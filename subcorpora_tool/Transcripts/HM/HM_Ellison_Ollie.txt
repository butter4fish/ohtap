Speaker 1: My name is Racine Tucker-Hamilton and I am the interviewer, and Rick Warwick is the videographer today, and [Rebecca] Weslie Ellison is observing.  Now if--and today's date is Monday, October 29, 2004, and this interview is taking place at WHUT-TV at--in Washington, D.C., Howard University.  Now if you would please, for the record, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], please tell us your full name including your middle name and spell it.
Speaker 2: My name is Ollie Benjamin Ellison, will have to say dash, Jefferson.  O-L-L-I-E, B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N, E-L-L-I-S-O-N, J-E-F-F-E-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, Mr. Ellison, now is your last name Jefferson?
Speaker 1: When I--this is a name I was born with.  My mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] unofficially changed my name after my father's [Ollie Jefferson] death and she had remarried, and so I've gone through much of life with my stepfather's name, but it--but it was never changed officially, and so I'm--I--I'm still just known by, by both names legally.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All righty.  Now would you please tell us the date and location of your birth?
Speaker 1: February 23, 1927, Muskogee, Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: And your occupation?
Speaker 1: Foreign Service--retired [U.S.] Foreign Service officer.
Story_ID: 261362
Speaker 1: Now the next couple of questions are just like some People magazine-ish type questions just to kinda help us get familiar with the process and to help us learn a little bit more about you as well.  Would you please share with us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Gumbo.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite time of year.
Speaker 2: Springtime.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color.
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: It's hard to say, perhaps Germany.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying, do you have one?
Speaker 2: One, one, one of my favorite ones I guess it would be a rough translation from a German phrase, he who doesn't have it in his--in his head must have it in his feet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know whether that's, that's too complicated or, or not, but it's the idea that you--that you must think through your, your problems or, or, or your--or your--the problem that, that you're facing with, so otherwise it saves a lot of time on your feet.
Story_ID: 261363
Speaker 1: Let's begin talking first about your mother.  Would you please start with your mother's name and where she was born and where she grew up as a child?
Speaker 2: My mother was born Gertrude Arsienne Barzart [Ellison].
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for us please?
Speaker 2: B-A-Z-A-R-T [sic.], and it's sometimes written as B-R-A-Z-A-R-T, and we were doing some research on it recently trying to find the rest of her family and found out that some of the family had dropped the T because in French it's, it's, it's not pronounced sorta thing, and so they just called Bazar [ph.] sorta thing, and so--but any rate, I found her relatives under all three names.  She was born in, in Echo, Louisiana.  She was the youngest child of a--of a--very much of a mixed couple.  Her father [Louis Berzat] was a mixed Indian [Native American], Indian black and I think some white.  Her mother [Helene Normand Berzat] was apparently genetically white but she became colored in order to stay out of jail.  And so she had a sizeable number of, of, of brothers who growing up became sort of a group unto themselves, and some would say even rambunctious group in that they defied the law, the Ku--the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and, and all others.  They had--became sort of a gang unto themselves.  And, and at, at one point when my mother was quite young, the oldest one, Joe [Bazart], was assassinated coming out of a--out of a bar one night, and so their mother decided to pack them all up and take them to Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Did she have family in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why did she decide to move (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When, when, when--because of, of, of the supposedly Indian--it was easy for people of Indian ancestry to get a stake in Oklahoma at, at that time.  This was pretty close to the--to the turn of the century.  And so her father died when she was two years old and she has no living memory of him.  But she had, of course, been heavily influenced by her at least part Indian brothers to the fact of being able to, to ride horses Indian style as, as they did.  So when they got to Oklahoma, she started school.  She started school in Oklahoma in--I think in Boynton [Oklahoma] as I recall.  She didn't speak English.  She spoke French and this Creole French, and so she had to learn English as a second language.  And we can credit to the fact that she overcompensated in learning English and so she learned to speak completely accent-less English, and so from this point, people tell me I don't have an Oklahoma accent when this is the reason why.
Story_ID: 261364
Speaker 1: Did she [Ellison's mother, Gertrude Barzart Ellison] ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember.  Much of this has been sort of things that have filtered down from, from some of her sisters at the time.  I remember of course one of her sisters complaining about the fact that--this is before moving to, to Oklahoma while their father [Louis Barzat] was still alive, apparently the fact that my father that, that my grandfather was not full-blooded Indian [Native American].  He had the privilege of, of buying alcohol so all his Indian buddies would chip in for him to go get the alcohol every, every Friday sorta thing.  And they would all gather in, in, in my grandmother's [Helene Normand Barzat] front yard there and, and of course imbibe until the wee hours of the morning.  And so this is one of the more celebrated cases that I remember from her early--and of course she was too young to, to remember this at that time.  But she--apparently, her mother died before she was grown there in Oklahoma and she went to live with an, an older sister, and I have no details as to what her life was like as a--as a teenager.  This older sister did manage to send her off to, to college, which is Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: This was in, in the early '20s [1920s] and we so happened to have her scrapbook from, from that period and so, so we have a lot more impressions as to what her life was there as a--as a--as a student at, at Wilberforce.  Now, her sister could only carry this for about two years, and so I guess our mother had to drop out after two years, but it was enough to--for her to qualify as a--as a teacher, and so she taught apparently school there in, in Muskogee, Oklahoma, until the time that I--she married my father [Ollie Jefferson].
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know?
Speaker 2: --not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were--my, my--like I said, my father's law practice was in Muskogee.  This is where he--go, go back.  My father opened up his law practice in--right after coming out of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and this was in about 1901 and 1902 sorta thing, so this is when he came to Oklahoma.  Now, he and--of course, my, my mother was his second marriage and, of course, they didn't get married until the '20s [1920s].  And so--in fact, I was just looking at her college scrapbook and, and I guess this has some of her post-college notes in it, and apparently she met my father some place during, during this era, and of course both of 'em had spent some time in Chicago [Illinois] during this period.  And, but again, I said, it's not clear where they--where they met.
Story_ID: 261365
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison]?
Speaker 2: She was a person of, for a while, of, of boundless optimism and, and, and ambition.  This college experience [at Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] as I could tell from some of her writing at this time, you know, really expanded her horizons, you know, and her expectations of the life that she could live.  And I think it, it didn't all pan out and I think she must've--she died in '56 [1956] and perhaps I, I think at, at least to some degree of disappointment, but I guess we--many of us can't live the lives that we perhaps dream of in, in college.  She was considered apparently a, a, a very beautiful woman.  And I--of course and I think of if, by today's vernacular--what's, what, what's the occasion that, that they use for, for second wives that are--
Speaker 1: Trophy wife?
Speaker 2: Trophy wife, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, she was very fair and straight hair, and, and, and all that sorta thing.  And--but, but of course my father [Ollie Jefferson] wasn't her original interest and she was apparently--thought she would've been engaged to another chap who became a prominent Chicago [Illinois] and--chap named Leonidas Berry.  He was a, a, a fairly prominent doctor there and, of course, he has his own book in which--in, in, in which he mentions her.  In fact, I think my niece cited--took a picture of that in the book and it's on that--it's on that CD in which--his book in which he mentions, he describes her in, in, in his book.  And, of course, he, he goes on to say that, you know, she married a--finally an Oklahoma lawyer.  And, and the fact that I--I'm one of her two children that got into the state department [U.S. Department of State]--
Story_ID: 261366
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your father starting with his name and where he was born and where he grew up as a child.
Speaker 2: My father was, of course, Ollie Benjamin Jefferson--Ollie Benjamin Jefferson, of course, he was my--I--I'm a junior in that case.  He was born in Arkansas City, Arkansas, about, about 1880, 1881.  His father [Andrew Jefferson, Sr.] who had been born a slave, of course, was freed I guess as, as a young child.  And it's--his father apparently was born in Alabama, but I had the impression at some time that he lived in Virginia.  But any rate, his father as a very young man, of course, apparently came to--up through the Washington [D.C.] area trying to find himself, came over to Chicago [Illinois], stayed in Chicago for a while, and then headed down the Mississippi River, and then he came to Arkansas City and apparently said, this is it.  This is where I'll, I'll stay.  And he ended up buying, buying and operating his own farm there, and he had--see--at least--at least six or seven children.  My father was the oldest son, but it so happened he had--his daughter, Maddie [ph.], was older than my father and she was the teacher at the one-room school that my, my father went to.  And apparently she put in a lot of work on him at the time.  And, of course, she obviously--the eighth grade was it, you know, for most of the South at that time, but--so she had no more than an eighth grade education herself.  But any rate, she, she apparently put a lot of in on him in which he acknowledges.  And so he, he disappointed his father greatly, but, but my father thought, you know, he at last had a son that could help him out, you know, with his expanding farm.  He, he was a truck farmer.  He built his own store there in Arkansas City which he sold his produce and vegetables, and he apparently even expanded to fishing the Mississippi and, and selling fish at his store.  And so his expectation was that my father would, would, would at last be of help to him, and my father ran away and--at fourteen years old, and came to Washington, D.C.  And, of course, by today's times, fourteen years old sounds awful early, but in those days, fourteen years old was the school leaver age and the country was awash, and fourteen-year-old boys who had been, either ran away or, or, or told to leave because there wasn't enough, you know, work or, or food in the house to, to, to feed them.  Any rate, as the story--as--I, I didn't hear this from him, but as, as--from, from other sources, he came to Washington and for, for the purpose of enrolling in the Howard prep school [The Howard Academy, Washington, D.C.], which is--I guess is one of the few in the country for, for, for blacks at that time.  And I guess his first weeks in Washington here, there, there were--according to description, the sidewalks on Georgia Avenue at that time were, were elevated wooden sidewalks, and they had straw underneath 'em.  So apparently that's where he lived--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --his first months here, you know, until he somehow got himself admitted into the Howard prep school, and he went on from there to [Howard] University [Washington, D.C.] and finally into the law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  He, he worked--he worked his way through the law school by being a dining car waiter between here and Boston [Massachusetts].  He would work the summers and then work the weekends on, on the road.  And, of course, when, when, when the meal was finished, the tables became his desk, you know, for much of the rest of, of the trip.  He would get out his work.  So he finished law school here in 1901 as, as, as I recall, apparently cum laude of, of his class.  And he decided he wanted to go to a place where--which, which would be "free."  And, of course, Oklahoma was Indian [Native American] territory at, at, at that time, so he decided to come to Oklahoma.  And he was part Indian ancestry and, and opened, opened up his law office in Muskogee, Oklahoma, at the time.
Story_ID: 261367
Speaker 1: And he [Ellison's father, Ollie Jefferson] was the first African American attorney in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Anecdotally, this is what I've heard.  I, I, I mean, I, I don't know whether anyone has the absolute record, but apparently this is what I've been hearing all my life, that he was the first African American lawyer to be licensed or, or, or whatever in, in Oklahoma, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did he ever share any stories with you about what it was like being a young attorney, African American attorney in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: No.  I--he didn't.  And, in fact, that was the, the benefit that I got from J. Franklin's book ['My Life and an Era: The Autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin,' ed. John Hope Franklin and John Whittington Franklin] in writing about his father [Buck Colbert Franklin] in that I, I--from that book, I learned about what it was--his life was like--it, it was--what life was there in, in frontier Oklahoma, and perhaps the certain kind, kind of things that my father did, and--
Speaker 1: What, what, what did you learn when you read [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's book?
Speaker 2: Well, when I said his, his father was apparently born here in Oklahoma and it was still very much a frontier, and, and, and, you know, the long distances he had to go by horseback to school, and, and even stories of him being attacked by wild animals, you know, going back and forth to school.  It was that kind of, of frontier.  And so apparently John Hope Franklin's father apparently got his law degree by, by--from some correspondence school [Sprague Correspondence School of Law] in, in, in [Detroit] Michigan, and so--and so he--and--
Speaker 1: And he and your father worked together?
Speaker 2: Well, apparently they, they opened up a law--a common law office in Eufaula, Oklahoma, and John Hope--and, and in, in Franklin's book, they do mention a long term famous resident of Eufaula, a Dr. Cooper, who was also a close friend of my father; I knew that.  And, and, and in my early days, we used to visit them quite often, and Dr. Cooper's wife, Aldene [ph.], was, was my godmother.  But, but I never heard much from him about--from him.  See, he died when I was ten years old.  But he did attempt to spend quality time with me, you know, by taking me on some of his weekend trips.  And, and I remember on, on Saturdays, he would take--he would--when his office was closed, he would do his, you know, some visits around.  And I think it's my first recall of some of his law duties as it were would be to go to the local jail and, and, and get apparently all the Indians [Native Americans] that had been picked up the previous night out of jail.  I mean, it was apparently an informal arrangement that the jailers had with, with my father sorta thing.  And then--and so I think I got sort of a negative view of the practice of law just, just by watching this.  If this is the law, then I'm not sure I, I'd be interested in it.  But any rate, but it was--but these chaps really would--and I would see them emerging from the jail, you know, very much hung-over, and my father would talk to each one of 'em, see if he had enough money to get home.  He would--he, he would give them money if they didn't have enough money to get home and, and, and see that they got on their way, and that was his first duty every, every Saturday morning.  And so he was--he had quite a, a reputation there in, in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  And then so I said I--and--although he died when I was ten years old and my mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] had remarried sorta thing.  But my teenage years, I was always reminded and as it were that I'm Lawyer Jefferson's son, you know, and they expected more of me.  And so it was--it, it, it was quite a, a legacy, if you will, to, to handle.
Story_ID: 261368
Speaker 1: Do you remember what impact your father's [Ollie Jefferson] death had on you as a small ten year-old boy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When, when--I, I mean, I guess I should go back there.  I mean, part of what my father did, I said he was very much a, a political figure and he became the chairman of the Negro Democratic Party in Oklahoma.  And in '32 [1932], he, he is given credit for having turned the black vote around in Oklahoma from Republican to Democrat.  He was very much a devotee to, to, to [President] Franklin [Delano] Roosevelt.  And one of my uncles who was--who, who--whom my father had earlier influenced to come to Washington [D.C.] here to go to school, but any rate he didn't follow up on it, but he was living here at the time.  And, of course, he told me the story that after the 1932 election, my father came here to Washington expecting the, the top patronage job at the time, which was deputy solicitor general, and apparently the job went to the editor of, of the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], whom I think was a chap named [Robert Lee] Vann at the time.  And so my father went back to Oklahoma according to this, my uncle, and, and, and swore that he was gonna go through this again and there'd be no one that would top him, beat him out of this job again.  And so he took on the 1936 election, you know, with a even greater Democratic vote from, from, from the blacks of Oklahoma for the '36 [1936] election.  But in early '37 [1937], he, he had a heart attack and died in, in April, and that was the end of, of that dream.  But, but, but I do remember 'cause, 'cause after he had gotten sick, I mean, he and my mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] had broken up some time before that, and my sister [Jane Ellison] and I were staying with him, but when he got sick, we, we moved to, to, to my mother at the time.  And so when he--when he died, we were staying with my mother there and, and, and the chap who, who became my stepfather [Coleman Ellison].
Speaker 1: Mr.--
Speaker 2: But, but, but it, it, it was, of course, a, a quite--I don't know, it's--I, I mean, when, when--up at this point when your father is your everything, you know, you, you, you do--it does come as quite a shock to, to, to learn that, you know, he's no longer there.  And it, it, it was a case that, that--of course, the grade school that I attended there in, in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] when--for the first five years, was, was Inman E. Page  grade school [Inman E. Page School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], and it was only a block from the black business district where, where my father had, had his office.  And in as much as--I guess going back a bit, my, my mother who had been a teacher and my father had forbidden her to teach, so she spent all that energy on, on, on me after that.  So I, I, I learned to read before, before entering kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Why did your father forbid her to teach?
Speaker 2: Well, I said, it's--it--it's the old--it's the old, old--
Speaker 1: So he didn't want her to work outside the home.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was the old pride, you know.  If, if your--if, if, if you worked, then it showed that, that you--that you couldn't take care of your family sorta thing, and it was the, the kind of pride that, you know, professionals had in, in, in that--in that era.  Right now, of course, it's just the opposite.  You have a professional husband; he kicks you out to (laughter), to go find work sorta thing, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, but it's, it's just the opposite then.
Story_ID: 261369
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], tell me, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing--I mean, you--I--
Speaker 1: Your earliest memory.  What's the--one of the first things that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: One thing I do remember fairly vaguely, going out and starting the family car, which it caused a--at, at about three years old or something like that, which caused quite some consternation, so I remember because it--the reaction that it, it caused, not so much I thought it anything unusual.  And, and I guess after that was losing this tip of my finger from, from someone cutting the, the--after someone was, was cutting our lawn sorta thing, and he was pulling the lawnmower behind and I sorta stuck my finger into the lawnmower, but that's--so it, it, it was somewhat traumatic memories.  There are other vague ones, you know--
Story_ID: 261370
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], tell me a little bit about, in terms of your father's [Ollie Jefferson] practice, some of the land issues that he dealt with and, and the Indians [Native Americans] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, when it--of, course this was--this was a good chunk before I was born as the case may be, but a, a brief history of the thing, you know, that when they started moving the Indians out of the eastern states, you know, the Trail of Tears and all of that, they were sent to Oklahoma.  And, of course, they were promised that, that, that this land was yours in, in perpetuity.  And, of course, perpetuity lasted about ten years in, in that no treaty as far as I am aware that ever made with the Indians was, was--ever lasted beyond the, the government official that, that signed the Treaty [of New Echota].  But, but in, in this case, of course, Oklahoma was given supposedly entirely to the Indians and then, then it was divided up for the--for the purposes of, of, of the run, about in 1899 in which they took half of the state away from the Indians and, and, and left them the western part, and they opened up the western part for, for settlement.  And, of course, Oklahoma is still--that's why Oklahoma is still called the Sooner State because, you know, there were people who broke the--broke the law and got--and got in--got onto the land sooner than the time that the--that the run took place.  But my, my father came there apparently after the division and Oklahoma was the capital of Indian territory.  And, I'm gonna try to condense this, but as a result of, of some crafty local politicians and, and some very well-motivated people in Washington [D.C.], they decided that the Indians should be given equal rights with all other Americans, that is to own their land individually.  Up at this point, the land was owned by tribes and, and so this passed.  And, and at this point, when the, the Indians wanted the right to own the land individually, all sorts of shenanigans began to take place.  Apparently some of the stories are--that, that I read in, in that at the same time, apparently oil was being discovered and some of the Indians were found incompetent to, to handle their, their land and guardians were, were appointed for them.  And these guardians of course became some of the, the--part of the wealthier classes of Oklahoma at the time.  And of course I, I think my father as well as [HistoryMaker John] Hope Franklin's father [Buck Colbert Franklin], of course, were involved in, you know, trying to help the Indians protect their, their rights during this period of time.  Also, this is when the, the ugly head of segregation arose in that they had decided--a number of the tribes had, had black--blacks as members of the tribe, you know, either people--or, you know, a mixed Indian black, but they were recognized, you know, by the tribes as, as being tribal members.  And so the laws were, were, were so manipulated in that Oklahoma apparently adopted the segregation laws of Louisiana at that time, and so only, only full-blooded Indians were recognized as Indians and, and, and they became white, and, and, and any mixed blood Indian became black.  And only the pure blood--pure-bred Indians were, were fully entitled to individual holdings of land.  And so that's how--I guess is the issue that--I mean, I, I learned this mainly from--wasn't from my father but from Hope Franklin's book ['My Life and an Era: The Autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin,' ed. John Hope Franklin and John Whittington Franklin] as well as--
Speaker 1: And so your father was involved--
Speaker 2: He--my, my father--
Speaker 1: --in terms of representing the rights of the Indian.
Speaker 2: --was, was, was trying to represent the rights of the Indians as I understand it.  And, and of course it was not a particularly successful effort, but he was still know up, up until the time of his death, you know, as the quote unquote Indian lawyer in that much of his clientele were--the, the Indians trusted him and recognized him as, as, as their lawyer.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], can you give us your siblings' names and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, I--I'm the oldest.  I, I gave you my birth date and I have one sister.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: I have one sister, Jane Carolyn Jefferson [Ellison].  She--hers was November 5, 1929, as I recall.  I think I might have it on, on-(simultaneous)

Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the community you grew up in as a boy.  Can you kinda describe it for us and just kinda give us an idea of what that community was like?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the street you grew up on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Um-hm.  Yeah, it was in a mostly--I mean, there were several addresses that I had coming up, but the one that's--that was for the longest time was 1420 East 8th Street [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].  Of course, this is the, the home of--that my--of my stepfather [Coleman Ellison].  But there were at least two others that I had lived in with, with my father [Ollie Jefferson] and, and mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] there.  I don't remember their addresses, but it, it was a fairly, as I recall, comfortable by standards then of a community.
Speaker 1: Was there like a corner store and that kinda thing?
Speaker 2: There were corner stores, but, but, but the--but there were beginning to emerge, you know, what was then--of course it'd be supermarkets.  They don't compare to supermarkets today, but, you know, but that was the majority of, of corner stores.  And I, I also remember specifically--of course, during the days of the [Great] Depression, the early '30s [1930s] that, of course, my father was in effect a, a, a country lawyer and so he, he apparently now and then took his payment in produce, you know, so my, my--our basement--my--with my mother being a--basically a farm girl, she knew how to can food and so every, every year, she spent a considerable amount of time either canning some of the produce that my father was given as payment or, or buying, you know, the fruit and produce on her own and canning it.  Canned food was, was still in its infancy then, you know.  It wasn't particularly delectable.  And so--and so it basically was full of canned food and, of course, had--I remember, you know, hams and--you know, smokehouse hams and, and slabs of bacon, you know--you know, hanging from the ceiling in, in, in our--in our basement sorta thing.  And I, I even had the nerve--I, I remember I even had the nerve to complain, you know, why can't we have store-bought bacon, you know (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know?  And now--you know, of course that's a luxury today.  That's--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, so, so I said, it was--it was fairly comfortable and, and, I said by standards then, my father, my family were considered, you know, quite well off.
Story_ID: 261373
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: When--number one, of course, my father [Ollie Jefferson] came to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] from Muskogee [Oklahoma] because of the oil boom.  Oil, oil had been discovered in, in the Oklahoma City area and so he moved there in the very late '20s [1920s] from Muskogee.  I'm guessing he was shifting over from becoming a--you know, an Indian [Native American] lawyer to, to more of the, you know, claims and, and representing people in general, and--of course, and so the oil business represented a, a, a new--a new, new source of, of, of breaking income for him.  But, so, so one of the sounds I remember most specifically there was, at one point actually an oil well being drilled across the street from the house I lived in at the time sorta thing, and it's an overwhelming noise, but you get used to it.  And I remember when, when, when the drilling would stop in the middle of the night, you know, to--you know, to, to, to change the pipes or something like that, everyone would wake up all of a sudden because the noise had stopped.
Speaker 1: It was too quiet, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It was too quiet to be--so that's one of the--
Speaker 1: And what sights and smells? (Pause) Any, like, cooking type smells?
Speaker 2: When--my father was apparently--was a, a, a pretty well dedicated cook, and I guess he had learned to--when he was working on the road to, to, to Boston [Massachusetts], he had taken a taste for New England cooking, and so every Saturday night, of course, was the time that he did his, his backup reading, he would put on a, a pot of Boston baked beans.  And so I remember, of course, always Saturday night was the, the time for, for the beans to be baked.  And of course my mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] always made yeast rolls, sorta thing for, for the weekend, and so there was always those two smells in the house for, for, for Saturday night sorta thing, and so--
Speaker 1: And what sights remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oklahoma is a pretty dull place as far as topography is concerned.  You know, there are no--it's mainly rolling plains and just a few hills, and not particularly differentiated, so it's a--I, I--you know, I, I--one, I do remember--I remember from some time in the '30s [1930s] the, the, the drought that occurred there in, in Oklahoma that drove so many Oklahomans to, to California.  And the--Oklahoma has characteristically a lot of red clay soil, and so I can--I remember, of course, for days on end, that's all you could see.  You could hardly see the sun except for, you know, this red dust in the sky.  And so I remember even up to the days that I went off to college [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri], so many of the sheets in the house that had been hung out to dry on, on lines during this period, you know, they were still staying red from this--from, from this--the drought and, and the wind that had occurred in, in this period.

Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  The first one was the Inman E. Page School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], and this is where I went before my father [Ollie Jefferson] died.  Of course, this was the school that was near my father's office, and then I changed, I guess it was the fifth grade to, to Dunbar School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].  This was the, the other grade school there in time.
Speaker 1: And do you remember some of your teachers there?  Did any of them have a particular influence on you?
Speaker 2: There was a Mrs. Liday [ph.] and a Mrs. MacFarland [ph.], I remember those, and, and, and a Mrs. Joseph.  Those were, I think, the teachers that I remember most specifically [ph.].
Speaker 1: What type of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: In elementary school, I was, as I said, having had this, this head start from my--from my mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison], I was--I, I was a very good student.  In fact--in fact, it spoiled me, sorta thing, you know, to, to the effect that, you know, I could get through without doing, doing much of any work, I mean, since I, I started so much ahead of, of, of the rest of the students.  And so at that point in time, it, it, it was easy.  Of course, it got more difficult in, in junior high school and in high school [Douglass High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: And during the elementary time period, what type of child were you?  Were you curious?  Were you mischievous?  What type of child were you?  Were you obedient or how would you describe yourself as a child during that time period?
Speaker 2: Pretty much obedient.  I, I, I did a whole lot of, of reading on, on, on my own.  And of course, one thing that did happen, I guess some--fairly early in grade school, a teacher who was--who was teaching us to write, found that left-hand writing was, was not acceptable.  I was--I had born left-handed, and so she made me change over to right-handed writing.  And that resulted--I, I--we, we didn't make the connection at the time, but that resulted in, in my developing a horrible stutter, of course, we--I guess what they call mixed cerebral dominance.  And so that had pretty much of an effect on a whole--a whole lot of my so-called social life from grade school to--
Speaker 1: So were you--
Speaker 2: --to, to high school.
Speaker 1: --kinda quiet--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was--
Speaker 1: --because of that?
Speaker 2: --generally quiet, and, and, and pretty much of a loner.  And, and so--and, and, and in fact it, it sort of affected the whole rest of my life.  I've been much more of a loner even in very much of social situations ever, ever since because it's, it's, it's the pattern that I had developed.  And I think partly because I stuttered, I finally overcame most effects of, of the stuttering, but through grade school, high school especially--in, in high School, it was absolutely horrible, you know, you know.  You know, I couldn't speak to girls even.  This was when, when you--I did the worst sorta thing, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 261375
Speaker 1: Back to elementary school, did you have dreams and aspirations at that time in your life?  Like, what did you wanna be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I can make it specific.  I did do a lot of reading very early even, even about World War I [WWI] at, at the time.
Speaker 1: So did you--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: --but--and it's, it's fine if you at that time didn't think--
Speaker 2: So, so, so, you know, I--so I had begun to develop a, a, a worldly view and I read a lot of, you know, history, especially the early history of, of Egypt and so I think I had set the pattern for, for, for something in the international sphere, but I think also you, you must I, I think that--I think as going into the teen years, that so far as college graduates during that period, there were basically four options: lawyer, doctor, teacher, Pullman porter.  This, this was the old, you know, segregated era sorta thing, and so a good chunk of, you know, people went off to college, you know, they end up becoming Pullman porters.  And, and, and so it was--and, and, and so, I, I did develop a knack, a, a lot more, more knack of reading into science and so I think by the time I got ready to go to college, I had decided at that point, pre-med or becoming a doctor was what I wanted.
Story_ID: 261376
Speaker 1: During the pre-teen, early teen years, what type of young man were you starting to become?
Speaker 2: One--again, I, I, I think I said, I mean, I wasn't--and it's in part because of, of the stuttering, you know, I wasn't--I never became, you know, part of, of, of a gang or a group.  I had a few friends, but, you know, they were--I, I, I didn't do much hanging out as, as the case may be.  I, I did a--I said, much of my time, that spare time, I did just a heck of a lot of, of reading.  So, I, I, I think it's a story I tell--there was a, a branch library near my residence at the time, and in one stretch, I, I went through their entire range of children's books in this library and the, the one thing that I hadn't read, it was a children's cookbook, and so I checked that out and, and took it home, and with my mother's [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] consent, I, I began--I, I, I cooked each item in the--in the cookbook.  And so--
Speaker 1: You made each item in the--(laughter).
Speaker 2: I made each item in the cookbook, one after the, the other, sorta thing.  So--and then 'cause I, I, I read practically all of the, you know, great children's classics, you know, King Arthur, 'Heidi' [Johanna Spyri], 'The Iliad' [Homer] and 'The Odyssey' [Homer].  And so I--
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite book as a child?
Speaker 2: Probably King Arthur.  I--maybe followed by the fall of Troy.  You know, I, I, I really got so far into these books that I, you know, I read them almost endlessly and then sorta dreamed myself in, in--into the characters at, at, at night sorta thing, and so I, I--
Speaker 1: Were you still a very good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was beginning to, to fall behind in math, which had been a problem all, all of life but the social studies, geography, reading, I did quite well and, and science that--which was--certainly by junior high school, I developed an increasing interest in, in the--in the natural sciences sorta thing, and this is what led to my eventual decision that perhaps--I mean, I wanted to be a, a pure scientist, you know, a chemist or biologist sorta thing.  And, and so, again, you know, the, the, the, the career fields for that--for blacks at that time, you know, weren't promising, and so that's why I, I finally focused on, on, on medicine.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in church?
Speaker 2: My mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison]--my, my, my father [Ollie Jefferson] was something between an agnostic and, and atheist--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and didn't attend church.  My mother was an Episcopalian and I remember going to--starting out, you know, as, as an altar boy somewhere around five years old, and I think for every Sunday that I wasn't in camp, I was an altar boy there in the church until I went away to college [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri], and so I was raised, if you will, a very staunch Episcopalian.  And it was only in later life in, in, in my college years when I attempted to follow that.  I became aware of something of a truism about Episcopalians.  And, and it hadn't occurred to me at the time that this little tiny black church that I attended at the time, practically everybody was, was either related or, or, or close friends sorta thing, and they liked it that way.  And, and so going away, going to college and dropping in on, on local Episcopal churches, you know, you were suddenly the stranger, you know, and so a question--you know, what does he want here?  You know, that sorta thing, and so I drifted away from the church, especially of course the couple times I spent in the [U.S.] Army sorta thing.
Story_ID: 261378
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Douglass High School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in high school?  I know you said you were still somewhat shy and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --introverted, but what were some of your favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 2: I--again, history, geography, the sciences.  In senior high school, I even began to, to, to take an interest in, in, in English literature.  I, I, I wasn't at--I had no--although I wanted to very much, but I realized I had no gift for football.  I was just too uncoordinated, too, too, too lightweight and so forth, although I did try.  My first freshman year in college [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] was the--was the first year World War--in, in, World War II [WWII] in which there were practically no men on campus, and so they accepted anyone who had the nerve--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --to come out, but, other than that, that was the end of my football.  But, I, I--
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any organizations or clubs in high school?
Speaker 2: Only the, the circle of High-Y, which is sort of a, a equivalent of a--of a high school fraternity as, as the case may be.  I think it was a--was, was--is a-an offshoot of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]; we called it the High-Y there, but, that's about the only one.  Now, of course--and of course in my high school, most of my--all my high school years, because this is after my father [Ollie Jefferson] died, my economic situation changed rather sizably, and so for much of high school, I, I worked after school.
Speaker 1: Where did you work?
Speaker 2: The first one was delivering for a, a, a hot dog and barbecue place that was--that was right off of the campus of the--of the--of the, the high school--of the high school area there sorta thing, so, you know--so I worked from right after school to about eleven o'clock at night, delivering hot dogs, barbecue, and sandwiches, and so forth for, for fifty cents a night and a sandwich.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And I--and, and I guess I progressed up to being a delivery boy at a drug store and finally got up to ten dollars a week.
Story_ID: 261379
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Douglass High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], what were some of your thoughts about college?  Did you think you were going to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I, I--there was never any doubt that I was going to college even though during that--during this period, the, the early '40s [1940s], you know, there was still--most students weren't thinking in terms of, of college, but, of course, I guess having parents that had gone to college, even my father [Ollie Jefferson] was dead and so forth, but still, it, it was no doubt that, that I, I wanted to and was expected to go to college.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-four [1944].
Speaker 1: And were you thinking you were still going to pursue something in the science field--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --when you went to college?  And what were you thinking you wanted to do?  Did you still want to be some type of scientist?
Speaker 2: When, when--at this point, it had begin--it begun to focus on, on, on medical school.  And, of course, there's quite a bit of a story there, also in effect that I had begun to focus all of my attention on my science courses and I didn't think anything else mattered much.  And so I got good grades in my science courses and I slipped up and got a, a, a D in, in second semester freshman composition.  And several years later, even though--which was of course into the later '40s [1940s] even though I had done well with science course--all my science courses, grade record, and medical aptitude, both Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] here had turned me down for the medical school specifically because of this D in freshman composition.  And, and--of course, this is one of the, the ironies of, of, of my life, and of course I was devastated then, but I'm, I'm--at this point, I'm glad they did because it--because my, my real interest would've been foreign affairs.  And so--and so I, I got into foreign--finally got into foreign service, and what was the main requirement I had to fulfill was being able to write sorta thing (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 261380
Speaker 1: Where did you decide to go to college?
Speaker 2: I went to Lincoln University in [Jefferson City] Missouri.
Speaker 1: How did you make--
Speaker 2: Jefferson City [Missouri].
Speaker 1: How did you make that decision?  Why did you decide to go to Lincoln?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I remember completely why.  Of course, at, at--still at this period, these college systems were, were still largely segregated, and there is a--there was a, a black college in Oklahoma called Langston [University, Langston, Oklahoma], and, and somehow I, I just didn't care for it.  I, I--and Lincoln in Missouri had sounded--I don't know whether there was a recommendation of friends or a reputation or, or what at the time, but I, I ended up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --going there.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at Lincoln?  Were you still somewhat shy and introverted or were you starting to come out of your shell a little bit?
Speaker 2: I was still a, a, a--somewhat of a shy loner.  I, I had--as I mentioned, I, I had gone out for football my, my, my first freshman semester there and finally they knocked some sense in my head literally--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --sorta thing, and so I withdrew from that, and I concentrated more on my work.  And I, I, I guess--I guess I pledged to a fraternity at the time.
Speaker 1: What fraternity?
Speaker 2: Kappa Alpha Psi [Fraternity], sorta thing, and so--
Speaker 1: So wait a second, you were a shy Kappa?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Is that--that's kind of an oxymoron, isn't it?
Speaker 2: I, I, I know.  Everyone said, I should--I, I was supposed to have been an APA [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], but (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, you know, Kappa's are hell-raisers and, and--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and all of that, but, but I, I, I think it was my high school High-Y counselor, you know, who--whom, whom everyone in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] at the time said, said, you know, he had the unfair advantage of influencing our decisions towards--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --for subsequent fraternities, sorta thing, so--but any rate, so--
Speaker 1: Um--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, I gather the reputation still, still goes on generation after generation.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So when you were at Lincoln, what were you thinking?  So at this point, you're still thinking you're gonna go on to medical school and become a doctor.  And what was happening with your thoughts and your dreams of, you know, traveling the world and working in some type of international field?  Were those still in the back of your mind somewhere?
Speaker 2: They were still in the back of my mind.  I, I did have--although I majored in the sciences, I still had a, a--had a strong minor in the--in the political sciences--in the political sciences.  And, in fact, one of the more useful courses that I took there at the time was a, a course in, in, in argumentation and debate.  And it's--it gave me pretty much of a good background for much of what I, I could build upon it later in that--for the work I eventually got into, in that I think Professor Miller [ph.], as I recall it, his name was, the teacher.  He, you know, taught, you know, never go into a debate without knowing your opponent's case better than he does.  And so that made me, of course, has helped me all the rest of, of my life and working with people and so called diplomatic area sorta thing that, you know, you--diplomacy is supposed to be in part--you know, it--it's, it's conflict resolution of some type or the other and you interact with fellow diplomats and politicians of other countries sorta thing, you know, trying to get your view across sorta thing.  And so it's pointless just going in shouting, you know, what, what you think sorta thing.  And so I always made a case, you know, that when I'm given a problem to handle, you know, learn the opposing view to, to the nth degree and then you have a basis for discussing the problem, you know, with your interlocutor, you know, and, and sometimes reaching an agreeable conclusion, which in my view, of course, is the, the essence of, of diplomacy, so I'm--always have gratitude for, for Professor Miller for, for teaching me this--the, the skill.
Story_ID: 261381
Speaker 1: As a young man, who were you being influenced by?  Who were you most influenced by as a young man?  Even like senior year of high school [Douglass High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] and the--during the college [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] years, who were you being influenced by?
Speaker 2: In part, I guess early on, of course, my, my, my scout master.  We had a very good, strong scout master and I was a very avid scout from the time I was twelve years old 'til, 'til again 'til the time I, I left for college.  The, the, the teacher is a social studies teacher who ran the High-Y sorta thing and so he was sorta the, the unofficial guidance counselor for, for boys, as the case may be.  And but, but, still I think as I recall earlier 'cause I had constant reminders, you know, sometimes very subtle, lawyer [Ollie] Jefferson's son, so that was also in the background.  I mean, he wasn't--he wasn't apparently the nicest man around but I guess, his, his--he had a great reputation there sorta thing, and so I think I was expected to be even--perhaps even morally or ethically better than--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --than, than he was.
Story_ID: 261382
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you told us--
Speaker 2: And I, I think I might have to, to, to intervene here that--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --of course that in, in '46 [1946], I, I, I got drafted [for U.S. military service]--
Speaker 1: While you were at Lincoln.
Speaker 2: --while I was at Lincoln.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, it was toward the end of my--of, of my, my sophomore year, and so I was away for about a year and a half at the time, and so of, of--so of course this was after the fighting stopped in, in World War II [WWII].  But--so, but anyway, I'm--I still get credit for being a World War II veteran.
Speaker 1: And where were you--what base were stationed at when you were drafted?  Where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Well, I had basic training at, at Fort McClellan, [Anniston] Alabama, and that's where I spent I guess the--more time than any place else, and, and--
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in the South?  I mean, were they much different than what you had experienced before in the Midwest?
Speaker 2: Not that much different.  We, we, we didn't--we didn't get off of base, you know, that, that much sorta thing, you know.  I mean, I, I, I can't recall, you know, whether we got out a couple a Sundays or not.  You know, supposedly you were usually so beat up by--this is basic training sorta thing, that, that you just wanted to crawl in some hole and, and, and die for the weekend.  But, but at any rate, but it was quite grueling.  It was very different in, in that, although I'd had two years of college.  But the, the--my training platoon was, was, was composed of--a good chunk of it was, was, was a New York [New York] street gang pretty much on, on the lamb sorta thing--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and so it was an immediate clash of, of culture sorta thing.  And of course in, in, in their view, anyone who went to college had to be queer and (laughter), and so it was a constant incipient battle of wills--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --the, the whole time.  So I had to, to learn language my mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] would never have approved of, you know, to, to, to--
Speaker 1: Just to survive, huh?
Speaker 2: --to, to, to survive, sorta thing.
Story_ID: 261383
Speaker 1: Did you spend that entire year in [Fort McClellan, Anniston] Alabama?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  We--after basic training, I was sent to a, a, a, I'm going to say transient camp from near San Francisco [California] and we were sent to, to Korea at the time.  The, the--I mean, the whole--of course, it was still the days of the segregated [U.S.] Army and so believe it or not, we had a whole ship, it was the, the old freighter ship conversion just full of--with, with, with black troops only at the time.
Speaker 1: And was that exciting for you in the sense that here you were being able to, to travel to, you know, perhaps a place that you had read about as a boy?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it, it was different, and certainly it added to my experience, worldly experience.  And, of course, frankly when I was told--when I read, I was told I was going to Korea, and I didn't even know where Korea was.  I had, had to go to a map to find out where the blazes it was, and became part of, of an interesting little experiment there in the process.  As I said, it was a whole freighter full of at least--at least from five to seven hundred black troops that, that were on there.  And they had decided that all of those of us who had had some college or, or, or had been--or had been athletes, they pulled us all out to, to form an--a little elite military police unit.  And we--and so they--we trained as a military police unit and we were sent to--and we were supposed to have a, a military patrol outfit in which, you know, you, you would do the street policing there in Incheon [South Korea].  And, and suddenly someone changed the orders.  The, the--apparently, they didn't--they didn't feel that segregation--that, that the social order permitted this, this much at this time, and so--and so we were pulled off of that and we went--and so we were detailed to, to guard the, the docks there at, at Incheon, which was a cold, grueling job.  I, I mean, it was within the realm of military police work and it did have a, a quartermaster unit there doing the job, but the Koreans--of course, this is in tail end of war and, of course, it was, you know, a pretty desperate situation so, in effect that they were stealing us blind there at the docks, and so they decided when this other superior people would be better fitted for, for, for guarding the docks, and we did have a few people who, who didn't mind shooting.  But, so, so--but any rate, but it, it was a change for me in that they--someone found that I had had some typing, and so I was pulled into the next headquarters just to--just to do, you know, do some typing of reports, and pretty soon I became the, the--a recorder for the board of officers, you know, for all occasions there.  And, and, you know, then I was helping out the, the captain that did the investigations for incidents that required a board of officers, and then finally I was doing the investigations myself sorta thing, and so it was an enlightening experience for me.  Some of it wasn't all happy in that--I mean, in this--in the black experience sorta thing because part of the job--the instructions we had--the, the Army came down with was that they had to separate--this is just after World War II [WWII], and they had to separate out, of course, illiterate NCOs [non-commissioned officers], and a good chunk of these were, were, were black sergeants and so forth who, who, who had gotten some rank, you know, because apparently they had some organizations skills and, and they could beat the hell out of anyone else who, who, who would oppose them sorta thing.  And so this was a skill that was useful perhaps in the wartime era, but they found out that it was definitely a drag in the peacetime Army.  So I ended up being unofficially given the job, you know, of interviewing a lot of these chaps, you know, to, to determine whether they were smart enough to stay in, in the army.  And it, it was a, a, a sad experience--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --you know, because knowing that the conclusions that I reached, you know, would have far reaching conclusions for them because my signature wasn't on it, it was the--it was the captain who was my boss who signed these things.  But he found out that I could do it and he was too busy to do it sorta thing, and so it was a, a memorable part of, of my time over there.
Story_ID: 261384
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit.  Well actually, we'll go up.  So once you graduate from Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] in 1949 and you don't get accepted into medical school at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], what are you thinking you're gonna do with your life at this point?
Speaker 2: When--I decided to try for a related field, clinical psychology, and so I was admitted into Indiana University Graduate School [The University Graduate School, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 1: And this is in 1949?
Speaker 2: This is forty--yeah, '49 [1949] to the--to graduate school at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  And, again, this international thing was still in the back of my mind, and so I took clinical ec- clinical psychology, and experimental psychology courses, but I did other courses in, in Soviet era courses.  I took Soviet geography, Soviet politics, and I, I even took up some courses in Russian.  And these in effect saved my life, in effect later on because I'd also, although I was on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] at this time, I decided they--of course, this was not very much money to live on, so I was eligible for the advanced ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] there at Indiana, so I got in the advanced ROTC at the time, and of course you could get a little monthly stipend for that.  And so, so by the time the two--the, the two years were up, I was in a four-year program there at Indiana, supposedly has no master's degree, you have to go for full doctorate there in clinical psychology.  But when two years was up, of course, we were in the middle of the Korean War, and so I--so, I was newly commissioned, second lieutenant at the time, and so I was called back into the [U.S.] Army for the Korean War, spent time at Fort Benning [Georgia], went to Fort Ord, California, which was the combat replacement training center for Korea at the time, and the idea was that we would train one cycle of troops and then you would go over with the cycle of the guys that, that you had--that you trained or had trained.  Midway through the cycle, someone apparently had, had, had read my record of qualifications, so I was yanked out of this program and sent to the intelligence school, which you see a picture of there at Fort Riley, California [sic. Kansas], and so I qualified as intelligence officer.  But any rate, I ended up instead of going to Korea as a--as a--as a combat second lieutenant and perhaps expiring or getting badly hurt in the process, I ended up being sent to Berlin [West Germany; Berlin, Germany] as an intelligence officer.  I think some of the pictures that you saw were, were, were from Berlin.
Story_ID: 261385
Speaker 1: There was another, if you will, racial experience.  This was a period when--
Speaker 2: This is 1951?
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '51 [1951].  And the--this was shortly after the, the, the order had come down to integrate the [U.S.] Army, and the Army had done, you know, pretty--it had advanced pretty well for the--for, for the enlisted men.  But up until that point of time, black officers were only used in, in all black units.  And so there were at this point--there'd be no more all black units, and so there was a problem as to what--a touchy thing of beginning to assign black officers.  And so I, I--anecdotally, I was perhaps the first black officer that was sent to Berlin [West Germany; Berlin, Germany] as a--on, on a unit assignment.  And, and again, the racial angle pops up in that the intelligence unit I was designated for, they, they, they broke the assignment, I think on, on a real base, base feeling I guess.  At this point in time, you know, a black intelligence officer is an oxymoron, but, but they--I--they later excused it in the fact that, that, that the unit I was sent to was a, a very close unit and, and that I wouldn't fit into the, the unit.  And so I was sent to the infantry regiment.  Again, the--and so, so, so I was apparently the--although the picture you see, there are a couple more black officers on it, but they arrived at a later period.  I think I was the first black officer sent to this regiment, and my reception was, was very much mixed.  The first assignment was, was for, for a platoon that I got.  I got a, a platoon sergeant who was a, a, a magnificent soldier out of Tennessee who I, I even say today was one of the best soldiers.  I mean, I've, I've stayed--I've been in the Army twice and I've been a, a reserve officer.  He's one of the best soldiers I ever met in my life, but he couldn't abide the fact of having a black officer over him, you know, and I think he really tried (laughter), you know, to adjust to me and he, he just couldn't do it.  You know, he treated the black enlisted men fairly well, but, with, with, with me, it, it was obviously a psychological problem for him.  And, of course, I had my own problems too.  You know, I found out, you know, I had no rhythm (laughter).  I, I couldn't even call cadence, you know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --the syncopated cadence, you know (laughter), and so the troops were laughing at me as I was trying to march 'em around the parade ground.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But, but any rate--but I was transferred out of that job into the--into the recoilless rifle platoon where we didn't have to march and, and, and we had a, a, a Jewish platoon sergeant, and we got along fabulously.  But any rate, it, it had an effect on my, rest of my life at the time in that if I had gone into the intelligence unit, my afterhours association would've been strictly limited.  By going into the, the regular infantry unit, my life was my own after hours and I took complete advantage of it.  I, I, I circulated around--all over Berlin in my pink and green uniform.  And wherever--without, without fail, wherever I stopped for a beer or a meal, I was very quickly joined by some Germans who wanted to talk to me.  And, and of course this was immediately, you know, after the fall of Nazi Germany, you know, plus the fact that Berlin was a city that we had bombed the hell out of just a, a few years previously.  But I found them to be overwhelmingly friendly and--
Speaker 2: And, and you felt safe just kinda going about on your own?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.  And so I developed a, a fair circle of friends there and I learned a hell of a lot, you know, I mean, just sort of cabbage and kings conversation with 'em sorta thing, you know.  And it, it actually changed me I, I think, I mean of self-confidence, you know.  I can get out among these people and talk to them and interact with them because--and, of course, my--most of my fellow Americans that were both enlisted and officers, we pretty much hung out at certain places sorta thing and, and I, I think I was the only one at that time who did a lot of roaming.
Story_ID: 261386
Speaker 1: Plus, at one point, I was sent as an exchange to the--to the French regiment for a month, and so the officer that I was--who was assigned as my guide, if you will, is, is a better term, we became good friends.  And so I had the--so we, we, we did, you know, a lot of traveling and hanging out together, and so--and of course I introduced him into my circle of German friends and sorta thing.  But any rate, I had this French officer at our--at our regimental club [in Berlin, West Germany; Berlin Germany] one afternoon and, and her--I mean, I didn't think my fellow officers took any attention whatsoever to what I was doing.  But we were sitting there having a drink at, at one of the smaller tables there and I heard this loud voice who's--who, who--whom I recognize even to this day.  He shouted--he shouted out, "What do you think of an American officer who spends all of this times with krauts and frogs?"  But, you know, that was in effect what I was doing.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and, and, again, a--he--
Speaker 2: Who was--who--whose voice was that?
Speaker 1: Well, it, it, it was one of my fellow officers from, from the--from the--from the battalion that I was in at the time.  I, I, I--at this point, I don't--as it was fifty years ago, I don't remember his name, but, but I, I, I know his face and his voice, and there was a real silence and, and, and I, I didn't react.  And my--and the, the, the French officer didn't react either.  We continued to drink as if we--it had never happened, and pretty soon the, the ambience returned, and it was forgotten.  But--
Speaker 2: So were you starting to develop a, a reputation on, on base or on post--what was your reputation on post?  Was it that you were this very, you know, like worldly person who, you know, wanted to find out about these other people and other cultures or how was it received on base?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure it got to that point.  They, they--I think they recognized me as different.  But other than that, I'm not quite sure how far they were taking it.  As, as, as I said, there were very few of the American officers who were downright friendly with me.  There were a couple of West Pointers [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] who, who, who made it their business, you know, to, to be friendly, you know, and to spend quality time with me, you know, to--sorta thing, you know.  So I, I went out, you know, Saturday afternoons, you know, you know, with them drinking or whatever sorta thing, but, but that was about the extent of it.  But I wasn't really welcomed by the best.  And of course I--and I, I admit, you know, my, my skills as a platoon leader were, were not--were not the finest to be sure, sorta thing.  And so, I mean--I mean, I didn't have the--I mean I, I once thought of that, you know, I might try for the regular [U.S.] Army and I very quickly found out I didn't belong in the--I mean, I had a knack for, for, for military life, but if I had that, you know, I better find a different day job.  And so I--so I did spend a--you know, a lifetime as a reserve officer. But, I dropped the idea completely of trying to join the, the regular Army. Now what did happen during this period is that the, the Berlin commander every so--every two months, he would sponsor what is in effect a cocktail party for, for, for all officers, you know, and civilians who were of officer level.  And so on one of these occasions, there were two [U.S.] Foreign Service officers who, who also attended.  They were from the Berlin mission there at the time.
Story_ID: 261387
Speaker 1: You're at this reception and you meet two [U.S.] Foreign Service officers.  What happened next?
Speaker 2: When--the, the thing I perhaps--I, I think I might've mentioned before that the image of the Foreign Service was, was the--was the--a, a--strictly belonged to people from the great universities of, of the east sorta thing, generally, generally whites sorta thing, and no one else had much of a chance, you know.  And, and so this has been in, in the back of my mind for some time; this is what I wanted.  But any rate--
Speaker 1: But were you thinking, like, Foreign Service would be an opportunity for you to do all the things that you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When, when I said, it, it, it sort of jelled at, at this point.  It had sorta been in the back of my mind as a general thing.  But any rate, I, I had a long conversation with these two chaps that evening, and going home that evening, I remember saying to myself, they were good but they were not that good.
Speaker 1: In terms of convincing you?
Speaker 2: I mean--I mean in terms of, you know, their abilities and, you know, instead of being ten feet tall, they were only about 6'5".
Speaker 1: So in other words, you really weren't that impressed.
Speaker 2: Well, well I was impressed, you know, but still, I, I wasn't given the impression, you know, that they were something way beyond me, you know, to--that, that, that I couldn't work for.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so it was at that point that I decided when, you know, I'm gonna have to give this Foreign Service thing a, a try, you know.  Because I said, I, I, I wanted--I knew I wanted something in the international area, and I said--if, if I--I concluded the, the [U.S.] Army was out.  I mean, there are, of course, civilian jobs in the defense department [U.S. Department of Defense] and some others, you know, that I might have taken a shot at, but I said I'm gonna have to go for this Foreign Service thing.
Speaker 1: And what year was this when you decided to join--
Speaker 2: This was--
Speaker 1: --the Foreign Service?
Speaker 2: --was '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: And what was the process of joining--to join the Foreign Service?
Speaker 2: When I got out of the Army in, let's see, it was '53 [1953], and I got discharged in Oklahoma and, and, of course, I had--my sister [Jane Ellison] was living in Chicago [Illinois] at the time.  She had become a medical technician there.  And so I had--so I came to Chicago and I think I settled in my mind, I'm gonna have to try to get into the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] which has a good international relations program.  But as it was, the, the grades that I'd had in undergrad school [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] wouldn't quite justify.  But any rate, so I worked I guess some seven or eight months for the Chicago Transit Authority [CTA] of the street car and bus driver and got fired from that from having, having three accidents of, of any kind within a certain period.  And then I took an exam--in the meantime, took an exam as, as a social worker for the Cook County [Illinois], and while waiting for that, I even worked as, as, as a gardener and chauffer.  And so--
Speaker 1: And what--this was 1952?
Speaker 2: No, this was--would've been '53 [1953], '54 [1954]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in that era.  And so I--so, so I worked for a period as a social worker at the Cook County welfare department.  And, and meanwhile, I started going to the--going to the classes at the University of Chicago downtown school area at the time, and apparently I, I made a fair impression on the--on the director of the school and he wrote me a strong recommendation to, to get me admitted into, into the campus--the University of Chicago campus itself.  And this would've been '55 [1955], '56 [1956], and so I think the University of Chicago for the first time, I became a, a real student.  It's quite a different atmosphere altogether from a small black college [HBCU] or the Big 10 university sorta thing.  And so I became--I became a, a very good student there at the time.  And, and, I said, at that time, I guess at the end of '56 [1956], I think I took the Foreign Service exam and I passed the exam and came to the Foreign Service.
Story_ID: 261388
Speaker 1: I hear that the exam [officer test for the U.S. Foreign Service] is somewhat difficult.  Was it difficult for you?  And that sometimes that was a barrier for African Americans--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it--
Speaker 1: --because it was--the level of difficulty.
Speaker 2: When it--when it, it, it has been a, a real barrier for African Americans and, and I did do quite a bit of--you know, after getting some idea of what it was composed of, I, I did do quite a bit of concentrated reading and study before going into the exam, but I--but I think I was still perhaps mainly held by, of course, a, a good lifetime of doing a lot of reading, so I--so I can thank my mother [Gertrude Barzart Ellison] for, for that.  But I did pass the exam and I guess meanwhile there in--at [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], I said I, I should've had a, a master's [degree] in, in that time, but I, I took the written exam for a master's, and to my surprise, I had passed it on, on the doctorate level.  And so I was encouraged, you know, just go straight out for the doctorate.  This was before I had gotten the news.  When, when I knew I had passed the exam, I knew that they were--and, and of course it's a long process, so you gotta do the written and then there's a, a physical exam, security exam, and there's the oral exam.  And, and, then of course, this takes a, a lot of time.  And so--
Speaker 1: Were you anxious or were you fully aware of the process and were just kinda pacing yourself?
Speaker 2: I knew it, it took time and you--and, and I knew that even if you pass the exams, they don't necessarily take you in.  Because, you know, they--it's a process and I guess--in, in the beginning, I guess, some ten thousand people take the exam every year and on the average, they take in about sixty people at the top of the process, and so you can never count on, on, on getting in even if you pass the exam.  But, but any rate, but I did--I guess toward the end of the period I, I, I passed the oral exam, which was about a four hour sorta thing.
Speaker 1: The oral exam was?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: But, but--and so I was told that I passed it but, you know, I was given absolutely no promise, you know, as to--as to if and when I would get a call.  And so in September '57 [1957] after I had started another semester there at, at Chicago, which I had hoped, you know, to, to wrap things up for this so-called doctorate, take another course and, you know, get my language requirement out of the way, and, and, and other things, and so I was called one, one Wednesday morning late in September and, and told that they're starting a new class the following Monday morning and I was invited to, to join it.  And so I asked 'em, well can I delay this?  You know, I'm, I'm sort of in, in a--in a--in a--in a semester now which I hope to get a degree out of and so, so, so could I come say in January?  And so, in fact, they told me it's now or never, and that, that, that if you're invited to come in and you don't take it, then you start from the bottom all over again.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And so since this was the culmination of everything that I had been working for, I, I, I came in.
Speaker 1: And where was the--where was this class on Monday?
Speaker 2: It was here in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Wow.  So you got a call in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: On a Wednesday.
Speaker 1: --on a Wednesday and had to be in Washington by that--for that Monday class.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 261389
Speaker 1: When you get to Washington [D.C.] in 1957 and you enter this class, are you--are there any other African Americans in this class?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.  No, at this point in time, there--judging from the pictures on the wall, there were--I, I didn't see any other African American at the time.  I, I--when, when I, I think of the chap I mentioned, Ronald [D.] Palmer, who was a Howard University [Washington, D.C.] graduate who had come in a few--in the previous class, but--and so I did meet him, but--and I did learn later that a chap that I--who I also became friends with, a chap named David Bolen who was an Olympian from the late '40s [1940s] had come in.  Now, of course, some people had come in on the lateral entry, so I don't know who--and, and I, I think Palmer came in by the exam, but I don't know.  And, and I think this other fellow, [Clifton R.] Wharton [Sr.], apparently came by the exam in, in, in the '20s [1920s] and so, you know, he's the legend of the--of, of, of the [U.S.] Foreign Service sorta thing.  But, but, but he was in his last months at that time.
Speaker 1: How were you received by your fellow classmates?
Speaker 2: Very well.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Now, there--I mean, it, it--a glitch did turn up in this process in that after my class was finished, the, the officer who was--who was in charge of the, the class who we used to call the mother hen of the class who was an older officer, he did call me in one day after class was over--after the class had finished its routine, and said it was his process that he was trying to find a, a, a big brother or mentor for each of, of among other senior officers for, for each of the new Foreign Service officers, and he thought he had one for me, but, but the officer found out that I was black, and he told him blacks weren't ready for the Foreign Service.  I think we were called colored then or whatever the--but, but they--they're not ready for the Foreign Service.  And so he told me as compensation, he could get me posted to, to Panama who--to a chap that was a friend of his, you know, and he could--and he could make sure that this chap there in Panama, you know, could, could in effect treat me right.  And so I, I, I got on my high horse, which was perhaps a mistake at the time, and told him, you know, I don't need special treatment.  I'll, I'll make it on my own, sorta thing, not realizing that that's how people get ahead, you know, by, by, by getting to people, you know, who are looking out for them sorta thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I didn't--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --know the system (laughter) there at the time.  You know, I was--as I said, I was still being a loner type sorta thing.  I don't need this sort of special treatment, so I, I turned him down.  But things worked out later on.  I, I pretty much have held that--at--own personal policy all throughout my Foreign Service career, and I said, knowing good and well that for those who wanted to get ahead, they, they find mentors, you know, and they ally their, their--I mean, they attach themselves with people they know who are going places and this is the way you go places, you know, I guess in, in any business or bureaucracy sorta thing.
Speaker 1: Every industry, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  You know, I, I think that they have--someone had, had, had made the phrase, nothing, "Nothing propinks like propinquity" ['Diamonds Are Forever,' Ian Fleming] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But I, I, I never learned that, and so, I mean, I've had a--I think a good career.  But I speculate that--
Speaker 1: Do you think you could've had an even better career?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I, I, I never made ambassador, sorta thing.  I made just below it, but I never made ambassador.  Several other--several other people I, I, I know who were--I said, Ron Palmer, he's--he had at least two ambassadorships.  But, but I said, you, you had to be a bit--you should be a bit of a politician and I'm not knocking them for being a politician or holding myself above politics, but, still, it was just not my, my personality.
Story_ID: 261390
Speaker 1: Now, one thing we didn't talk about that happened in 1957, I believe, is you got married.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what were your new bride's [Lydia Armstrong Ellison] thoughts about moving to Washington, D.C., and this whole [U.S.] Foreign Service career?
Speaker 2: I think she, she was largely intrigued by it and, and I think she very much took to it, like, you know ducks to water, sorta thing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: She--she's--I think she's enjoyed it tremendously and was, you know, very happy I came along to, to, to make this proposal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So she was ready to go?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much so, um-hm.  So--and I think she still feels it was a worthwhile--
Speaker 1: And were some of your fellow classmates, were they married as well?  What was like the makeup of the class?  Were, were most of the people married?  Were they single?  Do you recall?
Speaker 2: I think most were single, although there was a fair contingent of, of married people, and, and of course, I guess, another indication of the changing of, of times, there were at least four or five female officers in, in the class.
Speaker 1: Oh, there were?  In 1957?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Now, there was still a horrible discrimination against them at the time, which has been since corrected.  If they got married, they had to quit.
Speaker 1: If the female officers got married?
Speaker 2: If the female officers--
Speaker 1: But if you were a male officer--
Speaker 2: If you were a male officer--
Speaker 1: --it was okay.
Speaker 2: --you didn't--you didn't have to, to quit.  It was, was a real discrimination against female officers and, and, of course, and, and, and God forbid, even thinking about marrying a foreign--a foreign male--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, of course, this is completely gone by the way now, and, and some--at least two of the female officers who were in my class had to quit because they were married, and then finally came--at a subsequent time, came back into the service, so--
Speaker 1: How many were in your class in 1957, about?
Speaker 2: About, about thirty.  I think, this is the general size of each class.
Story_ID: 261391
Speaker 1: And what was your first assignment [as a U.S. Foreign Service officer]?
Speaker 2: First assignment was when--I think when we finished, there was a severe budget shortfall and so only one person got a foreign assignment there when, when we finished the A-100 course, and this was a chap who, who was married and had already four children, and so they, they sent him abroad I think as, as a mercy thing.  And, of course, they said--and, and he got only as far as Nogales [Sonora, Mexico]--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --Mexico.  But--so, I got an assignment in what is known as INR [Bureau of Intelligence and Research] BI or biographic intelligence and, of course, I, I was dealing with the--with the, the Soviet era, and so it was a--it was a--it was a pretty dull job.
Speaker 1: And where was it where you--
Speaker 2: You stayed in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Stateside, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, in fact we had a--one of--one of those Quonset huts there on the--in the [National] Mall [Washington, D.C.] there at the time.
Speaker 1: And what year was that, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.]?
Speaker 2: This would've been '58 [1958].  And about a year later, I got my first foreign assignment.  Again, I, I saw this was--pure accident sorta things that turned out well in that, as I said, I, I was a--an active reserve officer and I had requested a tour of active duty for some training or the other there in '59 [1959].  And, and it had fallen through--
Story_ID: 261392
Speaker 1: The expected training tour was, was cancelled and so I went back into the personnel officer to tell him that I'm available for assignment since my, my reserve active duty time had been cancelled out.  And while I was waiting there near his desk, he was in the process of, of making a personnel change at the time due to the fact that he was--a vice consul in  Cyprus [Republic of Cyprus] had been wounded by someone throwing a grenade over his back fence in Cyprus, and so he had just transferred an officer out of Cairo [Egypt] to go to Cyprus.  And so when I told him that I'm available for assignment, he raised his finger in the air and then pointed to me, 'Cairo,' and it was just that simple (laughter) in, in those days.  And so, again, that was a, a, a momentous assignment for me because, you know, Egypt was a country that I had always been interested in.  I had read about it continuously as a--as a small child sorta thing, so it was a, a, a great--a good piece of, of good fortune for me.
Speaker 2: And when you read about Egypt as a boy, did you ever realistically think that you'd ever go there?
Speaker 1: No.  No, I never dreamed that, that I would end up living in, in Egypt for four and a half years.
Speaker 2: So you get to Cairo and it's an interesting time in Egypt and Africa altogether.  What were your experiences like in Cairo?
Speaker 1: When--I guess the first big experience had to do with Palestinian refugees who were there in, in Egypt at the time as a result of the--of the first war [Arab-Israeli War of 1948] there in, in Palestine.  A number of Palestinians had fled the--had fled the country, you know, to get away from the fighting, and quite a few of them had come to Egypt.  And the, the UN [United Nations] decision on, on recognizing Israel would--included a provision that, that the refugees be allowed to, to, to return to their homes.  And for a period, the--Israel, I guess--I guess Golda Meir was a foreign administrator at the time, they pretended that they were doing so and, of course, they had a UN observer apparently observing the process, and it found out that they were not letting Palestinians return to, to, to their homes.  They were merely shifting around Palestinians who were already in the country.  And so as a means of, of trying to pull off some of the, the pressure on this, the United States agreed to, to take in--no, no, Golda Meir said, you know, there would be no repatriation of Palestinians because the, the land is needed for, for Jews who were being accepted from the Arab countries, and so they absolutely refused to take in any of these people.  And so--and so we enacted a small refugee program ourselves, you know, that would--that would allow a certain number of these people to come to the [United] States.  And so they--the--from here to Washington [D.C.], they designated the--I guess the number of people that they were prepared to accept and, and so it came out to, to, to--for my task in Cairo to, to interview these people and to be sure of the circumstances in which they were forbidden to return and then examine their credentials, then of course, report it back to Washington, and, and, and then Washington decided to finally--you know, on who would be admitted.  And I think most of the people that I interviewed at the time were, were admitted.  But this was a trying time for these people.  They had been in refugee status there for, for, for some years.  But, of course, you get--but in the end process, you get a, a rather different view of what happened there in Palestine, you know, when you're having to deal with the people who have been affected by it, you know.  And these were mainly very much middle class, upper-middle class Palestinians, rich farmers, bankers, professionals, you know, who understandably enough when, when fighting breaks out around you, you get your family out of the way if possible.  But because they left, they were accused of--of course, of, of, of listening to Arab propaganda and, therefore, the Israeli government wouldn't let them come back in.

Speaker 1: What was the political climate like in Cairo [Egypt] at the time you were there in the late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: It was a time in which the--this was in the aftermath of the--of the--of the first Suez Canal crisis [Suez Crisis] sorta thing and we had been instrumental in getting the--it was the '56 [1956] invasion of, of Egypt.  We had been--the [President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower administration had been instrumental in getting the--finally getting the Israelis to, to, to evacuate the lands they'd occupied at the time.  And so this period, late '50s [1950s] was, was a very good period in Egyptian American relations.  And, of course, I found that to be true with all Egyptians, that, that, that I worked with.  But, of course, it was also a period, of course, that [Gamal Abdel] Nasser was turning to his, his, his--opening up his, his leadership role for the--for the Arab world as well as for the--for the Pan-African world, and so Cairo became the center of--for Arab as well as African nationalism.  And so he invited African nationalists who were--who considered themselves being in exile from other countries in Africa to set--to set up their headquarters in, in, in Cairo, you know, and to carry out and make their pronouncement speeches and so forth, and, and supposedly feel that they are the governments in waiting to, to occupy the, the government when their countries are liberated.  Didn't happen, but this was the hope that these people came there, there with.  And so some of them began coming into our consulate there wanting visas to go to the United States.
Story_ID: 261394
Speaker 1: How were you received [in Cairo, Egypt] as a black American [in the U.S. Foreign Service]?
Speaker 2: Well, they had--as I said, for the most part, the Egyptians or the Africans hadn't had that much direct contact.  Obviously, they, they read about us or what, what--first-hand contact with, with African Americans.  But, but, but they received me well, but I think it was reinforced by the fact that I was the visa officer.  You know, I signed visas and so I was given a lot more deference in celebrity than I was due there in the--in the local population sorta thing.  And I was being, you know, addressed constantly as, Your Excellency, and, and things like that, you know, purely because, you know, I signed visas.  In fact, everyone--there's a large foreign community that was beginning to feel, feel pressured (background noise) to leave Egypt and they wanted to go to the [United] States, and even a large number of, of the Egyptians who, who were being dispossessed because of the increasing socialization measures there in Egypt also wanted out to, to get to the States sorta thing, so it was--and, of course, the, the annual quota for Egypt was just 100 persons a year, and of course it was--and so we were way, way, way back, you know, in, in, in trying to fill, going back in time for people whose, whose term had come up under that--under that quota.  And so--and so much of the outlet, of course, occurred in, in the area--I mean, the, the available solution for many was, of course, student visas.  And it was my task, task as a visa officer to, to--not only to, to certify that they had been admitted to an American university, but that they are capable of carrying on university level work.  And so--
Speaker 1: Did you have to turn down a lot of student visas?
Speaker 2: Quite a few.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--but, it, it, it was a, a case--I mean, but yet still there were a lot--I approved a lot more student visas than, than visitor visas or any other kind--
Story_ID: 261395
Speaker 1: When we ended last time, we were talking about your first assignment in Cairo [Egypt], and you were telling us a little bit about how things were changing there and what the climate was like, and can you continue for us?
Speaker 2: Well, there were--I, I think that I first mentioned that I had to interview a sizeable--a sizeable number of Palestinian refugees who had fled to, to Egypt after the--during the, the Palestinian war [Arab-Israeli War of 1948] and, and, and found that the--that they couldn't go back to, to Palestine at the time, and we instituted a refugee program of our own and I had to interview all of the--those designated as official refugees to, to confirm the events that occurred to them and their documentation and then of course send them back to Washington [D.C.], and in Washington, they decided which ones would be allowed to immigrate to the United States.  That was one of my earlier tasks and then I went on to, to mention that the--this sudden, sudden flowering of the African independence movement, which at that point in time, there were only two or three [sic.] countries of Africa that were independent, I think Ghana and, and Ethiopia.  And Ghana sorta became the first leader of the--Kwame Nkrumah, of course, invited African nationalists to locate in Ghana soon after Ghana became free and apparently, [Gamal Abdel] Nasser decided to give him some competition and, and, and began offering subsidies to these same people that, that--there in Cairo, so a whole lot of 'em left Ghana and went to Cairo to, to, to pursue what they considered their, their African nationalist aims.  And, and among them, of course, were a, a few--a few Americans of note, I think I mentioned.  And of course the--now I think [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou was at that time married to one of the South African nationalists [sic.], and I think she had been in Ghana with her husband and they came to Cairo.  Of, of, of perhaps more important--importance, there was the co-leader of the African National Congress [ANC], a chap named Oliver Tambo who had finally came, came to Cairo directly after several stops in Africa from South Africa, and he had been the co-chair of the African National Congress along with--what's the fellow who was-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  [Nelson] Mandela.
Speaker 2: Mandela.  He, he and Mandela were co-chairman of the African National Congress.  Mandela, of course, was arrested and Oliver Tambo escaped, and Tambo became leader of the African National Congress in, in, in exile, and he promoted their cause for up until, of course, a time that, that Mandela was released and became president.  But at that time, he was just one of the several dozens of people there, you know.  Of course, he, he wanted also a visa to come to the U--to the UN [United Nations] to, to try to get some UN recognition of their cause, and that's how I happened to meet him.
Story_ID: 261396
Speaker 1: One thing I should've done before we started was slate the tape, and I just need to do that really quickly, so I just need to say that I am the interviewer, my--Racine Tucker-Hamilton.  Matthew Hickey is the videographer and observing are [Rebecca] Weslie Ellison and Sylvia Ellison.  Okay, I'm sorry.  And today's date is Friday, January 14, 2005.  I'm sorry about that, thank you.
Speaker 2: No--
Story_ID: 261397
Speaker 1: What were your impressions of Nelson Mandela when you first met him?  Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I--no, I never met Nelson Mandela.  I, I, I met, of course, only Oliver Tambo who was the co-chair of, of the--of the African National Congress [ANC].  Mandela had been, in fact, just arrested and Oliver Tambo escaped arrest, and, and, and of course finally made it to, to Cairo [Egypt].  And Tambo I got to know fairly well.  He wanted a visa to the--to, to come to, to the United States.  And of course by the practice at that time, when someone from out of the country asks for a visa, you have to refer the request back to our embassy in the country from which they came.  And of course that was done, and of course the embassy in South Africa, of course, inquired of the government of South Africa and they had him labeled as a communist.  And by our visa laws, we couldn't give anyone who was a communist a, a visa, so the alternative I had, I, I could ask for a waiver of, of this--of this regulation and I based it upon, of course, the number of conversations I had with Oliver Tambo at the time, I said my belief that I don't think this man is a communist.  But I got no answer from the [U.S.] Department of State at that time and, and, and Oliver Tambo eventually left Cairo and went other places.  And, of course, he became quite famous as the exiled leader of the African National Congress.  But what did happen, I discovered many years later a--that a, a, a colleague from the political section there in Cairo at that time later came to the department and, and worked on this--on this case, and finally gave Oliver Tambo his visa to the United States.
Story_ID: 261398
Speaker 1: At the time you were in Cairo [Egypt], late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], what were some of your thoughts about what was taking place in the [United] States in terms of the Civil Rights Movement, just the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement and that kinda thing?  Did you feel like you were missing out on what was happening here in the States?
Speaker 2: In a sense, yes.  I think as, as, as a--I think I, I somewhat jokingly pointed out to, to people--I think I spent about four and a half years in Cairo at the time, which is longer than a junior officer generally spends at a post, and I did have home leave in, in between.  But as I pointed out I think when, when, when we left the United States in the left '50s [1950s]--in, in the late '50s [1950s], we were colored and when we came back, we were black sorta thing (laughter), you know.  And, you know, it sort of--a bit of a surprise because in previous years, calling someone black was a pejorative term, sorta thing, you know (laughter).  As I--as, as I, I mentioned to some of my white colleagues in, in later periods, you know, that if, if, if you call someone an SOB, it's bad.  If you call 'em a black SOB, you had a fight on your hands, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, but--so, so, so, the climate definitely was, was changing, of course, and there was the--I think the, the so-called people beginning to wear dashikis and afros and, and things of this type.  And, and, of course, it was odd since I, I, I never met--I don't think I ever met an African wearing an afro as the case may be or even--or even a dashiki--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but that became the, the, the question of, of identity with, with Africa.
Story_ID: 261399
Speaker 1: After Cairo [Egypt], you left the post in Cairo in 1963?
Speaker 2: Yes, about, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so where were you assigned after that?
Speaker 2: When, when--I was assigned then to, to the [U.S.] Department of State and I became the deputy of public affairs advisor for near east--for Near East South Asian Bureau [Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs; Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs], and my main task at that time was furnishing the department spokesman with press guidance for the Arab-Israeli problem.  There was always questions concerning this coming up in the department's press briefing every day.  And so every morning, we would meet with the department spokesman and he would figure out the questions he was going to be asked that day and then those of us from varying bureaus would, would come back to our bureau, and I guess what, what you would do is, you would write out what you think should--the spokesman should say, and then you begin passing it around to the desk officers to--for any comment and then finally to the assistant secretary of state because this was always a very sensitive area and get him to sign off on it and then of course pass it back to the spokesman that day.  Then after that, I was available to talk to newsman to brief them about the Arab-Israeli problem and our policy in that area, and then sometimes the job went on into the middle of the night.  I would get telephone calls from a, a--an Israeli news, news station called Kol Yisrael.  They would call me at one or two in the morning, you know, asking me about some little, little item that the press spokesman had said about Israel that day.
Speaker 1: And what was the U.S. stance or policy on the Israeli-Arab issue at that particular time?
Speaker 2: One--it was somewhat, I might say more ambiguous than it is now.  We, of course, were the ones who, who first recognized the state of Israel when it--when they declared their, their independence, and we began to differ with them certainly during, during the '50s [1950s] during the[President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower administration when, when after the--when the Suez war [Suez Crisis] broke out and Israel invaded parts of Egypt at the time and, of course, and the U.S. government was by the likes of the Israeli government at that time considered hostile to Israel's interest, but Israel and its supporters in the United States began to form a, a very effective lobby group here in the States that, of course, is now the, the second--considered the second most powerful lobby in, in, in the U.S. behind the National Rifle Association [NRA].  And so congressman and as well as the president could hardly afford to be even seen not favoring Israel's positions in, in, in the Middle East.
Story_ID: 261400
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, we're [U.S. Department of State] trying to maintain a balanced position with regard to the rights of the Palestinians and, and, and, of course, the right of Israel to exist.  These are the, the challenges of the Palestinians, that they had been wrongfully treated and deprived of their--of their land and, and, and home sorta thing, so it's--it continues to be obviously a very ticklish question.  But at that time, it was in the early '60s [1960s], the interest in it was beginning to, to rise sizably, and it was difficult to find a, a balanced middle ground in trying to answer questions about it because Israel supporters, both here in the [United] States and Israel, tried very hard to whatever slant there was, that the slant comes out in their favor, and they became increasingly successful with it.  Now, of course, I mean, it was--everyone of course recognizes the wrong done to the Jews as a result of the Holocaust and they very effectively played upon this history in, in supporting their claims to the--to, to the land of, of Palestine.  And, of course, it's still a very difficult issue, and there are some today who would say that much of our problems in, in the Middle East with the Al-Qaeda and the--and jihadists were, were part of our long-term policy with regard to, to Palestine.
Speaker 2: Were you personally--how, how, how were you dealing with it personally since you had the opportunity to work and meet with Palestine refugees through your work in Cairo [Egypt]?  So, were--was it, like, personally conflicting for you or how, how were you handling this?
Speaker 1: No, no, I felt no, no conflict.  I, I certainly believed that I understood their, their, their problem much better than most Americans having had this, all this personal conflict with 'em.  Of course, the facts that I knew at that time were, were barely known by most Americans in, in that these people, you know, fled their homes when, when fighting occurred, you know, near--in the areas around 'em.  And just like any American family, you know, if you're caught up in, in, in a war, you move your family out of the way, and, and, and, of course, until the fighting stops, not believing that just because you fled the fighting that you would be deprived forever of, of your right to come back to your home or your property or your bank accounts or, or anything else, but the, the, the Israelis absolutely refused any of these people the right of--to return to what had now become Israel, you know, after, after the war.  Their view was that we have to take in lots of Jewish refugees from Arab countries and, therefore, if there's any compensation, the Arab countries should compensate these, these Arab refugees, and they were very, very adamant about that.  As far as I'm aware, no one--no one was able to get back.  I mean, these were--these were not, you know, Arab nationalists.  These were people who had lived there, you know, in, in this land for, you know, for, for generations and they had no more political ambitions as such, you know, that--I mean, they just wanted to live out their lives in their land in which they had always considered, you know, their homeland.  And so, it came as quite a shock to them, you know, that they were suddenly deprived of everything as a result of this war in which they had no decision or--to make about it, sorta thing.  And so I, I, I saw the conflict from that standpoint.  Now, I would say certainly in retrospect, going back to my days back at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] as a grad student, I certainly saw the other side of the problem.  I, I can not only say, you know, that some of my best friends were Jews, practically all of my friends were, were Jews there in, in, in Chicago [Illinois] during that period, and so I certainly, you know, got, you know, their view of the problem.  So by the time I came back from Cairo, you know, I could see the, the dimension of the problem and, of course, the rights and wrongs that had happened to, to both sides.  And so you can feel compassion for the interest of both, but yet I never felt conflicted by any statement I made about the situation out there, although, as I said, some Israeli reporters could, could become very picky, you know, and try to read a nuance in, in your statement, you know, and complain about it, and--but I was never, never reprimanded for saying anything out of order or wrong about our policy out there.
Story_ID: 261401
Speaker 1: Let's move on and talk a little bit about your post in Germany.  So you were assigned to Germany in 1966.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about what you did in Germany?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I--my, my assignment in, in, in Bremen, [West] Germany [Bremen, Germany], came as something of a surprise.  I had been--had been actually assigned to, to, to Milan [Italy] previously, but--and so out of the clear blue sky, I had orders changed--orders come out sending me to Bremen, Germany, and it was a, a difficult situation in that the consul general there had, had, had absolutely refused a, a previous assignment there to come to the post, and the next person who, who was assigned learned of that and decided that, that--I can say this safely now that the man is deceased, that he was a career killer, and, and, and so, so the next man assigned refused to take it.  And so, so I wasn't even consulted.  I--of course, it was done by an old boss out of Cairo [Egypt] that I--that I would go to Bremen sorta thing, and so I was delighted going to Bremen since it was a, a--turned out to be a very nice place to be.  But the, the consul general there wasn't exactly delighted with me.  And, of course, I, I was replacing a, a, a consular officer who was--who was multilingual.  She was from a--from a old Jewish-German family and, of course, so was he, Jewish--a Jewish-German family.  Of course, he had been speaking German all of his life and, and so he was very fluent in it.  And my--and I barely passed the, the, the test, you know, for just basic competence in German, so that was a, a, a tall hill to climb.  Also, my first year there was difficult both working for him and, of course, settling into the community.  North Germans have a reputation of being much of a closed society.  They don't accept outsiders.
Speaker 1: And did you live in a German--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --community?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  In fact, I, I lived--I found a--found a, a, a beautiful house there and, and, and leased it.  And, and, and again, there was something of a racial situation there since the first house that I found was a great old townhouse near the center of Bremen and, and when the owner found out that I was black, he refused to, to, to rent it to me.  But the house that I did get, I think, was an even better one for entertainment.  I think it was one of the favorite places I lived in since, since I've been in the [U.S.] Foreign Service.  But, but so there, there was a difficult situation there.  I--anyone from the outside doesn't--does not get admitted into the--easily into Bremen society.  Even the society itself is sharply divided between the merchants society and, and, and the labor people sorta thing, and they don't even talk much to each other.  But gradually, things began to, to work out.  And pretty soon, we became, of course, invited out quite often and, and I guess after about a year there, my--the consul general became quite ill and, and he had to take off for quite a number of months, and so I became charge and, and just perhaps I might've been the first black in charge of a post in, in, in Germany; I don't know this as a fact, but I--this is my assumption from, from the other situations there.  And it became a, a most interesting assignment.
Story_ID: 261402
Speaker 1: This was also, of course, when, when the Vietnam War was, was at its height, and a lot of the people, the liberals and the people from the labor movement were, were, were strongly opposed to, to our position in the Vietnam War, and so had large numbers of, of, of demonstrations, which--and, and, and delegations, which I had to, to talk to people about what we were doing there and, and why.  And, and perhaps of some interest from The HistoryMakers point of view, I even had a visit from, from the, the leader of the local German Communist Party [Communist Party of Germany].  This, this, this was after [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis had been indicted for, for murder.  And he came--he came in to, to, to see me to protest the coming execution of Angela Davis for, for, for murder, sorta thing.  And, and so I, I got a lecture about the racial situation in, in the United States and I asked him, had, had, had he ever been to the United States?  They said no, but I know all about it, you can believe that sorta thing, and of course he was, was totally misinformed.  And, and so I tried to, of course, to, to bring him around a bit and he, he, he (unclear) it--
Speaker 2: What were--what were his impressions of like how blacks were treated in the United States in the racial situation?
Speaker 1: Oh, oh it, it was--I mean, it was the, the worst from, you might say even the '30s [1930s].  This was his etiological arrived at conception.  And so when I tried to tell him differently, you know, and the fact that, that, that he's talking to a black American, it--he pretended, you know, not to be phased by this.  He said he dismissed it.  You're only--you're only saying what you're being paid to say and I know that.  I mean, it, it can't be otherwise than, than I know it.
Speaker 2: So did he think that Angela Davis was being charged with murder and conspiracy because she was a communist or because she was black?
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  You know, when, when, when actually I found out that--reading some, some later that, that, that apparently Angela Davis had, you know, established some ties, links to the German Communist Party, and, and, of course, this was a, a much more important thing to them than I had realized at the time.  But, but any rate, so I decided to try to turn around the conversation, and so I--so I brought up the situation in, in, in East Germany at the time and I said, I, I think most black Americans would much rather live in, in America than most Germans live in East Germany, and he got tremendously upset.  You know, he, he, he literally screamed at me, you know nothing about this, you know nothing about this, you can't know anything about this.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, of course, the, the (unclear) just fifty miles from, from where we were sitting at, at the time.  And so--and so I, I came away from, you know, from that as much--I mean, of course, this is not the first conversation I've had with communists there or any place else in the world, but he was of the old school type, and to me, he was as much or more of a racist than, than most I had met.  Because--
Speaker 2: He was un--misinformed.
Speaker 1: He couldn't--he couldn't accept the fact that I knew anything about what was going in America or, or in Germany--or in East Germany.
Speaker 2: And so you were assigned to--you remained in Germany until 1971.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 261403
Speaker 1: What was your assignment after Germany?
Speaker 2: When, when--my assignment after Germany--when, when--of course, I would like to add to that, that, that my, my meetings--and, of course, I think I had a full spectrum of meetings there, believe it or not.  For instance, the, the Neo-Nazi party for, for, for Germany, the NPD, the National Partei Demokratische [sic. Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands; National Democratic Party of Germany], was having--had this national convention there in Bremen [West Germany; Bremen, Germany] while I was there.  Of course, the consul general was there at the time.  And, of course, whenever a national party holders convention where, where you're assigned, you're supposed to cover the meeting and report from it.  And so--and so the consul general was supposed to do certainly the--all the political stuff and I did most of the economic stuff.  But for some reasons of his own, he decided that, that, that as a Jew, he, he didn't want to attend, and so he sent me.
Speaker 1: So he'd send you, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And, and so the--so it, it was an open meeting.  It was being held at the stadthall or the--or the local convention center so anyone could come in.  You know, they paid this nominal fee.  And so, so I came there and paid my money, and then of course, I, I had the decision as to where to sit, and so my first inclination was to find some quiet corner, you know, to, to sit among all these Neo-Nazis sorta thing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And then, then I decided somewhat puckishly, you know, well, I might as well get, get hung for a sheep as a lamb, so I proceeded to the very center seat of the--of, of, of the convention hall and, and sat down.  Of course, I was way ahead of most people coming in to see me--to--not to see me, to, to the--to the convention.  And after a while, I, I became aware from, from the corner of my eyes that I was the subject of discussion, you know, by some people there, there in, in the--in the aisle sorta thing.  And so--and then so eventually, this--a very diffident young man, you know--you know, came up and sat next to me, and, you know, asked me if, if I knew where I was, and so I said yeah, I'm at a--NPD, NPD meeting, sorta thing.  And, and so I, I think he must've thought that I was there for a rock concert or something of the sort.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, and so, he squirmed a bit and, and then he said--and then he asked me, did I know anything about the NPD.  I said, yes, I've--I know a lot about the NPD, you know, so I'm--I was joking, said it's one of my favorite organizations, you know (laughter).  And so he squirmed a, a, a bit further sorta thing, and eventually left.  And, and, and there, at that point, my, my, my nervousness left because obviously, they were more nervous about my being there than, than I was nervous about being there myself.  But the funny part about it, of course, is that the place eventually filled up completely with, with the exception of two seats next to me, in front of me, and, and back of me.  I was sort of a--of a donut hole--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --in, in the middle of this whole convention sorta thing--
Story_ID: 261404
Speaker 1: Of course she [HistoryMaker Angela Davis] had lots of interest apparently in Germany herself sorta thing and contact in Germany.
Speaker 2: So you were just saying that you--even though you all ended up on different ends of the political spectrum, Angela Davis, you thought that perhaps you had--have a lot in common.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I, I, I--this is my--or we had at, at some point--
Speaker 2: Had, right.
Speaker 1: --in, in, in our--in our student or, or intellectual careers, although I said we ended up on, on the four corners of, of the American political spectrums.  But I think--but I think this is a interesting aspect of what you all are, are doing.
Story_ID: 261405
Speaker 1: Let's talk about when you left Germany in 1971, what was next for you?
Speaker 2: I, I first, of course, took--I was first put into a intensive six months economic course that they give to economic officers who, who, who were not economic majors.  And, of course, this is this given equivalent of, of, of a degree in, in economics.
Speaker 1: So was this back here in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: This is back here in Washington.  And then I went on from there to the [U.S. Department of State] Bureau of Southern African Affairs [sic. Office of Southern African Affairs].  I was--had two jobs for a while, both the regional economic officer and then the--then the desk officer for Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland.  And I became almost immediately involved in a--an, an effort by the assistant secretary of state for Africa [David D. Newsom] to do a, a paper on southern Africa called--which ended up being called the employment practices of American firms in, in, in southern Africa ["Employment Practices of U.S. Firms in South Africa"].  And also, I became--I got--I was on the short list to become the first African American being sent to South Africa, and another officer named James Baker became the first.  And so him becoming the first, I, I, I went out as, as it were ahead of him and became his John the Baptist if, if it will, sorta thing--if you will, so I had an--a quite extensive tour, a, a, a one-month tour of southern Africa.  I, I got the honorary white treatment as, as, as it was.  But I, I, I think that in the documentation I give some details about that trip that I was--went from--I mean, all the major posts in the major cities and met people principally on, on, on economic issues by doing the research for this, this paper itself sorta thing, and--
Speaker 1: And in a nutshell, what did you discover?  What were the employment practices of American firms in southern Africa?
Speaker 2: Many of them were marginally better, some much better, and the idea was to highlight what firms could do even under South African law and, and, and show it by example, what some of the firms have done.  The idea was to, to improve the lot of the African workers both in American firms and then, of course, in, in all African firms in general.
Speaker 1: So were the American firms somewhat to lead--set the example?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--some, some were.  And I said, I, I, I actually got to confirm this during my full trip to, to, to South Africa.  And, of course, I--the--it, it, it was a surprise in that I found that the, the Afrikaners that I met were much more flexible and open than I'd ever dreamed of--well, not necessarily dreamed of because even before going out to South Africa, it was known in the South African embassy that I was working on this project, and so I, I started regularly to meet with officers of the South African Embassy for, for lunch about once a month.  And, and, we, we were invited to a couple of, of receptions, which my, my wife [Lydia Armstrong Ellison] had some trepidations about at, at first, but she was just absolutely astounded how warm and beautiful, you know, they were to us, and so it--it's--I think as some commentator noted after I told him about it, there, there are no people more gracious in the world than Afrikaners when they want to be.
Story_ID: 261406
Speaker 1: Did you feel the oppression of apartheid or were you somewhat removed from that?
Speaker 2: When--I wasn't--I mean, I was exempt from, from, you know, observing apartheid laws.  Now, of course, obviously I, I saw what was going on since I did visit all the major cities, you know, and, and, and I talked to both--to, to people across the whole spectrum, you know, Afrikaner business men, politicians, the, the, the English--the English South Africans, the coloured, and, and black labor leaders and, and across the, the whole spectrum, and so--
Speaker 1: Did you kinda feel like you were in a time warp somewhat, you know, with the progress that was being made in the U.S. you had just left?  And what were--can you kinda share some of your thoughts with us about that?
Speaker 2: It did seem like a time warp.  I, I mean going through some of the smaller towns in South Africa, it looked almost exactly like the old South thirty, forty years previously.  I, I thought even the--even the, the expressions on, on, on some of the, the faces of the--of both the blacks and the whites.  It--there, there, there was a, a real continuity going on there.  So--and the--some of the biggest, largest differences of course I, I found, of course in, in Cape Town [South Africa] itself, which is the home--at that time the home of, of the so-called coloured population, and these people had been moved in massive numbers, you know, away from Cape Town into settlements, you know, near Cape Town sorta thing.  But the--I talked to a number of, of, of coloured there sorta thing and you found lots of--or I think--I think real similarity among people that you--that you've--that you've know, you know, in, in, in the states sorta thing, but yet they were here classified, you know, as a--as a separate racial group.  And so--but any rate, as I said, I was treated quite royally by all the people that I met, you know, dinners, cocktail parties, and so forth.  In fact, the--I, I think the somewhat humorous thing about it, I think a lot of people thought that I come there to, to, to beat up on 'em about their racial problem and, and, of course, I came there mainly as, as an economist, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --talked mainly about questions about the economy, economic situation, and business, 'cause that was my main focus.  And almost invariably when I didn't raise the problem myself, it was--they, they had to raise it with me.  They wanted to tell me what they--what they felt about the racial problem.  And so I left there a lot more encouraged about the future of it than you ever--than I would've ever had from the outside.  Now, in fact, when I got back to the [United] States and I--and I met with Jim [Baker]--now, now, of course, I--I'm gonna go back a bit.  Even the--our ambassador to, to South Africa hadn't heard that the first black officer was coming out there and it, it, it was--it was I who told him that, that, that the first black officers were being assigned to South Africa, and he was not pleased at the decision or--nor--or being told--being told about it by me sorta thing.  So that was a potentially nasty little wrinkle there.  He, he, he was a--ambassador (unclear) and, of course, he was not--he was not a career officer.  I think he was a Texas oil man as, as, as I recall.  But by and large, I felt pretty good about the prospects of the problem there and I came back and told Jim Baker, you know, this thing is doable.  You know, I, I, I think the idea was that, that, that a black officer couldn't possible operate there in, in South Africa, and I think I found out differently.  And, of course, he did subsequently go and he spent a full year out, out in South Africa and, and, and, of course, I think the difference--supposedly the reason he was sent rather than I, he was a bachelor and, and, and I had a family sorta thing, and he felt this would be a bit much to ask of, of, of a family to put up with.  Now, of course, I had lots of official cover.  Now, on the other hand, some people I met in dining rooms, hotel dining rooms and so forth coming across me, you know, if, if, if looks could kill, I'd been dead several times over.  But I was never molested or, or challenged.
Story_ID: 261407
Speaker 1: You completed this in--this assignment in 1974?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: Well, well, well, of course--I, I, I think I should mention, of course, that, that--at this point that I came back and we did finish up this paper ["Employment Practices of U.S. Firms in South Africa"].  Now, I want to emphasize that although I perhaps worked on it more than anyone else, it wasn't my paper, it was the state department's [U.S. Department of State]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --paper and it was the assistant secretary [David D. Newsom] who started it and who ordered it done.  And so I, I--so I can't claim credit for it even though I did perhaps the most work on it.  Now, it was after much toing and froing, it was finally released and the reporter for the Johannesburg Star [The Star] knew that I was working on it sorta thing, and so he--so he got one of the very early copies and sent it to Johannesburg [South Africa], and it was published completely in Johannesburg Star the day after we released it.  So it caused a, a, a--something of a positive turmoil there in South Africa and on, on the down side, it was not even released as a full state department paper.  The state department wouldn't sanction it as a state department paper, neither the [U.S.] Bureau of Public Affairs.  And so the assistant secretary for, for southern Africa released it on, on, on his own sorta thing, and I think he was a--it took a lot of courage for him to do that because it, it did turn out to be quite controversial.  And he even was summoned to the White House [Washington, D.C.] and, and read the riot, riot act by the then assistant national--deputy's national security advisor, one Alexander Haig, you know, he was--he actually tore him up, you know.
Speaker 1: Controversial in what regard?  Just that how American firms were treating South Africans who were employed by them?
Speaker 2: When, when, when--we were certainly advocating, you know, much better treatment across the, the spectrum for, for South African blacks, and coloureds, and by strict standards, you know, we were interposing ourself into, into internal affairs of, of South Africa.  And, and so--and so this is what Alexander Haig, of course, was, was quite concerned about sorta thing.  But any rate, it was released and the--it caused some--quite a bit of some public notice at the time, but The Washington Post as I recall did, did print an editorial about it commending the, the--this paper and, and ending with the notation that finally the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon administration has done something right about South Africa.  I'm not sure whether it was--it was tongue-in-cheek or not.  Now, now this goes on to the effect that--you have undoubtedly heard of, of--perhaps have heard of the Sullivan report [Sullivan Principles, Reverend Leon Sullivan], and it's my--it's my and I think many other people's conviction that--of course, the Sullivan report was a--was--had many--much of the same material that the state department paper that he worked on contained.  Of course--and of course he--and of course, he gained considerable prestige and notoriety for the Sullivan report and was generally considered to be the, the sole author of it.  And later in the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan administration, Reagan specifically cited the Sullivan report, you know, as the way things--the way things should go in South Africa, so I thought it was vindication for some of us who still remember, you know, the difficult time that we had in working on this report, you know, in, in the state department.  And, of course, I, I, I think my daughter there, has often suggested, you know, that, that we should reaffirm, you know, our--the fact that--publically reaffirm the, the fact that we, we were the original authors of, of the Sullivan report.  But in as much as he served to continue to propagate the principles of--in a way that I, anyone else who worked on it--you know, we changed jobs, you know, at least once every two years, and so I think most people in--I think anyone in the state department remembers anymore that, that this report was ever--was ever done in the state department, but the Sullivan report, of course, has, has become, you know, nationally known sorta thing.  And so, there's something--the old saying about it's unlimited the amount of good that you do that if, if you don't care who gets credit for it.  And so--and so I think we can--I can take some solace from that sorta thing.
Story_ID: 261408
Speaker 1: So now I wanna talk about your next assignment in 1974 to--
Speaker 2: [Republic of] Zaire.
Speaker 1: --Zaire and just what your experiences and--were like in Zaire and your responsibilities [as a U.S. Foreign Service officer] and what you were doing there.
Speaker 2: I was the commercial attache of--in, in, in Zaire.  And, of course--of course when my assignment was made there, Zaire was still earning lots of currency from its copper and, and associated metal reserves.  And thinking back two months before my getting there, the, the bottom dropped out of the copper market.  The, the, the price of copper dropped from down to about a dollar fifty a pound to about fifty cents a pound sorta thing on the international market.  And so--and so several months after I got there, all of--all of Zaire's foreign exchange had practically been depleted.  And on top of that--this was, of course during the period of when the, the, the Rumble in the Jumble [sic. Rumble in the Jungle, Kinshasa, Republic of Zaire], the great fight between [Cassius] Clay [Muhammad Ali] and George Foreman took place with much, I think unfounded--
Speaker 1: Were you there?  Had you already arrived for the Ali-Foreman fight?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I did not attend.  I was not among those, those few who got courtesy tickets, and the price of the tickets were so incredibly high, you know, I just didn't think it was worth it, you know, to, to pay to go, of course--now, of course, I've, I've, I've seen it on film and, and it, it, it was a great fight, but, but still--
Speaker 1: Do you wish you would've gone?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Maybe, maybe, historically, I, I, I would have enjoyed going.  But, but the, the, the fight was not well organ- I mean, Zaire thought that, that a whole lot more people would pay those humungous prices to come see that fight than did.  And so the Zairian government, of course, as I recall ended up in the hole on, on this fight.  And so, so I ended up as commercial attache spending a lot of fruitless time trying to collect bills as a--that were--that were due to various Americans, you know, for that fight.
Speaker 1: Were you excited, though, as an American that this huge fight was coming to Zaire?  Were you excited as an American or what were your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Not, not particularly.  I had, you know, had sometimes been a fight fan.  In, in fact--in, in, in fact in my much younger years, I'd even done a bit of boxing.  But, I mean, it, it was I think seen internationally as a greater occasion than, than it deserved.  And as--as, as I said, I think it cost Zaire, I think a lot more than, than, than the fight was, was, was worth.  As I said, of course I--of course I, I said I ended up trying to collect the bills for it and I, I perhaps know best--better than many other people.  In fact, I don't know that some of those bills were, were ever paid because by this time, Zaire's currency reserves were, were, were depleted.
Story_ID: 261409
Speaker 1: Do you think, though, because there were a lot of journalists and photographers, and just a lot of Americans who came to [Republic of] Zaire to, to work whether it was in their particular profession, and do you think that it kinda gave a different perspective that many Americans had about Zaire and African countries in general?  Do you think that it helped in that regard?
Speaker 2: There was, of course, definitely a, a blurb in, in publicity, but I think it was--the effects were not permanent.  I mean, the, the fight itself, of course, was still--
Speaker 1: They were very short-lived.
Speaker 2: It--it's still famous, you know, as the, the Rumble in the Jungle [Kinshasa, Republic of Zaire].  And, and I think it was obviously one of the more significant of, of, of [Cassius] Clay [Muhammad Ali] and [George] Foreman's fights sorta thing.  It, was, was Foreman, of course, I think he lost his, his championship in, in, in the process.  And, and Clay wasn't as nearly as dominant in this fight, you know, as he had been on, on previous one, and so for, for a while, it, it was very chancy, you know, how, how this was going to--I mean, this is from what I've seen from the--from the films.  He was--he ended up being the smarter fighter in that he could channel up some reserves, you know, to hold him off 'til the end of the fight and finally beat Foreman.  But, he took an incredible amount of punishment and so--which is not what Clay usually did.
Speaker 1: Do you think it provided, though, a connection for African Americans to Africa?
Speaker 2: When--perhaps in the total scheme of things.  I mean, there were--there, there were, of course, a--an increasing interest in Africa among, among African Americans, and I think even from--not only from Zaire but from several other countries.  I think they felt that, that there's--should be or is a considerable place for, for, for a display of their African heritage there as a result of, of, of occasions like this.  But in the long run sense, I, I think they overestimated the--this, this racial heritage bit in that most Africans that I know of don't consider this nearly as important as a whole lot of Americans did, and they did not accept them as, you know, long lost brothers.  In fact, it's--for, for most Africans, their bounds [sic. bonds] of kinship and tribe are much closer and much more significant to them than, than, than a common racial background.
Story_ID: 261410
Speaker 1: And so I think as, as I've often pointed out, for, for most Africans, the, the, the persons they hate the most on earth are other Africans who live no more than a few miles away.  And these are the people that they are fighting with, contending with, and, and competing with sorta thing.  And, and so they--unless for, for those few who, who have a personal interest in exploiting a particular relationship, they are not that, that interested in, in--I mean--I mean, they feel no strong ties with African Americans.  I mean, they come from a long way away sorta thing.  In fact, on my--one of my more recent visits to, to [Federal Republic of] Nigeria when I was talking to--about this to, to some Nigerians, he said, you know, for, for, for most practical purposes--for all practical purposes, most Nigerians consider you white.
Speaker 2: Well what do you--what do you think in terms of the connection between African Americans and Africans?  Which--you talked about the connection between Africans and African Americans, but do you think that it provided a connection for African Americans?
Speaker 1: It provides obviously a, a, a historical connection for, for a lot and, and, and, of course, most people of any race would like to feel proud of, you know, of, of, of where they come from, you know, and their--and, and their ancestors.  And, and so certainly in, in, in a sentimental sense, I think most African Americans or many African Americans would like to feel, you know, that they have very definitely cultural and intellectual ties with, with Africa.  But Africa is so huge and so diverse, and, you know, we--I mean, we tend to think of--we tend to think of Africa I think pretty much as some of the Africans I met in, in Cairo [Egypt] in that--in those early days, you know, that, that after independence--I think the, the universal idea was that after independence and the colonial powers leave, we'll all be brothers, you know, and there, there won't be conflicts between us and we'll all live together, you know, very happily, and that, that didn't--that didn't happen, you know, as obviously, of course as you've seen by most recent events.  The worst massacres, you know, have happened between Africans, you know--you know, they have lived together closely, you know, for, for years, you know.  And whether you've--as a most recent example of that, I, I, I would certainly recommend seeing this, this movie, 'Hotel Rwanda' sorta thing, where, you know, there has, has been this kind of--there's been a low level of animosity between people's--people of different tribal and, and, and ethnic heritages, you know, that are much more important to them than whatever common heritage, you know, they would have as, as Africans.  And, and as I said--and African Americans who grew up completely outside of the--of the cultural heritage of, of Africa, have no great place in it.  You know, for, for, for most African Americans, you know, you couldn't go to, to Africans and, and say he's of a certain tribe, he's of a certain tribe, and there's another tribe there, you know.  It's pretty much of a continuum sorta thing.  But for most Africans, they--that is the most important fact in their life, you know, knowing which tribe they're from and, and helping their own people, you know, meet their--meet their necessities.  Now, of course, this has been, of course--I mean, historically up until fairly recent--recently, a, a survival factor for many people, you know, strong tribal identification because the, the tribe will, will take care of you, you take care of your tribe.  And it's been a negative factor in, in, in modern African governments, again, this, this, this tribalism sorta thing in that it's difficult for them to overcome the adherence or loyalty to a tribe and, and transfer it to a nation.  You know, for most of us, you know, it's, it's immaterial, you know, to us, you know, where you came from or what your ethnic background was, if you're--you know, if--I, I mean, if you're black, you know, you--we, we, we have something in common perhaps sorta thing.  But you're, you're not going to go whatsoever, you know, into what someone's tribe was, but it's altogether different.
Story_ID: 261411
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], you left Zaire in 1977.
Speaker 2: Yes, about, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and from there, you went to Thailand.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about your experiences in Thailand and, and what your responsibilities were there?
Speaker 2: Well, in Thailand, I was the embassy finance and development officer.  I, I followed up on their financial institutions as well as, of course, the economic development of the country itself.  And Thailand is a good example of a developing country that is rapidly reaching self-sufficiency.  And so the--so I had a chance to, of course, to examine in detail the aid givers from international organization aid givers to, to, to Thailand and to check the, the efficiency or efficacy of their--of their programs.  And so I had a chance to travel about the country rather sizably and including, of course, I was twice in the areas in where there's a recent tsunami [Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004], took place there.  And then, of course, I was also involved in helping push American commercial interests in Thailand inasmuch as showing how America had lost major parts of the Thai market because of the inflexibility of, of financing by, by American firms compared to Japanese firms.  And apparently one of the more notable occasions for me occurred when Deng Xiaoping, the, the leader of China after, after Mao [Zedong] sorta decided that he was breaking out of the--of China's isolation and, and so he made a--almost a surprise visit to Thailand.  And, of course, this was something very new for the Chinese countries visit--having a--an official visit to a country that has a capitalist system as, as well as a king.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so--and so the--all the embassies were invited to send someone, of course, to a great reception for Deng Xiaoping and, of course, it caught us, the American embassy, flatfooted.  And, of course, and we sent to Washington [D.C.] for instructions as to, you know, whether we could attend and if so at what level.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and so we got no answer, and so it ended up, of course, I was acting economic counselor at the time, and so I was sent as the American representative to this occasion sorta thing.  And so it was notable for me personally in that, of course, in the--in the reception--in the so-called reception line, of course when all of the people from the embassies were lined up, you know, to, to meet him, and of course my being only a, a lower rank person, not an ambassador, I was sort of in the second row behind the, the front row sorta thing.  And so, so I was having to tiptoe, you know, to look over their shoulders because he was very short sorta thing, tiptoe to look over the shoulders of, of, of the--of him coming down the line sorta thing.  And I was suddenly--as I was trying to look over their shoulders, I was suddenly aware of a hand coming out from, from between the two people in front of me and he--you know, he reached out to, to, to shake my hand sorta thing.  And so I'm not sure what was his reason for doing that because he didn't shake hands in the second row with anybody else there sorta thing.  I don't know whether he, he knew I was--whether he thought I was an American--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or the American or, or whatever, and so, of course, there was never any explanation for it.  But any rate, I thought it, it, it was notable for, for me as the case may be.  And so as I sometime tell my colleagues, this is the hand that shook the hand of Deng Xiaoping, leader of a billion Chinese sorta thing, but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But any rate--but that--that's a, a small thing--
Story_ID: 261412
Speaker 1: I was also involved in, in, in--heavily involved in, in getting even American movies back into [Kingdom of] Thailand after they--after the Thai had effectively banned them sorta thing by, by--we, we had--using the, the technique of, of, of a charity film event, I had arranged that--I mean, the Thai government had contended, you know, the Thai were no longer interested in American movies and, therefore, it was no reason to, to lift the tariff barriers that, that would let American films back in.  So, so any rate, in, in cooperation with the representative of the American Film Institute [AFI] and, of course, the, the American Embassy Wives' group, we put on a, a charity film event.  And so I--so I brought in 'Star Wars' and James Bond and all thing--pictures like this, and so we, we--there was almost a, a--almost a riot in, in front of the major--the major Thai movie houses downtown in, in Thailand.  You know, people were lining up for blocks and blocks to, to get in to see these pictures.  And so, this in effect tore down that, that part of the--of, of the--of the argument.  But--but, so, so my work was much more routine there in, in, in Thailand, as I said visiting the major parts of Thailand.  But, but I learned a lot about the economics of, of, of development there, which I had thought that I would be able, of course, to very usefully apply to my next assignment there.  And I was--I had first--going back a bit, I had earlier been, been, been assigned--given orders assigning me to, to go to South Africa, and I was acting economic counselor at the time.  And as it turned out, the, the economic counselor who was coming out there had obtained a promise from the state department [U.S. Department of State] that I would remain there at least six months because he had no area experience, that I would remain there at least six months, you know, after he had arrived sorta thing.  So the ambassador got this chance to go to South Africa cancelled, so this is my second chance of, of missing going to South Africa.  But any rate, but I, I had perhaps my most successful tour there in Thailand in that I became fairly well known as a person to see for anyone who wants to talk about the banking community and finance, and in fact I--as part of my job, I, I--it was my task to publish a, a trends report, which all embassies do, and they're usually pretty dry, economic data material.  But I, I, I turned it into in effect a, a report card on, on, on the Thai economy, which I didn't know that much about it, but I knew lots of Thai who were going to American schools I wouldn't have dared applied to sorta thing.  And so--and so I, I had a network of these people who really wanted to help the economy who didn't dare make criticisms of their government themselves sorta thing.  And so I for, for some time or the time I was there, I sorta put this material together in my trends report, you know, and made some rather stiff criticism of, of government policy, not enough to get me in trouble but still enough to make, you know, some people angry and, and some people take notice.  And so I think that was my--perhaps my--one of my better accomplishments there at the time, so people were, were giving me credit for knowing a lot more about economics than I actually knew, but it's a case, you know, of, of knowing the people who did know about it and being able to put their thoughts in writing.
Story_ID: 261413
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your next assignment, I believe in 1981, the Central African Republic, correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You said that this is where you really be--encountered some serious racism.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: I mean, I, I, I would first make, make certain that for the--for the most part, I considered my, my [U.S.] Foreign Service colleagues, you know, as, as, as perhaps being the least affected by racism of any service.  Perhaps the [U.S.] Army has done better more recently, but at the time that I came into it, I think it, it, it was the most--the least affected, you know, by any overt signs of racism, and I've enjoyed my work with the overwhelming majority of the people I've worked with all these years.  And so up to that point, it had been my assumption that there wasn't a Foreign Service officer that I couldn't work with or for.  And, of course I found out differently there at--when I came to the Central African Republic.  And I came there with--right after getting there--I mean going back a bit, the Central African Republic of course was--is a country almost about the size of, of France, and it had undergone some, some terrific mismanagement in, in the just previous years under, under [Jean-Bedel] Bokassa.  In fact, he had declared himself emperor and absolutely ran the, the economy into the--into the ground.  Now, many African countries regardless of what you did, there's nothing that you could do to help them.  But for the Central African Republic, it had the makings of a self-sufficient country.  It had resources, agricultural land, and it wasn't overpopulated.  But the economy had been run into the ground and, and each, each, each year up until the year that I got there, the, the gross domestic product of the country had, had declined.  And so based upon my, my own experience there in [Kingdom of] Thailand working with development and seeing two other economies, both Egypt and [Republic of] Zaire, having gone into the tank by mismanagement, I saw perhaps an opportunity in the Central African Republic to, to do something useful and just perhaps--just perhaps make a difference.
Story_ID: 261414
Speaker 1: And so, of course, I was assigned there as the deputy chief of mission or the deputy, deputy to, to the ambassador [Arthur H. Woodruff].  And I immediately got into a program of consultations with local people there.  The head of the United Nations Development Programme [UNDP] office there was, was a--was a black American and, and I learned from him, you know, that the economy had gone so badly that there was nothing left of any previous economic program in the country.  And talking about-beginning consultations with Central, Central Africans.  In fact, there were--there were three American--I mean, what's, what's the business degree?
Speaker 2: M.B.A.s.
Speaker 1: M.B.A.  There, there, there were three American M.B.A.s in, in, in the country.  One of them was the--was the ministry of finance--minister of finance and, and, and another handled the, the, the commodity stabilization program in which all the commodities or basic commodities such as cotton and so forth were, were, were marketed through him, and then of course another fella, head of the chamber of commerce, and so begin consultations with, with these fellows.  And, and of course the other aid giving countries along with the fact that we have been authorized to restart our own aid, aid program there in the Central African Republic, I, I thought that this was a, a good laboratory for showing, you know, that market-driven reforms plus accountability can turn an African country around and make it if not prosperous, at least self-supporting.  And so I gradually began widening my circle of contacts, I mean, for, for other international organizations that were anywhere involved there in, in, in the Central African Republic and the World Bank, and other aid-giving countries, you know.  None of them had lots of money to put into Central African Republic, but by--as I saw it, by each of our, you know, beginning to coordinate our efforts, we could perhaps get, get a dollar together, but a dollar was all the, the economy could absorb at that point.  And so I was able to begin to get a start there, but I, I was also running into an increasing amount of perversity from my ambassador, who always on, on the surface would claim that he--that he supported what I was doing at first, but increasingly making it more difficult to, to get anything done.  And--
Speaker 2: Why do you think he was making things so difficult?
Speaker 1: When, when, when as I--when as I said, as, as, as I--as I was developing this--I mean, part of it was that he had--a, a mutual friend of ours had helped put him there and, but apparently, my being put there was, was, was part of the deal, and, and, and he didn't like it.  He resented it sorta thing.  So I think part of it was that, that, that he wanted to show or try to prove, you know, that I couldn't handle the job, and he had a stake in being able to, to prove that.  And yet I think in my--in what I was doing, I think I was--I think I, I was showing a bit more moxie than, than he was.
Story_ID: 261415
Speaker 1: Also, there was this, this--I mean, with the local society there [Central African Republic] and as much as--of course, most of the local officials and the French embassy, of course, were the main foreign group there, and so most of the, you know, informal parties, they were there for French embassy and--what do you call, co-operants.  The--these are French officials who had been paid to come to do, you know, different jobs there in, in the Central African Republic.  And I attended a few of them, and too many of them were--the, the principal form of amusement was, was telling Central African horror stories, you know, of, of, of--you know, most of these people, of course, worked in bureaus and, of course, they liked to make fun in gest, you know, at the incompetence of the--of, of the Central Africans, you know, that they were, were working with, and more commonly ending up with "What can you expect of people just, just out of the trees?"  Now, this is not necessarily telling stories out of school since at all these parties there were at least a half a dozen waiters and servants, you know, who were there to, to, to get drinks or whatever at--on, on request.  And most of 'em, of course, understood French.  And I, I, I began to, to watch them as what sorta reaction they had to some of these stories sorta thing, and, and, and I certainly detected, you know, the fact that, you know, some of the worse ones, you know, their, their eyes would slowly meet each other sorta thing, you know, just to note that they--that they were taking note of all that was, was happening there and sorta thing.  So anyway, I, myself, began to stop going to these parties and I spent more, more and more of my time with Central African officials whom I, I felt, you know, whom could make a difference.  Now, I felt that the [U.S.] ambassador [Arthur H. Woodruff] when meeting with Central African officials tended to patronize 'em, you know, but, but, but not do much of any straight talking.  All the criticism, of course, was, was at these sort of occasions.  And so my approach was entirely different.  I, I talked straight to them, you know, when, when I had some criticism to make of 'em, you know, I, I guess what I called the tough love approach, you know, that, that, you know, these are things that, that, you know, we have to overcome if we're gonna do anything here.  And I think that I was beginning to make a sizeable amount of, of progress in, in this direction as shown by several signs. One of 'em early was the fact that, for instance, of course my wife [Lydia Armstrong Ellison], of course was--used to--used to teach, teach English as a second language, in fact, at all the posts that we were--we were in.  And so on this occasion, she also taught young priests, Central African priests, aspiring priests, and so through this mechanism, we met the senior Central African (unclear) there in, in Central African Republic, a chap called Archbishop [Joachim] N'Dayen.  And he--we became friends and we, we--he invited us to dinner and I invited him back and we became, of course, good friends.  But how this connection developed, he always talked extensively with, with servants wherever he went, you know, wherever he was invited to go sorta thing, and we always tended to, to, of course, treat the people who worked for us very well, and so I think he, he essentially followed that old biblical, you know, rule--how's it go?  As--
Speaker 2: Do unto others as you've--
Speaker 1: As you have done to the least of these my brother and ye have also done unto me [Matthew 25:40].  And, and so--and, and so--and, of course, he also liked classical music and I had a, a fairly sizeable classic music collection sorta thing.  And so he became so informal that he would drop by the house--I mean, we all lived--I, I mean, I, I lived in a house right on the Ubangi River, and so a number of the houses on the river, he lived further up the river, and so he would stop at any time just, just to come in and--you know, even if--whether we were there--whether I was there or not, you know, go into my--the music room and, and, and listen to music.  But any rate, this was the basis, of course, of having long conversations with him and, of course, and through him, talking to other Central African people sorta thing.  And so I think through this very informal but highly directed method, you know, I, I, I still called shirt sleeve conferences often over my dinner table, you know, way into the--into the middle of the night or late afternoon, that I was beginning to make some progress, you know, in--just perhaps in turning things around.
Story_ID: 261416
Speaker 1: Now, of course, you can't be sure.  There in Africa, you know, it for instance--just some little incident could, could, could make things go haywire there, but, but, but--
Speaker 2: So was the [U.S.] ambassador [Arthur H. Woodruff] starting to feel threatened by your--
Speaker 1: When, when I--
Speaker 2: --relationships?
Speaker 1: Possibly.  I, I, I--I'm sure later on in that--I, I, I think he had decided to, to, to get rid of me early, which he eventually did, and--
Speaker 2: How long were you supposed to be in the Central African Republic?  How long was your assignment [as a U.S. Foreign Service officer]?
Speaker 1: When--it, it would've been at, at, at least two, probably three years, and, and, and it ended up being just a year.  But, but, but I, I want to, to emphasize a, a series of events there in that, I guess along about March of, of, of going into my second year there, there had been supposedly an attempted coup against the, the government, supposedly by several people [sic. General Francois Bozize] of a political party [Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People] trying to seize a, a, a broadcast station.  And the government had overreacted by going after many of the people of the party who knew nothing about this and who were, see, substantial figures there in the--in, in the country, school teachers and, you know, business people and so forth.  And it so happened that there was a, a, a Baha'i missionary there in, in, in the country who was a, a descendent, I'm not quite sure what the lineage was of, of, of [President Abraham] Lincoln.  He was--he, he--this chap's name was Albert Lincoln.  And, of course, he was superbly educated both in the [United] States and France, sorta thing, but the--but his, his religious faith told him to, to go to the Central African Republic and he dutifully did.  I mean, he could've earned a hell of a lot of money at a lot of, of different places, but he was told to go there and serve and so--and so he did.  And, of course, I, I, I learned about him first before I even went there since my sister [Jane Ellison] was a--was a, a, a fairly close friend of his mother.  And, and so I, I met his mother before going to the post sorta thing.  So, so, therefore, I was--became--become acquainted with him.  But any rate, Albert Lincoln had a law practice there in, in, in Central African Republic, plus he taught law there at the--at the university.  But, but since some of his clients were, were being set upon by the government, he--you know, he attempted to, you know, to, to, to represent them to keep the government from un- illegally, unlawfully divesting them of their property and even lives sorta thing.  And, and, and the government turned on him when, when he used to own his law office, raided his law office and took his records sorta thing.  And the, the [U.S.] ambassador [Arthur C. Woodruff] properly, properly enough saw the, the minister of justice and, and, and left a strong note, which I later heard was, was absolutely insulting and, and he came back to the embassy and announced he's going on home leave to the States, and my most important job while he's gone was to protect Lincoln, and, and then he subsequently got on the plane and, and went to the States.
Story_ID: 261417
Speaker 1: But things were, were still pretty much in turmoil there and I--my fear was, was, was that they would arrest Lincoln, mistreat him or, or expel him from, from the country.  And so I--so I begin working on this problem through a, a new close contact I had there in the government.  And meanwhile, I, I even left my personal car in front of Lincoln's house, you know, as a symbol.  This man is under the protection of the U.S. government, you know, sorta thing.  But, but, but any rate, after a couple of--couple of days, I think I had extracted the, the promise that Lincoln would not be harmed or, or, or sent out of the country.  But any rate, so there was--there was this one evening in which I visited him and, and his--the, the parents of his wife was--were also visiting him there in the country, and so when, when he left, I decided--I, I, I decided to take his parents back to the hotel on, on my way back home that night, and took them to the hotel that was back on this river road headed to my residence, and I was stopped at, at a road block by two Central African soldiers.  And, of course, by diplomatic practice, they were supposed to leave, not bother--you know, cars with diplomatic plates on 'em.  But, I don't know whether you perhaps heard, of course, young soldiers, young, undisciplined, and untrained soldiers are, are the bane of Africa sorta thing, and so--
Speaker 2: So what happened when they stopped you?
Speaker 1: And I was getting to that.  When, when, when they stopped and, and ordered me out of the car, and, and, of course, told me to open the trunk, which, which I shouldn't've had to do.  And, and then--and, and then they--then, the soldier on the other side ordered my wife [Lydia Armstrong Ellison] out of the car.  And we had a car in which the, the latch was clear to the edge of the door (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 261418
Speaker 1: What happened, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], after you were pulled over, what happened?
Speaker 2: When the, the soldier on the other side of the car after--when my wife [Lydia Armstrong Ellison] was trying to get out of the car to, to, to follow his instructions, he possibly mistook, you know, her move to reach for the latch as a move to the glove compartment.  So he--so he, he put a round in his rifle and stuck it directly in my--in my wife's face.  And, as I--as I said, this is a very ticklish moment with, with these, these young guys 'cause you, you never know whether they're gonna shoot or not sorta thing, so I had to handle this very warily, get, get, get over there and get in between them, you know, and, and show, you know, that, you know, that, that she met nothing wrong by, by, by trying to open the door, and so I finally got him calmed down.  And so I usually avoid anger in, in my dealing with people, but the next morning, of course, I, I, I went both to the [U.S.] Embassy [Bangui, Central African Republic] the next morning and found out that in fact all people in my embassy had been harassed in the same way that, that--the previous night.
Speaker 1: And why do you think--why was this happening?
Speaker 2: When, when--as it turned out, there had, had been a rumor that, that people who were trying to, to pull off a cue- a, a coup were bringing arms into the country and, and, and that that was a, a, a foreign embassy who was doing this, and it was supposedly another African embassy that was doing this.  Now, I don't know whether they could've assumed, you know, that since I was black I was from another African embassy or, or the fact that--I mean, you never know how these things get translated.  They did see that I had diplomatic plates and, and so that was perhaps the, the reason enough.  Now, of course, the other people on my staff were white and they were also being harassed and stopped that night.  But any rate, so--
Speaker 1: What were some of the other racial incidents that took place when you were in Central African Republic?
Speaker 2: When, when, when--I was just getting this, I guess trying to, to, to bring it down.  But any rate, I, I did raise a bit of hell the next morning and, and, and, in fact, apparently people in the--in the foreign minister--ministry realized, you know, that, that, that if, if one of the people had shot the wife of the--of an American diplomat, you know, that it would've been the, the wrong thing to do.  And so the whole thing was, was put on ice, the troops were taken off of the, the street, and so, so I got the--that situation settled as well as the situation about [Albert] Lincoln settled sorta thing.  And I ended up even getting a, a commendation from the department of--as to the way the thing was, was, was handled.  And so--but any rate, when the [U.S.] ambassador [Arthur H. Woodruff] came back, I think he had--in my view, he had had perhaps thought, you know, I would fall on my face and this would be a reason to have me recalled and in fact I got a commendation out of it.
Story_ID: 261419
Speaker 1: He  used a, a, a--another set up in, in that the, the long--the preplanned change of embassy hours, which the previous embassy hours were horribly inefficient and was costing us extra money, and so I told the [U.S.] ambassador [Arthur H. Woodruff] even before he left, you know, showed him the--a, a paper that a visiting admin officer had done, you know, that these hours have to be changed and that, that only--and when the new admin officer got here, we would change the hours.  But any rate, the new admin officer was difficult to work with, and so there was some turmoil there when he got back.  Any rate, he used this as an excuse to have me--have me recalled since he, he says that I came in one morning out of the clear blue sky and decided to change the embassy work hours, and the--he came in and found the embassy in chaos when he--when he got back and that one of the third--one of the very essential third country employees--I mean, these were third country--I mean, we used very often throughout Africa, Europeans and other people fill in staff positions, and that, that, that she--that she quit as a result of that.  Of course as a--of course, that was a lie and as much as her husband was leaving and she was quitting anyway, but he used this as an excuse to have me recalled, and so--
Speaker 2: And were you in fact recalled?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  I, I--
Speaker 2: You were.
Speaker 1: --I was.
Speaker 2: And so that was in 1982, so you were recalled back to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Back, back to Washington, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And what did you do for--
Speaker 1: When--I was--
Speaker 2: --the state department [U.S. Department of State]?
Speaker 1: When, when--I--on my first consultations, I, I talked to an, an administrative employee whom I had known for some reason, I told him what--he asked me what happened and I told him.  And he said when he was not surprised since this same ambassador had told a close friend before--even before he even met me that he would not long put up with a, a, a black DCM [deputy chief of mission].  And furthermore, I, I, I had--by then, I'd had a--an efficiency report, which was entirely fallacious and I, I showed it to another officer who knew us both, you know, and he told me, you gonna have to, to grieve this--I mean, go through the grievance procedure with this or you're dead.  I mean, you're--not only are you gonna have, have to go to the grievance position, you're, you're gonna have to win it or you're dead.  And so--it, it was a long story there.  But any rate, I did grieve it, and plus another one that the same ambassador sent in, which would--after I left, which would cover the couple of months not covered by the previous one and--
Speaker 2: And were you successful in your grievance?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And it came out on your end?
Speaker 1: When, when the--it ended up with them withdrawing to the--completely the two grievance reports from my file. And, and--but that did not end the problem since I had to get another job and, and the--and, and, and, of course--I mean, if these two efficiency reports had stayed in my file, I would've had to leave the [U.S. Foreign] Service because of, of, of that.  But I did manage to, to prove them absolutely wrong.  But having them pull from my file did not solve the problem since there were other people in the department who thought that, that I had to be killed off by, by not giving me another job.  And so there was a period there in which I was sent constantly out for interviews and had great interviews and then come back later, I was refused the job because they were checking with someone in the Bureau of African Affairs, and they were being told that I was incompetent.
Story_ID: 261420
Speaker 1: But any rate, the, the personnel officers stuck with me and had me paneled for this job in, in Geneva [Switzerland], and this caused a bit of, of, of an uproar in, in that both the assistant secretary--assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs [Gregory J. Newell] protested to the director general as well as the post in Geneva protected to the--protested to the director general to have this assignment changed.
Speaker 2: But you did eventually get the assignment.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when, when--I said, she--both of them are real heroes for me in that she insisted that I get the assignment.
Speaker 2: And that was in 1984?
Speaker 1: Yeah, just--yeah.
Speaker 2: And so you were in Geneva until--for how long?
Speaker 1: Until eighty--eighty--'88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Okay, and what were you responsibilities in Geneva?  What was your title?
Speaker 1: When, when--I was the working level representative to the United Nations Conference for Trade and, and Development [sic. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)], and it was one of the two UN [United Nations] organizations in which we were highly critical at the point in--at a point in time.  UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] was the other one because we felt that it had been taken over by third world radicals, and UNCTAD as the--this organization is known, was created against our, our, our wishes, but it was done anyway.  And we, we, we quit UNESCO, but since UNCTAD was part of the UN budget, we, we, we couldn't quit that and so that's the only reason that someone was sent to, to cover the job.  And, of course, the, the, the task was that, that I was to--I was to work for reform of UNCTAD.  And, again, to try, try to make the, the story shorter, in, in two years, I was credited with having gotten sizeable reforms there plus outstanding efficiency reports, and so that sufficiently countered the, the opposition to my getting a job, that I was--that I was incompetent.  In fact, I even got a, a meritorious honor award for, for, for the job.  And, of course, I got a, a--it's a--it's there in the next room if you--if you wanna look at it.  But any rate--but I was--I would like to, of course, point out, of course, that when I was--when the pressure was against me, of course, it, it was--also had a, a sizeable effect on my--on, on my family 'cause, you know, they were getting toward the end of their high school and into their, their college years.  And, of course, if I'd been--of course, find myself without a job, then that would've had a major effect on, on, on them.  The girls were all in a private school there at the time, which I put 'em into while overseas, and so I insisted even after being sent back to the [United] States for this period, my allowances stopped and I had to go--go into debt to, to keep them in, in, in school.  But, but any rate, getting--when I did get to, to Geneva at least, I, I--of course, I did keep my job and at least got some allowances back, and so successfully got them through their high school as well as their colleges, which was, was also a bit expensive.
Story_ID: 261421
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ollie B.] Ellison [Sr.], you know, when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?  Not necessarily professionally, but just when you look back at your entire life.
Speaker 2: When--I have pretty much done--I mean, of course, I started out as I mentioned before, wanting to become a doctor and I'm, I'm, I'm happy that I, I didn't, and, and, and as I said, it was strange in that I did not become a doctor because of this--the score in freshman English.  And, and so I, I ended up--I ended up with a job that I had to practically perfect my writing.  So my--I--in the [U.S.] Foreign Service, you, you live by your writing sorta thing, and so I've been credited with being a, a, a, good writer.  In fact, some people have even asked me whether I--whether I was related to, to Ralph Ellison or not, so--I'm not but still, we're even from the same hometown [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], so that was the, the reason that some, some, some asked.  But any rate, I became a, a good writer and the, the Foreign Service is to me--I mean, the combination of the [U.S.] military service--I was a career reserve officer and, of course, I didn't reach all the objectives in, in the [U.S.] Army Reserve that I wanted to.  I did get to--get--did reach the point of, of light colonel in the Army Reserve, and this had a real play on my--on my living there in, in, in Bremen [West Germany; Bremen, Germany] in that I was most active when I was there in, in Bremen.  And some few people were, were--who were connected with the Army, of course, I, I, I was even invited to military gatherings there in, in, in Bremen sorta thing.  And so I've pretty much achieved what I consider an interesting life between the military and the Foreign Service.  And although I've had some difficult periods that I've just mentioned, that I, I, I almost lost it all, but still I survived it and I didn't reach the, the heights of the--of the--of the field as an ambassador or anything, but I'm pretty happy with the life I lived.
Story_ID: 261422
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I should've had a chance to think about that one for, for, for a while.
Speaker 1: What is it that you want people to say about you when you're no longer here?
Speaker 2: Well, pretty much, I would say I've--I, I lived a, a--pretty much a fruitful and honest life.  I--I've, I've--I could always say that I've never had to do anything in my life which I considered dishonest or I've achieved goals in it that at the start I, I, I didn't dream of getting to, although at the end, I think I could--I coulda and should've done even better, sorta thing.  And so I'm--I, I think with a [U.S.] Foreign Service life, you, you, you live several lifetimes in one, in that you, you go from place to place and you stay there long enough to become involved in, in the life of the country and the people sorta thing, and, and, and I think in this sense, I have developed a perspective as, as, as a world citizen, if you will, and I've enjoyed it tremendously.
