Story_ID: 131154
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but I'll--we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Lillian, L-I-L-L-I-A-N Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Can you give us her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Lillian Cotry last name is spelled C-O-T-R-Y
Speaker 1: C-O-T-R-Y that's Cotry, okay, all right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She's--age I believe--and women are secretive but I think she's eighty-eight as we speak you gentlemen do the math.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: All right now what do you know about your mother's side of the family in terms of your ancestors.  First of all, how far back can you trace your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was part Indian, my great grandmother was believed to have been a full Indian.  I cannot go beyond the great grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay do you know what Indian group they were apart of?
Speaker 2: Cherokees.
Speaker 1: Okay so there are no stories past down in your family about slavery or reconstruction on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, no.
Speaker 1: Okay any other family stories?
Speaker 2: No my father's side--my father's father was from Tennessee--Lebanon, Tennessee who was known to be a rebellious person who married a Indian and I think that's what most of fire comes from, my father's side.
Speaker 1: Now before we get to your father's side, I want to talk about your mother's side some more.  So you knew your grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Very well
Speaker 1: All right did you know both grandparents or just your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I knew both parents--both grandmothers.  I--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: I mean your mother's side.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: I knew both
Speaker 1: Both okay well--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Feisty ladies
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: And no-nonsense women who were very much in charge.  During the period of time that I lived, they were absent that of a husband but they were known as survivors and my great-grandmother at that time would always sit and talk to me biblically speaking and admonishing me in that order.  My grandmother was from the Church of God in Christ and she did the same.  So the apples don't fall too far from that side to me.
Speaker 1: Okay now what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: They were just housewives; they were not people to go to work.  After coming to Chicago [Illinois] from Mississippi they became women who were kind of house ladies to take care of other homes and they would bring those dollars home to that of my mother and I understand that that's how they survived.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so they never talked about Mississippi much?
Speaker 2: They never talked about Mississippi.  Mississippi seemed to have been a place where everybody at that time wanted to leave and not have response as to its history.
Speaker 1: So your impression of it was pretty negative?
Speaker 2: It was pretty negative at that time.  What I did learn, it was a place to be from.
Speaker 1: Okay but not to necessarily want to go back--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Nobody wanted to go back.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Not even to visit.
Story_ID: 131155
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Lillian Cotry Bailey] grow up in Mississippi or in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: My mother came to Chicago at a very early age I'm told and thusly meeting my father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.].  And as a result they married.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: You know I really don't know, we've asked many times but we have not gotten clarity as to their meeting.  My father was previously married to a very lovely lady and she died at a very young age and I'm understanding that my father was devastated as a result and it was my mother who came into his life who was consoling and compassionate.  And as a result they dated and later married.
Speaker 1: Okay now did your mother talk about growing up in Chicago and--where did she go to school here and what did she--how did she--what was her personality like as she grew up in Chicago?
Speaker 2: My mother I'm told was a loner, very close to the family.  She met my father--did not have loving feelings for him but just was compassionate at that time and they grew to love one another.  My father encouraged my mother to stay at home but my mother wanted to work.  Of course, they got married and they kind of did a swapping off of jobs.  My father worked at one time and sometimes my mother would work.  My father in later years became employed by that of a testing lane.  Years ago in Chicago they used to have a testing lane that was on the South Side located around 39th Street.  All automobiles had to, at that time, be tested.  You could not drive an automobile without that certification.  My father worked there for numerous years and did very well with his employment.  My mother didn't have to work during that period unless she wanted to work.  We came up believing that the sole responsibility of a family rest with that of the father.  If a mother wanted to work, so be it and to God give the glory but did not have to work.  It was noted that she would stay at home and make sure that the house was appeasing and that the children were well taken care of.  My father then went on to work in other venues.  He then became employed for the City of Chicago with the Board of Election Commissioners office and he was a machine operator which means that they would break down the machines and put up voting machines and set them up for elections.  My father worked there until retirement.
Speaker 1: Okay can you give us some dates on some of these activities?  When did he work as an inspector for cars?
Speaker 2: Oh that was at an early age for me, I think I must have been around the age of twelve or thirteen at that given time. And--
Speaker 1: Okay so this is like in the early '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yes if not before.
Speaker 1: Yeah late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Yes he worked for the Board of Election [Commissioners] until he retired in, I think, the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay so he was--he worked for the Board of Education during the--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Board of Election Commissioners.
Speaker 1: Yeah Board of Election Commissioners during the, I guess the reign of Richard [J.] Daley then.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Story_ID: 131156
Speaker 1: Did--I wanted to ask about--we don't even know his name yet, but I was trying to ask you about your mother [Lillian Cotry Bailey] growing up.  What neighborhood did she grow up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well at that time she grew up on the South Side of the city in the 43rd Street area and they didn't move around very much.  I remember her living east on 43rd near Langley [Avenue] and then later my father and mother moved to 43rd and Forrestville [Avenue] in the Frank Lloyd Wright's building [Francis Apartments, 4304 Forrestville Avenue] which was right there--(simultaneous)(unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay but she grew up around 43rd Street?
Speaker 2: Oh yes in that 43rd Street area.  All of our knowledge came from that area.
Speaker 1: Okay now did she get a chance to finish high school and all that?
Speaker 2: She did not at that time finish high school.  I understand in later years she went back to school and did so.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. I think a lot of the students that went to DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] or [Wendell] Phillips [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]--did she go to Phillips?
Speaker 2: I believe it was DuSable.
Speaker 1: Okay well tell me what is your father's full name and can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Adolphus, A-D-O-L-P-H-U-S, J for Jerome, Bailey, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay now I neglected to ask you this but did your mother come from a large family or a small family?
Speaker 2: My mother came from a small family.  She had, I believe, three sisters and three brothers, of which all have deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay what about your father, did he have a large family?
Speaker 2: My father had a large family and all of them have also deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Off the top of my head I could not tell you.  My father died February 12, 1978 on my birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have any idea how old he was when he died?
Speaker 2: He was eighty-seven years of age.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Lebanon, Tennessee
Speaker 1: Okay and that's near Nashville?
Speaker 2: That's like twenty-five miles on the other side of Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay now what do you know about your father's ancestors?  How far back can you trace your father's ancestors?
Speaker 2: My father was a very quiet person who did not believe in speaking often.  He was like E.F. Hutton, when he did speak everybody listened including my mother.  I know that his experience in the South was distasting to him.  He went to the [U.S.] Army and rather than to go back South, he came to Chicago and when we would speak of the South, it was distasting to my father.  He never spoke nor wanted to speak of the South.
Speaker 1: Now--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I suggested that he go back for a visit and his response was, "I've lost nothing there and I don't want to go back to find anything."
Story_ID: 131157
Speaker 1: Now was he a veteran of World War II?
Speaker 2: He [father Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] was a veteran of World War I.
Speaker 1: One? Okay, all right. Okay, so yeah I guess he would be, yes that's right.  He's eighty-seven in '78 [1978].  So did he talk about World War I at all?
Speaker 2: It was distasting also to him and I think much of my philosophy in life has come strongly from my father's perspective.  He did not see the sensibilities of war.  He did as he was commanded to do but never understood the bias the racial concepts that were going on at that time in the army.  At that time blacks were discriminated against and separated from the white army partners, if you will.  So it was hard for him to understand that and after getting out of the war, he wanted to travel but there were some places that he could not travel because of his skin color.  And it left a bitter taste in my father that he would fight for this country and not be able to enjoy the luxuries thereof.
Speaker 1: Did he ever discuss [President] Woodrow Wilson or--would he ever respond--they talk about the four freedoms and Woodrow Wilson trying to bring democracy to the world and that sort of thing and the contradiction of having a segregated army and discrimination over here?
Speaker 2: He would talk about the hypocrisy of those persons who sat in government saying one thing but the evidence thereof was not according to their philosophies.  My father as he came along was a politician.  He admired President [Harry S.] Truman because he said Truman brought a thing called hope to the African American community and that was the first president that I've ever heard my father applaud.  As a politician, I have never seen a man who worked so hard to see that a person was put into office and if Truman said anything, it represented law to my father.
Speaker 1: Okay so he did admire--And Truman desegregated the armed forces after World War II.  Did your father ever talk about any specific incidence in his--during his service that angered him or did he just speak in generalities about it?  Did he ever talk about something really that happened to him?
Speaker 2: He was mute; he didn't want to discuss the Army.  It left such a bitterness with him as it did with the South.  Those two topic subjects were mute with him.  It was like I don't want to talk about it, I don't to discuss it, and he would often say, "You're going to live far better than I did and you're going to live far better as a result of my teaching you the future.  I want you to forget about the things of the past that I came up under."  My father was a person that said what he meant and meant what he said.  It was not to be discussed so you never took it back to him again.
Story_ID: 131158
Speaker 1: Okay, we often hear this, that people--parents and grandparents don't talk to them about discrimination in the South and how bad it was or how bad the [U.S.] Army was and other things that we know from reading just general history it had to be pretty bad experiences.  Did you have anything--well any thoughts as to why people just didn't talk about those things at all?  I mean we--seems like we've lost a lot history.
Speaker 2: I think a lot of them were because of hurt and they did not want to do transfer hurt to the children.  An example being, when I was young and I think I must have been about seventeen years of age, I was scheduled to go to Memphis, Tennessee with a choral group on a tour.  My father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] gave me death silence about it.  My mother [Lillian Cotry Bailey] was partly happy that I was selected to go but my father, I could tell in his eyes there was something wrong at this point and a fear was there.  My mother told me your father really don't want you to go.  I spoke with him and he said be careful, just be careful and he obligated me to call him every day that was the deal, I had to call him every day and I complied with that.  I went to Memphis and at that time I was in for a rude awakening.  I wanted to swim, I could not swim when I wanted to because the swimming pool at that time certain days were delegated for whites while certain other days they said coloreds could swim.  I did not understand that because Chicago [Illinois] at that time was beyond that.  I would call my father and tell my father about that and I didn't know that as a result of my telling my father that he was more than anxious for me to come home.  I later found out that blacks could not go to the show unless they went into the balconies.  I did not do that because I did not see the sensibilities of that and war arose in me, bitterness got into me and of course my father knew that.  I did not understand what it meant for me to want a drink of water and go and see the signs that said "Coloreds," "White Only."  I did not understand that, I related that on to my father.
Speaker 1: How old were you when that--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was somewhere about sixteen or seventeen years of age.  In Chicago we were sheltered from much of this.  We did not understand what bigotry was and segregation; we didn't understand any of that.
Speaker 1: So this is the mid-'50s [1950s] when--this was in the height of segregation and the Civil Rights Movement had just started in the South.
Speaker 2: Yes and to go into a restaurant and be served in the rear, I did not understand that.  My father's last conversation with me was, "Come home."  After coming home my father said, "I told your mother that you were too much like me to go into the South."  The proof in the pudding was right there before me, I didn't understand that.  And looking back in retrospect, I understand what it means when they say an apple don't fall too far from the tree.
Story_ID: 131159
Speaker 1: Well tell me about growing up.  What neighborhood did you grow up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right there at 43rd [Street] and South Forrestville [Avenue] which was then deemed as the eye of the ghetto.  We could not travel east beyond Cottage Grove [Avenue], 63rd  [Street] South, Wentworth [Avenue] on the west and 31st on the north.  The only way you could cross over Cottage Grove at that time, you had to have a uniform on indicating that you were going to work.  I did not understand that but the pleasantries of our home indicated that all was well.  We didn't have any difficulties, there were only three schools.  There was DuSable [High School], Wendell Phillips [Academy High School] and Dunbar [Vocational High School] represented vocational training.  Dunbar at that time was a highly sophisticated school where the young folk dealt with yes sir, no sir, please, may I, thank you and excuse me under a gentleman by the name of Campbell.  I think it was Bill Campbell if I'm not mistaken.  I admired the dictates of his premise there.  I knew at that time there was something beyond Dunbar, beyond Wendell Phillips and beyond DuSable and my father said I want you to get an education that other people are getting.  As a result, my father gave me a friend's address and at that time I went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  When I would get off of the train-the El if you will, a policeman would have to escort me to the facility and that's what I learned was the difference between the teaching in schools.  When I would come home from Englewood and sat on the stoop and compared what was going on in other schools with my rappies if you will, I found out that there was something wrong.  I was ahead and they were sort of in the rear which means that other folk were learning while we were bringing up the rear.
Speaker 1: Okay now I want to go back a little further, we always ask questions about early childhood and all that, not just high school.  But what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights were pleasurable.  We didn't have a frame of reference.  My father would insist that we would go to the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois], the [John G. Shedd] Aquarium and other places of great culture.  But it seemed to have also been a dominant factor in the community for blues for jazz and not very much beyond that except education.  That was all that was on the table.  I chose to learn more about the process of education.  My brother, a minister now, decided to go the jazz route another brother went the blues route.  In addition to much of that came in a little flare called gospel music which latched on to me.
Story_ID: 131160
Speaker 1: Now what church did your family go to?
Speaker 2: When I was a child, I went to Christ Temple Cathedral Church which was a Holiness church [Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.] located at 44th [Street] and St. Lawrence [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  I gave my heart to the Lord at the age of twelve and have not looked back since.
Speaker 1: What is meant by a Holiness temple, what is that?
Speaker 2: A Holiness church was a denomination that came about in early, early, early years by a gentleman by the name of C.P. Jones [Charles Price Jones] and a partner by the name of [Charles Harrison] Mason.  They divided company in later years, Mason formed the Churches of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Okay are these both African Americans?
Speaker 2: Yes, I tend to lean toward the Holiness and I stayed with the Holiness denomination but those were the first African American denominations to come about.
Speaker 1: Well in the-in what sense? What are you saying?
Speaker 2: African American, see others came from the white culture.  The Baptists, the Methodists and some of the others came from the white cultures.  Holiness and the Churches of God in Christ were black-orientated.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: The origin.
Speaker 1: All right the A.M.E. Church was African Methodist Episcopal but--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: They came out of the Methodists.  The Methodist was brought forth by whites.  The true African denominations were Holiness and the Churches of God in Christ.  Everything else came from the white community.
Story_ID: 131161
Speaker 1: We were talking about the origin of the Holiness Church.  So when was the Holiness Church [Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.] founded?
Speaker 2: I have no memory of that.  There's been so many years ago but I have a love for the roots of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember Dr. Cather [ph.] who preached not liken unto any other minister and his first name escapes me and then it went down to Jacob--Dr. Jacob Haywood who convinced me through his ministry there was another way to look at this thing and under his ministry I gave my heart to the Lord and I've never looked back.
Speaker 1: Now how old were you when you did that?
Speaker 2: I was twelve years of age, twelve years of age and was baptized under his philosophy and in later years I looked back in retrospect to see that he was a heavy influence on my ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay now how do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: H-A-Y-W-O-O-D. Jacob spelled J-A-C-O-B.
Speaker 1: So was your whole family involved in this church?
Speaker 2: No, my family was not involved.  My aunt [Alma Young] reared me and she was a very permanent member of that aggregation.  My father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] was Catholic as was my mother [Lillian Cotry Bailey] and I knew at an early age that it was not my way of worshipping God.  But my family never gave me resistance.  They knew I was a strange child and that I should go the way that I chose and I did.  I joined up at--when I was three months of age, my aunt would take me to church and growing up she noted that there were peculiarities with me.
Speaker 1: Now in what way?
Speaker 2: Peculiarities were I would always watch the choir and I would always watch carefully the minister and she could not understand that.  The proof in the pudding was the music became reality when I formed in later years the Harold Bailey Singers.  The ministry--the proof in the pudding was when I was ordained to the ministry.  Thusly, I always say that young people see and emulate that which they will be in later years and is careful--we have to be cautious and careful what we expose young people to.
Story_ID: 131162
Speaker 1: I just want--now you say your aunt reared you, does that mean you were with her sometime and did she actually--were you there--did she actually raise you?
Speaker 2: I was with her most of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of the time and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: And why was--why was there difficulty at home or was it--(simultaneous)(unclear).
Speaker 2: No my father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] had two older brothers and my aunt who reared my father had such a love for one another that my aunt said--because she was a widow, she asked my father when you have your next child would you give me the privilege of financially helping and supporting the philosophy through that child?  It was agreed to and I think as they have told me about three or four months later after my birth, my aunt reared me.  I was with her most of the time though I was between the two families.
Speaker 1: Okay how many other brothers and sister do you have and where do you fall in order?
Speaker 2: I'm the third of four brothers.  I have an older brother, William who is deceased then there is Adolphus Bailey, Jr. who is known as A.J. Bailey, he is a minister of the gospel then there is myself and I have a younger brother who is Ronald Bailey.
Speaker 1: Okay now did your father have any other children before because he was married before?
Speaker 2: No other children.
Speaker 1: Okay so just the four of you?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Alright and what was your aunt's name?
Speaker 2: Alma, A-L-M-A Young, Y-O-U-N-G.
Speaker 1: Okay now so you seem to be--you sound like a pretty serious young man as a youngster.
Speaker 2: They say I was too serious.  I didn't understand what that meant.  They said why don't you go outside and play ball, why don't you do this and why don't you do that and they would find me in my room listening to gospel music and reading the Bible.  I didn't understand that there was another way; I did not know another way.  My brothers would admonish me often, you're going to be a punk, you need to do this; you need to do that.  Strange that even now he's a minister of the gospel.  In retrospect, I don't think I would have had it any other way.  I laid before the Lord; I laid before the Lord and did not know why I was laying before the Lord.  I didn't know what the calling was; I just obeyed it without understanding.  I was admonished, come out that room.  I was listening to Moody Bible Institute which was my favorite broadcast at that time and churches 24/7 and laying there going through scriptures and did not understand why.  I understand it all now.  We are educated and education means to become aware and being able to think, and as a result I'm able at this point to think out the scriptures and more importantly obey the scriptures.
Story_ID: 131163
Speaker 1: How would--well what grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Forrestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] which at that time was the only African American school we could attend.  It was the largest grammar school in the city of Chicago located right there between 44th and 45th on St. Lawrence [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay now in those days and this became an issue later on in Chicago the black belt community where black people lived on the South Side would become increasingly overcrowded, right.
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: That's the subject of the Lorraine Hansberry play '[A] Raisin in the Sun.'  It's the subject of the big controversy over the "Willis Wagon" [Chicago Superintendent of Schools Benjamin C. Willis] where they are there in the '60s [1960s] trying to put wagons beside the schools to catch the overflow population rather than allow black folks to live outside of that narrowly defined geographical space that you described earlier, right?  So it was a real--how would you describe your community growing up in terms of--
Speaker 2: In comparison to what's going on today, it was a happy time for me.  Going to school was pleasurable; we didn't know any other way.  To see someone who was then known as a reefer head, we called them marijuana heads or whatever the case may be now was an isolated situation and to talk about that person was prohibited.
Speaker 1: Okay there wasn't a lot--there wasn't dope in the community--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No
Speaker 1: Not on that level at least--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Actually unheard of and when you knew one the response for him was pray for him don't talk about him, pray for him.  We would go to school, have fun, come home from school and there was a community coming together where the people up the street watched out for the people down the street.  There was nothing I could do that Ms. Sally would not relate to my mother [Lillian Cotry Bailey] and/or my father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] when they got home, we knew that.  If Ms. Sally wanted me to go to the store, I will go to the store for Ms. Sally.  Those are the pleasantries that I came up on.  The pleasantries also were that we're all going to succeed, one way or the other.  What are you going to be, what are you going to be and we had role models at that time.  Mr. Campbell who was the principal of Dunbar [Vocational High] School [Chicago] was a man that we all looked up to, did not understand him but we looked up to him and people wanted to be like Mr. Campbell.  We had some blacks in the community in our books we looked up to.  [George Washington] Carver and all the other persons, we wanted to emulate them.
Story_ID: 131164
Speaker 1: Who were your heroes when you were growing up or mentors?
Speaker 2: When I came up I didn't have any mentors, I didn't have any.  My father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] was the joy of my eye--the apple of my eye if you will.  I wanted to be like my father because I saw strength in my father that I could not see anywhere else.  My father was not a person to say a lot, he thought a lot and I think I got that side, if you will.  My father would say what he meant and he meant what he said and he was one never to repeat himself; he would not repeat himself.  When we would play outside, my father would say when the lights come on be in the house.  If the lights came on we know make it to the house.  Sometimes we didn't make it to the house and I would ask my mother [Lillian Cotry Bailey] did daddy call us and just to assume that your father called you means, make it in right now.  He would never go to the window and bellow out and he would just say with a level voice, Harold, A.J. [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Jr.], it's time to come in and we knew my father meant business.  Not only for that but he meant business all through our lives.  He would say to me it's not a question whether or not you're going to school, it is a question as to what school you're going to and he would tell us about working.  There is no man going to stay in bed after I walk out of my house to go to work and we knew that and so we always made it our business to go to work or find ourselves trying to do something that represent being constructive in our home and/or in the community.
Speaker 1: What kinds of thing would you do?
Speaker 2: Well I started work when I was twelve years of age.  I started working for a place called Pioneer Ice Cream Company that was just across the street and I worked there for a long, long, long time until I went into some other things.  But I've known work all my life.  I've never been one to sit at home and speculate whether I'm going to get a job, I went out and I found a job.  Not only that, we were obligated to do just that.
Speaker 1: Okay did anybody in the family ever try your father in terms of let's see what happens if I stay home and don't?
Speaker 2: Not in my house (laugh).  No one tried my father, once again he said what he meant and he meant what he said and we all knew that.  My father was not a trying person, you just didn't do that.  Not only with us but he would purchase something for example and they would say they would deliver on a particular date, hour and they didn't do it, my father would not make a telephone call, he would go there and he would say something to the effect of if you're in business, you're supposed to say what you mean and mean what you say.  And if there was any other response, of course my father would decline to give the people business.  But I saw these things and these things were deemed as honorable with me.  I never saw anything wrong so I had no wrong frame of reference with my father and that is the same premise that I've used in rearing my children because I know that my children are watching me with a jaundiced eye.

Speaker 1: Now, well tell me about high school.  You ended up going to Englewood [High School, now Englewood Technical Prep Academy, Chicago, Illinois], right?  There were black students at Englewood but just a smattering, you know for many, many years.  Some of the people we've interviewed who are now in their eighties and nineties went to Englewood but there weren't too many blacks going there.
Speaker 2: They did not want us at "the castle," as Englewood was then called.  And I remember so very well the police meeting a bunch of us at the "L" [Chicago elevated train], then located at 63rd and they would walk us for safety purposes to school.  I didn't understand that, I didn't understand nor did I appreciate that.  But I know they had good instructors however I did have an incident to occur that left a bitterness in my heart for this particular instructor.  I was a serious student, I've always been a serious student and I remember one time this particular instructor said something and my mind was so far away from what he was saying, it was just like north from south and the students began to laugh.  I wasn't laughing because I didn't hear what was going on.  He intentionally picked me and said and that's why you're not going to graduate.  I didn't understand that because it was a mystery to my thinking.  What is all this and more importantly why is all of this?  Fortunately the Lord goes before you and makes safe and successful your way.  The principal then who was a man by the name of [Joseph C.] Thompson who was a musician and loved music and admired me as a musician.  I went straight to the principal's office and told him what was going on.  The principal brought the instructor in and admonished him.  As a result, I graduated but when I look back in retrospect to see what took place and what came out of the heart of a white gentleman to a black face and I had no repercussion other than being an honorable person and a musician, that's all I had.  Strike that from happening, I would have not graduated and I thought about that often.  How many people out in the world are going through similar situations?  Being persecuted and prosecuted without a cause.  Based upon what a white man has to say about a black man.  That was instilled in my heart and it's still in my heart today.
Story_ID: 131166
Speaker 1: Now what inst--did you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: Organ.
Speaker 1: You played organ, okay.
Speaker 2: And the principal scheduled that I would play for graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now why was--I mean there other black students at Englewood [High School, now Englewood Technical Prep Academy, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes at that time.
Speaker 1: How many were there?
Speaker 2: I have no memory but when I first went there they were scattered, there were just a very few and we found ourselves huddling together.  Those were some days I'll never forget.  But those were days that I met some very precious people because we would eat together, we would ride the "L" [Chicago elevated train] together and we would pair off together and we would make telephone calls, one to the other.  They were precious to me and in numbers, we had our security.  There was no ignorance that I knew of that was going on.  I loved that body of people and those people have gone on to be some successful people in life.
Speaker 1: Okay so most of the black students that were there were probably there because of the academic advantages that Englewood offered.  So they were very fairly serious.
Speaker 2: Very serious
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: You could not go to Englewood at that time unless you had a serious mind to do so.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: You had all the adversities, you had your life in jeopardy in going there and we called it "the castle."
Speaker 1: Okay now were there any instructors at Englewood that you remember that were helpful or-(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Most certainly.  After a while some black instructors came in and one was a gentleman by the name of Irving Bunton.  He came in in the area of music.  He saw my talent and he latched on to it and I've never looked back.  All I needed was someone to say to me, you're alright, you can do it, you're going to be okay.  I needed that in my life.  There other instructors there but they were not as impressionable as Mr. Irving Bunton.  I remember him to this very day.
Speaker 1: Okay and Mr. [Joseph C.] Thompson, the principal was--seemed to admire you and support you.
Speaker 2: Yeah he was a white gentleman.
Speaker 1: Okay you said you bonded with the other black students, how was your social life in high school?
Speaker 2: I didn't have much of a social life, not that I could not have but I could not spell social life.  Much of what I did, I found pleasure in going to various churches.  I would go to church broadcasts from eight a.m. in the morning till twelve sometime at night.  A strangeness that I had but I was compelled to see and to hear and I think it has impressed me to this day that young people could be better impressed by the church if more of the churches would reach out and do as the Lord did in the scripture.  He went among the sinners, he broke bread with the sinners, he drank wine with the sinners so much so that he was ridiculed and ostracized as a result of much of that.  But when he came out, they came out also and I think the churches need to just kind of look at their ideologies a little more and stop telling the sinners don't come here.  Now I'm not saying all churches are that way but there are some because as I have ventured here in my program, I've had many young men to tell me that they have gone to some churches because they have the electronic ankle bracelet on and some ministers have told them you can't come here.  Where are they to go?  If they are making an effort to into the house of God, to God be the glory.  Giving them opportunity is what they need.

Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation from high school, did you see college as a possibility?
Speaker 2: When I first graduated, I went to [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [now Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  Wilson Junior College was a community college at that time.  I did not find Wilson Junior College to be to my liking because it seemed to have been not as I was geared toward.  I knew that in earlier years, I'm not supposed to be going this way.  Then I received a scholarship to go to Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio].  I was at Central State University up until my junior year.  I became ill, I came home.  I then took courses at the University of Chicago--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now wait--hold on one second here, we don't want to get too far ahead before we spend some time at each place but Wilson Junior College first.  When you graduated from high school--what year--you graduated in--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think that was the year of '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: '57 [1957] okay and you went to Central in '59 [1959], right?  Okay now so when you went to Central, now you were there for three years?
Speaker 2: Three years
Speaker 1: Central State is in Ohio--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Wilberforce, Ohio
Speaker 1: Wilberforce, Ohio, right so you are like leaving home for the first time?
Speaker 2: The first time, I left home to--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: To live, I guess.
Speaker 2: To live--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Before we do this, you told us about your trip to the South when you were sixteen, you're still in high school and I was thinking--now you went to Memphis [Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: Memphis and over into to Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Jackson, Tennessee, okay now that's around the time of the--had the Emmett Till case happened yet?  Had Emmett Till been--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Not-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: It's close.
Speaker 2: It's in that close area, yes.
Speaker 1: Real close by a year or so, it's got to be.
Speaker 2: I remember it; I was young then, yes.  All those disturbing things were happening.
Speaker 1: I don't think it had happened quite yet.
Speaker 2: No not yet.
Speaker 1: Yeah well okay but your father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] was very concerned about your being in the South.  But going to Ohio, did your parents give you any instruction about how to--what Ohio was going to be like or what to expect?
Speaker 2: I think at that time my father found great delight in the fact that I was going away to school and was looking for me to bring back nothing but excellence and I did go away.  I went away on a scholarship that was given to me by the president, Dr. Charles Wesley and I was there to certainly--to prove that I could bring my father back what he wanted.  I became ill there at the school and at that time I was studying music education and sociology.
Speaker 1: Are any instructors at the school that stand out now or personalities that went to school with you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes there are some that stand out very positively and there are some that disturbed me.  I loved gospel music and I remember being in the study hall that was built for music.  I was playing the piano and I had some young folk standing around and we were singing gospel music and this instructor came by and did a thumbs down, an instructor that I had the highest respect for did not understand why that was such a negativeness for gospel music at that time.
Speaker 1: Now who is this instructor?
Speaker 2: I'd rather not.
Speaker 1: Well you may as well tell, he probably is--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: She
Speaker 1: She yeah
Speaker 2: I'd rather not.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: She was a concert pianist and her area was certainly geared toward that and nothing more.  Nothing else was deemed as music.  And there was a Dr. Garcia who was the organist at the school who put his arm around me and he became my organ instructor, a very kind and considerate person which allowed me to know that everybody is not thinking the same way.
Speaker 1: Now when you were there-(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Henry Garcia.
Speaker 1: Henry Garcia, okay.
Story_ID: 131168
Speaker 1: Now you were there right as close--I don't know how this matched up but I know Coretta Scott who later married Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was over at Antioch [College, Yellow Springs, Ohio], I think in the early '50s [1950s].  I don't know if you ever met her but she sang with a local group that toured around the area, I think.  They were like some members that were--they had a little gospel group that they--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm not familiar but Dr. King spoke at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] for a graduation there and that was the time I had an opportunity to hear of and about Dr. King.
Speaker 1: Okay by my chronology--yeah that's right she would be married to him by then.  She had had a little-she had had a reputation in the area as being quite a singer in that part of Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yes I'm familiar because as I was studying music people like Charlotte Wesley, Dr. King's wife and a few others were noted.  Leontyne Price was an up and coming person.
Speaker 1: I think [HM] Nancy Wilson was at Central State.
Speaker 2: Nancy Wilson used to come--Nancy Wilson did come through Central State, yes.  There is someone else that came through there but I had an opportunity to meet some of the greatest names and wondered why they were unapplauded at that time.  Leontyne Price's husband was [HM] William Warfield.  William Warfield in later years performed at my wedding.  You never know where you're going in life.
Speaker 1: Leontyne Price was at Central?
Speaker 2: She performed there.
Speaker 1: Okay so the music department at Central State was-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: A strong department, very strong department.  I used to play for assemblies at the school and I thought that was so prestigious to do that.  It gave me an opportunity to learn some things although I received that scholarship because I was playing for Tabernacle Baptist Church here in the city [Chicago, Illinois].  So I had experience of playing but this was a different surrounding, this one was around a bunch of critical people, if you will.  You had to dot your I's and certainly cross your T's, as a result.
Story_ID: 131169
Speaker 1: All right. Okay. So we're talking about Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and the music department.  So did you really enjoy being at Central State?
Speaker 2: I loved it, found friends.  The music department was like a second home.  Some of the people I kept contact with for a long time.  In fact, I formed a group of singers out of Central State and they were entitled The Harold Bailey Singers and we travelled around the area into Yellowstone [sic] and Columbus [Ohio]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yellow Springs [Ohio]
Speaker 2: Yeah Yellow Springs, yes all in that area was--up in Zenia [Ohio] over to Cincinnati [Ohio] and all, we would sing and I didn't know that I was going to later have a professional group.  But my groups were being formed right there at Central State.  I had a little aggregation of people that loved what I was doing and I did a first there called the NBC which is the National Bankers Convention mock so to speak and it was such a grand success that Dr. Wesley sat on the front row and later he called me to his home and to go to the president's home, man that was a bit much.
Speaker 1: What was Charles [H.] Wesley like?  He's a historical figure that--he worked closely with Carter G. Woodson who was one of his number one confidantes.  He co-wrote a couple of books with Carter G. Woodson and was president of Central State for a long time.  But what was he like?
Speaker 2: Dr. Wesley was like such a genuine person.  You would think a person in his position would just be what he was not.  He was able to communicate with you, like a father figure and down home with you.  I just did not believe I was sitting in his home talking to him and from that conversation, I found out that Dr. Wesley was a lover of gospel music.  That's all I needed to know because I originally believed that it was just a no-no for the campus but it was not, he loved it.  And he encouraged me, I'll never forget that.  He encouraged me to go further and not allow the voices of men to hinder me.  He was a man and he was a man beyond men.
Story_ID: 131170
Speaker 1: Okay now did you--now why did you--what was the problem at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?  Why wasn't gospel considered--what was the--can you explain the philosophy of the music department there?
Speaker 2: I think it was leadership at that time because there seemed to have been a little pull.  Some of the instructors were patting me on the back while there was great resistance from this particular lady.
Speaker 1: She was the chairman?
Speaker 2: No she was not the chairman.  I think she wanted to be the chair, however.  I was a part of my gospel music; in fact I would take it to the stage in the theater and would fill the auditorium for gospel music.  You see at that time when I was coming along, gospel music was not prevalent.  It was heard here and a little here but not very much.  Gospel spirituals--spiritual music was prevalent and-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right now there's a difference and I don't think--a lot of people don't understand that.  I know even at my age and I'm just a little younger than you are maybe eleven years, not much though.  I assume that gospel music had been around a long, long time but it was actually founded here--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Negro spirituals.
Speaker 1: Yeah the Negro spirituals were and gospel was actually founded here in Chicago [Illinois] by--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Correct Thomas A. Dorsey.  Thomas A. Dorsey applauded me, patted me on the back and encouraged me and that's another reason I continued with my gospel music.
Speaker 1: Do you know about the time that Thomas Dorsey founded gospel?
Speaker 2: I do not off hand.  I met Thomas A. Dorsey before I went to Central State at Tabernacle Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: It's a twentieth-century phenomenon, something that didn't--it came about in the early part, maybe the 1920s or '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Negro spirituals had a hold in the community.  There was a resistance to gospel music coming in.  Gospel music was a thing that by some was taboo until it just overshadowed things and I mean it really did come in with an overshadowing of black spirituals.  To the point now you very seldom hear a black spiritual.  My influence came by way of black spirituals.  I loved them but I knew there had to be another interpretation of some things and I heard gospel.  Thomas A. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, Roberta Martin those were my influences and I just some kind of way said that if they can do it, I can do it too and that's where I came in with my singers.
Story_ID: 131171
Speaker 1: Okay now you left Central [State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] after three years, what happened?
Speaker 2: I left Central, I was ill, my family wanted me home.  I came home [to Chicago, Illinois]; I went then to take a course at the University of Chicago.  I was there completing my course there.  I went to Chicago State--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh instead of the University-Chicago State University.
Speaker 2: Chicago State University, I fulfilled the commitments there, did not get degreed decided to go on then to what they say you are a professional student, yes I was.  I went on to Governors State [University, Chicago, Illinois].  I completed my studies at Governors State, went back to take the test.  The test was not available, came back--I was working then as a Cook County Adult Probation Officer.  As a result that took me away from my degree being deferred [sic] upon me.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't until later on--let's pick up the chronology of Central.  Now you said you went to Chicago State for a while but didn't you go to the [U.S.] Army for a period of time?
Speaker 2: I went to the army in 19--I believe it was in 1960--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well you started at Central in '59 [1959] so--and you were there three years, so.
Speaker 2: At the end of Central State, I went into the service.
Speaker 1: Okay so that may be '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Well whatever it is--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: '61 [1961] or '62 [1962] I guess.
Speaker 2: Went into the service, was ill before going into the service, fell ill in the service and was discharged on an honorable discharge.
Speaker 1: Now what was wrong?  I mean was it a chronic problem?
Speaker 2: Oh I was very sick; I had ulcers at that time.  They deemed it as ulcers but the hospitals here said that I had pancreatitis and of course the service didn't want to pay for that medical attention and they figured releasing me would be far better.
Speaker 1: Sounds like the--so you came back--did you go overseas when you were in the service?
Speaker 2: Never did.
Speaker 1: Okay, where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Fort Leonardwood, Missouri and that's where I was discharged.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 131172
Speaker 1: So back in Chicago [Illinois].  Now how did you become a--what did you do before you became a probation officer between the [U.S.] Army and the--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I took my father's [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.'s] position.  He was working for the Cook County Board of Commissioners in the voting machine area.  My father had a thing called forced retirement.  That's when retirement came in by force and it almost killed him because he was a viable person but they said you have to step down and my father said if I step down then I want you to take my son.  I didn't want to go but you respect your father.  I took that position and that was the hardest work I've ever done in my life.  I worked there, I think for three years.  I found it very interesting because I would find myself going downtown and interacting with the Board of Elections Commissioners down there and seeing some things.  It was there that I discovered it has to be a far better way of employment.  From there I left and I went to the water department, Chicago Water Department.  That was my first discovery of how politics can play an integral part of what you're doing.  If you remember in the press there was a war between Mayor [Richard J.] Daley and Congressman Ralph Metcalfe.  Ralph Metcalfe sent me on that job and I mean I worked diligently because that was a family relationship between Metcalfe and my father and I had to do well.
Speaker 1: Your father knew Ralph Metcalfe?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he sat at my table on occasion as did Mike Sneed before him and Winbush [ph.] before him.  The politicians have all sat at my table.  That's how I learned the side of politics and that's also how I learned that politics was not fit for me.  In going into that job, that conflict was real between Metcalfe and Daley.
Speaker 1: Now this conflict takes place in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]?  This is the conflict over the [1972] beating of Dr. [Herbert "Doc"] Odom, right?
Speaker 2: That's when Mr. Metcalfe decided to stand up.
Speaker 1: Yeah Doc Odom was a black dentist who was stopped in a routine traffic and then beaten up--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And beaten, yes.
Speaker 1: He was a very dignified--everybody knows Doc Odom because he was a very dignified man.  Did you know Doc Odom too?
Speaker 2: I have not met him, no but Mr. Metcalfe would speak of him and he warned us that there would probably be pressure and there was pressure.  He said dot your I's, cross your T's and I did just that.  However, I noticed that I was being called in to the front office on occasions, did not know that a dossier was being built on me and to make a long story short, I was terminated from the water department without cause.  They then wanted to make an issue out of it and I did not want to go back so we left there.
Story_ID: 131173
Speaker 1: Okay so where did you go after you left the water department?
Speaker 2: I went to the Cook County Adult Probation Department [Chicago, Illinois].  I had a fork in the road at that time and it was do I go here or there was another job proposed, I cannot recall.
Speaker 1: Now if they were trying to get rid of you for political reasons from the water department, why didn't they keep you from working the probation department because in those days the first Mayor [Richard J.] Daley had quite a bit of reach.
Speaker 2: Mr. Metcalfe [U.S. Representative Ralph Metcalfe] had strength in the probation department, it's all about politics, all about politics and I remember this because when I went for an interview there Tyrone Kenner was the person who was then the alderman, he went with me.
Speaker 1: Third ward
Speaker 2: Yes the third ward and Mr. Napoli [ph.] who was the then chief asked my history and I told him I'm a minister and he gasped.  Mr. Kenner says is there a problem?  No, no maybe it's about time for us to have a minister here.  I was hired and I knew it was not by mistake or happenstance.  I knew I had to do what I had to do.  I went into the probation department and that was a change in my entire life.
Speaker 1: Now before we get into the details of that, take us back, we've skipped over your ordination as a minister.  How did you--we can already see the pattern and where this is heading when you talk about your early life but when were you ordained and under what circumstances?
Speaker 2: I was ordained [sic, licensed] to the ministry in 1967.  I was minister of music at Tabernacle [Missionary] Baptist Church under the auspices of [Reverend] Dr. Louis Rawls.  I was called down to Greenville, South Carolina by Pastor Johnny Smith who had been following my calling.
Speaker 1: You say you were called, I mean--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: He asked that I come to Greenville and that he would, at that time license me to the ministry and at that time I went forth.  After speaking they decided to give me my credentials and I think it was in 1978 here in Chicago I was ordained to the ministry by Pastor Lester Bale [ph.] of Deliverance Center.
Speaker 1: Okay now what happened--now in '67 [1967]--okay and you were ordained--I thought--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Licensed first--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: You were licensed in '67 [1967], all right and then ordained in '78 [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: That's the protocol licensed, ordained.
Speaker 1: Okay now go ahead now in '78 [1978] you were ordained.
Speaker 2: I was ordained in the City of Chicago, received my credentials and went forward.
Speaker 1: Okay now you were ordained in what denomination?
Speaker 2: He was interdenominational, nondenominational.
Story_ID: 131174
Speaker 1: All right so you worked for the [Chicago, Illinois] water department from what year (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Being an old man, dates are escaping me.
Speaker 1: But you worked for the--we're sum it up and say you worked for the Department of the Elections--Board of Elections, the Water Department and then the--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And then on to the Cook County Adult Probation Department.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay and about what year did you join the Cook County Adult Probation Department, you were ordained by then, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I went in with credentials.
Speaker 1: All right so this is after '78 [1978] did you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Probation department?
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: I think it was around--you young people do the math.  I'd been there almost--I was a probation officer for fourteen years and probation (unclear) is twenty five/thirty/thirty five--is that forty years, almost thirty nine years.
Speaker 1: Okay so fifteen years before 1982 then.  You started in the late '60s [1960s], I guess in the probation department.  So that gives us some kind of perspective anyway.  So when you joined the probation department, what was it like and--I mean give me your perspective on the work that you had, what did you try to do?
Speaker 2: Initially I could not understand what was going on.  I knew that we were doing paperwork but I did not see the honest intent going forward to rehabilitate.  It was name, address, telephone number and your next appointment date given.  I didn't see where any of that took in constructive rehabilitation.  I went to the department head at that time and expressed my feelings.  His response was you've got your eyes open, keep your mouth shut.  That went straight to my heart and I went and prayed about it and I did not understand.  All I wanted to do is to see constructive change, is this wrong Lord?
Speaker 1: Now what did you want to change about it?
Speaker 2: I wanted to see young people change inwardly not coming and give me--they can stay home and use the telephone and call and give me name and address and telephone number and next date to come in, that's a waste of carfare.  I wanted to see a person go to school, I wanted to see a person go to work; I wanted to see if I could affect the mentality of that person--
Story_ID: 131175
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's walk through this.  Your job is a probation officer for those who have never been one, is to monitor the probation of the people who are incarcerated, who are on their way out.  They're being--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Filtered through the system.
Speaker 1: Yeah they are filtered--they are coming out of the system, right? So they're on probation--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, no, they're on probation for a given period of time--they're sentenced to time and it means that during this period of probation monthly, they have to see a probation officer or they have to abide by special conditions that are set forth.  The officer has the duties of overseeing that John Doe making sure that the John Doe does as they judge orders.  Those findings have to be submitted not only to the probation department, they have to be submitted also to the judge.  It's an awesome task and it's all barred down in bureaucracy-paperwork, if you will.  To divert from that means that you are getting off of the beaten path and you want to do more and for you to do more means you're breaking with the masses and if that succeeds, the masses will have to also follow suit.  It's all about bureaucracy, it's all then at that time was about the first and the fifteenth.  And my superior told me you be concerned about the first and the fifteenth which were paydays and it said to me in essence don't be so much concerned about John Doe and Mary Sue, you be concerned about your pay and following the dictates of this office.
Speaker 1: So you were required to turn in a certain amount of paperwork on each one.
Speaker 2: Absolutely just paperwork.
Speaker 1: By the first order and tell us about the load.  Now this is something that I've heard about before, it seems nightmarish in a way.
Speaker 2: Oh yes
Speaker 1: What was the work load like?
Speaker 2: Before I left I had something like four hundred and some people on my caseload.
Speaker 1: Now this means that you have to be in contact with every month and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: At the time I believe juvenile probation had something like fourteen to fifteen people, that has since changed because the trend of things now has become that young people are committing crime more and so their caseloads are up.  But adult probation has always been with massive amount of numbers.
Speaker 1: So you had over a hundred people a week.  Do you have to come in personal contact with these people?
Speaker 2: Yes all persons on your caseload have to have accountability with their officer.
Speaker 1: A hundred a week, five days a week so that's twenty a day, I guess.
Speaker 2: If you have to go--at that time we had a day that was delegated for a person to come in.  It was not different days, it was on a day and if you had four hundred people on your caseload, four hundred people had to come in on that same day.  Yes on that same day and you can imagine what a probation officer walked out of there at the end of that day looking like and feeling like.
Speaker 1: All right so you didn't have to go to them, they had to come to you--
Speaker 2: They had to come to me--
Speaker 1: --In one day? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: In one day, at that time. It's since changed.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Story_ID: 131176
Speaker 1: So were you to provide counseling or guidance to these people?
Speaker 2: You couldn't provide counseling, there was no way for you to provide counseling and not only that, if you were found doing consultations, they would tell you that that's not a matter of protocol here and I was doing it.
Speaker 1: So your job is merely to just keep tabs on them, to make sure--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's all, that's all and to do any other than that was distasteful by administration but I did it.
Speaker 1: Okay so that gives us some kind of perspective in terms--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I did it and was called in for it.  Ridiculed on many occasions but taking time from other clients to talk to a John Doe, to talk to a Mary Sue, to encourage a person to do better and then get it out there and try to find a job for that person.  It was hard but we wanted to do it and there were others who did the same thing.  They did it under cloak of darkness.  I did mine a little differently.  I did it to the point of being noticed in my work by [HM] Judge R. Eugene Pincham who was then an attorney.  I didn't know that he was watching me and when he came to the bench the first thing he said is I want Harold Bailey to come and be interviewed because I want him to become my personal probation officer.  They did not want that to happen, they disrespected Judge Pincham and his order and Judge Pincham had to, slight of a contempt order, tell Mr. Napoli [ph.] I want Bailey to come and be my personal probation officer.  The next day, I was up there and from that day forward it was Judge Pincham and Harold Bailey helping the community.  Judge Pincham told me at that time whatever it is and whatever it takes for you to make a difference in the lives of these young people, I want you to do it and I did.
Speaker 1: Okay so what kind of things did you see that people needed that you could provide them with?
Speaker 2: Well in interviewing young people, I knew the first thing was there was a lack of education and I then wanted to know what it is that I should do.  I went in prayer in November of 1978 and there was a vision that I had was an escape back into reality for young men and women who were caught up in the clutches of crime--sin if you will and that would be probation challenge.  I took the intricacies of it back to the judge.  The judge told me whatever it takes, do it.  I implemented that program in January 1979 for the express purpose of true, serious rehabilitation and that it would be done through the vehicle of education.  Why education, simply because education brings about awareness.  Awareness brings on the ability for young men and women to think and thusly make rational decisions.  We implemented it and nobody was mad with us but the devil.  Hell broke out profusely.  I was called before a judicial council as a result of this and my job was put on the line because I was merely educating.  I asked Judge Pincham why is this and what is this going on.  He said study your history and if you have not studied it, read it.  I went back in history and remembered that education was always a no-no for a certain group of people, African Americans, black, coloreds, Negroes, if you will.  I educated in spite of, I converted the jury room, the courtroom and my office room into classrooms after dark.  We would educate so well that young people would not come back into the judicial system.  They would go on to constructive measures.  The system noted that also and they told me immediately cease and desist.  I did not; I continued to educate the young men and women.  I was then taken before a judicial counsel and I was ordered to do this and/or the other and Mr. Richard Napoli was right there in back of them.  Blue Ribbon Commissions were formed and however there was Channel 7 who had been doing an undercover investigation for over a year.  They called me and told me about their investigation and told me that don't you worry, we've been watching your constructive measures and you're coming out of this okay.  When they aired that finding for seven days, the only plus in that finding was Probation Challenge.  I applauded-I said God this great.  That was the beginning of my great sorrow because they told me I broke ranks with the system.  You don't do that in the criminal justice system.
Speaker 1: So at this point do you start calling what you were doing Probation Challenge?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: When did you start calling it that?
Speaker 2: I put that and documented that by reason of the state in January 1979 for protection purposes and from that point to this point we have existed merely because of the goodness of God and the contribution of some few other people.  It has been a hell--a living hell.  From that point to this point, I have educated--I'm told by, I think it was Essence magazine over 80,000 people have enrolled in Probation Challenge and I get my tiredness the old-fashioned way, I've earned it.
Story_ID: 131177
Speaker 1: All right, sir, could you outline the program of Probation Challenge, what exactly do you do?
Speaker 2: Probation Challenge is the first court-mandated program of its kind in the country where we force young men and women to be of a genuine assistance to themselves through the vehicle of education.  Simply, it's education or jail.  Under the auspices of [HM] Judge [R. Eugene] Pincham, we never had a client to go to jail more than twice before getting the message that it's going to be an education.  We selected education because education does bring about awareness, awareness brings on the ability for these young people to think and preferably make rational decisions.  Here they get more than a mere GED, they get adult basic education.  They can then after graduating from there go into skills for example, multimedia productions is being learned here at no cost to the client, carpentry, computer science on several levels.  All these are high paying positions out in the industry and the world--the marketplace, if you will.  So why not train them adequately to do what--compete in the job market.
Speaker 1: Now that goes counter to what the penal institution--well the criminal justice system usually does not see--though it seems actually (unclear) if you--if a person is in jail and their sentence is running out, society lets them out without any provision for any education or any retraining, the chances are that they'll do what--go right back.
Speaker 2: Recidivism becomes--let me say this, I'm getting excited, recidivism becomes astronomically high simply because when a young man is filtering through the bowels of the criminal justice system, there is no provisions made for guidelines, there are no provisions made to show him what to do and how to do it.  When a John Doe is released out of the prison system with not--with twenty-five, thirty dollars in pocket, the conspiracy when they tell him that now don't you come back here anymore, that's a lie.  They want him back because if he don't go back, they no longer have a job and to put a person on a bus absorbs all the money in pocket.  When that person reaches here, they have already had their mentalities dealt with by persons who are sitting in judgment over them, correctional officers, if you will, who are placed in communities who are first partakers of those jobs who are not like the complexion of the person whose being housed there.  And so what happens is that you've got the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] in Illinois in some places who are being hired to administer judgment, justice over the lives of these young men and women.  What are they expected to be like when they come out?  I dare say it's a conspiracy that has been well set into place.  They cannot retaliate for all of this as they are in the institution but when they come out they do what, they give vent to those persons in the community.  And who are those people, the people who live upstairs, next door to them or beneath them or in their own house.  Mothers are being damaged, sisters and other brothers, family members are being damaged because all this frustration that they took in prison is now out on the community.  It was a conspiracy that was well written for these young people and the young people are now playing out the script and they don't realize what's going on.
Story_ID: 131178
Speaker 1: Let's finish outlining what the program [Probation Challenge] is. How did--so, you were outlining it and I kind of got you off on a tangent but--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I'm following your lead, my brother. When a John Doe comes into this program, he must comply.
Speaker 1: Can anybody--I mean how do they--do you choose them or they choose you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They are mandated by reason of the court.
Speaker 1: Through the court, okay.
Speaker 2: They must come in and they must meet the conditions set forth by reason of law.
Speaker 1: Okay so a judge can choose to send someone to Probation Challenge?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: All right and if they don't send any, you don't get any?
Speaker 2: I don't get them.  What I have done is we are now servicing persons who are on electronic monitoring, those persons who are doing court supervision and by reason of law, persons who are placed on probation.  It means they've got to come in, meet the conditions and after they would have met the conditions set forth by Probation Challenge, their lawyer can take them back into court and that court order can be vacated which means the person can get off of probation earlier but they're getting off with tools in their hands rather than a gun.
Speaker 1: So if I was on probation and my lawyer and I and even if I didn't have a lawyer--if I thought say maybe I know about Probation Challenge if I can get involved in that then I have a better chance of---simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well of course and what happens is that once that mentality has been dealt with that person will never be the same again.  Recidivism falls as a result.  We're wondering why there are empty seats at all in Probation Challenge.  When taxpayers are paying astronomically to send a person to jail and/or prison, if we dealt with them constructively here, they would not have to go to jail or prison.  What's the real game here?  I dare tell you what the real game is.  The P that was in penitentiary is the P that's in prison is the same P that was in plantation.  The philosophy of old still exists only new methods of approach have come into play.  What that does mean for young people, the game is still the same just players have changed.  They don't want these young folks and their mentality changed because it's too lucrative to other folk.
Story_ID: 131179
Speaker 1: How--people have said this, but how lucrative is the prison, I mean how much money does the state spend on prison and who gets that money?
Speaker 2: The prison system--each prisoner the range is from now forty-six to sixty-six thousand dollars to house one inmate per year in the Illinois Department of Corrections.  When it'll cost you, I think about eighteen thousand dollars to go to Northwestern Law School [Chicago, Illinois]. Who's fooling who?  But on top of any of that, you have not entered into the cost of the jail cell itself.  Actually you pay over a hundred and some plus thousand dollars per inmate in that institution when in fact if we dealt with his mentality he would not be there in the first place.  Point out, if we educated on the outside, we would not have to incarcerate on the inside.  It cost less to educate on the outside than it cost to incarcerate.  There is diabolicalness on the inside of any and all of this.  It's not about saving young people and their lives, it's about some people suffering and some people benefit from that suffering.  The game is still the same, players have only changed.
Speaker 1: Now who gets the--I mean where does the money go?  I'm in incarcerated and they have to pay presumably for the maintenance of the facility, right first then what else?
Speaker 2: Oh you have maintenance and maintenance--well up under maintenance is all that fat.  You have those persons who are the farmers who have closed down now, they put on shirt and ties, they're in there now, they've become administrators. You have all the other people, social workers, you've got all the other workers in there and then you've got the correction officers who have the belts on that indicate who they are, blatantly and they are the ones who are administering justice over the lives of these young folk for two, three, four, six years.  It's called brainwashing.  What are they coming back to us with, what they have learned in those institutions.  Keeping in mind that most of the institutions are built in communities like ours and when they hire, they hire out of the community and we wonder why the young people come back to us so bitter, that's the reason.
Speaker 1: Okay so when one goes to state prison even at the far reaches of the state of Illinois all the way down to Shawnee which is on the Kentucky border all the way down there in the Ohio River, all the prisoners or most of the prisoners are black and Hispanic.
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: And all the guards are the locals--local white farmer population--former farmer population down there.  It seemed very--their families have to take a bus to go see them from Chicago [Illinois]. It's a long ride, five or six hours, seven hours sometime.  They go down there to see their relative--there are costs all along the way, right?
Speaker 2: And degrading in the summer they stand in the hot sun hour on top of hours waiting to get in and oft times don't get in for whatever excuse.  So what has happened here is that we have built a monster and once or twice you go down, you don't go anymore.  So as a result John Doe has to suffer the consequences, the inmate if you will.  Bitterness sets in there because he's not seeing family members.  We have, at one point, tried to build a prison closer to Chicago but the community rebelled after being brainwashed of course.  That these young people are going to break out and break out into the community, hogwash.  If we can have the Cook County Department of Corrections there and they not break out, a prison can sit here and not break out.  But it would then provide jobs and positions of power for the community and who is the community, African Americans.
Story_ID: 131180
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, what's the--now this fear that having a prison in the black community would jeopardize people by having a prison so close by, what's the--the prisoners are coming back here anyway, right?
Speaker 2: The prisoners are coming back, it makes no sense and there is no sense. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: In terms of recidivism, when they let them go finally after they've served the sentence, they come right back to the [Chicago, Illinois] West Side, South Side, same place right?
Speaker 2: Recidivism in the Illinois Department of Corrections is eighty percent plus.  When they release them, they know that they're coming back in one year's time.  How do they know that?  Because they have planned it that way.  Once again they have brainwashed them to come back.  They built that monster to do what it's going to do and on the outside what we've got to do is to dismantle.  How do we dismantle that monster, with truth.   Truth has a tendency to slice the legs off of the monster.  Young people are hearing it here in Probation Challenge.  They're learning the conspiracies but we are going to have to cut the monster off further at the knee by going to the polls, the ballot boxes and say to the people who have become our masters.  Why do I say masters because it's nothing but a plantation.  Many young people are working for thirteen cents an hour and if you will note American Express have bought into it.  Why would American Express buy into privatizing if it was going to be a failure?  Don't leave home without it is what they are saying.  This is all a massive conspiracy and the state conspiracy is now coming over into the city and the county when its conspiracy set forth here to dog these young men and women.  And why are they doing it, it's good for business.  I keep saying whose business?
Speaker 1: Now American Express has invested money--(simultaneous)(unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: The Illinois prison--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well not here but they are in existence in some of the prisons with privatizing and they are talking about you heard the other day they're talking about privatizing the jail.  Who's going to buy into that, not I.  But business is going to buy it.  What business?  Lucrative businesses are going to buy in.  And are they going to buy in because it's a system that is designed to fail, no.  It's a system that is designed to work and if by chance you decide that you don't want to go along with, you're the enemy.
Speaker 1: So you're saying it's against the interest of private business when they get involved in the criminal justice system to lose clientele.
Speaker 2: Right they are not in the business to lose.  They're in the business to make money but look at the complexion of the institution, eighty percent African Americans.  I thought somewhere along the line someone would stand up and applaud people who are saying you don't have to go to jail, let me help you to go to school.  I thought that was the right philosophy but no it's not.  If you stand up now and go against the prison industry, you're doomed.  If you go against the jail industry, you are doomed.  Not only are you doomed by whites but you're also doomed by brainwashed African Americans who believe these young folk just ought to go to jail, it's good for business.  It's not good for business, these are our children and our children's children and if you put all of us in jail who's going to take care of your future?  That question needs to be answered.
Story_ID: 131181
Speaker 1: What success rate do you have in Probation Challenge in terms of lowering recidivism?
Speaker 2: My administration says that the recidivism in Probation Challenge is less sometimes than six percent and six percent on a hard day.  Five percent represents what we are doing today.  Young folk standing around absorbing truth, absorbing what is really going on not hypocritically what's being placed in the paper.  They have experienced what's happening, they know what's going on now but the problem is shut Bailey down, close Bailey off.  Don't let it further go anywhere because if a movement to go into the right direction would succeed, what would happen to the jails and the prisons?  I've been here long enough to understand what the game is and I'm really resent the game.
Speaker 1: They'd be reduced significantly by 60, 70 percent.  If the black population was represented as we are-as we represent the American population--eleven percent of the population than it would be a lot less prisons around.
Speaker 2: When you say the criminal justice system, you are saying the criminal just us system.  When you stand outside the doors at 26th [Street] and California [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] on any given day, before the doors open you see a mass amount of people waiting to get in.  Over ninety percent of those people waiting to get in are African Americans.  There is a little side door where employees go in, over ninety percent of those employees going in are white faces.  I just don't feel like playing games, I'm too old for it.  They know what they are doing and I got to know what I'm doing.  I'm trying to save the lives of these people and they're trying to doom the lives of these people.  I have sat with judges time and time again, of course when I sat with them they thought I was going to be with the system forever and the common conversation is how many have you sent away.  Well when you say how many have you sent away, I know who they are talking about.  I know they are talking about sending away African Americans.  And so it has become a lottery and everybody is competing to see how many folk they can send away.  Nobody wants to be on that lottery sheet in saying I didn't send anybody away this month.  It's a game and it's perpetrated on African Americans followed by Hispanics and some unfortunate whites.  When you look at who is in fact in this city being arrested, it's not African Americans, they are whites.  But somewhere along the line, they get pulled away--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: So you're saying a proportionate number of white people get arrested in the first place, but they don't end up in jail.
Speaker 2: They don't end up going into the criminal justice system before judges and being sentenced.  Why is that?  There was a thing called thirty day adjustment for a little John Doe being arrested by the police.  It was, who is your father, Weinowsky [ph.] so and so, Canary or whatever the case may be, get your father up here.  The father comes up, when a John Brown comes up where's your father, I don't know, I don't have a father, he's put into the system.  This is known as hypocrisy; why not give an even playing field here.  When that person bringing his father up, they are placed in a thirty-day holding, if nothing goes wrong in that thirty day, it goes into the trash can.  But where does that young black man go, where does that young Hispanic go, into the criminal justice system.  This is a vicious game perpetrated on us and nobody is to stand up.  To much given, much is certainly required.  I know what I know and I served on the Cook County Board of Corrections, I know what I know and I keep coming back telling young folk, don't play into the scenario, get off those corners and I've been ridiculed for getting young people off the corners.  What time of day is this, hypocrisy in the worst kind of way.  I'm trying to save the lives of the young folk and I'm hated for trying to save their lives.  Trying to send them on to college and universities, I'm hated for that.  I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't.  I think I'm going to go on and do what I'm supposed to do, shape their lives and shape it into men and women.
Story_ID: 131182
Speaker 1: And it seems as though, when community groups get together, there is always a lot of complaining in the black community about what young people generally are doing in the community.  Some communities I know and some of the neighbors have called for police sweeps in their neighborhood and that sort of thing.  It seems like there is an atmosphere of fear that--would you agree that fear in the black community kind of helps fuel this--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: We've been fed fear, we've been fed it.  They told us we're supposed to be fearful.
Speaker 1: We're the victims of the crimes as well as the--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Drugs is the number one cause of crime and drugs don't just come into this country, they are brought into this country.  African Americans don't drive or navigate those two Learjets that come in.  I talk to a very influential person in Washington [D.C.] one time and I said well don't you all see the drugs coming in, the person said well see Reverend Bailey you don't understand, they are coming in and they're flying beneath the radar system and that's how they are getting in.  I told that person I'm afraid of you, I'm afraid of your being in Washington because drugs can come in on a two Learjets beneath the radar system, a bomb can come in beneath the radar system equally as well.  They come into the community and our country very well knows that they are here.  They very well know that they're going into certain communities and-example being recently a car had a flat in the lower end of the [Chicago, Illinois] South Side.  The police came, it was driven by a white man and they just decided to do a search, loaded with cocaine, loaded.  How is it that the whites bring it in to us knowing that we're going to stand on these corners and that we're going to distribute it among ourselves and the people that bring them in don't even use them.  That's called community genocide but it's being allowed.  You can't tell me that the Chicago Police Department and all the other law enforcement people don't know where drugs are on any given day, absolutely they do.  They wink at the young men and women standing on the corners, why do they do that.  Simply because if they did a raid on this corner, before the end of the day everybody would clear all the corners of the city.  But if they do and they do, they take one from here, one from there, one from here and one from there.  At the end of the day at the Cook County Department of Corrections receiving room is jammed to its capacity.  Why wake up to people, it's good for business, but whose business.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that an arrests--lots of arrests but no solving the problem on the corner.
Speaker 2: No
Speaker 1: They still sell it on the corner but you may take one or two off the corner every week or-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And nobody's missed.  You take a John Doe here-the chief says to another foolish person step up and they step up.  You can't tell me that they don't know where drugs are; absolutely they know where drugs are.  But drugs represent a multimillion-dollar industry and who wants to break into it.  Who wants to stop it, who wants to stop the 12,500 Chicago Police Department?  If there was a moratorium on crime in this city and young folks stopped committing crime today who would be first affected, Chicago Police Department.  Yes and when you go into the holding cell, you've got a cold bologna sandwich and cold coffee, who wants to stop that concession?  And then when you go into the House of Corrections and you've got to go to court, what's your chance of standing before a black judge who knows where you're coming from, who sympathizes with you, oh it's nil.  And then when you go into the Illinois Department of Corrections which is not correcting, what are your chances there?  So you bring back to your community all of your experiences in the criminal justice system and then when a person stands up and says let me help you, it's what in it for you.  Well the only thing in it for me is I want to return meaningful and productive people back into our society as taxpayers rather than a tax burden.
Story_ID: 131183
Speaker 1: Probation Challenge from everything you've said has been successful.  You said maybe six percent failure rate and all this activity which makes it successful by any standard we have today.  Why hasn't it been replicated?
Speaker 2: Well would you really want it replicated?  Would it not-let me say what [Chicago, Illinois mayor] Harold Washington said-the late mayor said that, make your program a success then we're going to spread your program all over this city.  We're going to reach out into the community and engulf all the ignorance and all this game-playing is going to be a thing of-of what-it's going to be a thing of the past.  That's it in a nutshell.  People don't want it to succeed.  We are court-mandated by reason of law to do what we're doing and out of all the laws in Springfield [Illinois], why is it that Probation Challenge is the only one who can't get funded.
Speaker 1: So the state doesn't fund the--(simultaneous)(unclear).
Speaker 2: And it's its own baby, will not fund it.  And they know it is a success, they have applauded it as a success.  Why won't they let me do a bigger success?  Stevie Wonder told Ray Charles I can see that.
Speaker 1: Wow do you see on the horizon any change in these policies?
Speaker 2: Oh yes there's going to be a change.  There's a season for everything.  There's a season for the snow, the fall, the winter and there's a season to be quiet and there is also a season to stand up and I've just stood up.  I had to catch my wind from being knocked down but I just stood up and I stood up with the Sheriff [of Cook County, Illinois] who has broken the letter of the law and costing taxpayers millions of dollars to hold on to a lie.  I've asked the Lord for that mountain, he gave me that mountain and now I'm going after some more mountains.  I want these young people freed up; I want them to be able to walk the streets of this city without the fear of "are you a part of my group," "are you a part of my organization?"  Why is it that they can come into this facility and everybody's family, there's no turf here and as quiet as it seems, there is no turf out there.  That's Mayor [Richard M.] Daley's turf out there.  Why are we being allowed to stand on that turf and I say allowed (gestures with hands)?
Speaker 1: Chicago is an interesting place in that a lot of innovative work in the criminal justice has taken place here on some level as tough as it is.  The juvenile court founded here over a hundred years ago, you have figures like Ma Houston [Jessie "Ma" Houston] and Mother York [Consuella B. York] who tried to help.  So you see that down the line things may get better?
Speaker 2: They are going to get better, progressively better.  I used to watch Mother York.  Mother York has such a tremendous way with inmates.  She would tell them you're going to church today.  She would not ask did you want to go, she'd put her arms around the inmates and tell them oh yeah you're coming out of here and you're going to church and they were obedient to her.  Ma Houston had the same philosophy.  Love conquers all, not only does it conquer all, love covers a multitude of faults.  Reverend Helen Sinclair--who is the daughter of--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Ma Houston.
Speaker 2: Ma Houston--[Sinclair] is doing a tremendous job in her mother's stead but catching a living hell.  Everybody who is doing constructive measures are catching hell.

Speaker 1: All right, tell us about how you became the chair of the Cook County Board of Corrections [Cook County, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was approached on the auspices of Mr. O'Grady--Sheriff [James] O'Grady.
Speaker 1: About what year was this?
Speaker 2: I think it was '97 [1997] or '98 [1998].  I was asked to consider becoming a member of the Cook County Board of Corrections.  Was not interested because my hands were full with Probation Challenge and after praying about it at two, three a.m. in the morning the Lord spoke to my heart and said I'd like for you to become a part of that board.  Thusly, I did, I was obedient and after getting in again here's a second adventure likening to the probation department.  Too much given, much is required.  Didn't want to do anything but sit there on the board and absorb information and I mean the information was a bit much as it related to African Americans, Hispanics being in that institution and nothing being done to be of a genuine assistance.  After praying about that, I was instructed to put my name in for chairmanship.  Well the word came down anybody but Bailey and of course it was someone other than Bailey.  The second time it came up for a vote, I put my name in again.  A lady by the name of Dorothy Drish, who had been on the board since I think '67 [1967] or '68 [1968] or something like that was an old white lady who loved that system and she said that--she said why would you all elect me when there is Reverend Bailey who is concerned about the department.  She said I'll tell you what I'm going to do since I'm the chair I have the pleasure of selecting who is going to be the vice chair, I want Reverend Bailey to become the vice chair.  I want you to hear this, here I am close, I'm the vice chair.  Dorothy Drish did not live but three months after that, she died.  Who's the chair?
Speaker 1: Reverend Bailey.
Speaker 2: I inherited the chair and I remember going into the board meeting and the secretary arrogantly said--now here's a new stationary and all the board members are going to be down here and your name is going to be at the top of the board member and such and so.  I said no, no, no that's not the case.  My name should be here, up here because I am now the acting chair.  Oh yes that's true.  When it came down for an election, I became the chair and I've been sitting every since.  I think I've been chair now eleven, twelve years and I know where the skeletons are buried.

Speaker 1: Well, who all sits on that [Cook County, Illinois Board of Corrections] besides you?
Speaker 2: Well now you have a five-member board.  You have [HM] Senator Howard Brookins [Sr.]--former senator if you will, Mr. Frederick Sengstacke who was the editor of the Chicago Defender, Mr. Esequiel Iracheta who is an Hispanic gentleman who operates out of the organization SHOUT [Sheriff Hispanic Organization United Together] and another member [Gilbert Marchman] who has not been to a board meeting in over a year and that seat is empty each board meeting.  But we've been told it's alright.  That is the gentleman who reports all the news that goes out who did report all the executive sessions which is illegal went out.  He is a right-hand man to [Cook County sheriff] Michael Sheahan.  After seeing what's going on, the controversy that's at hand is the selection of a director for that department [Cook County Jail].  The letter of the law says it becomes the duty of the board to do a search committee, interview and select three names to be submitted on to the sheriff for consideration.  I worked hard to do that.  The sheriff made the declaration thank you but no thank you; I'm going to have it my way which threw us into a court situation because I refused to disobey the law.  A grand jury has come into play and was actually investigating even during that process who has said that the board obeyed the law and that Michael Sheahan disrespected the law.  And disrespecting the law has cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.  We went to court, won that, he refused to concede, depositions took place, taxpayers paying for depositions.  We went to another court, that court said Reverend Bailey and the board is right and that the lady [Callie Baird] should be out in ten days.  Then--I'm sorry it was fourteen days.  They are now taking it to the appellate court.  Well I keep saying who's paying for all this?  If he had to pay for all of it, it wouldn't have gotten to the first judge.  But taxpayers are now paying through the nose and we're being disrespected.  Not only are we being disrespected in that fashion, we are advisors to the sheriff.  How can you advise a sheriff when you don't come to the meetings?  And Mr. Fred Sengstacke had said blatantly on the record he [Marchman] refuses to sit in front of a black man for a black man to tell him or advise him what to do.  He has never made any more than four complete sessions in his entire two (unclear).  And taxpayers are paying through the nose and when you do these things, you would honestly believe that the people who you are servicing would rally behind you because you've done the right thing.  But over here in the corner you have political enemies that shoot at you, arrows to the heart and I mean it's devastating to understand how African American people can shoot at you for doing what, obeying the law and being right in obeying the law, it hurts.  But I thank God for one thing, I sleep well at night.  I have no difficulties in saying I did that which was required of me on my shift.  Now it's going through a dilemma.  They are saying that I should be out now and the sheriff has, under consideration now, another person.  Well to God be the glory, I can go home and rest.  But in a council meeting, it was established that my term is not up yet and all that is being taken under consideration.  But I say all that to say this, not only my board but you have boards all across these not so United States who are not standing up perhaps and are barring to bail(?) or doing that collective thing that I hear often, you know we're all in this thing together Bailey, no we're not all in this thing together.  I look at the Chicago Police Board, they run parallel to us.  Black man leads that board but they overlook the black contender that could be the police chief.  What's going on there?  But it didn't happen on my shift and it will never happen on my watch.

Speaker 1: Have you been able to form any kind of alliance with other like minded groups to maybe put some pressure in the right spots?
Speaker 2: Well you have the grand jury.  The grand jury came down with a finding of wrongdoing and I'm just wondering at this point who's going to be indicted and who's going to jail.  If, in fact, it was you or I, we would have been in jail a long time ago.  You just cannot blatantly break the law and walk away.  Spending taxpayers' dollars and its cents and say all is well.  If you do and it is allowed then there is a double standard in this country that's being pointed out again.  History is being making--in the making as we speak.  No one has ever come against the powers that be, let alone a black man and has won a case.  I can understand why there's a fight.
Speaker 1: Recently charges were filed against John Burge--criminal charges.  It's been like years--it's been over ten years since he lost his job or was retired by the police department, I think that's how they put it.  Do you see these public officials being increasingly more vulnerable now, than they used to be?
Speaker 2: Most certainly, yes.  As I said earlier, there is a season for all things.  There's a season to be silent, a season to speak out.  It is now a season to speak out and I dare say that people have underestimated the powers and the mindset of African Americans.  We have been quiet, passive, if you will.  And I think some people have taken advantage of that and they have not moved a mile, they have gone into places they should have never been because of our silence well that's our fault but enough is enough.  Young people are suffering as a result of a foolishness being perpetrated on us.  Adults are waking up; I'm receiving calls from everywhere, anonymous and otherwise thanking me for standing up being a man.  Now since this incident has taken place, I have even been under police protection because strange incidents have taken place that has put my life in jeopardy.  But I'm still standing up, crying loud and sparing not.  Where does it end is my question.  There are some people who are fighting for it never to end.  I'm saying enough is enough, set these young folk free.  Put them back into college, put them back into school, let them get grants and scholarships, let them go on to a productive way of living.  But you know there's a hidden hand that says we don't want that.
Story_ID: 131187
Speaker 1: We ask this question in every interview and maybe--the question is what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today, as if we don't know after all this time, what are they?
Speaker 2: I'd like to see these young people turn from their wicked ways and go back to God and live happy ever after and they can.  I'd like to see them build up the schools and all these educational institutions.  You know we use to do that, there was once upon a time there was not an available seat in school for us.  I'd like to see a revisiting of that.  I'd like to see the young folk walk the streets and not be afraid to speak.  Now it is gangs involved.  You've got to do this and you've got to do that.  I'd just like to see love abound once again before I leave this planet.  Do I believe it can happen? If I did not believe it could happen, I wouldn't be sitting here with you today.   I wouldn't be taking on the responsibilities of such a massive headache as we've gotten on the scene if I didn't believe that we could turn back to God and make things right.
Speaker 1: Okay when you look back on everything you've done so far, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yes I'd put jails and prisons out of business.  I would make them a thing of the past because they represent, in my mind, a thing called plantation all over again and it is a plantation.
Speaker 1: You're trying to do that, I think you're trying to do that but is there any major thing that you would do in your career differently than you're doing?
Speaker 2: No. I've followed the lead of the Lord that's all I want to do.
Speaker 1: Okay now you have a family.  You don't talk much about your family do you want to tell us something about your family?
Speaker 2: Well I'm sitting here with a broken family because of my love of my work.  I was divorced simply because my wife did not understand how I could separate myself from the family to do a love for all young people.  My son and my daughter did not understand at an early age.  My son before his demise understood and appreciated as does my daughter at this point.  She understands emphatically clear that there has to be leadership in this.  I would not change any of that.  I would minister just to people who go through dilemmas like that, you have a choice.  Do you obey God or do you obey man and you have to count up the cost before it's too late.  I made the decision to obey God.  Did it hurt, yes it did hurt.  Would I go back and righten [sic] that, no.  The pain has gone; I have a love for the people.
Speaker 1: Okay likewise, what would you see at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would like people to see that I made a difference, a constructive difference with African Americans, Hispanics and unfortunate whites in the jails and in the prisons.  I would like them to say that that old man made a difference in my life and had he not done what he did, I wouldn't be who I am today.
Story_ID: 131188
Speaker 1: Okay. Now we know your father [Adolphus Jerome Bailey, Sr.] died before you got--well just as you were getting started with Probation Challenge, right?  But your mother [Lillian Cotry Bailey]--what does your mother think about the work you're doing?
Speaker 2: My mother's proud.  Initially she was terribly upset, did not understand the intricacies of people coming against you when you do the right thing, it frightened her.  But now she's gotten angry--Godly angry and she is now my person to go on their knees with fervent prayer for me and that's what I need.  She's a little afraid; she's a source of encouragement for me--prayerful encouragement for me.
Speaker 1: Okay our last question is there anything else you need to tell us before we get to the last question?  Is there something that we've forgot to ask or something we haven't covered?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: I think you mentioned earlier that you founded a professional singing group and I don't think we've discussed that, right?
Speaker 2: I recorded years ago with the Harold Bailey Singers.  It started with Hob, H-O-B Recording Company and had a hit called 'Since Jesus Came into My Heart.'  It hit the top of the charts.  It won me a recording company--I'm sorry, let me strike that again because it's not the case.  I first recorded for a company called Rush, R-U-S-H and from Rush Recording Company, I went to Hob out of Detroit [Michigan] and from there I went to Savoy.  Savoy was at that time the largest recording company for gospel music.  I travelled all around the world with the Harold Bailey Singers pioneering.  At that time you had very few people out on the road.  You had, for example, Gospel Harmonettes, James Cleveland, The Caravans, The Mighty Clouds of Joy and the Roberta Martin Singers and some others.  I tell you just a few.  And I did that to the best of my ability but the Lord called me away from that to the ministry.  Was I delighted, no. It was a tearful separation because I loved what I was doing.  The Lord gave me a better job to do.
Speaker 1: Do you still play?
Speaker 2: I have not touched a keyboard in years.  It was a dilemma with me.  When the Lord called me to the ministry as if anyone can proposition God, I said Lord if you can take my love for the keyboard away, I'll do what you would have me to do.  As if anything is too hard for God.  He took my love away.  I don't touch the keyboard, very seldom do I touch the keyboard and now I'm in a different arena.
Speaker 1: Okay the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person who feared the Lord.  "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." [Proverbs 9:10]

Speaker 1: This is a photo that was taken in Greenville, South Carolina.  It is with the Intercessory Center headed up by Pastor Lottie Hall.  This organization was formed from the vision of Probation Challenge and that's dealing with young men and women at an earlier age so that they would not happen to have to come this way.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: Is it on there, I think it's on there?  This was three years ago, so that's what?

Speaker 1: The same time.  This is a picture of my daughter, Brandy Nicole Bailey and her father.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay what was the occasion?

Who came to the city of Chicago [Illinois] and much of it was under the auspices of The Mumford Point Marines coupled together with Reverend Bailey and Probation Challenge.
Speaker 2: And here is a presentation of an award to the late Mayor Harold Washington.  Here is that award being presented to Mayor Washington by Astronaut Bolden and just in back of him you will note that of myself, Reverend Harold Bailey with the Mumford Point Marines in attendance.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of years ago when the Xerox Corporation endorsed the Probation Challenge program and presented us with a sizable check to keep us afloat.  To the right is [Calumet Park, Illinois mayor] Mr. Joe Dupar who was chairing a committee at that time; Mr. Harry Bettner [ph.] president then of Xerox and myself to the left.
Speaker 2: Here is the Xerox family who flew in for the occasion of our annual affair, one of our very first.  All the big executives--big guns, if you will, came in.

Speaker 1: Here you have the late Mayor Harold Washington applauding my work at our annual event and right to the side he is speaking and having one of his fun times with Merri Dee and myself looking on.  Here is a very serious conversation going on that took in the future of Probation Challenge, I'll never forget it.  The mayor and myself were huddled together talking in terms of the future of this program.
Speaker 2: Here is my mother and my late son, I might add--no apologies for this, this is when I was caught up in spiritual awareness if you understand me. I didn't intend for those pictures to be taken. And, let's see some other--
Speaker 1: This is my son and daughter here at another occasion.  This is the Xerox Illinois Black Caucus who supported Probation Challenge down through the many years.
