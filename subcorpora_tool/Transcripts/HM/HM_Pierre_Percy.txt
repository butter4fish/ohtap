Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think it's the 12th, is it of September.
Speaker 1: Well, it's the 13th.
Speaker 2: The 13th, okay.  The 13th of September, 2012.
Speaker 1: And, where are we, at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], the law office of Skadden and a few other people.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  That's good.
Story_ID: 24515
Speaker 1: Alright now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as sort of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do; it's gumbo.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: It depends upon where I am; in Michigan, I like summers; in New Orleans [Louisiana], I like falls and spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not a place I go to--go back to.  I like traveling to different places.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I try not to repeat myself.
Story_ID: 24516
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately, so we don't get them mixed up, and then we will put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Rosa Villavaso; R-O-S-A.  That's Rosa, Villavaso is V-I-L-L-A-V-A-S-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in the same place I was born; St. James Parish, Louisiana.  She was born August 29, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I can trace her family back quite far because I spent a lot of time doing genealogy on both my mother and my father.  On my mother's side of the family, her grandparents were all born slaves, and I can go through them one at a time.  There was Augastan Villavaso, Constance Fostal, Arthur Nicole and Rosa Butler.  All four of those people were born slaves, and I can go back from there, depending on how far you want me to go.
Speaker 1: Well, how far back can you trace her side?
Speaker 2: My mother's side, I can trace some African American ancestors on my mother's side, I can find Polish, I can find Italian, I can find French, and I can find some African Americans, some U.S. African Americans.  On my father's side I found an African.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't want to go on his side yet--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I want to just stay with your mother's side right now.
Speaker 2: There are some stories about these people.  You might wonder where the names came from; where Villavaso came from, well, my mother's grandfather was born on the Villavaso plantation.  The Villavaso plantation was owned by the grandson of a army officer by the name of Villavaso who came to Louisiana when the Spanish took over Louisiana after the French and Indian war about 1765.  And he--his son married a local woman whose father owned a plantation, and that's how the Villavaso plantation came about.  Now Villavaso was from Bilbao, Spain.  Bilbao, Spain is in the northern part of Spain; it's in the Basque territory.  So that's the Villavaso side.
Speaker 1: And how far does that--does that date back to the 18th century?
Speaker 2: The first Villavaso came over here around 1770.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, my mother's grandfather's mother was born in New Orleans [Louisiana], baptized in St. Louis Cathedral.  Her father, and she was a slave; she was the daughter of a slave who had been brought from Haiti to New Orleans by her owner, who originally was from France, from a little town in southern France called Tar near the Pyrenees [mountain range between France and Spain].  So this Guillion DuPerrie(sp) migrated from southern France to Haiti; was kicked out of Haiti and brought with him a slave, a woman, Marianne, and had three children by Marianne, and when he died, his successors sold them.  And one was Elizabeth; she was sold into the Villavaso plantation.  So that's how Elizabeth DuPerrie(sp) met Gestav Villavaso.  I can tell you all kinds of stories.
Speaker 1: So did this French ancestor who was in Haiti, did he leave because of the Haitian revolution?
Speaker 2: As far as I can tell, he did; he came to New Orleans in the early 1800s, and there was a tremendous migration from Haiti when the Haitians kicked out all whites, and the migration from Haiti was first to Cuba and then from Cuba to New Orleans.  And the migration was so large that half the population of New Orleans at that time was from Haiti, so he was part of that migration.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a huge number of people, and they were rich.
Speaker 2: Now, it was illegal for him to import slaves, but he did, and nobody said a word.  Now the slave trade had been abolished at that time, presumably, but he did bring Marianne with him; had three children by her, Elizabeth being one, who when Guillion died, she was sold to the Villavasos.  So you want more stories?
Speaker 1: Sure, yes.
Speaker 2: This was on my mother's side.  Now, she had a--one grandfather on my mother's side was Arthur Nicol.  Now his father was a plantation owner; his father did not own him, but he was his father.  His name was Takeley Nicol or Nicolas.  Takeley was the grandson of a man by the name of Louis Nicolas Lubeslovic.  Louis Nicolas Lubeslovic came from Sicily where he had been chased from--where he arrived after being chased from Poland.  And his--no actually his father had been chased from Poland.  So Louis Nicolas Lubeslovic was born in Sicily to an Italian mother and a Polish person who had been chased away.  The son of that marriage migrated to Louisiana in the late 1700s, and again, owned a plantation and was the father of Arthur Nicole.
Speaker 1: So you're starting to really--now, you were really illustrating what a mix is in New Orleans--in Louisiana in those days; the city that over which flew one, two, three, what four flags, at least?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it started French, it went Spanish and then back to French and then U.S., so four flags.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Africans involved and all kinds of Europeans.  Who would have guessed a Polish slave owner would have come through.
Speaker 2: There were a lot of migrants to the United States, and they came from all over Europe, and there were lots of Germans in Louisiana, and I don't have German ancestry, but, yeah, that's all on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my mother's grandmother, I think, was African, pure African.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Descendant from--born in the United States, but with no mixture of Caucasian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's like one out of four grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The others were mixed.  One was not mixed, on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: This says something about plantation life in those days--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the population that's here right now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24517
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Rosa Villavaso] grew up in St. James Parish [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now what did her parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: Her father was a--they lived on a plantation, and his--he was a supervisor and managed some of the workers.  My mother's father was born in 1880, so he was not born a slave, but his family continues to live on the plantation until he died, frankly.
Speaker 1: And, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Ferdinand Villavaso.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: She was a Nicolas.  She was the daughter of Arthur Nicole and Rosa Butler--she was perhaps a little younger, born in the 1880s, maybe.  I can get an exact date for you.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Odalie; O-D-A-L-I-E.
Speaker 1: O-D-A-L--
Speaker 2: I-E.
Speaker 1: --I-E.  Okay.  Did your mother grow up on that plantation?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of the plantation?  Was this the--
Speaker 2: Hanaman; H-A-N-A-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did they grow there?
Speaker 2: Sugarcane, was the main crop in that whole area.  I'm sure they grew other things, but sugarcane was the cash crop.
Speaker 1: What did your mother say about growing up?  Did she describe her life or talk about what it was like?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was a very smart girl, intellectually curious; did extremely well in school, but only went to the eighth grade, because there was no high school in that area.  For her to go to high school, she would have had to leave the country and go to New Orleans, and that was--that was just not the opportunity.  So she was always committed to education and was determined that her children would be educated.  She was the driving force with respect to education in my early years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know what kind of work she did.  Typically, all members of the family would have to help out.  My grandfather had his own plots, I mean, for growing his own vegetables and beans and watermelons; I suspect my mother helped with that.  He had cows for milk; I'm sure she couldn't milk a cow; so she lived on a farm and did farm-type things, I'm sure.
Story_ID: 24518
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Percy Pierre.  Percy Pierre, Sr.  He went by senior.
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in St. James, same place.  He was actually born in St. James Parish, but a place called Freetown [Louisiana].  I could tell you about Freetown.  And he was born March 8, 1912.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a story.  Now once again, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side, and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I know a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On my father's side I was able to identify an African ancestor.  I can tell you about her.  I identified her by finding a document that described her being sold, and that document is 1790.  Because slaves were property, there were sales documents that were descriptive of the people being sold, sex and age and origins.  So this document, which is--the original is in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, describes her, and it says she's from Mozambique.  She was of the Macau tribe, and the Macau tribe is a Mozambiquan tribe; what is currently Mozambique; it's in the northern part of Mozambique.  It's a tribe that--it was an inland tribe, and the coastal tribes preyed on that inland tribe and captured them and sold them into slavery, primarily, French slavers, who transported them to the Americas.  Now, most of the slave trade came from West Africa, but there were slaves that came from East Africa, as far as Mozambique.  So when--I don't know her original name, but when she got here, she was named Terrese, T-E-R-R-E-S-E, and she was in Ascension Parish, and that's where I found her, around 1790.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was already an adult, so she was born twenty-two years prior to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's interesting. This is the first person, I think I've heard, who can trace their ancestry to Mozambique.  Now, ironically, though, well, this is a note, I mean, there are like--I've interviewed about four people who are from Arkansas or Louisiana who can trace their ancestry to Medagascar, which is off the coast from Mozambique, which is interesting, because when I first heard the story, you know, you say Madagascar, how could that, you know, you just don't--you don't really hear about that, but after I heard it about four or five times, I said it must be something to it.  So Mozambique and Maqua, that's spelled M-A-Q-U-A?
Speaker 2: Q-U-A is one way of writing it; Maqua.
Speaker 1: So it could be M-A-K-W-A, I guess?
Speaker 2: K-O-U or M-A-K-O-U, or something like that.  I forget how it was written in that record.  It might have been a M-A-C-A-U, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Are they still a group, or are they still recognized as a tribal group?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a language group, a tribal group.  They are still there.  I've planned to go visit, but I haven't gotten there yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So she was enslaved in Ascension Parish, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, what else--who else?
Speaker 2: Well, if I trace that line, she had a daughter, Pelagie, P-E-L-A-G-I-E, who's also mentioned in that same 1790 record.  Pelagie had a son whose name was Pierre, and Pierre was baptized about 1806, and I have a church record of his baptism, and he was listed as "Pierre, son of Pelagie, slave of Dubois."  So Pierre was his first name.  To jump ahead, Pierre survived until after the [American] civil war, and his children took his first name as their sir name, and that's why my name is Pierre.  So Pierre was not a last name; it's not a surname, but my great-great grandfather's children said they had to take a surname, and some people took the surname of the plantation owner, but these folks took the surname of their father.
Speaker 1: He's taken ownership of his name, I guess, in some ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because some people made up names, and there are a lot of black Washingtons, because a lot of people took George Washington's name.  There's a funny story about that from one of our HistoryMakers.  So Pierre is from this ancestor, Pierre?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Great-great grandfather.
Speaker 1: He goes back to--when did you say he was born, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: About 1805.
Speaker 1: Okay, about 1805.  So, well, move us on up to your grandparents, maybe--.
Speaker 2: Well, let me do my great grandparents.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And they're four of them, right, on my father's side.  One is Pierre's son whose name was Adolphe, A-D-O-L-P-H-E, another was Sara Washington,  and Sara's father came from Virginia, another was Alexis Greqoie, Gregoie being  G-R-E-G-O-I-E; and the last one was Mary Ragou; all four of those people were born slaves; Mary Ragou, R-A-G-O-U.  If I come back to the Pierre line, my great-grandfather Adolphe had a son, Adolphe, who's my grandfather and then Pierre.  So that's how that line went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather on your father's side is Adolph Pierre, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Celeste Gregoie.
Story_ID: 24519
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your ancestors on your father's [Percy Pierre, Sr.] side do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, they were all farmers, but let me tell you some stories.  I mentioned Freetown [Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 2: When slaves were freed in Louisiana, most stayed on the plantation.  In fact the military encouraged them to stay on the plantation.  The military actually negotiated contracts between the freed slaves and the plantation owners because the military wanted the plantations to continue to function.  But some slaves did not want to live on the plantation.  And after a while, a group of them got together and bought some land for them to live off the plantation.  Now this land was not a plantation, it was just land; so they built houses.  So the Pierre side of my family comes from this land that they called Freetown, because it was a place of freedom, so that's where my great-grandfather, Adolphe Pierre and Sara Washington lived.  Sara Washington's father, George Washington, who came from Virginia, and the Pierres organized a benevolent society to take care of each other.  And the first thing they did was to collect money so they could bury each other.  But that benevolent society still exists.  So that was sort of on that side.  Now on my grandmother's side, Celeste Gregoie--
Speaker 1: Can I just stop you for a second and just focus on the benevolent society; they still have it; it still exists now?
Speaker 2: The Freetown benevolent society, still exists, yes.
Speaker 1: Is it for the general public or is it for just the people and family--
Speaker 2: Well, the people who live--
Speaker 1: --who live in Freetown?
Speaker 2: --in Freetown, and Freetown is very small, you know, there are fewer than probably a couple of hundred people there.  But when the benevolent society was really functioning, they had a hall where they had meetings, and, you know, where they would have Sunday dinners and things like that, you know, it was an example of the spirit of self-help and pride, and, you know, my people had a lot to do with that attitude among the freed slaves.
Speaker 1: So they owned a hall there now.  There name for the hall, was it called--
Speaker 2: I don't recall the name.  Their society--I have the charter--they had a charter for their society, and I forget what it's called.  It's probably called Freetown Benevolent Society, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they built a hall so that they could meet.  The society still exists, and they do--they do meet.  Now, that wasn't the only benevolent society up and down the river.  You know, Freetown was along the river.  The geography of that area was--there was a river, there was levy and there was a road next to the levy, and everything was on that road.  So up and down that road, between New Orleans and Donaldsonville, there were many benevolent societies; Freetown was just one of those, and each benevolent society had a hall where they could meet, but also where they could socialize and have Sunday events.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is different from a lot of communities.  A lot of communities were organized around church, you know, and make the church their site of, you know, their collective activities of a small community.
Speaker 2: Well that's interesting, because Louisiana was different in that Louisiana was Catholic, and the Catholic church was dominated by the white population.  So, you know, the Catholic church would not be a place that they would come together on.  And I hadn't thought about that, but that might be the reason why they had separate halls.  Now, there were some Baptist churches, but you know, the majority of the population at that time was Catholic, and today, you know, maybe people come around the Baptist churches, and today, the Catholic church in St. James Parish is dominated by black people, so it is more of a social hub, but back when I was born, it was--everything was run by the white population; it was not a place where we could gather very easily.
Speaker 1: Right, so if the community wanted to handle its own business, it would have to have it's own place?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Hadn't thought about that, but that makes sense.
Speaker 1: Okay. I didn't dream that you had an ancestor named George Washington either, when I was talking about the George Washington naming, I didn't know it.  That's a common--
Speaker 2: All black folks in Virginia were called Washington, right (laughter)? A lot of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is really--now, you're really giving us some deep history here that's really meaningful about this period of time; how black people organizing themselves for their own benefit.
Story_ID: 24520
Speaker 1: Yes, tell us more about Freetown [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a period after the [American] civil war, of reconstruction [Reconstruction Era], where, you know, African Americans were given the--some power.  The chief civil officer in the parish of St. James [Parish, Louisiana] was the sheriff.  There was a period just after the civil war when the sheriff was an African American, who was also a member of the Freetown society.  So the Freetown Benevolent Society was very influential in St. James.  Now, of course, you understand, there came a time when all blacks were kicked out of office, and there was no longer a black sheriff, and for the next 150 years or so, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --initially, right after--when reconstruction was in, there was a black sheriff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I've seen the poster of the elected officials from Louisiana, at least some of them, those in the legislature, P.B.S. Pinchback and O.J. Dunn, I mean, so black people were in the highest rungs of government during reconstruction in Louisiana.  O.J. Dunn was Lieutenant Governor.  These gains were not rolled back without violence.
Speaker 2: There was violence.  Yeah, I don't know of anyone--well, my grandfather, Adolphe [Pierre], the second one, there are two Adolphes; the second one is my grandfather.  He talked about in the early 1900s, the Klu Klux Klan's members raiding black communities; you know, little black communities; so I do know about that.
Story_ID: 24521
Speaker 1: Now, one of the  proudest things that I can--one of my best memories was when I was a youngster, I would go out to the country and stay with my grandparents, my grandfather Adolphe [Pierre], in particular.  Adolphe's uncle, Dick Washington, would come to visit.  Dick Washington was an old man; we're talking about the late 40s [1940s], 1940s early 50s [1950s].  I found out later that Dick Washington was born a slave, so I met a relative who was born a slave, one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It just kind of--was not that far away, is it?
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's a link.  I mean, I see his face now, and this man was born a slave.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did Uncle Dick Washington have any stories he shared with you?
Speaker 1: No.  He just talked to my grandfather.  I was a kid, and I don't remember any.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Your father [Percy Pierre, Sr.] grew up in Freetown [Louisiana].  What did he say about growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, my father was born in Freetown, but his father--I'll give you another story, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: These folks in Freetown were very independent, and my grandfather Adolphe had brothers; George was a brother and Tolefield(sp), he had brothers.  During the First World War, before the United States got into the war, there was a great demand from Europe to  supply food to both sides of the war.  People were getting rich in the United States, sending food to the British, and sending food to the Germans.  So sharecropping became very lucrative.  So the people in Freetown were sharecroppers; I mean, they didn't own anything, they just owned the plot where they lived.  My uncle George decided to make a lot of money so he could buy himself a farm.  And my grandfather Adolph, he was making a lot of money; everybody was making a lot of money, because prices were up, and they could sell all of the food they wanted.  So George got some money together, and he found a farm, and he decided to buy it.  Well, when it came to closing the deal, he didn't have enough money and my grandfather Adolphe joined with him, so they bought this farm.  So Adolphe and George shared the farm.  So my father grew up on that farm; he was born in Freetown just this little house and lot, but they had a farm.  Now, the farm was not that big, because all farms were linear.  The shape of a farm was, you had a frontage on the road, and that frontage might have been 200 feet, 300 feet, and then your land went back towards the swamp as far as you can go.  So you could grow some crops on that, but it was not a big farm, but it was their farm.  And my grandfather had horses and pigs and chickens, so my father grew up in a farm-type environment.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The difference was, they were tending their own--
Speaker 1: It was their own farm, yeah.
Speaker 2: --livestock.  It was their own farm.
Speaker 1: I'm sure some of them went out and worked in the fields to earn money, but my grandfather Adolphe, until the day he died at eighty-four, was still farming.  He still liked to go out and turn some soil and grow something.  He used to grow shallot, you know, these green onions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, great big--
Speaker 1: And he would take them to Donaldsonville [Ascension Parish, Louisiana] and sell them.  So it was a farming culture.
Story_ID: 24522
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father [Percy Pierre, Sr.] have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: My father went to third grade.  Now, he regrets that he never finished, but he was only able to go to third grade--finish third grade.
Speaker 1: So, did he then learn to read or write?
Speaker 2: With difficulty, he learned to read and write; he did not like to write.  He had my mother [Rosa Villavaso] write, but he read the newspapers.  He was able to read enough to read the newspapers.  My father was a very smart man, and was singled out by a carpenter in the country as an apprentice.  So my father learned carpentry and was very good at it.  And he taught me some, and I'm pretty good at it too.
Speaker 1: Did you father serve in the war [World War II]?
Speaker 2: No.  I was born in 1939; that was the beginning of the war.  He did not have to go.
Story_ID: 24523
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright. Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Is there a story?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, there is a story, and my mother [Rosa Villavaso] tells the story.  My mother is deceased now, but when my mother was fifteen years old, her mother became very ill.  Her mother was Odalie Nicolas.  And I don't know what she died of, but she became very ill.  But while she was ill, my father [Percy Pierre, Sr.] came to bring her some milk, because they didn't have milk. So that's the first time my mother met my father, because they lived about, you know, two miles apart along the river road [in St. James Parish, Louisiana]; so that's how they met.  Later on my father worked on the Hanaman plantation, where my mother lived.  And, they got married in 1937.  My mother was, what, twenty-two, and I guess, my father was twenty-five, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, he worked on that plantation, but they first met when my father brought milk to her mother who was ill, that's the story she tells.
Story_ID: 24524
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did they [Pierre's parents, Rosa Villavaso and Percy Pierre, Sr.] live the balance of their lives there in St. James Parish?
Speaker 2: No.  When--when they got married, my--I have an older sister, she was born, and then I was born, and the notion was that they would build a house on my grandfather's farm, because there was lots of land you can build a house.  Everybody was going--all of his children were going to gather around him, because my grandfather was the patriarch, his idea was, gather your brothers around you; gather your children around you, so my father built a house on the farm, but when I was two, he left the farm, and took a job in Gulfport, Missippippi as a--at a motel, as a handyman, porter, so the family; my father and mother, me and my older sister moved to Gulfport, actually, between Gulfport and Biloxi.  We lived on the Gulf [of Mexico], right on the beach at a, what was called a tourist court; it was collection of cottages that was a precursor of motels, and my father was the all-around handyman there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we interviewed a medical doctor from Gulfport, who was one of the people responsible for integrating the beach in Gulfport; you probably know him, I don't know; you might have heard of him.  I can't think of his name right now, but I will, at some point.  But these beaches are segregated, right?
Speaker 2: Here's the deal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was a maid at the motel.  Maids could take their children--well, there were white children at the motel.  The owner of the motel--they lived--everybody lived at the motel, and there were white children.  So my mother could go--, take the white children to the beach and bring her children.  So it wasn't totally segregated, I mean, but, you know, the maids could take the children to the beach.
Speaker 1: Of course, all of these arrangements are--we look back on them all right, in saying--I'm going to say, when you think of America's race relations in those days, how one thing is wrong and then in another context it's okay, you know, it just doesn't make a lot of sense.  But that's okay.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't totally rational.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: We used to go crabbing.  There were piers out into the water.  These were piers where boats could dock at the end of the pier, and we used to go crabbing on those piers.  And I don't know whey we were allowed to crab; I'm sure somebody could have told us not to do it, but my mother and the family--whole family would take a big wash tub out on the pier and crab all day, and fill up a wash tub full of crabs, and that was good eating when those crabs came home.  So that was an idyllic period of my life from age two to four.  I was not in school and life was good.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question.  Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their hobbies, talents, looks; who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Half and half.  My father [Percy Pierre, Sr.] was, I wouldn't say quiet, but not as aggressive and ambitious as I am.  My mother [Rosa Villavaso] was very aggressive and ambitious.  So, I take some things from my mother.  And now my father taught me a hell of a lot about life and about carpentry and about getting things done.  You know a lot of my values came from my father, because I spent a lot of time with him growing up, and time with his family and this notion of family is very strong with me, and that came from him, from his father, from my uncles, so he had a lot of influence on me.
Story_ID: 24526
Speaker 1: Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Two sisters.
Speaker 1: Two sisters, okay.  And they are younger than you?
Speaker 2: One older, one younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: The older one is a year older than I am.  She's a nun, and the younger one is like six years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did have a lot of--so you didn't have to--you spent a lot of time with your father [Percy Pierre, Sr.], because you were the only boy?
Speaker 2: Only boy.
Speaker 1: I guess so, and you're a junior, too?  That makes sense.
Speaker 2: I didn't go by junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just as my grandfather gathered his brothers around him, my uncle Alec, gathered his brothers around him.  So I grew up in a neighborhood of my father and one, two, three, four uncles, so that family village is part of my growing up too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not just my father.
Speaker 1: So a lot of cousins, as well?
Speaker 2: Lots of cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And cousins who I ran into everyday, and not just cousins but, you know, sort of grew up with them.
Story_ID: 24527
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is Gulfport [Mississippi], and going to the beach, walking in the piney woods, picking blackberries along the railroad track, having a crab feast of stuffed crabs and boiled crabs and crab gumbo, and--so those were my earliest memories, yeah.
Story_ID: 24528
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you grow up between Gulfport and Biloxi [Mississippi] there?
Speaker 2: We spent two years there; moved to New Orleans [Louisiana] when I was four.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where did you live in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: 1016 Dufossett Street.  Dufossett, D-U-F-O-S-S-E-T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where would that be in New Orleans in relationship to what we know today, that would be like towards the center of the town?
Speaker 2: Well, it's ten blocks from the river where my father [Percy Pierre, Sr.] worked on the river front.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would that be in an area that was the ninth ward?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no; it's what we would call uptown, right off of Magazine Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you grow up at 1016 Dufossett?
Speaker 2: Until second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because 1016 Dufossett was where my Uncle Alec lived; he had a family; two girls and aunt, his wife.  My father moved in with is family; there were five of us in a two-room house, and my father decided he wanted to leave.  And he built a house on Hamilton Street, and we moved there in 1947.  So we were on Dufossett Street from like '43 [1943] to '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: So you were about nine--eight or nine?
Speaker 2: Forty--, seven, about eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe the house your dad built?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I helped him build it.  The one on Hamilton Street.  It's called the shotgun double with a camel back. It's the shape of a shotgun double with a camel back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Kind of give us some details about it?
Speaker 2: Okay.  In New Orleans land is precious and you've got to squeeze the houses together, so we had a lot that was thirty feet wide and 120 feet deep.  So the house, you had to have an alley on either side of three feet; so that's six feet of alley, so the house was twenty-four feet wide, and originally, it had three rooms and a bath on each side, so a double means two apartments; shotgun means you walk--there's--there's no hallway.  You go from one room to the next room to the next room; not a lot of privacy.  So if somebody's sleeping in the bedroom, you walk through their bedroom, so that's--and it's called a shotgun, because normally, if you look through the front door, you can look straight through the house in the back door, which means you could shoot a shotgun through the house and not hit anything; that's why it's called the shotgun.  It wasn't quite what we had, but--now, later on my father added the camel back, and I was more involved in the camel back.  The camel back is a second level on the back of the house with a roofline that is perpendicular to the roofline of the main shotgun double.  So, I was heavily involved in the camel back; the original shotgun, I was much less involved.
Speaker 1: So is the camel back like a dormer or something?
Speaker 2: Well, it's called that because it looks like a hump.  If you look at the house, the original house had a roof that went back.  If you put a second floor and a roof on that second floor that's perpendicular to the roof on the house, it looks like a hump on a camel, that's why it's called a--
Speaker 1: Okay, a camel back?
Speaker 2: I can draw it for you.  (laughing)
Speaker 1: I can envision it pretty good, I think.
Speaker 2: That's what it's called.
Story_ID: 24529
Speaker 1: Well, we always ask this question.  Can you describe the neighborhood you lived in, who was there, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I described the neighborhood in Gulfport [Mississippi] that was a motel, which as a kid, not in school, loved it.  In New Orleans [Louisiana], when we moved to New Orleans, the Dufossett Street neighborhood, it turned out that many of our neighbors were white, even though it was a segregated community, residentially, we were not segregated, so there were white people on either side of us.  There was a grocery store on every--almost on every corner.  So, when my mother went to the store, she went daily to buy the things for today.  We used to go and get, what do you call these, snow pops (laughing).  So the sights and sounds, you know, trees, oak trees, just pleasant uptown on Dufossett Street; that's the old section of town.  When we moved to Hamilton Street, that was boondocks, not old, new, new land.  But once my uncles built all the houses, and once the lots filled in, it was a vibrant community; a new community.  You know, most of the houses, when I was there, were probably less than twenty years old, but lots of kids.
Speaker 1: Was that like a mixed neighborhood too?
Speaker 2: There was a boundary.  On one side of the boundary was black; called black, on the other side was all white, and we lived on the boundary.  Because the oldest sections of town were very mixed.  The newer sections were more segregated.
Speaker 1: What was the boundary?
Speaker 2: Actually, the boundary was the back of our house.  We were on a block, and everybody on the opposite side of the block was white, and everybody on our side of the block was black. And then if you continued towards the black side, it was all black and continued to the white side, it was all white, so it was sort of the boundary.
Story_ID: 24530
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Started grade school at Blessed Sacrament School when I was on Dufossett Street [New Orleans, Louisiana].  I went to kindergarten, first and started second grade at Blessed Sacrament.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when we moved to Hamilton Street, I switched to St. Joan of Arc Catholic School, and I finished elementary school at St. Joan of Arc.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went from third grade to eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from second to eighth.
Speaker 1: Okay, from second to eighth.  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  My mother [Rosa Villavaso] insisted that I like school (laughing).  I liked school.  My mother insisted that I do homework; I didn't necessarily like homework, but my sister and I, as I said, were one year apart, and she made sure we did all our homework, so, but I liked school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Later on, I liked basketball more than school, but, I liked school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there any particular teachers, you know--
Speaker 2: In grade school?
Speaker 1: --yeah, that were like important?
Speaker 2: In first grade, Sister Thomas, my first teacher; a little--very short white woman; in seventh grade, Sister Frances Pollar.  I was having a lot of fun in seventh grade and my--Sister Frances Pollar talked to my mother at PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] meeting and changed my life.  Sister Louisette, who was my eighth grade teacher was influential.
Speaker 1: Were most of the students black students, too?
Speaker 2: All black.  These were segregated, so you know, through high school, I went to segregated schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Most of your teachers were white nuns?
Speaker 2: At Blessed Sacrament they were white; at St. Joan of Arc, they were black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a particular order that ran St. Joan of Arc?
Speaker 2: St. Joan of Arc were the Sisters of the Holy Family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at Blessed Sacrament, it was the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.
Story_ID: 24531
Speaker 1: Alright, so, you're in school.  So, did you have a favorite subject or activity in school; in grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school.  I liked math and I liked science; math and science, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they did offer some science then in school?
Speaker 2: I do recall some science courses, mainly science out of the encyclopedia; we didn't have any laboratories or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had to do math and English, and those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you like to do otherwise, in the neighborhood, I mean, besides--now, had you started playing basketball yet, in grade school?
Speaker 2: I started playing basketball, probably in fourth grade, maybe even earlier, because, I was also an alter boy, and as an alter boy, I had to arrive early for 6:30 mass, and between 6:00, 7:00 o-clock and when school started, we played basketball, and then at noon, we played basketball, so we played basketball, basketball, basketball.  I played on an organized team in the seventh and eighth grade, and eighth grade, I was captain of the team, and we won the city Catholic league championship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What position did you play?
Speaker 2: I was probably playing center, at that point, center or forward.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were saying you were one of the tallest kids in class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: And, how tall are you now?
Speaker 2: Six feet half inch.
Speaker 1: Okay, but then you were the tallest one?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes, yes.  Well, today, they wouldn't let me play center, because I'm not tall enough.
Speaker 1: Right, it's pretty ironic isn't it?  But in those days, you were pretty tall.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24532
Speaker 1: Alright, so, what else did you like to do; did you like to read?
Speaker 2: In the seventh and eighth grade, I enjoyed reading, but we didn't have a library; we didn't have books.  There was a mobile library that came around to loan books every now and then.  The first book I read was a book--I read my text books, I read the encyclopedia.  I enjoyed just reading encyclopedia.  But the first real book I read was the story of Roald Amundsen, the man who was the first man to reach the South Pole.  And that book I got from a bookmobile, a van that came around and loaned us books.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, here's somebody going, you know, to a place that's a lot different from New Orleans, to the South Pole.  So was it because it was a place that was so different, so far away?
Speaker 2: Was that why I liked the book?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I liked the book--I'll tell you why I liked the book, because I resonated with Amundsen's preparation.  Now the story of the South Pole exploration includes a man by the name of Scott who is British, who was racing Amundsen to the South Pole.  Amundsen got there, got back alive; Scott got there second and died.  Amundsen was an engineer.  Now, he was not trained as an engineer, but he thought like an engineer.  The reason he got there and back alive was because he thought like an engineer, and I liked that thinking.
Speaker 1: Now, how is that?  Now, how would an engineer handle this, rather than a say, poor guy like me?
Speaker 2: Scott thought it was a matter of bravery.  You get brave men, and they would endure whatever hardships they had to endure.  Amundsen said, you know, to hell with that; I'm not going to endure, I will prepare.  I'll give you an example, and this is--animal lovers may not like this, but Scott decided that he would use ponies, Shetland ponies to carry his supplies, because Shetland ponies endured the cold very well.  Amundsen said he would use dogs.  Now, Shetland ponies had never been in Antarctica.  Amundsen had learned to use dogs from the Eskimos in North America.  He knew dogs, he didn't know Shetland ponies.  Scott didn't know Shetland ponies either.  But what happened was, you had to feed the ponies; you had to carry hay to feed the ponies, so the ponies could carry what you want.  It doesn't make sense.  Well, what happened was the ponies died halfway to the South Pole; bad planning.  But Scott's notion was brave men can endure, so they started hauling themselves, you know, they hauled their supplies.  Amundsen had dogs, and he knew dogs.  And he knew that going to the South Pole, he would have to carry a lot of supplies, but then he dropped off supplies on his way to pick them up on his way back, and planned it out very well, and some of the dogs would not survive; they would get worn out, etcetera.  He was going to feed the meat from the dogs that died to the living dogs; nothing was chanced, totally planned.  When he got back from the South Pole, he weighed more than when he went; you know, just total rational problem-solving as opposed to emotional stuff that Scott did; so that's why I liked it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I later went to the South Pole.
Speaker 1: Did you?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I could tell you about that later.
Speaker 1: All right.  When did you join--just give me a date, so I make sure I don't go passed it?
Speaker 2: 1979.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a picture of myself standing at the pole.  There's a pole at the South Pole (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I read that book when I was in eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Now, was the book recommended by anyone?
Speaker 2: No, I was just browsing, and I saw it and read it.  It was just--it's rational problem-solving.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Love it.
Story_ID: 24533
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any teachers that emphasized that kind of problem-solving?
Speaker 2: No.  But my father [Percy Pierre, Sr.] was as rational problem-solver as you'll ever find.  He's, very smart man.  Now building a house requires problem-solving, you know.  You got to be creative, you've got to be rational.  It's not all by formula, you've got to come up with solutions, and my father was very good at that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you like to take things apart when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yep, yes, yeah.  Not clocks and things, I didn't take that stuff apart, I took some things apart.  I enjoyed building more than taking apart, you know. I enjoyed constructing and building something that's going to be strong.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were watching your father build the house, and maybe other things, did you think of ways to make them better?
Speaker 2: Well, I solved the problems.  I mean I--he would go to work in the summer, and I was left at home to keep building.  So, you know, I would build.  You know, bracing the house and putting the geometry of the wood so that things were strong requires some thought, some feel, some instincts, and you learn that.  You know, the reason why you make things square; there's a reason why you want things to be square, mixing concrete, there's a way to do it right, and there's a way not to do it right so that it doesn't work, and you learn these things.  I mean, there's a way to smooth out concrete.  You got to use (unclear) in certain ways, otherwise, you put lines in it.  I mean, it's more of the construction in tearing things apart and putting back together that I enjoyed.
Speaker 1: So there's some nuances and some fine-tuning to all these tasks?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you learn about plumbing, too?
Speaker 2: I could do plumbing.  Plumbing wasn't my forte, but I could do pipes and I can put treads on pipes, yeah, I can--my father could do all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't do electricity, but we did pipes, we did plumbing, we did concrete, we did, you know, wood, all of those things.
Speaker 1: Now, when he wired your house, did he have to bring in an electrician?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Couldn't do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, this is--a lot of homes in those days were getting their first electricity from what I understand.  (unclear), and you know, especially in the rural areas?
Speaker 2: Well, when we moved in, we didn't have electricity, but electricity came fairly quickly.  Then we had somebody to wire it up.  I was still in high school--grade school--in high school at that time.  Subsequently, I became an electrical engineer, so then I started doing my own wiring, but prior to that I didn't--didn't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you take a part in any electronic appliances in anything in those days?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  We had radios, and I had an uncle who would fix radios.  I would change vacuum tubes in radios, but that's about it.  I mean, I didn't rewire it.  I mean, if a radio when out, I would find a tube; go buy another tube.
Speaker 1: Did you take advantage of the kiosk in the store where you can test the tube and see if it works?  Did they have those when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: They probably did, yeah.  They probably did.
Speaker 1: They called them, "You Test Them" machines?
Speaker 2: Do you remember that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughing) Yeah.  I did some of that, yeah.  Not a lot, not a lot.
Story_ID: 24534
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So were you influenced at all by radio shows or TV shows and the movies?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, before television we had all the radio shows; we had 'Lone Ranger' and 'The Green Hornet', and I used to listen to that stuff everyday.  So, that was grade school.  When television came, there were the fights, you know, the Friday night fights, and the sports and the World Series, and watched a lot of sports.
Speaker 1: That should be in the early '50s [1950s], right--
Speaker 2: Early '50s [1950s], yes.
Speaker 1: --on television.  You would have been a teenager, I guess, right.  Or pre-twelve, twelve, thirteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, I saw some good fights.  The--, Sugar Ray Robinson, when he came back, you know, Archie Moore; some very good fighters.  I didn't see Joe Louis, but Archie Moore was a light, heavy weight; Sugar Ray, there's a Johnny Bratton; they're some good fighters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, they used to have, what was it the Friday night fight?
Speaker 2: Friday night fights.  Gillette sponsored it; Friday night fights.
Speaker 1: So, I take it you didn't watch TV that much then?
Speaker 2: We didn't have a TV.  I had to go around the corner to my uncles to watch.  Later on we got a TV.  When we got a TV, what impressed me most was what was called educational TV, because the public TV, generally all they had on were lectures, academic lectures.  People would go into classrooms and film lectures, and there were several lectures that I really, really enjoyed.  So I do recall watching those.  There was one series, in particular, on Eastern religions, on Buddhism.  I found that fascinating.
Story_ID: 24535
Speaker 1: Okay. And you said you were an avid reader of the encyclopedia?
Speaker 2: By then I had stopped, because I had real books.  When I was in high school, I had real books.  In grade school, we didn't have books, so I read the encyclopedia.  But in high school, we had to read real books.
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents encouraged you to read the encyclopedia?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't know anything, other than what I brought home, because we didn't have books at home.  You know, it wasn't like--they encouraged me to do my homework.  And my mother would find out what my homework was (laughing).  And reading was part of the homework.  She taught me and my sister to read, my mother did, when we were in first, second grade; 'Dick and Jane'.  You know, we would come home at night, and she would sit there and--with us, and we had to go through that book, you know, she was very insistent, so she taught both of us how to read at that level, but not, you know, when we were in seventh and eighth grade.
Story_ID: 24536
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now, high school; where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: St. Augustine's High School in New Orleans; St. Augustine's.
Speaker 1: Traditionally thought of as being a black saint?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's the reason for it being named; this is a black high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in high school, now, did they have you in tracks in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You guessed, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did you take the college--you on the college track?
Speaker 2: I was on the A track.  We had A, B, C and D.  My A track was like eighteen to twenty students; very intense, very intense.
Speaker 1: So you continued to like math and science; I'd be surprised if you didn't in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did you continue to play basketball in high school?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in my sophomore year, we won the city championship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's a big deal.
Speaker 2: And in my senior year, I was captain, and we won the city championship again, so, yeah.  St. Aug[ustine] shaped my life more than any other school before or later.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the personalities at St. Aug, the teachers, or other students?
Speaker 2: Well, my coach, Nick Conners; really a fine man.  I learned how to win, how to, you know, prepare to win, how to believe you're going to win, how to be competitive, because my--I was in the third class of my high school; it was a new high school.  So the athletic teams had no tradition and no history of winning because we started one grade at a time and, you know, being in the third class, there were only three grades, so it's hard to feel the strong team.  But we won the first championship that St. Aug ever won, and it was a city championship in my third year.
Speaker 1: Now, was this the first championship that a black school had ever won?
Speaker 2: Now this was a black league, so it was a segregated league.  So--well, I was in the third class, we won in my second year, so there were--the school by that time had four classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Nick Conners, really a great man, he subsequently became a politician and was elected to the State Legislature.  Now, on the academic side, there were several people; there was Father Grant.  In 1953 I took civics, civics class with Father Grant.  Father Grant was what some would call a radical priest; he was sort of tame at that time, but he taught us civics, and he taught us about the [U.S.] Supreme Court and brought to our attention the upcoming decision on Brown versus Board of Education [1954 Supreme Court ruling that the segregation of public schools was unconstitutional].  And he told us very directly the reason he was educating us was so that we would challenge the system.  And we would challenge the system by competing by becoming the best scientists and engineers and showing by our ability that we deserved a place at the table.  So he taught the civics context, but the mission was, you become as good as you can be and then you will make a difference in the world.  Now, he also taught me chemistry and physics, and it was in leaving St. Aug [St. Augustine's High School] that I knew I would become the best engineer I could become so that I can make a difference.
Speaker 1: Now, how far in math could you go in St. Augustine?
Speaker 2: We did not have calculus; we did have physics.
Speaker 1: Did you go to trigonometry?
Speaker 2: Let's see, we had two years of algebra, geometry and trig.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But no calculus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you enter any state science fairs, or anything?
Speaker 2: We had something different within the black schools.  There was a statewide competition which was a test competition, not a science fair.  It was called the LIALA [Louisiana Interscholastic, Athletic and Literary Organization], and it was a--you took test, and you took them at the local level, and if you won at the local level, you went to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and took tests there.  Well, Father Grant decided I was going to win the state championship in physics--in civics, I'm sorry.  So he prepped me, and I won in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I became the state civics champion, because I was a good test-taker.  He also prepped me for chemistry the following year, because he taught chemistry, and I was the state championship--champion in chemistry.  And he taught me in physics, and I was the state champion in physics.  So we did have science fairs, but the idea of competing and because he had to go find all kinds of materials to help give me an edge; I was competing against kids who didn't have the advantage I had.  You know, he brought materials to me that they probably hadn't seen; he spent time with me, you know, more than their teachers did.  The lesson was, you know, work and effort can make you a winner.
Story_ID: 24537
Speaker 1: Now, did you participate in any other clubs or activities in high school?
Speaker 2: No, sports and no, no.
Speaker 1: Debate team?
Speaker 2: No debate team.  No, I was tempted to play in the band, but I couldn't play in the band and play basketball at the same time, no.
Speaker 1: Now, as a basketball player, you were on a lot of championship teams, now were you like the best player on the team, or were you just a good solid player?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a forward, and I was in my sophomore year, I was first year.  I might have been the second best player on the team.  In my senior year, I definitely was the second best player.  So, you know, I didn't have too big an ego.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's great that you win twice like that.  Let's see.  Music, you had mentioned music, now, what was your favorite music in those days?
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Rhythm and Blues [R&B].  Yeah, that was my favorite music, you know.  We were going through puberty, and listening to James Brown and Johnny Ace.  Ever heard of Johnny Ace?
Speaker 1: I have.
Speaker 2: All kinds of music.
Speaker 1: New Orleans [Louisiana] is famous for music.  Fats Domino--
Speaker 2: Fats Domino, Blueberry Hill.  At the football games, the band used to strike up Blueberry Hill and other Fats Domino pieces, so that was my favorite music, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this was the beginning of what we were calling then rock and roll.  Now, it's morphed into you think of white rock bands and long hair.
Speaker 2: Well, we called it rhythm and blues and then when it crossed over to white populations, they called it rock and roll.  And then it keeps morphing into other kinds of things, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The rhythm and blues, Big Mary Thorton, I don't know if you ever heard of her, but she was the first one to sing 'Hound Dog'.  Elvis Presley made it famous, but Big Mary Thorton sang 'Hound Dog'.  Elvis had to change the words a little bit, but I remember 'Hound Dog'.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever see her perform?
Speaker 2: No.  Only on YouTube [video-sharing website].  You can find her on YouTube.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Allen Toussaint, he's become more well-known now than he was when he was writing songs, but he was--
Speaker 2: Allen Toussaint went to my grade school.  Yeah.  I really didn't know him, he was a couple of years ahead of me.  He was in my sister's class.
Speaker 1: Now, as a teenager were there venues where you'd go see James Brown in New Orleans and that sort of thing, or did your parents allow you to go?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't go to see these big acts, you know, it's mainly records we--went to dances.  There were local bands like Allen Toussaint had a band, you know.  So, we went to dances, local bands, but we heard the music on the radio, you know, the popular ones.  The bands would play Fats Domino, I mean, the high school band would pick up all those popular songs and play them.
Story_ID: 24538
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you have good counseling about where to go to college?
Speaker 2: I think it turned out to be good.  I'll tell you what the counseling was.  I told you I was pretty good at taking tests, and I had pretty high SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] scores.  I was a, not a national merit scholar, but I was a commended scholar, that meant I just missed, okay.  As a result of that, because I was on that list from the SATs, I got approached by various universities about coming to those universities, and my counsel on where to go was my principal, Father O'Rorke.  Well, Father O'Rorke believed that all St. Aug [St. Augustine's High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] graduates should go to a catholic university.  So he was biased.
Story_ID: 24539
Speaker 1: All right.  Father O'Rorke [principal at St. Augustine's High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], he has his suggestions.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Again, I was in third class, and previous graduates of St. Aug had gone to Catholic University [Washington, District of Columbia], La Salle [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Villanova [University, Villanova, Pennsylvania], one went to [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana].  So that was his advice.  Now, I got offers because of my high SAT scores. I don't remember what they were, but, you know, in the 90 percentiles.  I got a letter from a little college in Massachusetts called Amherst [College, Amherst], saying, "Come to Amherst, we'll give you a full scholarship."  I didn't apply; I just get this letter.  I got a letter from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] saying, "Come to Princeton, we'll give you a full scholarship."  So I go see Father O'Rorke, see, my counselor.  I said, you know, look, I was admitted to Notre Dame, and they didn't give me a full scholarship; they gave me one third scholarship, but I got these other scholarships; I could put a package together to Notre Dame and Princeton gave me everything.  Where do you think I ought to go?  He said, Notre Dame.  So the truth of the matter is, I had never heard of Princeton, I never heard of Amherst; I'd heard of Notre Dame, they had a good football team.  I used to listen to the radio broadcast of the Notre Dame football games.  So I figured, if I go to Notre Dame, people--my friends would ask me, "Where'd you go," I'd say, "Notre Dame"; they know Notre Dame.  If I told my friends I went to Princeton, they'd say, "Where's that, what's that?" (laughing).  But it turned out fine; it turned out fine.  I went to Notre Dame.
Speaker 1: But you had to pay, right.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Notre Dame, I'll tell you exactly, tuition was about--tuition, room and board was about $1500; Notre Dame gave me $500.  I had a scholarship from the Jessie Noyes Foundation, because they were supporting black students who wanted to go to college, but then I--it was portable, I could take it anywhere I wanted.  And there was another scholarship from a group in Massachusetts, a woman, called Catholic Scholarships for Negros.  So those three scholarships paid for my--all of my bills at Notre Dame for four years, so I didn't have to pay, my parents didn't have to pay.  So it was equivalent to a full scholarship that Princeton and Amherst gave me.  And I was admitted to other schools, but these little places, they gave me full scholarships.
Story_ID: 24540
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated from high school [St. Augustine's High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] in 1957?
Speaker 2: '57 [1957], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, 1957, you're on your way to [the University of] Notre Dame.  Was the president Father [Theodore] Hesburgh when you got there?
Speaker 2: Yes, Father Hesburgh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was it like?  I know the golden dome was impressive?
Speaker 2: Well, there were very few blacks; there were only two blacks in my class, and on the entire campus, undergraduates and graduates, probably about fourteen blacks, so that's--so I'd walk around campus and almost never see a black, when you know, classes were changing.  But the blacks there were close, and they were my good friends.  The people in the community, the black community in South Bend [Indiana], was very supportive, they opened up their homes to us so, while there were few of us, I think we had good social support.  I think most of us enjoyed it, because we had better connection in town than most of the other students, you know, because the black community in South Bend just reached out to us; invite us to dinner, let us have parties at their homes, etc., so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now there were also probably young ladies in the community and--isn't there a woman's college--
Speaker 2: --yeah, across the street.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there were some black women there, and there were some black women in town, because Notre Dame, at that time, was all men.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, I think most of us enjoyed our time in college.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your fellow students that you remember?
Speaker 2: Gary Cooper.  I don't know if you know Gary; he became a two-star general.  He was a senior when I was a freshman; he's currently in Alabama, and has a pretty distinguished career, was ambassador to Jamaica; Aubrey Lewis who has died, was a football player, when I was there, and he subsequently was an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agent and a few other things; Jim Goodwin is a prominent lawyer in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Jim was my roommate, and Ron Gregory, the younger brother of Dick Gregory [American comedian and social activist], was a classmate.  And Ron is funny.
Speaker 1: Was he funny, too?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's funny; Ron is still funny, yeah.  So there was interesting people.  But Ron was never a professional comedian, he--but his older brother, Dick was.
Speaker 1: Yes.  It's interesting; he was noted as being funny, too.  They probably had a family tradition of humor, I guess.  Now, was he an athlete, as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ron was a distance runner, a black distance runner; Ron Gregory.  And Dick ran distance, too.  He was at the University of Illinois, I think, running distance.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember he's a track--he's a track man.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Ron ran a mile across country.
Speaker 1: Now, did you play basketball at Notre Dame?
Speaker 2: I didn't go out for the team, I played at 'The Rock' [the Knute Rockne Memorial Gymnasium built in memory of the late Knute Rockne, Notre Dame football coach from 1918 to 1931], and some people encouraged me to go out for the team, and I don't know that I was good enough, but here's the other reason that I didn't go.  I told you that there were very few blacks on campus and many of them were athletes, so when white students would see me, they asked what do you play, and I'd say, "I'm on an academic scholarship, I don't play anything."  So I enjoyed saying that (laughing).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughing).
Speaker 2: But I did play in the gym, throughout the four years, I just enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Intramural basketball, or just pick up basketball?
Speaker 2: Pick up, pick up.  I would go over to the gym and just play the toughest guy.
Speaker 1: Probably beat 'em, right?
Speaker 2: Some, some. No.  I wasn't big enough to dominate.  Tom Hawkins was there.  Tom played for the LA [Los Angeles] Lakers [basketball team, National Basketball Association].  So Tom was what, 6'5" (six feet, five inches), 6'6" (six feet, six inches), I was six feet, so.  And I played under the basket, so I couldn't go up against those guys.  But I enjoyed--I played basketball until maybe fifteen years ago; really enjoyed basketball.
Story_ID: 24541
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you--what did you decide to major in, you know, in the beginning?
Speaker 2: The thought process went like this.  I was considering physics, because I had a physics course, which I liked in high school [St. Augustine's High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], Father Grant, was good.  I also liked to argue; I was thinking maybe of being a lawyer, but I also liked doing things; I liked building things.  So, I was talking to Father O'Rorke [principal at St. Augustine's High School] one day, and he said, "have you thought of being an engineer, because you could use your physics and you could build things?"  I said, "that sounds good".  So I decided to be an electrical engineer, because I like electricity, and engineers build things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did you choose that right away at school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you find that you were prepared for the classes?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My high school was extremely good.  My first year at [the University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], I was on Dean's List; my second year, I was not.  I stopped studying.
Speaker 1: Your social year?
Speaker 2: Well, the truth of the matter is, I so well--I was better prepared than my fellow students as a freshman.  So I didn't work hard.  By the sophomore year, they had been working hard, and they were progressing faster than I was.  So that's why my grades went down.  But I was extremely well prepared for my freshman year, extremely well.
Speaker 1: Were there--who were the professors there that--or were there any that really paid special attention to you, that you remember as really helping you?
Speaker 2: None really until my senior year.  There was a professor--Professor Hoad, he was a Jewish professor; one of the few Jewish professors.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: I think it's H-O-A-D, Hoad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he took an interest in some of his students, not just me.  He worked with me on a project, it wasn't a science project, but a demonstration.  He took his class into his research lab, so he was the most intellectually stimulating of all the professors I had.
Story_ID: 24542
Speaker 1: Was there a favorite course that you took as undergraduate?
Speaker 2: There are courses I enjoyed.  One course I enjoyed a lot was in the philosophy of science.  It shaped my thinking about a lot of things; sort of explained to me what science is about, and that was very enlightening.  That's not my professional, but it was a very enlightening course.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, it's interesting--.  Did the philosophy science course seek to reconcile science with religion or other deep thought?
Speaker 2: It didn't reconcile science with religion, but it explained science, and it made it clear that science is not an absolute truth, you know.  Science attempts to provide the best explanation for things we observe; and best is defined subjectively.  And it doesn't mean there is not another explanation, but this is the one we prefer now, and tomorrow, when we find new facts that don't fit, the theory we had today, we have to devise a new theory.  So there's nothing fixed about science.  There's no absoluteness about it.  It's an explanation of the things you will observe, and you're willing to change your explanation if you observe new things.  And even--and there are many different explanations that can explain a given set of facts, and it's up to me to decide which of those explanations I prefer.  And so, for example, science is not against religion; science cannot prove there is no God; science is not about proving there is "no"; science says this is "a" explanation, "an" explanation.  If you have an explanation that says God did it, science cannot disprove that; science, you know, that's not the nature of science.  The nature of science is to provide one explanation for what we observe, so that was very enlightening to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was the essence of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24543
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, let's see here.  So I take it you had good grades?
Speaker 2: I had good grades in my freshman year, okay grades after that, but good enough to get into graduate school at [the University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], where I continued to get a master's degree.
Speaker 1: In graduate school, what did you focus on, what was your thesis about?
Speaker 2: I did a course-only master's program, so I didn't do a thesis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what I became interested in was signal processing.  I liked mathematics, and signal processing is about extracting information from signals, which might be radio signals, that might be acoustical signals and that's sort of what I got interested in, but only through courses, not through a thesis.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright. Before we leave Notre Dame, now, did you join a fraternity or anything?
Speaker 2: No, there were no fraternities at Notre Dame.  That was part of their tradition.  But the black students had something we called Nu Nu Delta, Negros of Notre Dame, so we were a fraternity.
Speaker 1: Nu Nu Delta?
Speaker 2: Right.  Notre Dame had no fraternities.
Speaker 1: In 1961 you graduated with a degree in electrical engineering.  In '63 [1963], you received your master's degree--master's of science degree in electrical engineering, too, as well, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: From Notre Dame.
Story_ID: 24544
Speaker 1: So in '67 [1967], you got your Ph.D.  Now, how did you--tell us about how you decided to go on and get a Ph.D. from John Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a professor at [the University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], while I was doing my master's degree.  I took a course from him, it was a mathematical course called 'Non-Linear Mechanics', and he told me I should get a Ph.D.  Now, I was interested in getting a Ph.D., I was not confident that I could, but he said, "Yes you can, go do it."  So, I said, "Yes, sir", and I started applying for graduate school.  And I applied to several places, and I was applying late, and I got admitted to a lot of places, but they said, we're out of money, you're late; we can give you money in January.  I was applying to the top twenty places, you know, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and [Johns] Hopkins [University] and other places.  I got a letter from this chair of the department at Hopkins, his name was Vert Hamburger, who said, "I've got money for you right now, come on" (laughing).  Now my choice was to go to another place like MIT and pay my first semester, with a promise of money later.  I used that money I had saved to buy a car and go to Hopkins, because they were going to pay right away.  So, I opted to buy a car and go to Hopkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you drive to Hopkins from--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --South Bend?
Speaker 2: I was actually in New Orleans [Louisiana] at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a hiatus.  When I finished my master's at Notre Dame in early February, I was applying to graduate school in the fall.  In the meantime, I got a job at Southern University teaching.  So I taught at Southern University between February, '63 [1963] and September of '63 [1963].  So Southern University is in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], you know, it's in New Orleans.  So I drove--I bought the car in New Orleans and drove from New Orleans to Baltimore, to Hopkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were just at Southern that brief period of time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one semester in the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24545
Speaker 1: Now, '63 [1963] is the summer of the March on Washington [for Jobs and Freedom; civil rights march, August 28, 1963, Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you go, by any chance?
Speaker 2: I arrived in Washington after the march and went and visited the tent area, but I arrived after the march.
Speaker 1: Did you talk to some of the people that participated?
Speaker 2: No, they were gone.  So I didn't participate, but I do remember, you know, just looking at where they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, at the time, did it seem just as historic then as it--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  It was very important.  It's was just something that I didn't decide to do, I mean, I was very aware of the March on Washington, very aware of civil rights, but if you go back to the high school [St. Augustine's High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], my strategy was, once I achieved status and power, I can make a bigger difference than marching on Washington, you know, personally.  My getting on a bus and going to Washington would be less important than my going to [Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] and getting a Ph.D.  Once I got that Ph.D., I'd make a bigger difference.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--your family know Andrew Young's family?
Speaker 2: No. No, no.  Andrew Young [American politician and pastor] was a different status.  We were--my family was working people, Andrew was educated.
Speaker 1: Were you aware that he was from New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Also, in November of '63 [1963], President [John F.] Kennedy is killed, as a catholic, how did that affect you?
Speaker 2: At Hopkins, one evening we were playing tough football on the lawn, and somebody yelled to us that Kennedy was killed.  I remember exactly when that happened.  The fact that he was catholic was not--was not an issue for me; the fact that he had begun to do some of the things I had hoped he would do in civil rights, etcetera, that was important; he had only begun to do those things.  I don't know if you recall that Kennedy ran for president, in the primary, he ran against [Lyndon B.] Johnson by making a deal with the Governor of Alabama, Patterson, that he would not bring forth any civil rights laws; he broke that promise after some events, and did bring forth the civil rights law, but Kennedy allied himself with some southern opponents of Lyndon Johnson, so I had some problems with Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were keeping up with politics?
Speaker 2: Oh, very definitely, very definitely.
Speaker 1: Do you remember George Romney running for president in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I do.  I actually met George Romney when he was in the Nixon administration; I was a White House Fellow, I met him then.  I remember when he ran; he ran in '68 [1968] and he claimed that somebody brainwashed him and destroyed his candidacy.
Speaker 1: Right, something about that I can't remember now, exactly what that's about.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, he said somebody brainwashed him.
Speaker 1: Well, that messed him up.
Speaker 2: That messed him up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, 1963 was a turbulent year.  The Sixteenth Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama] was bombed that year, Medgar Evers [African American civil rights activist] was killed that year.
Speaker 2: It was a bad year, it was a bad year.  But again, my focus--frankly, I always thought that I had a particular talent.  I had to develop that talent to make a difference.  Later on I think I did make a difference, I can tell you later how, but I was very conscious of the fact that I was not part of that movement, but it was a very conscious decision that my role would be different, you know.
Story_ID: 24546
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1963, John Hopkins University in Baltimore [Maryland].  What was the Ph.D. program like and who was you advisor?
Speaker 2: My advisor was a young professor by the name of Steve Wolf, Steven Wolf.  He was a graduate of Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and had done a postdoc [post-doctoral training] in England.  But he was protege of a senior professor by the name of Bill Huggins, and Bill Huggins was a man who came from Lincoln Labs [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and had been part of the Second World War's radar development.  So I really had two mentors, Bill Huggins who was the guru of the group and Steve Wolf who was my immediate advisor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to remember the title.
Speaker 1: Okay, here's the title that we have.  Now, I'll see if it's right.  I'm not sure if it's right, because someone else did this research.
Speaker 2: I could tell you what it is, 'Characteristics of Random Processes as Used in Signal Detection', or something like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This one says, 'Properties of Non-Gaussian, Continuous Parameter Random Processes as Used in Detection Theory'.
Speaker 2: That's it.  I can explain that if you have a half hour.
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes, we have--(unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, let me see if I can explain it.  This field came out of communications and radar, and if you have a radio, and you have static, you ask yourself, "How could I get rid of the static?"  A good radio will build an electronic circuit to remove that.  Well, the kind of circuit you need to build depends upon the kind of noise you're trying to get rid of.  So, I was studying different kinds of noise; studying them in terms of what are their statistical properties, because if I could characterize, okay, it's this kind of noise, then I can design a filter to get rid of it.  Most filters are designed to get rid of what's called white noise, and white noise is noise that is equally strong at all frequencies.  So if you're transmitting a limited frequency band, and you've got all this noise outside of the band and inside the band, you can reduce the noise by saying, "Okay gonna block all the frequencies that are not where my signal is."  That wipes out all the noise in these other bands.  So that's sort of the idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you've got to know what kind of noise you're trying to get rid of before you can figure out how to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Actually, I understand that.  Having fooled around with short wave radio and such, you know.  Whatever frequency you're trying to listen to, you got to make the adjustment to where the white noise is gone--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so your signal is clear.
Speaker 2: Because you don't want to be listening to all that white noise if you don't have to, because if your signal is on in this band, you don't have to listen to all those other bands where--where the white noise is, yeah.
Story_ID: 24547
Speaker 1: Did you have any difficulty with your Ph.D. work [at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] at all?
Speaker 2: Nothing serious.  At the time we had to learn, pass two language tests.  It wasn't difficult, it's just that I hated learning German, but I did. I took German and Spanish.  So that wasn't difficult, I just had to focus on it.
Speaker 1: Had you had any German or Spanish before?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Well, I had Spanish in high school.  Yeah, Spanish in high school.  The research got off to a slow start, but I learned later that's typical, but then it accelerated, and I was able to be very satisfied with the research I did, and so, it was hard to get started, but once you get started, things can move.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any other--was there any other African American students in the graduate program there?
Speaker 2: No, not in my program, not in the college of engineering.  I did not know of any other African American in graduate school; there were several Africans in graduate school who were my friends.  I'm sure there were African Americans some place, I just didn't know them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there were African students taking electrical engineering with you?
Speaker 2: No.  One was in biology, another in geography, and another in political science; nobody in engineering.  There were no Africans or African Americans doing graduate work in engineering when I was there; I was the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24548
Speaker 1: All right, so now, you did post doctoral studies at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 1967 to '68 [1968].  How did you manage to choose the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: Well, that's an interesting story.  It turns out I'm told I'm the first postdoc student ever at the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan.  Here's how that happened.  I was doing my research, loving it, loving it, loving it.  My advisor said, "It's time for you to go, write it up and leave."  I said, "I want to keep doing my research."  And the thought of getting a job and not doing research full time was not what I wanted to do.  So I decided well maybe if I get a postdoc, I could keep doing my research.  I don't want to be a professor, because then I'd have to teach, I just want to do my research.  So my advisor says well, "Let's go to this conference and talk to people and see if we can find--if any university is looking for postdoc, so we went to the Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] conference and talked to people from [University of California,] Berkeley, from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], from [University of] Michigan, etcetera.  There was man at the University of Michigan, his name is Bill Root, who is really the godfather of my field.  So we approached him and said, you know--.  My advisor approached him and said, "Percy Pierre would love to do a postdoc; do you have a postdoc?"  He said, "No, I don't have one, and we don't have postdocs in engineering, but I think we should, and maybe you could be the first one."  So he created a postdoc position.  He went back to the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan and talked to the dean; the dean created a position for me, and I went to Michigan as a postdoc.  I was the only postdoc in the college.
Speaker 1: So you were the first and only postdoc in the college?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the first African American postdoc--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --To be sure.
Speaker 2: But I loved it, because I spent all day doing my research.  There were a couple assistant professors who were hired at the same time, and they had to teach.  Now, eventually, I did teach.  I taught the second semester.  They asked me to teach a course, I thought one course.  But my postdoc year was one of the most satisfying years of my life, because I was very productive; I published five papers in that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are the journals that you published in as an electrical engineer?
Speaker 2: Half of them were math journals, probability theory journals, and the other half were engineering, 'Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineering' [IEEE].
Speaker 1: You were there until 1968-
Story_ID: 24549
Speaker 1: Then in '68 [1968], you went over to the Rand Corporation [Santa Monica, California].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Bill Root, my colleague at [the University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] knew everybody and was able to get me offers.  And I thought I would become a faculty member, and I had--had offers from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], had an offer to faculty position, and offer from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], an offer from Michigan, and that's what I wanted to do, an offer from Bell Labs [New Jersey].  But I went over to the placement office at Michigan just to see what else was there.  A recruiter from the Rand Corporation was coming through.  I decided to talk to him, and he told me that at the Rand Corporation, they traditionally had done military analysis, but that they are trying to get into urban analysis to analyze urban problems, and they would love to have me come, and if I came, they would let me in the first year do whatever I wanted to, but in the meantime, they would hope that I could learn how to use some of my analytical skills to address some urban problems and problems like more efficient police work, fire services, sanitation, etcetera, that I could apply my mathematical models to some of that.  Well, that was very attractive to me, because [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed in, what's that early--
Speaker 1: April, yeah, April 4th, yeah.
Speaker 2: --April.
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And some of my friends and I, Don Coleman, in particular, who was an African American graduate student at Michigan, talked about how can we turn our engineering to serve solving urban problems.  Now, you'll hear about Don Coleman again at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] because we had this in our minds, Don and I; we ought to be able to use our skills to help solve urban problems.  So anyway, Rand had started doing that, so I said well, I can keep doing what I like at Rand.  They said you could do anything you want to do, while at the same time trying to figure out how to steer some of my knowledge towards urban problems.  So that's why I went to Rand.
Story_ID: 24550
Speaker 1: Alright now, what was it like--now,were there other black employees at Rand [Corporation, Santa Monica, California], I mean in engineering?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were the only--were you the first one they ever had?
Speaker 2: No.  I wasn't the first black employee at Rand, by any means.  There was a man by the name of David Blackwell, who worked at Rand in the early '50s [1950s].  There was another black researcher, but he was not in engineering or science, he was in economics.  That was the only other black researcher I knew at Rand; can't think of any others.  There was a young man who was a master's level research aide by the name of Larry Pipes, African American, and I became one of his mentors.  I helped him get a fellowship to get his Ph.D.  But, no, I was--I was the only one.  Now, I didn't tell you this, but you mentioned I was the first African American to get a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, the question is how--how do you know that?  Well, I didn't see any other. But when I went for a job interview in '68 [1968] at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the chair of the electrical engineering department told me that they had been looking for three years for an African American with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, and I was the first one they had ever seen.  So that surprised me at the time, but I think it's true.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you remember what you were doing when you found out that Dr. King had been assassinated?
Speaker 2: I don't recall what I was doing, but there were demonstrations at Ann Arbor [Michigan], and I participated in those.  We went to meetings; there were riots in Detroit [Michigan], and there were many people in Ann Arbor who wanted to go to Detroit.  And Don Coleman and I were motivated by those meetings to say, you know, we're not going to go to Detroit, but we've got to figure out how we can make a difference.
Speaker 1: All right, so you're at Rand from '68 [1968] to '71 [1971], and can you summarize what you did at Rand?
Speaker 2: Well, I was there for one year, and I published lots of papers just like my dissertation work.
Story_ID: 24551
Speaker 1: But I applied--not long after I got there [to the Rand Corporation, in 1968], I applied for a White House fellowship.  I applied in '68 [1968], fall of '68 [1968].  I was selected in the spring of '69 [1969], and left Rand in September of '69 [1969] to spend a year at the White House [Washington, District of Columbia].
Speaker 2: Okay, is this like a leave, or something?
Speaker 1: I was on leave.
Speaker 2: So this fellowship, you served as a White House fellow and deputy to the assistant--to the assistant--to the president for urban affairs, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Pat Moynihan [American politician and sociologist, Democratic Party; in 1969, Counselor to the President on Urban Affairs, for President Richard Nixon's administration].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Pat Moynihan, all right.
Speaker 1: Pat Moynihan.
Speaker 2: Now, what did you think of Pat Moynihan at the time?
Speaker 1: Well, let me--I asked to work for him.  People assumed, because of my Rand background, that I'd work at the Pentagon.  But I told you the story earlier about we're trying to find ways of using engineering to--so I said that I wanted to work for Pat Moynihan to understand those issues.  Pat had several deputies, and he allocated responsibilities.  I had responsibilities for HUD [United States Department of Housing and Urban Development], Department of Agriculture, Department of Transportation.  And I was like the liaison between those departments and the White House, and Pat Moynihan, basically.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you discover any ways to use your engineering skills to do something?
Speaker 1: Not directly, but I was able to use some academic analysis to form judgments on some programs, and in particular, George Romney [Republican candidate for presidential elections in 1968; 43rd Governor of Michigan] was pushing a program called 'New Community', to build new communities like Reston in Columbia.  He wanted to build them all across the country.  And the rationale was that would address the housing problem, because at that time, there was a projection that the population would increase by fifty percent.  That didn't make sense to me.  I was able to find somebody who did a good analysis that said new housing is expensive housing; you'll never house poor people in new housing; it just won't work.  So I lobbied against George.  Now, that has turned out to be true in that there are new communities, but there are no poor people in new communities.  So I was able to persuade Pat Moynihan that this approach was not going to address the needs of poor people.
Speaker 2: And subsequently, it has not?
Speaker 1: Nope.
Speaker 2: Who else was at the White House that you remember?  Did you know--was Louis Martin there?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was.  He was.  But John Earman, Don Rumsfeld, those people.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is the [President Richard] Nixon--
Speaker 1: The Nixon White House, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you know Paul Jones, I think?
Speaker 1: Paul Jones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's an art--he became famous for collecting art later on, but he was there.
Speaker 1: No, I don't remember him.  I was only there one year, of course.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 24552
Speaker 1: And when I left there [White House fellowship as a deputy for Pat Moynihan as an urban affairs liason], I went back to Rand [Corporation], but stayed in D.C. [Wshington, District of Columbia].  I did not go back to [Santa Monica] California.
Speaker 2: You weren't at Rand very long before you became dean of engineering at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], right?
Speaker 1: I was official at Rand for two and half years, but one of those years was as a White House fellow, on leave.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, tell us about the Howard job?
Speaker 1: Well, that's interesting.  When I was a White House fellow, the White House fellows met with leaders on a regular basis, like once or twice a week for lunch.  One of the people I invited to talk to us was James Cheek, president of Howard, because James Cheek had asserted a leadership position in response to the anti-Vietnam demonstrations and the killings [in 1970] at Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi].  So he came and talked to us. So I met James Cheek when I was a White House Fellow.  Later on when I left the when I left the White House Fellowship, I heard that Howard was looking for a Dean, so I wrote Cheek a letter saying, here are some things you ought think about in feeling that position.  Well, he decided that he was going to hire me as Dean of engineering.  Now, I'm going to tell you a little background story.  So, he told Andy Billingsly to go sign me up.  So, Andy and I talked, he said, "Okay, we're going to make the offer."  But in the meantime, before he sent the  offer, he went to talk to the faculty of the college of engineering and told them we have your dean, and the faculty didn't like that, so he had to stunt the process and start a search, a regular search.  In the regular search, I found out later, I was not the first candidate that they wanted, I was the second, but they couldn't get the first one, so they got me.  I decided to go.  So that's how I became dean.  And that was in what, '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: '71 [1971] right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 24553
Speaker 1: Okay, so it says here that you introduced new engineering programs to the school as such as a master's program in computer science and a doctoral program in electrical engineering [at Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A doctoral program in electrical engineering and another one in mechanical engineering, so two doctoral programs, the first doctoral programs in HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] in engineering; I introduced those.  But I also introduced the master's program called Urban Systems Engineering, do you have that?
Speaker 1: No, I don't. Urban--
Speaker 2: Urban Systems Engineering.
Speaker 1: --Systems Engineering.
Speaker 2: Urban Systems.  Don Coleman and I developed that program.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about that.  That sounds like the most interesting of these?
Speaker 2: Again, when I became dean [of the College of Engineering at Howard University], the first thing I did was to call Don Coleman, who was about to graduate from Michigan in the electrical engineering with a background in computers.  Say, Don, if you want to come to Howard, we will try to figure out how to apply our analytical skills to urban problems.  So he decided to come as a professor of electrical engineering.  So once he got there, we put our head together and wrote this proposal to get funding for it, and the proposal went to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.  And the Sloan Foundation had been thinking of the same thing; we want to fund programs that will address urban problems through tools of analysis.  So Howard was one of the first eleven universities to be funded for that kind of program.  So it was--our program was a master's of professional--a two-year master's program, with lots of analytical tools and a practicum, and with the idea of placing these people in cities so that they could help solve urban problems.  We later got another grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.  When I left Howard, this program became less popular, because we had less money--they had less money, and it still exists, but it doesn't have the same popularity, if you will.  So that was an experiment, and it was not only Howard, it was a series of colleges across the nation that started programs like this.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Give us an example of what you all came up with as solutions to urban problems and what planning technique you were using?
Speaker 2: Well, the basic tool, or the most useful tool was what you call 'operations research'.  Operations research is a methodology for studying and optimizing processes, you know.  The other area was transportation; the study of how to move buses and cars and trucks, etcetera.  So those were the two most fruitful areas.  Now, operations research could be applied to garbage removal, scheduling trucks, optimizing size, getting routines for them so as to have the best pickup.  Operations research could go into a service department, like a, you know, a drivers license department and introduce software that will optimize their work.  The transportation people can study highways and cities and traffic lights and--so basically, trying to make the services of the city better.  That's what we were trying to do.  So, it was not social science, it was transportation engineering and operations research.
Speaker 1: Infrastructure.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24554
Speaker 1: Now, in '73 [1973], it says here, you were instrumental in the founding of the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, NACME, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, going back to high school [St. Augustine's High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], when I said I will push my career to make a difference, the Urban Systems Engineering [at Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] was an attempt to fulfill that promise.  This was the most successful attempt to fulfill that promise, because--now, I'm going to give you some background.  We may have to come back tomorrow to finish this interview.  Back when I was a White House fellow, the [President Richard] Nixon Administration created something called 'affirmative action'.  It was an alternative to [President Lyndon B.] Johnson's war on poverty.  The idea was, we're going help people get jobs, we're not going to give them welfare.  If minorities need jobs, we'll help them get jobs.  One response to that, and the Nixon Administration was very aggressive in telling companies you need to hire minorities.  The companies said well, we can't find the minorities we want.  GE [General Electric Company], in particular, said, "We hire engineers, there aren't enough black engineers."  So let us work on getting more black engineers rather than simply hiring people as engineers who are not qualified.  It turned out that GE representatives came to me at Howard, as a prominent black engineer, to help them launch a program to educate more black engineers.  So the GE representative and myself went around the country trying to orchestrate a national effort.  We ended up at the National Academy of Engineering and we had a symposium, and I was chair of the planning committee of the symposium and also chair of the symposium.  Out of that symposium came a recommendation to create this industry panel chaired by Reginald Jones, then chairman of GE, with other CEOs [Chief Executive Officer] that would spearhead an effort to get more minorities in engineering.  So, that's NACME.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, there are several people that reflect on the [President Richard] Nixon Administration.  I know he's famous for Watergate, and all that, and he seems to be generally vilified these days, but those are not bad days for civil rights and activity in a--I think a lot of people have warmer feelings toward [President] John F. Kennedy and even [President] Lyndon Johnson, but not so much for Nixon.  But--there were things that were coming out--
Speaker 2: There were things he did, yeah, yeah, and affirmative action was his thing.  Now, he wasn't the one who thought it up, but he pushed it, you know.  That was a black Assistant Secretary of Labor [Arthur Allen Fletcher] who came up with it.
Speaker 1: We've interviewed him, and I'm trying to think of his name.
Speaker 2: I was trying to think of his name too.
Speaker 1: Passed away about five years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I interviewed his wife too.
Speaker 2: A black Republican.  But he was the--the Philadelphia Plan was his thing.
Speaker 1: The father of affirmative action.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so, NACME then was started in '73 [1973]; still exists, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, what happened after that, once this panel of CEOs said we want to do something, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation said we will jump in too, and they asked me to run their program.  So I had a foot at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which I did on a half time basis, which is a source of money to create organizations.  And the industrial people who said they would follow, basically, that these companies would support these new organizations.  So at the Sloan Foundation, I created an organization for a scholarship fund.  When I said I, I mean, you know, with the staff at the Sloan Foundation.  We created 'GIM', the organization to support minority graduate students.  We supported MESA, which is a high school organization.  We created SECME, and all of these organizations was created with startup money with the idea that they would have to find other money to survive.  And all of them have survived, not all of them, but many of them have survived.  So there was a period--an opportunity time, now given the affirmative action out of the Nixon Administration, pushing the companies, and the companies feeling obligated, and the Sloan Foundation saying, "We will fund the creation of things," it was just a fortunate time to orchestrate that to develop what we have today.
Story_ID: 24555
Speaker 1: Okay, around 1977--
Speaker 2: Can I go back to the--
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: --the NACME [National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering; Pierre was instrumental in establishing NACME in 1973] thing, because this is very important to me.  I told you that through the academy, we put together a committee of CEOs [Chief Executive Officers] who were going to do something about minorities in engineering and then the [Alfred P.] Sloan Foundation decided to invest in programs.  They asked me to run the program, but I said I didn't want to quit my job at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia]; I was only dean for two years.  I agreed to do it half time.  So for two years, I commuted between D.C. [District of Columbia] and New York to the Rockefeller Center to run the program.  And one day early in my tenure at the Sloan Foundation, I was walking up Fifth Avenue and thinking that this is a fabulous opportunity to make a difference.  I had reached the point where I thought I was putting myself in a position to make a big difference, because all the elements were in place to create organizations that would change minority engineering for the next thirty years.  And I realized that that was that opportunity.  And what I'm saying is I knew this was it.  And it took a lot of work; we had to create organizations, we had to guess what to do, but the results have been fabulous; the increase in minority engineering graduates has been spectacular over the next thirty years, and both at the bachelor's and master's level, so, if I looked at one of the biggest impacts of my life, it's that.  That's the fulfillment of my promise to Father Grant when I was a freshman in high school [St. Augustine's High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a big part of it.
Speaker 1: And, of course, NACME is still in operation, still doing good work?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24556
Speaker 1: Now, in 1977, tell me if I'm skipping over something, now?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: In '77 [1977] you are assistant secretary of the Army for research and development. Tell us how this came to be?
Speaker 2: I was dean of engineering at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], and did not want to be a dean for the rest of my life, so I started looking around at other opportunities.  I was offered a couple of jobs as the dean at other places; I was offered a job at SUNY [State University of New York] Stony Brook as dean of engineering and another job in Chicago [Illinois].  I decided I would prefer to get into engineering to do some of the kind of engineering that attracted me when I was building houses, not just the academic engineering.  So I started, and [President] Jimmy Carter had won the presidency, so I started looking for opportunities in the federal government.  And I knew through my work with the academy, I knew Frank Press who was Jimmy Carter's science advisor.  So I told Frank that, you know, if there's a job in the government that would interest me, I would be interested, so Frank was looking for people to fill the technical positions in the government.  So he came up with a few.  But then a friend of mine, Cliff Alexander, was named Secretary of the Army, and Cliff asked me if I would be willing to come to work for him as the assistant secretary for research and development.  So I said, "That's the best offer I have."  I had an offer at the National Science Foundation [NSF], an offer at the Department of Commerce.  So that's how I got to the Pentagon.  And my reason for going was to get closer to actual engineering as opposed to academic engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1977, so what programs did you work on as the assistant secretary of the army for research and development?
Speaker 2: Okay.  In the Pentagon, there is civilian leadership and uniform leadership.  The civilian leadership oversees the uniform leadership.  The Department of the Army was going through the development of most of its major weapons systems, the tank, the helicopter, the transport helicopter, the attack helicopter, the missiles, etcetera.  And those programs take about ten years to develop.  During my four years there, I was in charge those programs, which meant that I had to monitor them and approve their progress through the various stages of development.  We ran into technical problems; we had to make major changes on the attack helicopter; we had to make significant changes on the tank, and as an electrical engineering, I understood electrical engineering; I was not an expert at cross-engineering, so the challenge for me was to understand enough to have an intuitive notion of how these programs should be managed.  And most of them came off extremely well and all of the systems I worked on showed up in the Gulf War, the First Gulf War.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  These are systems worked on in the '70s [1970s], show up in the '90s [1990s] in the Gulf War?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, because they take that long.  Patriot Missile System was another system I worked on.  And we had problems with that system; there were software problems.  And we didn't quite know how to fix them, so that was the engineering challenge too; come up with a way of making things work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I suppose you have to provide some kind of oversight on behalf of the federal government in terms of projects when they're being developed in the private sector, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  All of this work was being done in the private sector, and I was the acquisition officer, I had to sign the contract with them and decide whether or not they were fulfilling the contracts, and figure out what to do if they weren't.
Speaker 1: Okay, kind of monitoring the engineering to make sure it's sound and what they say their doing is they're actually doing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I had a very large staff that advised me on the technical aspects, and we had test programs so that test results, we had analysts, lots of people to help.
Speaker 1: This seems like a very, very important post, you know, and I wasn't aware that we had anybody--
Speaker 2: This was the most significant job I ever had; the most intellectually challenging job I ever had, and I was the first African American to have such a job.  I was the first African American to be head of research and development in any of those services, the Army, the Navy, Air Force, so that--and it was the work that I did on that job that led to my election to the National Academy of Engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that shows you how significant it was.
Speaker 1: The significance of the National Academy for Engineering, there aren't many engineers period that are elected, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The academy has about 2000 out of one and a half million engineers elected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When were you elected to the National Academy?
Speaker 2: About 2009.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It took a long time, but it was mainly the work at the Pentagon and subsequent work that I did that was the reason for my election; it was not being dean of engineering, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there, basically, throughout the--through the end of the Carter, I mean the beginning of the [President Ronald] Reagan Administration?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a presidential appointee.  So my term ended at the end of the Carter Administration, except I was asked to stay on for two weeks as acting secretary of the army because the position was vacant, and they needed somebody in there until they could get the Republican person in, so I was acting secretary of the army for a couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: All right.  That's something you can say that nobody--that people can say they were.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 24557
Speaker 1: So in 1981 you opened your own consulting business.  Percy A. Pierre and Associates, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did military-type consulting mainly, and some educational consulting.  I worked for the Raytheon Corporation, for Westinghouse, and that was a follow-up to my work at the Pentagon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did that until 1983, and in '83 [1983], you became the president of Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University or A&M in Texas?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did this happen, I mean, did they recruit you?
Speaker 2: They did, and this was change of direction.  The chancellor of the Texas A&M system was a friend of mine, his name was Art Hanson.  And I'd learned that he had become chancellor and Prairie View was part of that system, and they were looking for a president, so I had been away from academe for six years or so, but the circumstances at Prairie View were such that I found it very, very attractive.  And the circumstances were money.  Prairie View was going to get about, oh, I think about a hundred million dollars to rebuild the school, and it just was a great opportunity to make a big difference.  So after thinking about it, and talking to my wife, I decided that's what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started Prairie View in 1983, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were president until 1989.  So what was it like at Prairie View?
Speaker 2: Well, we did a lot of things; we started programs, but mainly I rebuilt the campus.  I had money to redesign the campus, to turn it into a pedestrian campus versus a streets, we closed a lot of streets, planted a lot of trees, built some buildings, and it's a lovely campus; it still is one of the prettiest of the HBCUs.  So that's what has stuck--I started a lot of other programs; we started a Banneker Honor's College that temporarily was closed, but now they have an honor's program again.  We started a few other programs, so, but we had resources to do that, particularly the construction resources.
Speaker 1: Now, were you able to found a graduate program in engineering?
Speaker 2: No, I did not start any graduate programs in engineering.  I think there was a master's program there when I got there, but I really focused on the undergraduate program; to strengthen it to attract very able students.  Prairie View had not been very attractive to students who had other options, let's say.  And one of the things I wanted to do was to compete for students who got scholarships at University of Texas [Austin, Texas].  I want Prairie View to be a place that offered challenging education through honors programs and was physically attractive so that a student who really wanted to come to Prairie View was not deterred by a concern that he would not get the same education, because I thought--Prairie View provides a different environment for the education of black students.  It's not the only environment, but it's an alternative, and I wanted it to be an alternative that would be a good alternative for students of various backgrounds.
Speaker 1: So doing something with the actual physical plan was necessary?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to make it attractive, to make it attractive, and then create programs, like honor's programs that would attract students who had many other options.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a highlight of your presidency that you look back at?
Speaker 2: No, it was my intention of being there five years, out of a five-year contract, I stayed six.  I wouldn't say that was the highlight.  I built a library, and the library is the most prominent building on campus, and that was my idea, and we made it happen; the library is still there.  So that's the most significant physical feature.  We built several buildings.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did enrollment increase?
Speaker 2: Yes, enrollment went from about forty-seven hundred to fifty-three hundred when I was there.  That was important.  Enrollment and average, I'll say two scores went up.  Although we remained a very open university, but on average, the quality of the student body increased.  I established certain rules there; sometimes they didn't have rules, and sometimes they were not enforced.  Like you've got to maintain a certain average, you go on probation, and if you're really not serious then you shouldn't be around. We had students who, who enrolled just to be there in the fall for the football season and didn't go to class, carried very bad averages, so that was a situation that was not a good thing for other students to see somebody who wasn't taking it seriously, you know, just there for the partying.  And there weren't that many, but a few will spoil the whole situation, so we established some requirements for, you know, being there and coming to the party.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any particular field of study that Prairie View is, you know, kind of noted for?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Prairie View has long had a very large engineering program, so it's known for engineering.  It's an A&M university, so it has agriculture.  When I was there, I worked hard to improve the business school, so I think the business school is pretty good.  The biology department is pretty strong there, the education department is strong, so there are some strong programs.  And I think we improved them, we improved the faculty, but, you know, Prairie View has been around a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, after your presidency was over, you stayed to teach, you know, for a couple more years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the reason for that was my youngest daughter was still in high school when I--I didn't want to leave, and I really wanted to get back to my research, and I was more about doing my research than teaching.  So I had gone out to Honeywell and gotten some money for an endowed chair, so I decided to put myself in that endowed chair and enjoy it, a year of intellectual work, and I did teach, and I did do some research, because I really didn't want to leave until my daughter graduated--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was the following year.
Story_ID: 24558
Speaker 1: All right.  So in 1990 you went to Michigan State [University] in Lansing [Michigan] to serve as vice president of research and graduate studies, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that position was consistent with my background, you know, the Pentagon, the engineering, so, I really enjoyed that job, too, because it was intellectually stimulating, because I got a chance to work with faculty across the campus and all different areas, and I enjoyed that.  I was hired by John Depiazzio, who was president at the time.  Unfortunately, he left after two years, but I did enjoy that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You taught some electrical and computer engineering classes at Michigan State?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah.  In 1995 I--when I went to Michigan State, I was vice president and then professor, so I had to get tenure in the department in order to be a vice president, so I had both.  And the notion was I would eventually be a professor.  In '95 [1995], I, in '96 [1996] I became a full time professor and started teaching and writing proposals, but after about a year, I decided I was not going to go back to my old research, I was going to use my background to help the department in other ways, and in particular, to recruit and graduate minority graduate students in electrical engineering.  And I went to my chair, and I said I know you evaluate faculty members on a variety of things, teaching and how much money they bring in, I can bring in more money than most people, but it won't be for research, it will be to support graduate students, and I'll work with other faculty as their research advisor, what do you think of that.  He said fine, so by being able to get funding, you're able to do the things you want to do, and I'm free to enjoy that.  I mentored about fifty Ph.D. students where I provided partial support for them.  About forty-two of those have been minority students.  We've had about 125 master's minority students, so that's been very satisfying, and, you know, if you ask me, I know you're going to ask me; my legacy leaves almost 200 graduate students as part of my legacy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That comes a little bit later.  So you've been at Michigan State ever since, then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The program you were talking about, development, was a Sloan engineering?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the one, okay.
Speaker 2: I've had a long relationship with the [Alfred P.] Sloan Foundation, and I got a grant from them for my Urban Systems program, I went to work for them as a program officer for the minorities and engineering thing.  So, when I needed money for this, I went back to them and said give me some money for this and they've supported me for fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Have you been able to satisfy your research needs?
Speaker 2: I'm not doing research anymore.
Speaker 1: You're not doing research anymore?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I serve on the research committees of students, but I'm not their primary advisor.  So in my field, like signals, I serve on the dissertation committees and the--so that I provide general advice to the students, but they have a faculty research advisor.  So I recruit them, mentor them, provide significant financial support, but they have a different research advisor.
Speaker 1: We've been told by some of the people we've interviewed who are in science and engineering that research is so consuming and demanding that's it's really hard to just do a little research, you have to almost plunge your complete self into it.  I've had people tell me that they didn't know when it was Christmas or, you know, when they were doing research, it was like all their waking hours.
Speaker 2: I used to be like that (laughing) when I was at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor], when I was at the Rand Corporation [Santa Monica, California], yeah, all my waking hours.  It takes concentration because you got to dig deep, deep, deep, and you can't stop and come back, you know, climb out of the hole and go back, you gotta spend the time, and I just decided that impact, the impact of my going back to my research at Michigan State was much less than the impact of recruiting and graduating all these minority engineers, you know. My election to the [National] Academy of [Engineering] was about impact.  My impact on engineering by managing the R&D [research and development] programs exceeded my impact by publishing papers.  So while I enjoyed the research, there are other things that have more impact.  And what I'm doing now has more impact than if I had just done research.
Speaker 1: All right, and you received some recognition, as you mentioned, a little while ago, you were elected to the Engineers Hall of Fame?
Speaker 2: National Academy of Engineering.  And in 2004 you received the Founders Award from NACME [National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering] during the gala celebration of the organization's thirtieth anniversary, and in 2008 you received the Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement from the American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS].  And, I'm sure there are other awards, I'm sure, many, many, many.  So, are you still teaching at the present time?
Speaker 1: I don't teach.  I stopped teaching in '05 [2005]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Because I'm managing about twenty-eight students, plus I like to spend time in New Orleans [Louisiana], so my chair allows me not to teach, because I'm fully occupied otherwise.
Speaker 2: So you're basically advising and managing the students, graduate studies of students?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 24559
Speaker 1: All right.  We do always ask this question about legacy.  So, while it's fresh, what today would you consider to be your legacy then, to sum up?
Speaker 2: My legacy is what I have impacted that makes a difference.  My work at the Pentagon is recognized by the National Academy [of Engineering]--by my election to the Academy.  And my impact is large because of the scale of what I did, you know, like twelve billion dollars per year.   The sheer scale meant that I had some impact; I had made a difference.  The other impact is on minorities and engineering, you know helping to create and conceive these organizations with the support of the [Alfred P.] Sloan Foundation; have put in place things that will exist for a long time and have existed, and the other is what I'm doing at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] now, these 175 minority graduate students, that's my impact, that's a legacy.
Story_ID: 24560
Speaker 1: I've also mentored individuals.  The current president of the University of Detroit [Michigan], Mercy calls me his mentor.  He's younger than I am, he's from New Orleans [Louisiana].  There're other individuals around who I see as part of my legacy; not that I created them, not that I deserve a lot of credit for them, they give me credit for having influenced them.  So there're several of those people, but the legacy is in people, it's in all the weapon systems I worked on at the Pentagon, those are the two sides of it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, when you look again back on everything you've done, is there any major thing that you would do differently, if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 1: I heard President [Barack] Obama say something recently; somebody asked him that question, if he had something to do over from his first two years, what would it be, and he said I would communicate better.  He said, "I thought that if I worked at the policy and if I got the policy right that that was sufficient."  But I realize now, he said he needed to communicate that to the public.  That's a lesson that has taken me a long time to learn that just doing it sometimes is not sufficient, you've got to communicate.  So I try to communicate a little better now, and this interview is part of communications.  I've told you things tonight that normally I wouldn't communicate, and I've learned the value of just letting people know what you do and what you think.  So if I had to do it over again, I would do more of that.
Story_ID: 24561
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question, too.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns.  My hope is that the African American community will make economic progress.  It's been too slow, and it's been too uneven.  We've had individual African Americans who've done extremely well; we have a president who's an African American, yet too many African Americans are still in the poverty that we've seen.  So my hope is to make some progress there.  And I think it's just going to take a lot of work, we have to work at it.  What I'm doing will hopefully make some difference, it's not going to solve the problem, but everybody needs to make a contribution.  I'm trying to educate people so that they can live a better life, and I'm trying to convince them that they have to give back.  Everybody I work with at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] understands that I might call upon them to help me to give back.  So that's just a small part, but that's--that's my hope.  My concern for the African American community is that we won't get it; that we won't recognize that we can succeed, we can do better and it's worth it, so that's a concern.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us something about your family.  We neglected to--
Speaker 2: My immediate family?
Speaker 1: Yes, you got married and that's kind of sneaked past us so we never talked about it.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'll be brief.  I met my wife in--my current wife in 1961 when I graduated from college.  She's from Chicago [Illinois] and she had met my roommate, Jim Goodwin, the lawyer in Tulsa [Oklahoma], previously, and he gave me her number, and four years later we got married in 1965, when I was at [Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland], and she came to Hopkins.  She's a teacher, so she taught.  And our first child was Kristin.  In 1969 when I was a White House fellow, she was born.  Kristin is now a government employee.  She works for EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency.  She's created some very imaginative programs to work with industry to help them be greener to pollute less, to waste less.  So she organizes these companies and helps them adopt state-of-the-art methods.  My other daughter, second daughter is a lawyer in New York City.  She graduated--well, she's two years younger than Kristin.  So, they're both single women and I enjoy them a lot.
Story_ID: 24563
Speaker 1: Alright, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered by my immediate family and broader family as someone who cared about them, and someone who wished them well and someone who did as much as he could to help them grow, so that's, that's--family is important.  It comes down from generations with me that family is extremely important.  In terms of the black community, I would hope that some would remember that I worked to improve the opportunities of black people.  Some will remember my work at the Pentagon, maybe not a lot, but when they see the systems, the helicopters and the missiles, Percy Pierre had something to do with that, so that's--I think that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you, Sir.
Story_ID: 24564
Speaker 1: All right, can you describe this photo for us, from left to right?
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of my father and my bride.  My father is Percy Pierre, Sr., my bride is Olga the former Olga Markham, there's me, there's my mother Rosa [Villavaso], and my younger sister, Rosalind.
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: That is 1965.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my wife Olga with my daughter Kristin and myself about 1970.  That's again, that's me and my daughter Kristin, probably 1970.  That's me Percy at the house in which I was born.  That's not a good picture of it, but that's St. James [Parish], Louisiana, where my grandfather built the house.  That's me in New Orleans on my back deck, and my house there; I was born in New Orleans, but that's me.  If I could pick a year, it would be, maybe that's 2004, maybe.
Speaker 1: Is that the camel back house?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  That's my family with my sister Rosalind, myself, my mother sitting down, my sister Clare, Sister Clare of the Assisi, and my father, Percy, Sr.  That's me in my New Orleans house.  This is not the Hamilton Street house, it's the house I bought when I had enough money to buy the house I wanted.  I spend a lot of time in New Orleans doing that.  That's me, where's that, that's in Michigan.  That's probably, oh, 2007 or '08 [2008].  That's in Antarctica, one of the dry valleys.  People in the background are navy people who were escorting me to explore the dry valleys of Antarctica.  Now, that's a reunion picture of former White House fellows and spouses.  I was a White House fellow in '69 [1969], that is 2005.  Now, I have another picture of when they were young.
Speaker 1: Okay, this must be the one.
Speaker 2: These are the same people when they were young.  These are the White House fellows in that picture, 1969, lots of people won't give names.  That's me when I worked at the Rand Corporation [Santa Monica, California] about '68 [1968].  I had--was clean-shaven and had lots of hair.  That's Secretary Harold Brown who was Secretary of Defense swearing me in as assistant secretary of the army for research and development. And that's me along with some officials of Hughes aircraft after taking a ride on the Apache experimental helicopter before it was finished.  They wanted to show me what it was about.  I don't know where that was taken, but I had a mustache, and I had hair, so that was probably oh, around '81 [1981].  This is my fourth grade class, and I'm on the top row, second from the left.  That's St. Joan of Arc grade school in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
