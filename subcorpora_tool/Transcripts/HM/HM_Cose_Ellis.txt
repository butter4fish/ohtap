Speaker 2: Thirteenth, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in New York City [New York] on West 96th Street.
Story_ID: 39693
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer; first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't think I do have a favorite food actually; I mean I like, I like fish and I tend to eat a lotta salmon so if I had to make a choice, that might be it, but I like a lotta things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue would be my favorite color.
Speaker 1: All right.  A favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: That would be autumn.
Speaker 1: All right.  A favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: Brazil.
Speaker 1: And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  I do not have a favorite phrase.
Story_ID: 39694
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's [Jetta Mae Cose] side of the family and your father's [Raney Cose] side but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name was Jetta Mae, J-E-T-T-A Mae, M-A-E Cameron, C-A-M-E-R-O-N.  Her married name was Jetta Mae Cose.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in West Point, Mississippi and that was July--what is this--16th or 17th and that would be 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what are the stories from that side?
Speaker 2: I can't trace it far back at all; I mean, essentially, my awareness of my mother's side of the family begins with her generation.  She was from West Point, Mississippi; my grandfather on my mother's side died long before I was born.  I understand that he was an itinerant preacher; don't--never knew him.  My (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What was his name?
Speaker 2: I don't even know his name, or my grandmother's name for that matter.  My, my grandmother on that side of the family died also when I was extremely young.  I have very vague recollections of her, knew her only as Big Momma, when they would--when she would come visit occasionally from Mississippi.  So the generation that I knew about is essentially my mother's sisters, her--my aunts and my cousins, and on my--well you haven't asked about my father's side yet.
Speaker 1: We're still on your mother's side, so--what kind of work did your mother's parents do in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, my grandfather--from what I understand, was an itinerant preacher; whether he did other work, I just don't know.  I, I, I never visited Mississippi when I was a kid.  I never really knew that part of the family so I have no real idea.  As I said, he was dead long before I was born, so I just don't know.
Speaker 1: And your--okay.  Same with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother--I, again, don't know what she did.  I, I know they had some--the family had some farm property in Mississippi so I'm assuming that they were farmers at some point or at least some generation did farming, but what kind of farming and most of the property, I'm also given to understand, was essentially stolen by, by folks in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now by folks, you mean white folks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--By white folks in Mississippi, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is a story--to me (laughter).  I mean it's a story.
Speaker 2: Well, it's a common story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--land is stolen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--it's a common story that happened to black folks who owned land in the South--absolutely.  But at the time all that occurred, I was, I was an infant or it was before I was born so I just have no, no real direct knowledge of that.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not asking about direct knowledge, but the stories--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --of what informed--you know, how--your sense of what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, it's not something my mother talked with us about so, so if we over--we'd over-hear stories sometimes when she would say things like "Those folks have taken our land," and, and, and she was rather upset about that.  But in terms of my having any actual knowledge of what happened to the land or how much land there was, I just don't know.
Speaker 1: Well that's not unusual; a lot of people don't know all the details but I sense that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't know any of the details but I, but I, but I certainly have a sense that she felt very strongly, and I'm sure she was right.  You know, that property that she and her family owned was stolen by, by white folks in Mississippi.
Story_ID: 39695
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so is this--is that a contributing reason to how your mother [Jetta Mae Cose] wound up in Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, and again, you know, my family is an interesting family in the sense that there were a lotta things that were not talked about at all, and I think because they were things that were very painful for my, my mother and presumably also for my father [Raney Cose].  I mean I did not know until I was 10 or 11 that my mother had been married before, and had actually had a--another child before, a son, and clearly had a husband before.  Both of them had died while in Mississippi for reasons that she would--of causes that she would never talk about.  As a kid, you speculate about things, and I remember being convinced at one point that there'd been some awful fire that they had all--that her son--I think it was a son, that her son and her husband had been killed in; but she would never talk about it, and I was later sort of given to understand that they died from illnesses of various sorts in the South.  They were poor, and this was a time when black poor people in the South did not have good health care at all.  And I also remember as a very young child sometimes coming upon my mother in the kitchen and she would be crying and she'd be--and she would say things similar to, "You find out who your real friends are when you lose everything."  But she would never talk about this whole period of her life, and I only found out that she had a previous family because one day when I was in middle school I think, I remember looking at--there was a photo album that she had and I was sitting there looking at photo albums and we were looking at, looking at pictures throughout there and there were pictures of my dad and us and other people, and then there was this picture of this rather nice looking guy wearing a hat, and I'm going--and I said, "Whoa, who's that?"  And she said, "Oh, that's my first husband."  I said, "Your what?" (Laughter), and a little bit later there's a picture of a kid, and I said, "Well who's that?"  And she said, "Well that's my first child."  And I'm goin', "Huh?"  But again, it was just something that she did not talk about and--because my father also, I think, was someone who just didn't talk about, you know, his past life.  I think as, as a child, you learn very early that there are subjects that are just not good subjects to bring up with your parents.  There, there are things that are just out of bounds, and after a certain point, didn't ask very much about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So I guess you kinda conclude that these are things they don't wanna talk about because they're bad things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well they're things that--well clearly in my mother's case they were very painful, and she just would not address 'em; her way of dealing with it was to, was to, at least in terms of us, just not to share anything about that period of her life.
Story_ID: 39696
Speaker 1: Now do you know anything about your mother's [Jetta Mae Cose] education?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean she was--she had gone to high school; I'm not sure that she had graduated from high school, but had gone to high school in West Point, you know, in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  West Point is a location in Mississippi I've heard about before.  By living in Chicago [Illinois], there was actually a West Point Baptist Church--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --on 39th near Oakwood somewhere in that area I know; I've seen it.  Is it--do you have any connections to that church or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  We didn't have any, any connection at all to that church; I mean we were raised Methodist.  We went to a church called Gammon, G-A-M-M-O-N, Gammon Methodist Church [Gammon United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois], when I was young, on the west side, and I have no idea whether the West Point church has any connection to West Point, Mississippi or whether it's just a coincidence.
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it does have a connection to West Point, Mississippi.  It may be--I'm thinking it's like a community of people that came from West Point, you know--
Speaker 2: Could be.
Speaker 1: --founded it; not necessarily populate it now, but that's what I'm thinking.
Speaker 2: Now it very well could be, but as a kid it's not as if we ever traveled there, it's not as if I had any direct or personal connection to West Point.  If I were to go to Mississippi, I would have to look it up on a map (unclear) to find it, and so it was not part of my consciousness as a place that I knew at all when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Would you say it's a place that your parents didn't have a lot of affection for?  Didn't want to go back to?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents--my father was from Louisiana, so he was not from Mississippi, but they were both products of the segregated South, and my--later in life, my mother at some time suggests that perhaps they would want to move back to the south and my father was adamantly opposed to that; he would--just did not want to have anything to do with that, and he was certainly--he certainly was very outspoken about how bitter and, and angry he was about segregation in the South and about, you know, about white people in the South and about having to deal with that.  So for him it was, it was not even, not even--ever a consideration to move back south again.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--now do you have a sense of when your mother actually moved to--I guess she moved after her first--sometime after her first marriage and all that, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she moved sometime after that, but no, I don't have a real sense of, of when that happens; I mean my, my assumptions is that it was sometime in the '30's [1930s] or '40's [1940s] but no, I don't really have a sense at all of when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  She'd have been in her 30's, I guess, right?--by the '40's [1940s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, by that time she would have been.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And also her, you know, they were a part of this migration of folks from the South to Chicago [Illinois] because several of her sisters also moved to Chicago and I'm pretty sure that she was not the first one in her family to move to Chicago, so she already had a support network when she moved here--or moved there I should say.
Story_ID: 39697
Speaker 1: Now did she [Jetta Mae Cose] come from a large family?
Speaker 2: Did she have a large family?
Speaker 1: Did she come from a large family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were six or seven kids I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So do you know what kind of work she did when she--
Speaker 2: I know what kind of work she did before she was married.  She would sometimes do work in people's homes, so she basically was a housekeeper or a maid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What they call day work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly--what they called day work; she would do that kind of work.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--But once she began to have kids, she did not work; so--again, you know, the period of time that I was conscious, she did not work at all outside of the home.
Story_ID: 39698
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm gonna go to your father's [Raney Cose] side.  Can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, first name Raney, R-A-N-E-Y and his last name is Cose, C-O-S-E.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind the name Cose?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there is, but I'm not the one who can give it to you.  In fact, my--I mean these people have told me that it's a name of French origin; other folks have said that it's, it's a name of English origin.  I actually have come across it very seldom, and have no idea where the name came from; I sometimes wondered whether it was an invented name to tell you the truth, but I just don't know.  I mean my--the, the section on my father is gonna be shorter than the section on my mother because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: Well do you know his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well it's--it was Louisiana; I don't know exactly where in Louisiana, and it would have been April what--1903; I think it was April 4th--April 4th, 1903.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he never mentioned a town in Louisiana where he was from or any--
Speaker 2: I'm sure he must have at some point, but it did not stay with me, and again it's this--I mean but my father's story, you know, is a story of somebody who left home very young--I think he was 12 or 13 when he left home, for reasons that--for reasons that he would never explain, and was on his own after that.  And so--and totally cut himself off from whatever family that he had in Louisiana, so we don't know a single relative from my father's side of the family and we don't know why he cut himself off from those relatives.  What I do know is stories that he told of doing all kinds of work as a very young man; everything from being a cowboy out west to being a prospector in Mexico and making his way from one end of the country to the other and then back again working in New York [New York] at some point, you know, in the construction of the subways and ending up in Chicago [Illinois] sometime during the depression and deciding to stay in Chicago.
Story_ID: 39699
Speaker 1: So what kind of work did he [Raney Cose] do in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: In Chicago he worked for an industrial laundry--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so he would get up every morning very early and go to his laundry and then come home every evening from that work and that, and that was the only job that I ever knew him to have.  I mean apparently as a, as a young man he did all kinds of work--whatever he could find or wherever he could find it, as I said, even in Mexico.
Speaker 1: A prospector in Mexico; this is a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--He had stories about being a prospector in Mexico.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of the stories--what he said about that?
Speaker 2: Well he said that he didn't find any gold, he didn't find anything (laughter), and so he ended up--and, and, and he would tell stories about when he was translating for--you know, for, for people, you know, in Mexico.
Speaker 1: So he could speak Spanish.
Speaker 2: He could speak Spanish, yeah.
Speaker 1: Emm.
Speaker 2: But this happened long before I was born and so it was--so my direct experience of him was someone who went to work every day, you know, at the laundry in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So your parents were older (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--They were older when they had me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--than most people's parents in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think my mother was forty when I was born, and my dad was fifty at the time, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They would have been like--of course, I'm older than you are, but they would correspond to the age of my grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: My grandmother was born in 1901 and that--you know, so that's like--'cause I know that generation but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, it was--yeah, they were definitely older and it was obviously a second family for my, for my mom who ended up having five kids, including me.  I had two brothers and two sisters, yeah, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I'm gonna get all that in detail, but I'm just--now you probably don't know if your father ever had another family.  He was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--My father's whole (unclear) experience, except for selected stories he would tell that I'm sure he found interesting, was pretty much off the table.  If you would ask him something about why you left home, you would get a vague answer that, you know, things weren't right there, or something like that, which really didn't tell you anything; and you would ask, you know, what had happened in Louisiana and again you wouldn't get a direct answer about what had happened there.  So, so there was no real information and so no, I have no idea whether he--and then again, all I had was the speculation of a child, you know.  I would speculate that he had been married before and I speculated that he was, that he was running from something or escaping something, but what that might be, I have not the faintest idea in fact.
Speaker 1: It sounds like he had a lot of adventures in life, certainly.
Speaker 2: He definitely had a lot of adventures, and he had stories about different places.  I remember him commenting once that one reason he loved San Francisco which apparently he went to as a young man, was that you could actually check into a hotel in San Francisco as a black person.
Story_ID: 39700
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he [Raney Cose] have any stories about being a cowboy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they were--and I'm not even sure what states he was in.  I mean they were, they were western states and, and he would just say that he used to work as a cowboy and that he had--and that was a great period of his life, but he didn't go into particular detail about that.
Speaker 1: So that was the highlight?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--from what he talk about, it sounded like as a young man when he was traveling from one end of the country to another and doing different things and having adventures, that was the time of his life that he would return to and that he sort of seemed to romanticize a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it during the 19--probably the '40's [1940s] and the '50's [1950s] that being a cowboy was the most romantic thing to be, as all kids know that grew up and you knew it; you know, watching television and being a cowboy is--all the kids want to be a cowboy.
Speaker 2: Sure.  And I'm sure that's probably part of the reason he would tell the stories because it made him more--a more romantic figure.  I imagine the same reason he would tell stories about prospecting in Mexico because that made him this very interesting, mysterious guy, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he could speak Spanish, and did he have any other talents that you--could he play any instruments or--
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't musical.  He was--he was very smart; I mean he was not highly educated at all.  He had left school--he hadn't even finished grade school, so he was not highly educated but he was a, but he was a very smart man; he had a lot of, a lot of street knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So here's a man that leaves home at 12 and does all these things before he ends up in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Before he ends up in Chicago; and when I asked him why he ended up staying in Chicago, what he said was that there were no jobs anymore, it was during the Depression, and he had a job so he decided to stay in Chicago, and eventually he met my mom and they got married and that's where they started their family.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us the name of the place he worked, the big laundry?
Speaker 2: Was it the Great Western Laundry?  I think it was called Great Western but I'm not even gonna swear to that--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --but it was a, but it was a--you know, a laundry on the west side of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it near where you lived?
Speaker 2: It was within walking distance of where we lived.  But he never took us there but he would walk to work every day.
Story_ID: 39701
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met, that they tell?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there's a story.  I don't really know the story, I mean, other than that he met her on the street, walking or something, and decided that she was cute, and started talking to her.  So they weren't introduced by anybody as such; I think he was a, you know, a man about town, and he saw an attractive woman and he spoke to her and they ended up going out.
Story_ID: 39702
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, can you tell us--when you consider your parents' personalities, their talents, their dispositions, their sense of humor, the way they look, walk, talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I take after both of 'em in different ways; I think in terms of looks, I'm pretty much a blend of the two of them.  My father was very dark, my mother was lighter.  I think in terms of personality, I'm probably closer to my father.  My father was rather taciturn; he was--even though he was not terribly educated, he was rather cerebral.  My mother was much more emotional than my dad and I think my style, my personal style, was much closer to my father's than it was to my, to my mother's.
Story_ID: 39703
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well can you list your brothers and sisters for us, and tell us where you fit in there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm in the middle.  The oldest of the family is Audrey; she's five years older than I am.  After Audrey [Audrey Small] came Robert [Robert Cose] who is two and a-half years older than I am; and then I came along.  After me, there was Larry [Larry Cose] who's--what, two years younger than I am.  And then there's Laverne [Laverne Cose] who's my younger sister and who's five years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did they--what occupations did your siblings pursue?
Speaker 2: My sister--my older sister Audrey started out as a school teacher, decided to--elementary school--decided she didn't like that very much after a fairly short time, and then became a real estate investor.  She got married, moved to Atlanta [Georgia], bought a great deal of property in Atlanta--small properties, small homes and whatnot, and turned them over and pretty much made her career as a private property owner in Atlanta.  My brother Robert had an interest in mathematics and he ended up becoming a computer programmer; he dropped out of college I think maybe half of a semester before he graduated, and he came along at that time when you didn't need a college degree to be a computer programmer.  He had a talent for numbers; he had an interest in that sort of stuff and so he ended up--he worked as an actuary for a while but then he ended up doing computer programming.  My younger brother Larry actually worked as a journalist for a while; he sort of followed in my footsteps.  I got him a job with the Chicago Sun-Times and he did that for several years as a journalist, ended up going back to school, got himself an MBA [Master of Business Administration], became a public relations person for a--for the phone company, and then became an investment person with Smith Barney, and ultimately started his own, his own investment firm.  And Laverne was educated in, in special education with the intention of teaching, I guess, at one point, but then got recruited by the Navy into their Officers' Training Program and went to Officers' Candidate School and became an officer in the Navy.  And she did that for several years, and when she left the Navy, became a consultant working with--basically a management consultant working closely with groups that deal with computers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so everybody did fairly well I'd say.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean certainly given where we started and the kind of community that we came up in, we did much better than most folks who, who came out of that community, I would say, yeah.
Story_ID: 39704
Speaker 1: Now did you live in the same neighborhood on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] the whole time you grew up on the West Side, or did you live in different spots?
Speaker 2: No, we, we grew up--I, when I was born, we were living on West Roosevelt Road on the West Side of Chicago, and when I was five was when we moved to the home that I really remember as my home which was the housing projects--the Henry Horner Housing Projects on the West Side of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay. So that would have been 1956 or so?
Speaker 2: That would have been around '56 [1956]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that we moved there and, and what I do remember--as I said, I was five so my, my memory is, is not totally clear.  But I do remember it was a huge step up for us because it was a much bigger place.  I believe it had three bedrooms, and I remember my first day at the place just being struck with how large it was; I mean it actually was not a large apartment at all, but I remember being struck with how large it was and, and how much nicer it was because there was, there was grass outside and it was--it actually became known as one of the worst housing projects in Chicago, you know, eventually and actually there was a--there's a book written, "There Are No Children Here," about that housing complex.  But for us it was a huge step up.
Speaker 1: Now at the time that your family moved in, I think it was fairly new, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--I don't know exactly when it was built, but it had not been there for that long, at that point.
Speaker 1: I know I've heard stories from people who come in on the beginning of the housing--even the high-rise housing projects, that talk as you do about it being a step up, and how there was grass and there was--there were services (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I wouldn't say there were great services, I mean--but there was, there was certainly grass and, and I think it's all relative; I mean we came out of a tenement, tiny apartment in an awful place, and from a kid's perspective, seeing this relatively new building and these elevators and, and, and a much larger place, there being chutes which you put garbage down that were almost magical.  You just put the garbage down this thing and it disappears; for a kid, that was, that, that was impressive.  Now if I had been a kid coming from some affluent suburb, I'm sure my reaction would have been very different to that kind of housing.  But yeah, for me and where I was coming from at that point, it was a--it was almost like moving into, I don't know, luxury housing.
Speaker 1: I guess in the long look, did you see it go up or down?
Speaker 2: Well I think suddenly a couple of things happened; I mean I think objectively things got worse in the projects in that neighborhood.  Eventually, gangs became more of an influence, eventually there was more violence and things of that nature, so objectively that just happened.  But I think also like a lotta kids who are basically born poor and, and, and raised poor, it took some time for me to realize that we were poor.  Everybody that I knew was pretty much in the same circumstance, you know, that I was, and so this was just normal life again for me.  So, so there are two things that happened to me, one is that I think objectively things did get worse there, but also subjectively my awareness increased and I realized as I got older that the universe of that neighborhood and, and, and these projects was not quite what I had originally thought that it was.
Story_ID: 39705
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, I do.  My earliest childhood memory--I have two that are very early.  One is--goes back to when we were living on West Roosevelt Road and I remember in the middle of the night, for some reason, my father [Raney Cose] either awakened me or I had awakened and he decided to show me either a rat or a mouse that had, had fallen into one of his traps; I remember that, and I, and I remember looking at it and going, "Okay," and then sort of went back to sleep and not really knowing, you know, why that was important.  The other thing I remember was being fascinated by cars, just by the movement of cars, you know, going down the street.  And my mother [Jetta Mae Cose] used to tell a story that I have no memory of at all, but apparently when I was around three I guess, there was this day when we were out for a stroll or something, and I went running towards the street at full speed, and she went chasing after me and could not catch me.  And just before I reached the street, I stopped and just stared, and then she caught up and, and grabbed me.  So I was fascinated, apparently, with cars and, and the movement of cars at that age, so those are the two very early memories that I have.
Story_ID: 39706
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now describe the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: The sights and sounds and smells of what?
Speaker 1: Growing up.
Speaker 2: Of growing up.  Well, I guess they depend because a lot of it was of course the sights and sounds and smell of the projects [Henry Horner Housing Projects, Chicago, Illinois].  The projects were--smelled like urine; at least the stairs--the stairs often did.  So urine and concrete were two of the big smells in the housing project itself.  The sights--well, we were on West Washington Street which was two blocks from Madison which was a pretty major commercial area so the sights and sounds of that neighborhood--I mean there was, you know, on one side going north I guess, there was a big playground, there was the Boys' Club [Union League Boys Club, Chicago, Illinois], there was--there were a couple of schools.  Going south was the commercial district so there were, well just all kinds of activity, all kinds of little stores and shops and whatnot.  At night, there were the street-walkers--the prostitutes on West Madison Street--that we saw.  But it was a--that was--I used to make that walk all the time because the library was on, was on West Madison Street so at least once a week when I got a little bit older, seven, eight I guess--or nine, would make the walk with my, usually with a brother or a sister, to the library and, and just remember there were a lot of small storefront businesses and--which I'm sure we'll get to this, but many of which subsequently got destroyed during the riots [The 1966 and 1968 Chicago Riots].
Story_ID: 39707
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was just thinking that when you were describing--you were describing Madison Street pre-riot, when all those businesses were thriving (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, but there, but there--well I don't know if they were all thriving but there were a lot of businesses there and, and that was--of course there were two big riots in Chicago [Illinois], '66 [1966] and '68 [1968], and they took out a lotta those places.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  So you're talking about Chicago that doesn't any--well, of course it's not gonna exist the way it did anyway but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well the housing projects don't exist anymore; I mean those have been, those have been torn down, you know, as well, so that whole neighborhood is radically different now than it was when, when I was coming up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You were close to the Chicago Stadium too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, two blocks away from Chicago Stadium, and there were--so weekends there would be--huge crowds would come into the neighborhoods and the parking and, and, and everything surrounding the stadium.  And it was actually when I--and it was also where the Ice Capades would, would be performed; and that was actually where I went on my first date, if you wanna call it a date, was when the Ice Capades were at the Chicago Stadium, and at the time, I was--I think 14, 15.  At the Boys' Club [Union League Boys Club, Chicago, Illinois], I was what they called a Junior Leader, and they gave us tickets to the Ice Capades Show so I invited the young lady I had a crush on and we went to the Ice Capades at the stadium.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's also where they bring the circus too, right?
Speaker 2: They did; they didn't give us free tickets to the circus so I never got to see the circus.
Story_ID: 39708
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What did you like to do as a little kid, you know, when you were in Henry Horner [Henry Horner Housing Projects, Chicago, Illinois]?  We'll start with Henry Horner.
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much what the other young kids liked to do, I mean I was--I used to play basketball a lot, and there was a playground right--there was a Boys' Club [Union League Boys Club, Chicago, Illinois] right next to the projects almost, and then adjacent to that was a playground, and I would spend a lotta time in either the Boys' Club or the playground, mostly playing basketball in the playground.  I was very interested and I thought good, you know, at table tennis at the time--ping pong, at bumper pool--the small pool, the small pool table; I used to play a lotta that.  And I also used to like to read, but I mean but my, my biggest love of activity as a kid were, you know, parents would just basically say, "Go outside," and going outside for the most part meant playing basketball.
Story_ID: 39709
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started at Brown Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], which was a few blocks away; I think it was on Woods, I think it was Woods between Washington and, and Lake, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Brown's a whole--one of the oldest Chicago [Illinois] public schools, from what I--I've been to Brown actually, and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it is like a school built at the turn of the century or beyond maybe.
Speaker 2: It was--it's an old school; I have no idea whether it, whether it even still exists, to tell you the truth.  And then went to, to Birney [Birney Elementary] for a while, which was, which was a school also very nearby (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Well let's stay on Brown for a second now.  What did you--you went there for kindergarten, I guess?
Speaker 2: From kindergarten and maybe first or second grade.  I can't tell you exactly when it shifted from Brown to Birney, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I take it you liked school, yeah?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: You didn't?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I (laughter), I liked some things about school; I mean what I, what I didn't like about school, and this started in the first grade, was that--I mean I was a bright kid, I could read before I went to school; and I remember being very excited about going to school and about the idea of school, and naturally getting to school and certainly it started in first grade being bored to tears because what happened for me in school was that we had a reader, and I don't remember was it Dick and Jane type reader, but it was some type of reader that we were supposed to spend--at that point they had semesters so it was the first semester, second semester--so it was grade 1A and 1B.  But we were supposed to spend the whole semester reading, you know, this blasted reader; and I read it the first day or two, and day-after-day after that, I remember the teacher leading the class through reading one page at a time, one word at a time, and just being totally bored by what was going on.  And ultimately I remember by the time I was maybe in second grade I guess it was--could have been second grade--I started amusing myself by reading whatever else I could read while they reading what they were supposed to be reading in the school, and ultimately ended up drawing and writing comic books and selling them to other kids for their milk money during school time because I was just totally bored with school.
Speaker 1: Now how did you learn to read before you got to school?
Speaker 2: At home.  My parents--my mother who--even though my parents were not highly educated, they recognized the importance of reading and of, and of getting some kind of education and they imbued us with that.  So I remember, you know, being able to write my name and all of that when I was very young, you know, and being able to read when I was very young.  And so for me, school was a big disappointment for the--actually for years and years it was a big disappointment because I sort of had had this idea that it was gonna be this interesting place and at least academically it was anything but that.
Speaker 1: So you're way ahead of what the school is trying to do.
Speaker 2: I got double promoted a couple of times.  I think when I was in second and fourth grade I was double promoted; but it didn't really help because I mean I was in, I guess what you would characterize now as a very low performing inner-city school, and it was predicated on the assumption that the kids were dumb and nobody was gonna learn much of anything, and occasionally--I mean teachers recognized that I was bright and I always tested well so I always did well on tests, but I remember in many classes I would sort of pretty much tune school out and then I would have a couple of teachers who would say, "Okay, well now we're gonna let Ellis read it so you can see how it's supposed to be read," and I had to figure out where they were and, you know, get the book and find out the place they were and read the passage that the teacher wanted me to read.  So for most of my public school life, actually pretty much all of my public school life, I was pretty alienated from school.
Story_ID: 39710
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any--say at Brown [Brown Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], were there any particular teachers that you liked or--
Speaker 2: There was one teacher, Mrs. Smith, who--and she was responsible for me getting double promoted at one point I'm pretty sure.
Speaker 1: What does that really mean, double promoted?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they--you get, you know, instead of being in 2A, you're put in 2B or whatever the numbers were but you get advanced a half-year ahead, and so I got advanced a half-year two times.
Speaker 1: But you're in the same grade but you're--
Speaker 2: Well, a higher level, same grade (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I know they used to tier the grades in one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well they didn't have tracks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--They didn't have tracks?
Speaker 2: --but they were, but they were basically two levels of the grades, yeah, so it would be like--so instead of getting the first half-year curriculum, I'd be getting the second half-year curriculum, you know.  And by being double promoted twice, I was actually promoted a full year ahead, so by the time I was, so by the time I was in fifth grade, I guess it was, I was a full year ahead of where I would have been if I had just progressed normally through school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were a year ahead of most people your age?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I ended up for instance--I mean I was, I was a senior when I was sixteen, you know in, in high school, and, and, and ended up graduating I guess, when I was 17, because of being double promoted when I was kid.
Speaker 1: When did you come out?  In '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: I came out in '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So Mrs. Smith, now what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well she was just very encouraging and, and she recognized that I was smart and she, you know, would just sort of encourage me a lot.
Story_ID: 39711
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And you--I was interested in you talking about your--you developing these comic books (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I had an interest--well I, I wouldn't--my, my brother Robert was actually a much better artist than I was; he had, he had, he's--I think he had a talent for drawing.  I was more interested in telling stories but I knew that in order to sell my comic books, I needed to have pictures.  And I was okay, you know, drawing, you know, pictures, and I had a cadre of fans who I could depend on to give me their milk money if I would like tell these little stories--illustrative stories, in school.  I mean during that period which was--I guess, you know, was the grade school period, I mean I even--at some point was selling homework to people (laughter).  I would do some kids' assignments if they paid me for it.
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] all right (laughter).  But selling homework, selling comics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember--I don't remember what grade I was in, maybe it was sixth grade--fifth or sixth grade, because I went to a different place for seventh and eighth.  I remember there was--our assignment was to write a poem, and I think I wrote four or five of the poems in class that day and the, and the teacher picked the best poem which happened to be one I had sold to a kid, and I remember being a little bit ticked off that I couldn't take credit for it.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good (laughter).  So did the kid turn it in in your handwriting?
Speaker 2: I'm sure they must have re-written it in their handwriting; I think--but no, I mean I think they were smart enough to do that but--
Story_ID: 39712
Speaker 1: All right.  So--now where did you go after Brown [Brown Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Now you were at Brown like until the third grade you said? (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Second or third grade.  I then, I then went to Birney [Alice M. Birney Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and I, and I don't know exactly why, I don't remember exactly why but there was--but that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: B-I-R-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's B-I-R-N-E-Y.  Is that in the same neighborhood?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--same neighborhood--Alice M. Birney School, same neighborhood--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and stayed there until I was--until I completed sixth grade.
Speaker 1: So that's fourth through the sixth, I guess.
Speaker 2: Roughly; I mean as I said I can't guarantee exactly what year I transferred (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now were you in those days reading newspaper?
Speaker 2: I wasn't reading the newspaper, I was--well no, that's not quite true, that's not quite true.  I mean, you know, we did not regularly get the paper except for--I mean we--I know we got it on Thursdays because that was when the--called the coupons--
Speaker 1: Yeah, shopping edition.
Speaker 2: --were in the newspaper, and I would certainly, you know, read it then.  But I was reading the thing--The Hardy Boys and books like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there a lot of periodicals coming to your house?
Speaker 2: No, there was not a lot of reading material at my house.  I mean the only books I recall being in the house were the set of encyclopedias--
Speaker 1: Oh that's good.
Speaker 2: --and the Bible, you know.  We had, we had bible stories, a lotta biblical stuff; my mother was quite religious.
Story_ID: 39713
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said you went to Gammon Methodist [Gammon United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Gammon Memorial (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Methodist Church, okay, all right.  Now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--I mean my, my father [Raney Cose] rarely went to church; I think he only went on, on Easter, so we got a sort of a mixed message about the importance of church.  But my mother [Jetta Mae Cose] was a regular church goer, and so we were very much involved in church activities.  I was part of the Methodist Youth Fellowship, I was--we went to whatever summer program they had at the, at the church so it was a big part of our social activities.  We would have, you know, dinners there; I'm pretty sure that the first dance I ever went to was at the church, which my mother had some reservations about--there being dancing in a church, but it was something for a young kid--for young people that they did at the church, so, so the church was very much a focus of activities when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to go to summer camp?
Speaker 2: I went to summer camp once in Michigan, and it was when I was, I believe 13--12 or 13.  And that was not through the church; that was through Boys' Club.  I was also very active in the Boys' Club [Union League Boys Club, Chicago, Illinois].  My--one of the, the--and I was a--I think I mentioned I was a Junior Leader in the Boys' Club.  And there was a program, I think, where they sent junior leaders--and junior leaders were people who were supposed to help out with some of the younger kids, and they're supposed to be sort of leadership examples I guess--was the idea.  And one year they sent us to a, to a summer camp so I did get to go to summer camp one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) do the union league, summer camp on the west side a lot--I don't know but that's okay.  So Boys' Club, summer camp (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It wasn't a Boys' Club summer camp, but it was a summer camp that was--the reason I went there was because of my affiliation with the Boys' Club; they somehow were connected with people who were organizing or who were involved in summer camp, so they, so they sent me there.
Story_ID: 39714
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So at Birney School [Alice M. Birney Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], you're there from four to six, and--now were you ever an honor student in school?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't have honor students as such, as far as I recall.  I mean I was always a good student; I mean I, I always got excellent grades when I was in, in school.  I mean I think the one exception that I can remember to me--to not getting good grades in school was maybe when I was in seventh grade; I was, I was considered somewhat of a behavior problem so, so, so the, so the head of--I think it's language arts. They called the language arts teacher who gave me what he called a red E, and I said, "What's a red E?"  He said, "Well E is what you get for excellent;" they were on the E, G, F system, you know in Chicago [Illinois].  "You got an E for excellent but it's red because of your behavior."  (Laughter).  So I got marked down for behavior I guess you wanna call it that but no, I, I always got very good grades but they--but as far as I, I know, they didn't have any such thing as an honor--honor students there.  When I--by the time I got to--there was--time I got to seventh grade, which was McKinley Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois], I do remember McKinley did have tracking of sorts, and there was a mistake that was made for my first year at McKinley because when I was--they had these--these standardized tests, and you took a test when you were in sixth grade, and I believe the other time was, was fourth grade, you know, and they were, and they were in either regional--either state or nationally (unclear), I'm not quite sure.  But when I was in sixth grade, I was reading at I believe the eighth or ninth grade level, and my math was even higher than that.  But what happened--no, I think it was sixth and second grade, but what happened when I went to McKinley is they looked at my second grade scores as I recall--either my second or fourth grade scores.  But anyway, they, they, they put me in a class based on scores that were either two or four years old.
Speaker 1: This is a--that doesn't seem wise.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Well, I don't know; I mean I have no idea what happened there.  I mean I think maybe they looked at these scores, let's just say for the sake of conversation; I just don't remember anymore, but let's just say for the sake of conversation, you know, that when I was in fourth grade, I was reading at the sixth grade level and doing math at the sixth grade level so, so let's--so, so, so when I got ready to go to seventh grade, I can see some, some administrator somewhere just seeing those scores and saying, "Oh, well these look like the type of typical scores we get from those schools, so we'll put the kid in the track for the slower kids in seventh grade."  So for a large part of my seventh grade year in McKinley, I was tracked with the low performers and I remember discovering this because I was in the school office for some reason and somehow got into my file and (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--Somehow.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--Somehow.
Speaker 1: Now can you describe how somehow was achieved?
Speaker 2: I don't remember why I was in the school office, but I, but I decided to look at my files and, and, and I, and I did, and I discovered that I was in the wrong place.  And also, you know, there's some confusion because there were kids I knew who were in the higher track and, and they were saying, "Well Ellis they're calling your name in this class as well as there," but they were also calling my name in the other class, so apparently I was double assigned, you know, on the basis of my two sets of scores in the two different classes.  Not that there was that much difference at the end of the day between the, you know, the two tracks in that school, but-
Story_ID: 39715
Speaker 1: Now this couldn't happen in a school where there's a lot of parent involvement where the parents knew what was going on or maybe, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, certainly it wouldn't happen in an upper middle-class neighborhood, but as I'm sure you know, in these sort of poor neighborhoods, parents aren't very involved, and the parents for the most part aren't highly educated; they don't really understand the school system, how they're doing things--somewhat intimidated by the people at school as well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this is a factor--I've run across this before, even in my own family, where a parent's intimidated (unclear) to participate in the PTA and other things because they see it in a social light rather than an educational light, you know.  And so your mother [Jetta Mae Cose] certainly jumped on the education thing early getting you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--She knew it was important, but in terms of actually dealing with the specifics of education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Did she come to the PTA meetings and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, no.  That was not something that, that she did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So she wasn't present (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It was not something that she felt, that she felt comfortable with.
Speaker 1: Your father [Raney Cose] either?
Speaker 2: No, my father even less so.  I mean my father was--I mean I'm not even sure my father could read, to tell you the truth, but he was certainly not at all involved in the, you know, in our education.  And, I mean I was, I was kind of an outspoken kid and I remember in seventh grade when I was in the, the low performing class challenging one of our teachers because we had some books that were clearly not designed for seventh grade kids, and I remember challenging the teacher and saying, "Why are we being assigned these books? These are not books we oughta be reading; these are not--these are books for younger kids."  And her response was, "Well, you kids can't read, you're lucky to get these."
Speaker 1: Emm.
Speaker 2: So it was, it was, it was, it was an--so, so my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You're talking about something else too here, and this (simultaneous)--the disconnect of a teacher.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, a disconnect of a teacher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You're in a class and she's saying that you all can't read.  She's not--she clearly doesn't understand that you can read above the class (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean there--but I think of the whole--I wouldn't say every teacher in there was disconnected, but I thought--I think some teachers in the school were quite good, but I, but I think that whole school was basically stuck in a rut and that rut was that we got a bunch of kids, you know, who were poor, who are--who can't read, and we're--and we have to babysit them for the period of time that we're here.  So a lot of my seventh grade experience was not getting an education at all.  I mean most of the teachers I don't think even tried to teach; they tried to maintain order and make sure that we, you know, didn't do awful things when school was going on, but school for me, at least in seventh grade, eighth, was a much better--but at least in seventh grade in that particular class, it was sort of a non-stop smorgasbord of shooting penny pool, pitching pennies, and other kinds of activities.
Story_ID: 39716
Speaker 1: So McKinley Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois]--this is where--just generally, what was the ratio of teachers racially over there on the west side at Brown [Brown Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], McKinley [McKinley Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], Birney [Alice M. Birney Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I, I, I would assume it had a lotta black teachers; maybe even the majority, I'm not positive about that--that Brown and Birney were black.  McKinley was a bit more mixed I think it was probably half and half where we had, you know, probably half whites, half, you know, half blacks.  But I think that--the attitudes about education, about the kids from--from as far as I could tell, didn't seem to rotate around the issue of race in terms of the black teachers encouraging us and the white teachers not, or whatever.  I think pretty much all the teachers, with some notable exceptions, but pretty much all of the teachers assumed that most of us were not there to learn, and most of us were not really capable of learning very much.  I mean I remember in McKinley we had a Spanish teacher--we had a Spanish class there; I remember a Spanish teacher telling the class, "Look, I don't care whether you learn or not, I'm gonna get paid anyway, you know.  So you can do what you wanna do in this class."  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That's something that's been heard all over America, you know, and a black teacher usually tells this to a black class.
Speaker 2: But this was a white teacher.
Speaker 1: A white teacher.
Speaker 2: That was, that was a white teacher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, well maybe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--but I, but I remember a black teacher telling us--and I guess she was trying to be helpful, when I was--maybe--I think it was in Birney--telling us that, "You know black people have lazy tongues," and I'm going, "What?"  But I think she was just trying to explain, I don't know, the way black people talked or something like that.  But that phrase stuck with me, that black people have lazy tongues.  But there were just many teachers and, and, and McKinley, in those years, was known as a pretty, pretty bad school.  I mean the year after I graduated, there was a guy who beat up the principal and put him in a hospital, you know.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--This is a junior high guy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, junior high guy, you know.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) adult.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean he used a pipe or something; it was not just his hands, but he, but he, but he--but it made news because the principal ended up being put in the hospital.  And there were student--I mean there were fights which, I mean I got introduced to brass knuckles and knives and things like that when I was at McKinley, and there was one principal--actually the same principal that got beat up, I'm pretty sure, who instituted a, you know, a weapons sort of check day; this was before they had metal detectors in schools.  And actually, it was before kids were carrying guns.  But there were people who carried knives; I actually carried a knife occasionally myself, you know.  There were people who carried knives and other things and, and the principal implemented a weapons check, a surprise weapons check, where you would have--lock the door and have everybody empty their pockets when he came in, and confiscate weapons.  So a lot of the focus of that school was not in education, it was in maintaining order.  And the class that I was in, you know, the seventh grade low performing class, I don't think there was even the pretense of trying to teach kids anything.  We had a group of girls who called themselves The Kissing Band, and they would like organize themselves, and different days and descend on some boy they decided selecting and kiss 'em (laughter).  You know, they were--as I said, I mean they were--I mean that's where I--I got very good at, at, at penny pool because instead of doing anything useful in school, we were sitting at our desks, you know, shooting people's pennies off the desk--gambling, basically.  It was just that kinda school.
Story_ID: 39717
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is a period--you're in school during the height of the Civil Rights Movement basically, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This would have been the early '60s [1960s], the middle--yeah, middle '60s [1960s], I guess, when I was in McKinley, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So President Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Was assassinated in '63 [1963] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--March on Washington [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, 1963] in '63 [1963], President Kennedy assassination.
Speaker 2: All that took place.  Well, the March on Washington I was in, I was high school by the time that that took place.
Speaker 1: No, you were still in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well '63 [1963], yeah that's right, yeah, '63 [1963].  I'm thinking of the, of the '68' [1968] thing.  But yeah, '63 [1963] I was still in, I was still in grade school, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so all this--did your parents [Jetta Mae Cose and Raney Cose] discuss this?
Speaker 2: It wasn't big family discussions about it.  My mother [Jetta Mae Cose] wasn't very political in that sense, but we were certainly aware of Martin Luther King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and we were certainly aware that there was this big movement going on.  And there would be comments about it from time to time, but it's never a point where my mom said, "Okay, let me sit down and explain segregation and what the Civil Rights struggle is about to you kids, and let's talk about, you know, the impact of race in America," or "Let's talk about the history of American Apartheid."  There was never that kinda discussion that took place at home.  But yeah, I mean there was a lot of reverence for, for, for Martin Luther King and, and, and, and certainly, you know, I was aware as a kid would be aware, you know, that all this stuff was going on and, and I had been--and we saw, you know, the scenes from the South, you know, of the dogs and, and, and people being beaten and things, you know, of that nature.
Speaker 1: Did your parents or other adults ever make reference to that being a reason why they weren't down there--because of the--
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Raney Cose] would certainly talk about--his thing was how awful the South was, and he would talk about how awful the South had treated people.  And my mother sometimes would as well; I mean she would talk about white people in general, and the South in particular, and how they had treated, you know, African Americans.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's also a known barber shop conversation about that kind of (unclear).  You know, I don't know if you went to barber shop or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I mean, I mean my, my dad cut our hair so, so we didn't have the barber shop conversations.
Story_ID: 39718
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  Now what about music?  Now the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] is a place where I know a lot of Blues musicians would come up and play on a porch and--over on Maxwell Street and other places (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah.  I actually had a group when I was in high school, and the--Verdine White and I were buddies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, now Verdine White is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Verdine [Verdine White] later became part of Earth Wind and Fire--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Maurice White formed Earth Wind and Fire--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Verdine and I knew each other, I think originally from the Boys' Club, and--at the time, I played the piano and Verdine played bass, and so--and his younger brother Freddy played drums.  So we decided to form a group; we called ourselves The Three Beats.  This would have been, as I said, my--at some point when I was in high school--he went to a different high school than I did; he went to Crane [Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I went to Lane Technical High School [Chicago, Illinois].  But we got together and for about a year, I mean we, you know, we would come together at my house and--'cause I had the piano there.  He would bring over his bass, Freddy would bring his drums, and we would practice.  We played a few venues; we either came in--I think it was--was it sec--I don't remember whether we were first or second in some talent show, but it was some talent show that we won.  (Simultaneous)-
Story_ID: 39719
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--First question is where did you pick up the piano and get piano lessons?  And the second one is what was your repertoire?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother sent me for piano lessons starting when I was, I think, maybe 10.  We had an upright piano that she had gotten very cheaply.  Somebody had--wanted to get rid of it and sold it to her very cheaply, and there was a guy who gave lessons on Ashland Avenue [Chicago, Illinois] that she heard about, and I believe she heard it through church somehow, and I think, I think paid him two or three dollars a week, you know, to teach me.  And so I took lessons for--not that long, but for a few years, and he was a classical guy in Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], etcetera, etcetera, and so that's what I was learning.  But by the time I got into high school I guess, I wanted to be cool, and playing classical music wasn't cool, so I wanted to do R&B type stuff and he wasn't really into that.  So I ended up stopping taking lessons and teaching myself some of that stuff because I could read music of course.  And so by the time that Verdine [Verdine White] and I hooked up, we were doing mostly R&B type stuff; I mean, you know, verses of the Temptations or the Miracles, you know, that kind of music.  A little bit of jazz but not--but basically it was, it was that kinda stuff.  And I was the pianist; I also did vocals, even though I'm not a great singer.  But I did vocals and--but a lot of our stuff was instrumental.
Speaker 1: Who would you say you sounded like of those groups?  I mean like in those days, I guess maybe Booker T. [Booker T. Jones, Booker T & the M.G.'s] or Junior Walker--I don't know.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I wouldn't say we sounded like anybody in particular; I mean I, I think that--I mean we had--I guess if the people--no, I wouldn't say we sounded like anybody in particular.  I mean we just had our own sort of approach, you know, to that.
Speaker 1: Did you do original songs?
Speaker 2: We had one or two, but we mostly did songs that were in the, in the public repertoire, and for the most part, we--either we'd get the sheet music to it or I'd work out the melody or something, yeah; and we would, and we would play that.  And the band was not together for that long.  We called ourselves The Three Beats; we were together for maybe a year and, and then after that the, the White family moved out of the neighborhood.  They moved actually to South Shore, which was the cause for the band breaking up after they moved out of the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So two of the Beats were gone (laughter).
Speaker 2: Two of the beats (laughter) were gone.  I mean, I mean I would run, I would run into--and they also had another brother, Monte [Monte White], who was sort of the manager, and I would run into one of the three of them, for several years after that, one place or another and, and I remember at one point--I think it was Verdine--told me he said, "Oh no, we're doing this sound track."  I said, "What kinda--it's a sound track?"  "Yeah," he said, "We're doin' a sound track for a movie."  "Well what movie?"  He said, "It's somethin' called Sweet Sweetback."  I said "Oh, what's that?" (Laughter).  So they actually--so, so they actually did the, the sound track for Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song [1971] which was, I think, the first commercial sort of thing they did, as far as I know--at least the one they got sorta known for.  But they also played with some other groups; I mean they went on and obviously became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I know they had a group--they were in the--I think they were in the Pharaohs, right?
Speaker 2: I think they were in the (unclear); they were in a couple other groups and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Played with Phil Carren (ph.), I think at one time.
Speaker 2: Well Maurice [Maurice White]was playing with Ramsey Lewis; he was older than we were, I think he was like 10 years older than we were.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I was gonna ask you about Maurice--
Speaker 2: Yeah so, so--yeah, so I didn't really know him other than to have met him, I think, once or twice.  But he was--so he was already in a professional music track and he was playing with Ramsey Lewis and, and Verdine and Freddy were much more serious about music than I was.  I mean their whole life was rotated around music and, and in fact, Verdine stayed at Crane [Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] I think even after he moved out because Crane had a good music program, even though it was an awful school.  But his interest was, was music.
Story_ID: 39720
Speaker 1: Well, we jumped into high school kind of inadvertently, but tell us how you--now you went to Lane Tech [Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now this is a--you had to test into Lane (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Had to test into it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us the story about how you became interested in Lane Tech and managed to go to Lane Tech.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I knew about Lane Tech 'cause my older brother Robert had gone there, so I was aware of it.  And it was a school you had to test into; I guess there were a few schools like that, and it was also all-male at the time.  And I always did extremely well on tests, I mean with any standardized tests I would take, I'd always get, you know, somewhere 95th, 97th, 98th percentile so, so I, I never had a problem with tests, you know.  And so it was sort of a given that I was gonna do well on the test, well enough to at least get into Lane.  And with, with the alternative being Crane [Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] which was the neighborhood school--neighborhood high school, it was a typical inner-city school with all the typical inner-city problems.  And so my, my mom encouraged me to think about Lane, you know, instead of that, even though Lane meant taking a bus every day and meant going to an all-white neighborhood.
Story_ID: 39721
Speaker 1: Now what is the--was there a gang issue by the time that you started--entered high school?  Was there a gang issue?
Speaker 2: There was the evolving gang issue.  I mean I came along at an interesting period in the West Side experience, which is to say that there had been gangs when I was younger--too young to become involved with them.  I think it was the Vice Lords and it was--I think it was--they were the big gang on the West Side at the time.  But they had been pretty much--by the time I came of the age where I would have been recruited by a gang, the gangs had been sort of wiped out; I think it was, you know, a combination of police action and who knows what else, but the--there were, there were two big west side gangs, the Vice Lords were one, and I forget what the other one was.  And I remember them being active when I was very young; I mean I remember at one point--and maybe it's one of these childhood memories that's half a memory and half something else, but I remember being very young and, and, and someone saying something about, "Oh, the Vice Lords are coming."  And what appeared to my--maybe five year-old sort of brain, as this cadre of men walking in formation and everybody scurrying into their houses as they came along the street and--but it's one of those vague sort of childhood memories that could be half fiction.  But I, but I do remember the, the Vice Lords being a feared force when I was very young in that part of the West Side.
Speaker 1: But you can negotiate neighborhoods and stuff without having (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--As a young kid, I didn't have any issue with gangs, and by the time I was a somewhat older kid, there was no dominant organized gang; I mean there were a lotta tough guys, and even the trip back and forth to school could sometimes be like walking a gauntlet, and there were people who would try to steal your money and they, and they, and they were people who would do things like that to you.  But there was no organized dominant gang, in that part of the west side when I was coming up, so I sort of dodged that whole gang thing.
Speaker 1: I've been told by Chicagoans, you know--in my introduction to Chicago [Illinois], my orientation, that there was like a West Side, South Side kinda thing where there was--guys on the West Side wore different styled clothing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they were called Gousters or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well Gousters--well they had--we had all kinds of names for ourselves.  I mean there were Gousters [Chicago Gousters] which was some sort of loose-fitting, cool type clothes; they, they--I don't know where they called themselves Ivy League but they were like, you know--but there was--called Ivy's, you know, who were more preppy looking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Skinny ties (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--yeah--type things, yeah.  Yeah, there was, there was, there was all of that but that was--and, and that was--but that wasn't directly related to the gang thing, it was just a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That's a difference rather, I assume from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a gang, probably.
Speaker 2: And, and there was also a bit of a rivalry between the West Side and the South Side.  I mean we were, we were given to understand that we were tougher than folks on the South Side (laugher), and that the South Side had a bunch of sissies and, and things like that.  I actually, when I was in high school I guess--yeah, it was high school.  When I was in high school, I used to go to the South Side on weekends quite a bit because there was--when I was a young teen, I guess about sixteen or--fifteen, sixteen, whatever, there was a place called the Times Square, which we also called the Tea Box, on South Wabash [South Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]--I think it was 49th and Wabash, and I used to take the bus there--the El and the bus there many Friday, Saturday nights, as a very young man.  I know I was very young because I was--I had to borrow my brother's ID because they had a curfew for people who were under sixteen, you know, to actually be out on the street sometimes.
Story_ID: 39722
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so at Lane [Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois]--now this is your--this is your first experience--is this your first experience around, you know, significant numbers of white people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean there were a handful of whites in the neighborhood; for the most part, there was some story as to why they were there but no, there weren't any significant numbers; there were not whites at that part of the west side of Chicago [Illinois] at that time.  I think there was one white kid in my class when I was in elementary school.  I know there was one white girl in kindergarten who clearly came from some kind of family that sent her to school with dirty clothes every day, and things like that but no I had not--so, so my--I guess my first sort of social encounters with large numbers of whites came before I went to school.  They came through two things; one was the summer camp experience that I mentioned earlier, which was mostly white, and the other was the church.  I mean I had--I was, as I said, very active as a kid in the Methodist church, and at some point, we got a sister church up in northern Illinois, I think it was in Naperville [Illinois].  And part of the idea of getting this sister church, I think, was sort of to integrate, in some vague way, the churches.  And so I remember there was a couple weekends where kids from the Methodist church in Naperville came to our neighborhood and, and, and they actually--nobody took 'em to their homes; I guess for the most part, we didn't have the kinda homes you could take 'em to, but they all brought in sleeping bags and whatnot and they stayed in the church, and we did activities, you know, for them--with them for several days.  And then, we got invited up to Naperville and we actually stayed in their homes in, in, in Naperville.  And that was my first experience actually of seeing what life was like in a, in a upper middle-class white suburb, and I remember, you know, thinking about the most luxurious place I could imagine, you know, a big house with a big lawn and then, then, lots of space, and a fancy kitchen, a nice big bedroom--stuff like that.  So that was, that was my sort of, sort of--and also there were some activities in the Boys' Club [Union League Boys Club, Chicago, Illinois] that exposed me to, to white groups that we would get out of the neighborhood.  But yeah, it was my first time when I went to Lane which was when I was, I guess thirteen, when I started there.  It was the first time that I was exposed daily, you know, to whites, and the first time that I had white buddies and school mates, and certainly the first time that I was competing with whites in a sort of regular way.
Story_ID: 39723
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--you start in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: I started in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-Four [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1964.  And this is the year of the Democratic National Convention that summer, I guess was the year over there-[President] Lyndon Johnson finally got a nom--he had been the president already, but got the nomination in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --came down and (unclear) on TV.  I don't know if you saw all that, but all this is jumping off.  So in '64 [1964], what courses did you gravitate towards?  What did you like the most?
Speaker 2: Well I actually liked--there were two courses.  I mean I, I loved math, and Lane [Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois] was a technical school and so they were trying to prepare people for sort of technical careers, and so we all took the architectural drafting, and I really like architectural drafting; those were the two subjects that I--but particularly math.  I mean I, I, I just--the, the, the whole--discovering mathematical proofs, working through mathematical problems was something that I had a real affection for and a talent for.  I mean I remember there was this Austrian woman--I can't remember her name right now, but she was a teacher there, who decided I was some kind of math prodigy, and so she would give me extra assignments to do in math--different number systems, different this, that, and the other just because she thought I should be learning math.  And she actually, bless her heart, tried to get me into honors math classes.  And honors classes at Lane were predicated on your grades, not, not on your test scores or anything.  And I was the kinda student in high school who, if I liked the course, I would do well in it; if I didn't like it, I'd pretty much blow it off.  So my grades were decent but they were not all--they were not straight A's or E's I guess is what they were giving at Lane at the time, so they wouldn't put me in honors math so she decided she was gonna personally tutor me instead, so--
Speaker 1: Did you consider a career in science and math?
Speaker 2: That's what I thought I was gonna be.  I originally thought I was--I mean, I remember having lots of discussions, and this teacher at one point was trying to tell me I should become a mathematician, and I couldn't get my head around what a mathematician did other than teach, and so I'm resisting the idea of being a mathematician and I'm thinking, 'Well, I'm not--quite understand what you do as a professional mathematician,' you know.  So we agreed that I would probably start college as a physics major, so my, so my original idea was to become a physicist-
Story_ID: 39724
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --and I actually hated English classes.
Speaker 1: So were you having the same problem, that they weren't challenging?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I mean--and I actually--by, by this time, I was, I was in sort of full rebellion against unchallenging classes.  And the thing about Lane, I mean it's, it, it never--I mean even though it was supposedly a competitive school and whatever, I never thought it was a difficult school and I never had any, any academic issues, you know, with anything at Lane, but what I did have were issues with what I considered boring assignments, and I don't remember what happened my freshman year but I do remember for my sophomore, my junior and my senior year, having battles with English teachers.  I remember--there was a guy named Mr. Shapiro who was my English teacher my sophomore year, and he called me up at one point and basically said, "Ellis, why are you not doing the assignments in class?"  And I said, "Because they're boring."  I said, "These assignments aren't challenging, they aren't interesting, they're basically to test whether I read the material.  Well I know I read the material, I don't need to sit here and answer a bunch of rote questions to prove that I did that, so I'm not interested in doing this stuff."  And (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That was an honest answer I guess (laughter).
Speaker 2: It was as honest as I could be, and he said, "Well look, you clearly can do the work 'cause the work you've done is fine, and I don't wanna flunk you but I'm gone' have to flu you if you don't do your work."  And I basically said, "Well do what you gotta do, but I'm not gonna do this work, it's just not interesting to me."  And he took--I guess took pity of some sort on me and he said, "Look," he said, "tell you what, if you won't do the work I cannot give you a good grade."--Said, "but if you do one more assignment, I can at least pass you.  So will you promise me you'll do one more assignment?"  I said, "Fine, I'll do one more assignment."  So that was my deal with Mr. Shapiro; I did one more assignment and he passed me.
Story_ID: 39725
Speaker 1: Well what did he give you?
Speaker 2: He gave me, I think, an F.
Speaker 1: That's not passing, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, what was fail--failure was a U, so F was barely passing so--I think it was E--it was E, G, F for Fair, and then U for Unsatisfactory, you know.  So, so, so you barely passing.  My junior year, I had a teacher who basically said, "If you miss three assignments, you flunk;" same--exact same set of issues.  So she comes to me and she says, "Ellis, you're not doing the work.  I know you can do the work 'cause clearly demonstrate you can do this so why are you not doing it?"--same discussion.  She says, "Well please try to do the work; please--please try to do the work for me."  I said, "Okay, I'll try to do the work."  And I did some of the assignments, some of them I didn't; I probably missed at least 30, 40 percent of the assignments, and I think she just threw up her hands and she finally said, "Okay, fine," and she gave, she gave me--actually gave me a--gave me a--what's the second grade?  I guess it was a, a G for Good, so she gave me a decent grade. I think she just said, "Screw this; this kid obviously can do it."  My last year, the teacher was interesting because--I mean I guess it was--that was when the Iceberg Slim books had come out, and so I was reading, you know, the--you know the, the former pimp who would, who would become the author, and these books were kinda popular.  So I remember I was in Mrs. Klinger's (ph.) class and, and, and I--and we had some book we would be reading in class, and I had like Iceberg Slim's book inside my other book and I was reading this book, and so (laughter) she called me up at the end of class and she says, "Ellis, what's the problem here?"  And I said, "The problem is very simple."  I said, "I don't find this class interesting or challenging, I don't think these assignments are worth my time, and I'm bored."  And she said, "Well we have a problem here."  I said, "Yeah, well I guess we do."  She said, "Well how are we gonna solve this?"  Which--all of a sudden the light goes off in my head because no teacher had sort of asked me to solve this problem before, and I said, "Well, the purpose of this class, as best as I can understand it, is to assess whether I can handle the English language; whether I can read, whether I can write, whether I can research, whether I can put together coherent arguments.  Isn't that right?"  She said, "Yeah, yeah."  I said, "Well then why can't we do something that evaluates that as opposed to this?"  She said, "Well what are you proposing to do?"  I said, "Why don't you have me write about something I'm interested in?"  And she said, "Well what?"  And this was, you know, '67 [1967], '68 [1968] of course.  And this would have been, I guess, late '67 [1967].  I said, "Well you know, I live in a community that was torn up by riots [The Chicago Riots of 1966] in '66 [1966]," I said, you know, "last year."  I said, "Why don't you have me write about riots and riots in America?"  And she said, "Okay, fine, that's your assignment.  Write about riots."  And so for the first time ever, I became interested in English class, and so interested that I ended up putting together a manuscript of over a hundred pages, a hundred and something pages, about riots in America, riots in, in--the history of 'em, the, the, the draft riots in the 1800s, the anti-black riots in the 1920s--
Speaker 1: The draft riots here in New York [The New York City Draft Riots of 1863]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-- 1863?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And about all this and, and, and about my understanding of the riots in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 39726
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you--I mean did you see the--I mean you were on the West Side in '66 [1966].  Did the riots [The Chicago Riots of 1966] come close to where you were?
Speaker 2: --They came exactly where I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, yeah, there were gunshots being fired from the projects across the way, there--Madison Street became, you know, this mass of broken windows and, and, and whatnot, troops came into the neighborhood, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Well what is your understanding--I'm not asking for the exact understanding of what happened, but what was your understanding (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--There was some police altercation, there was some police altercation and it spun out of control.
Speaker 1: This is in 1966 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--In '66 [1966] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Would this have been in the summer?
Speaker 2: It was the summer; yeah, it was summer of '66 [1966].  Police stopped somebody, did something to somebody, and--yeah, and then that sort of spun out of control and, and, and folks ended up angry at the cops and, and, and it became a several-day riot.  So it started off as a police altercation of some sort.
Speaker 1: One of the results of that was that Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] himself moves to Chicago for a couple of weeks.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, moved out.  And when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--and lived on the West Side.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear) Cicero [Illinois], yeah--and got--he had stuff thrown at him.
Speaker 1: Did you have any memories or personal involvement in any of that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you go to any of the mass meetings or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go to any of that; I mean, I mean I would have been, at that time, 15 years old, and I'm sure my mother would not have heard of me going out to someplace that she considered dangerous like that so no, I wasn't involved in any of that; I mean I just saw it on television.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this was his first action in a northern city.
Speaker 2: Right--was Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right.  Spoke at Soldier Field, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I forget exactly where he moved to in Chicago; I mean it wasn't our community, but he was definitely in Chicago and he marched in Cicero which is western suburbs and I'm not sure where he went--where he actually had his apartment in Chicago.
Speaker 1: It was on the West Side, but I'm not sure exactly where it was.  I know Reverend Sheldon Hall was his host--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --I know that.  We interviewed him, but I'm not sure; I think it's Garfield Park--I think.
Speaker 2: It could have been.  And that's--and that was a fair distance from where, you know, from where I lived.  And we also, I mean we were not all that mobile, in that we didn't own a car, and so getting around the city [Chicago, Illinois] was not the easiest thing, and certainly going to--looking for trouble, which was another way our mother would have construed it (laughter), was not something that she was--that she would have been comfortable with me doing at that age, so I was--but the, but the riot which came to my neighborhood I mean so I had no choice but to be in that environment and, and, and, and in that whole milieu at the time, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And it lasted for about a week? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It lasted several days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--the riot and its aftermath?
Speaker 2: It lasted several days--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't think quite a week, but it did last for several days.
Speaker 1: Was there permanent damage to things that never came back?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there were stores and businesses that didn't come back, and then that was compounded in '68 [1968] where, where I remember walking down Madison Street and--when there was still heat radiating from some of these structures that had just been totally, totally destroyed and--you know, so--yeah, definitely.
Story_ID: 39727
Speaker 1: In 1966, riots were part of the national public discourse; it wasn't just Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --'cause even my little hometown Dayton had a riot.
Speaker 2: No, there were a couple hundred riots across America between '65 [1965] and '66 [1966] and so it was part of the long-hot-summer way of thinking at that point; they were being touched off all over the place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're like looking at all of this, right?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So I'm writing this, this sort of take on--place of riots in American society and, and it became, as I said, a hundred and something-page manuscript.  And I remember turning it in to Mrs. Klinger and her being surprised at just the size of it, and taking it home and--I think she read it over a weekend and so the next day, or whenever the next class was, she came back--she called me up after class and she said, "Ellis," you know, "I'm gonna give you an A." She said, "But the fact is I have no way to judge this material; you need to send this to a professional and have it evaluated."  And I'm going, "A professional?  A professional who?  I don't know any professionals."  And she said, "Well," she said, "have you heard of a woman called Gwendolyn Brooks?"  I said, "Yeah, I've heard of her, she's the Poet Laureate, whatever that is, but why?"  She said, "Well I took a course with her and she teaches at this college--Northeastern College [now Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], in Chicago."  She says, "Why don't you send it to her?"  And I said, "Okay."  And so on her recommendation--I mean I don't think Gwendolyn Brooks knew her from, from a hole in the wall, but she suggested that I send this to Gwendolyn Brooks, so I sent this--so I packed this manuscript, I got her address and sent it off to the college where, where she taught, and didn't hear anything for weeks.  But then one Saturday, the phone rings and I'm figuring well, you know, poet laureates are obviously busy people and she doesn't know me, so she doesn't have any real reason to respond to this thing, so I figure it's just that.  But she calls, and she says, "Young man, you need to come down and talk to me."  And I said, "Oh, okay.  Where?"  So she told me how to get--well she tells me where the college is, so I take two buses to get to this college on the farther north side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she's at the main campus of Northeastern?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: On St. Louis [St. Louis Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], I guess.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, I don't even remember exactly where it is, but I remember it was two bus rides (laughter) and it was a long trip.  And I get there and she's--and there's nobody in her office so I wait outside and, and, and there's this sort of slim woman who was sort of also sitting outside the office, and I finally realize this must be Gwendolyn Brooks.  So I walk over to her and I said, "Are you Gwendolyn Brooks?"  She says, "Oh yes.  You must be Ellis," so she showed me into her office and she sits across from me and she has the manuscript in a big folder in front of her and she pushes it across to me and she--and, and she says--and so I turn it over and look at it and she's written across it in both red and blue ink, "One day you will be a great writer."  And so, you know, I'm going, "Wow."  So she basically lectures me for the next half an hour on--the essence of which was, "I have no idea what you plan to do with your life, but you have a talent for writing and you oughta be writing, and that's what you were put on this earth to do."  And before that, I had never thought about writing and certainly not making a career of writing, and--but all of a sudden I have the word from the Poet Laureate that I'm a writer; I'm going, "Oh, wow--okay."  And then she invites me to join her writers' group, which met on the South Side of Chicago, I guess--once a week, I believe.
Story_ID: 39728
Speaker 1: So is this the Obossey (ph.) Writers Group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I'm--well, I guess that's what it was called.
Speaker 1: It was over at the South Side Community Arts Center?
Speaker 2: Well, that's Mentor (ph.) Home.
Speaker 1: Okay, well it may not have been Obossey (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I'm not sure.  But it was overlap with it; I mean because, you know, Don Lee was there--I think he was still Don Lee at the time, or maybe he was Hot Key at the time, but I'm pretty sure he was Don Lee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--May have been Don Lee then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was Don Lee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He was there, Carolyn Rogers was there, Dudley Randall from Broadside Press would come by from time-to-time; there were just a parade of people, many of whom I knew, many of whom I did not.  And so all of a sudden, I'm involved in this community of folks who see themselves as writers, and so I'm beginning to see myself as a writer too.  And--but the other, the other problem with my being part of her writers' group was that I was, I guess, sixteen at the time--maybe seventeen, but I think I was 16 at the time.  And all these people were to my eyes basically old people because they were people, you know, thirty (laughter), thirty-something, whatnot, and twice as old as I was.  And at the end of the day, I just was thinking, "I don't have much in common with all these adults who are meeting here."  So I dropped out of her group, but I did stay in touch with her, and with a couple of the people, you know, who were there.  And--I was trying to think of the sequence of things that, that happened 'cause also, at that time, I ended up writing--I got so charged up with this whole idea of becoming a writer that I ended up producing, in fairly quick succession, two manuscripts; one was a novel, and the other was a sort of series of essays.
Speaker 1: Now--this is a novel.  How old are you?
Speaker 2: I was seventeen, I think, at the time.
Story_ID: 39729
Speaker 1: Now just to--I should have asked this a minute ago, but what conclusions did you come to in the hundred-page essay about the riots?  What finding or what--
Speaker 2: You know, that's a good question there (laughter), you know.  And at some point, and I have no idea where that manuscript is now, I mean I think it might be in some things in my sister's storage; I have no idea where it is.  But I don't remember what conclusions I came to; I mean I, I, I do remember sort of making the argument that riots weren't invented by black people and that they had long been part of the American landscape, you know, and that there were these periods when they happened.
Speaker 1: That had to be like a revelation 'cause I know I didn't find that out until I was in college.
Speaker 2: It was--the, the--because of the time, there was this, you know, there are these wild black people who riot, and that was the, the, the, the general perception and what I realized was no, that's not really American history, you know.  For most of American history it's been white folks who were rioting if you're talking about race riots.  And they killed a lotta black folks in these riots, and destroyed entire black communities.  So, so I wrote about that, but in terms of there being clear conclusions that I came to, I just don't remember it clearly enough.
Speaker 1: Now did you have like--I don't know if they were proper, but did you have like footnotes and, you know, references and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I don't believe I did, but I--
Speaker 1: --Bibliography or something?
Speaker 2: I don't believe so; I mean I, I was not interested in sort of being an academic.  I'm sure that I, that I referred to the various things I had read and various research things, but I wasn't trying to write a thesis or a term paper so I'm pretty sure I didn't have footnotes and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered what the teacher was doing and how she--what kind of guidance she may have offered (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, but there was--she didn't offer any guidance at all.
Speaker 1: She just wanted you just to write what you felt? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I mean she, she didn't--I mean I remember her telling me to do this and then just letting me go and I didn't give it to her without working on it, we didn't discuss it while I was working on it.  Between her telling me that I could do it and me doing it, there was, as far as I recall, no real discussion not at all until I came up with this big manuscript and gave it to her.  And then after that, she basically said, you know, "I'm not capable of judging this; this is like a whole 'nother caliber thing that I can't deal with, so you go talk to somebody who deals with real writing."  So--I mean I, I certainly credit her with recognizing that I had some kind of ability, but she didn't really so much shape it as nurture it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Somewhere along the way, you came up with the idea that you had to do some research--
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: --to really discuss the issue--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --even though you experienced, you know, the riots yourself.
Speaker 2: Oh, of course, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--But you--you know.
Speaker 2: No, I mean I knew you had to do, you know, some kind of historical research and whatnot, and I, and I spent time in the library, you know, reading and got books and whatnot, but to say that I actually had what would be, you know, a term paper-type product, I'm pretty sure it wasn't; I mean I think it was just basically an extended essay, you know, based on my impressions and my, and my readings.  And then all of a sudden I get catapulted into this group of real writers, but for the most part they were novelists and poets-type writers.  And I got kind of adopted for a while by a guy named Ron Fair-
Story_ID: 39730
Speaker 1: Right, Ronald Fair, right.
Speaker 2: --who did a book called Hog Butcher, which became a movie, I guess, called "Cornbread, Earl and Me," and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So that's the movie that came out of Hog Butcher; I did not realize that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well the book was called Hog Butcher, but the movie was "Cornbread, Earl and Me."
Speaker 1: Which starred--this is Laurence Fishburne's first movie role--
Speaker 2: Is it?
Speaker 1: --as a kid--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --who testifies in court.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's an 11 year-old kid in the movie.
Speaker 2: And Ron's day job was a court reporter, you know, and Ron decided that he, yeah, he took a liking to me and he sort of became a big brother, or father figure, whatever you wanna call it.  And, and, and I remember when I was writing my first manuscript, I got a lotta feedback from him and he would, you know, we would go out to lunches and we would go on walks and he would share his philosophies about me--with me rather, many of which had to do with how he hated America and how he hated, you know, white folks in America (laughter).  And at some point in all of that, he got a European girlfriend, you know (laughter).  But it was certainly a very interesting tutelage and, and he introduced me to this whole idea of, of writers being special people and that we were called to speak certain types of truths and whatnot.  He ended up leaving the country, not surprisingly I guess.
Speaker 1: Did he still write?  The only thing I know about his Hog Butcher, but--
Speaker 2: He still wrote, but his career took a down turn once he--well I guess once that era passed, and also once he left the states.  And I remember--because--and then we sort of, kind of lost touch with one another after he moved; I mean he would write from time to time.  And my first trip to Europe, and we're really jumping ahead now, but that was after I graduated from college, so it was a few years after this.  I went to visit him and he was then living in Stuttgart, Germany.  I mean he had originally moved to--I think he had originally moved--was it Iceland?  He had moved to somewhere (laughter) in, in, in, in Scandinavia; I think it might have been Iceland that he moved to originally, and--I mean he was a really sort of interesting guy, and I think he was living with two women, you know, in some deal in Europe somewhere.  So he moved there originally, and then he moved to Germany and so he wrote me and said, "I'm in Stuttgart, and if you ever make it to Europe, come visit me here."  So the year I graduated, which was 1972, I guess, I took my first trip to Europe and, you know, the typical trip was just to get the Eurail Pass, travel all around and whatnot, but I, but I made it a point to stop in Stuttgart.  And at that point, his fortunes had sort of turned and he was living, he was living in a--well, commune I guess; he was living in a commune with a bunch of Germans, including one black German, a black woman who I assumed was the child of a serviceman or something but who didn't speak English, so I really couldn't communicate with her.  But he was--and I remember he was working on some huge, huge magnum opus--some huge, huge book; but he could not get an American publisher--he could not get any publisher interested in it, and so he was getting very discouraged about writing at that point and, and, and then he ultimately moved more into poetry and it was sort of published by his friends in Europe.  And then ultimately he just became very religious and, and became this, this religious proselytizer so, as far as I know, pretty much, you know, stopped writing at that point.
Story_ID: 39731
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: But I also met, who came through Chicago [Illinois] I guess around that same time, Sam Greenlee, you know, the guy who wrote Spook Who Sat By the Door.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--This was about the same--I mean '72 [1972] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That would have been--well it would have been in the late '60s [1960s] I guess.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, as part of the Gwendolyn Brooks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--As part of the Gwendolyn Brooks thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Sam Greenlee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Sam Greenlee came through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Author of The Spook Who Sat By the Door.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I don't know whether he knew--I don't know whether he was from Chicago [Illinois] or what his connection was, but I remember him coming through.  And I remember being--and he had just come back from Europe and, and, and actually I think Ron [Ronald Fair] and I met him before he came to the group because Ron knew him and so we went out to meet him.  And I remember being impressed with him because he was the most different looking guy that I had ever seen; I mean he was carrying like some purse or something (laughter), and he had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right.  He was still doing that in '77 [1977]--the Euro look (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--He had a Euro look, and I had never seen that, certainly not on a black guy before.  And I said, "Okay, this is an interesting guy."  So I met him; but that was part of that whole milieu at the time and--but I actually got a publishing deal with--there was a small press that had been started by some black folks in Chicago.  Was it called--and I don't even remember the name of it now, but it was a small press that had been started by a group of folks, and they accepted my novel for publication.  I think Gwendolyn Brooks knew some of these people and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--This is the one you wrote at age seventeen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, seventeen, eighteen.
Story_ID: 39732
Speaker 1: Now what was this novel about?  What was the name of it and what was it about?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the name of it but it never got published, but it was a coming of age novel about a young man, not unlike myself, coming up in some poor neighborhood in Chicago [Illinois], you know, who goes on to have various kinds of adventures; so it was very much a coming of age novel.  I don't even remember the specific plot, you know, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Did all the stories, I mean the different stories in there, were they drawn from things that really happened to you, or did you--
Speaker 2: No, no, they were fiction and they were whatever my idea at eighteen of what would make an interesting read, and I'm sure it was very dramatic and the character was, I'm sure, involved in much more dangerous stuff on the streets than I was involved in and what have you.  And because I was under-age, my mom [Jetta Mae Cose] had to sign the contracts and--was it Broad Press or Broadside Press?
Speaker 1: Broadside, that's Dudley Randall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's Dudley Randall so it wasn't Broadside it was, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Third World started up in '67 [1967] but it wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, it wasn't that, it was another name and I'm, and I'm just blanking on the name of the press but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Something called Lotus Press (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It wasn't Lotus.  If you said it, I would remember it but it wasn't Lotus Press.  I don't remember what it was but anyway, they had me sign a contract--no advance, and they were just some black folks who were interested in literature and didn't really have any money but they had this idea of publishing stuff from time to time.  And, you know, years went by and the book just never came out and they never put together the money to do it, but I do remember being very excited at getting a book contract and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That was the time I think they formed combined black publishers in the U.S.--Hockey (ph.), Drummond Spear Press--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a lot of the--some groups here in New York that formed with Broadside; they had like forty two black publishers at one time.
Speaker 2: There were a lot of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--They formed this, but they were--but within ten years it was pretty much--
Speaker 2: Well, most of 'em weren't making any money.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 39733
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So that was, that was just that.  But that whole year [1967-1968] was transformational for me because that was the year that I basically decided I'm not interested in being a scientist anymore, I'm interested in being a writer.  And so by the time that I had entered college, I did not apply as a physics major, I mean I, I--actually I didn't apply as a literature major either; I got it in my head, I think because I hated English classes so much, I decided I was gonna major in psychology because I thought that as a writer, I oughta understand something about people; that was my reason at least.
Story_ID: 39734
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Other than--and other than Mrs. Klinger, were there any other teachers, like mentors (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well there was, there was the math teacher who I--but I can't remember her name right now.
Speaker 1: That's the Austrian (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But no, those two were the ones.  And then I was a wrestler at Lane for at least a year, and then had to quit the team to--well I didn't have to quit the team, but I needed money so I, so I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So did you work in school?
Speaker 2: I worked--yeah; I worked in one way or another, starting at, I guess thirteen, in a little store.  But I would always find little jobs, so by the time that I had--I was at school, yeah, I was working--I guess my last year, I was working at a metal shop and ultimately ended up getting fired from that job because--they liked me, but I was too young to operate machinery, yeah.  So I sorta talked my way into that job and, and, and eventually they said, "Well, you know, we like you kid, but you cannot work machines; you don't really belong here."  And then after that, worked in the library for a while as, you know, filing--they called it the Page (unclear), filing books and whatnot.  So yeah, I always worked.  And then--but then subsequent to that, ended up working in a couple of banks and, and then worked at Litten's (ph.) Department Store for a while selling men's clothes, which I actually was good at--I was very good at selling men's clothes.
Story_ID: 39735
Speaker 1: Now, you already mentioned going to the Ice Capades as a big--first big date, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean that was--I'm not even sure I would actually call it a date; I mean I was thirteen or fourteen.  There was this young lady, name was Carol Banks, who I had had a crush on for years at the church, and so we got these two tickets to go to the Ice Capades, so I decided to invite her and I--and she actually lived within walking distance of, of the, of the stadium [Chicago Stadium].  But I remember having set aside enough money to take a taxi if we decided we were gonna take a taxi, you know, to the Ice Capades 'cause that was going to be my way of impressing her, but I think we ended up walking anyway.  And--but as I said, aside from the fact that we went together (laughter) and I took her back home, you know, after it was over--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did Lane have a prom or anything, or did you go that or--
Speaker 2: It did have a prom.  I didn't go to the prom there; part of it is at the time, I didn't have a girlfriend, and Carol, who had--I'm sorry I said Carol Banks; it was another--I should have said Betty Johnson (unclear).  But Betty, who had been sort of a kind of a girlfriend, at that point was a year ahead of me in school so she had left the state [Illinois] to go to, to go to college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I suddenly lost interest in church so I stopped going to church once she left the state because (laughter)--and at the time didn't have a girlfriend so--and also there was a social thing at Lane where, you know, Lane was, you know, ninety-odd percent white and, and, you know, they--Lane did have dances and whatnot from time to time, but I think like most of the black students there, I didn't go to 'em because I figured there were gonna be all white girls and didn't wanna deal with that whole issue of race and what that meant, you know, at the time.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You still had your band, too and you were playing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well I had the band, I had team activities, but there was a conscious decision at some point not to go to like the mixers and the dances that they did just because socially I thought it would kind of awkward, so the whole--I mean going back to, you know, '67 [1967], '66 [1966], you know, those years--the idea of walking across the floor and asking a white girl to dance (laughter) was not, was not an appealing thought, so-
Story_ID: 39736
Speaker 1: So in terms of college, how did you choose a college?
Speaker 2: I didn't so much choose a college as--the college was just there; I mean I--you know, in retrospect, I should have chosen a college but I decided--because I had the grades and, and the scores to probably get into any number of good schools but at the time, there was a scholarship that was available for--there were state colleges if you had scored a certain--if you scored a certain level on the ACT [American College Testing], and I don't remember my score, but it was high, you know.  And it was high enough to get the scholarship; so going to a state school I would get a free ride and, not that state school was all that expensive at the time, you know.  And so I applied to the University of Illinois; it was the only school that I applied to, and--the one in Chicago [Illinois], not the one--the Chicago campus.
Speaker 1: Chicago campus, okay--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which they call Circle Campus.
Speaker 2: Circle at the time, exactly.
Story_ID: 39737
Speaker 1: I think I may be going too fast here 'cause I don't wanna leave anything out, but this is a period of time--1968 when you graduate, and by that time people are starting to refer to our people as black people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --instead of Negroes, and this is when the transition is happening.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories from that period of time?
Speaker 2: Well by that time, I was very much aware of, of what was going on, you know, and of course King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had died, you know, the same year that I graduated.
Speaker 1: That would have been in April, just before--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --graduation.
Speaker 2: --just before graduation, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And there were the subsequent riots.
Speaker 2: There were riots, tanks--or at least troops came through the neighborhood and it was, you know, a very tense several, several days, you know, in the--on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--This is when most of Madison Street [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--was pretty much destroyed; that was when Madison Street was pretty much destroyed, you know, at that point, so I have very strong memories of that, of that era.  And at the time--'cause I was also getting involved with, with writing and, and, and ideas and whatnot. So I had a sort of a growing consciousness of this, you know, black movement.  The Black Panthers are coming to Chicago at the time; I was aware of them and I was sort of following, following them in a way.  The Black Muslims were very active in Chicago at the time, so there was that whole current of thought.  So that was all part of the--I guess the backdrop of which was unfolding during that transition from high school to college.
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the arts, that was the year that the Afro Arts Theater operated.  Is that about right?  '68 [1968], '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure whether that was that early; they may have been, I just don't remember them operating then.
Speaker 1: This would have been some of the white brothers involved in that and other--you know.
Speaker 2: But I, but I--and I certainly wasn't involved in it, but I don't remember if it was that period or not when they--I think they might have come a little bit later, but I'm just not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is a big transition period.  Now during the riot--I mean once again, that was close by where you lived, right?
Speaker 2: Well, this was my neighborhood; it was where I lived, it was my neighborhood, yeah.  I mean there was a curfew imposed right away, and so I wasn't on the streets during the actual rioting but was certainly out there immediately after that, and was, and was in the neighborhood after that.
Story_ID: 39738
Speaker 1: Now this is--what you're telling us too, says something about your upbringing.  You mentioned several times you all were kind of taught to stay away from trouble.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  My mother [Jetta Mae Cose] was acutely aware that we were in a kinda dicey neighborhood and she was sort of protective, I mean in, in, in, in different ways; I mean the--it's sort of a mildly funny story from I guess childhood when I was--I couldn't have been any more than maybe eleven.  I had gone to the library one day and it was this bitter cold day in Chicago [Illinois], very cold Chicago day, and on the way home I got cold so I decided--I saw this nice warm place and went inside this little what I thought was a store or something, I didn't quite know what it was, but I went into this place and a cousin of mine, older cousin of mine, happened to walk by and see me sitting in the window; well it was a bar (laughter), and I was sitting in this bar and my cousin who was, I would say was maybe ten years older than me, pulls me out and starts basically, you know, "Ellis, you don't go in"--and I thought she was saying 'cabin.'  "You don't go into a cab--"  she was saying 'tavern.'  "You don't go into a tavern."  I'm going, "Why was she upset with me going into a cabin?  What's the big issue here?"  And then when I got home, my mother repeated that.  But she saw--I mean even when I went to join the Boys' Club [Union League Boys Club, Chicago, Illinois], which was probably the best place to be, actually; her concern was there were lots of tough thugs who hung out there, and that I shouldn't join the Boys' Club.  And I remember us actually getting into a, kind of a fight about it and I said, "I'm gonna join the Boys' Club; I wanna hang out with these guys."  And she said, "Well I'm not gonna sign for you to join."  I said, "Okay, fine."  So I forged her signature and joined anyway, and she subsequently accepted that this was a good place to be but--so, so, so, so she was very aware that--and also, I mean she just, knowing from my going out shopping 'cause she would send me to get milk or other things at the store sometimes, and I would run across guys who, you know, wanted to take my money--sometimes did, or get into altercations with folks, you know, who would accost you on the street, you know, so she did have a sense and even, and even later on when I was older--first year in college and whatnot, I mean I got involved with the young folks who were, in one way or another, connected with the Black Panther Party or whatnot and, and, and she got really nervous about that and it's like, "You associate with these people who are dangerous; you shouldn't be doing that."  So yeah, she was very much concerned about that.
Story_ID: 39739
Speaker 1: Okay.  University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago Circle Campus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Chicago Circle Campus they called it at the time.
Speaker 1: What was that like?  That's also on the West Side.
Speaker 2: It's on the west side but a different part of the West Side.  I mean it's in, I guess, what was called Little Italy at the time, you know, and so it was not really the neighborhood.  It was totally different; I mean it was totally different because college is totally different than high school and she had been--actually, my mother [Jetta Mae Cose] had not supported my going to, to the University of Illinois because my older brother Robert [Robert Cose] had flunked out, not because he couldn't do the work, he was very smart; but he got distracted and I think he went--they had a bowling lane on the campus and he decided to spend his time bowling and, and other things, so he ended up flunking out of the school and so she thought that, you know, this was not just a good place to go because, you know, you might end up failing there, and I got sort of offended by that and I said, "Well, obviously I'm capable of doing the work," so I went there.  But it was, it was I guess like anybody's transition from high school to college; all of a sudden you're in a much bigger place, you're--you have a lot more freedom.  And at that point, I was so involved in, in my writing and my work in other projects that--and then I guess I got involved also in the Black Students Association things; I got involved with that, and so that was a big part of my activities then.
Story_ID: 39740
Speaker 1: Okay.  I hope I didn't skip over this; now you--Democratic National Convention [1968 Democratic National Convention] that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--was '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-Eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the summer before you go to college, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the--what month was that?  It was, it, it, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--August.
Speaker 2: It was, it would have been just before I started college, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, okay.  And did that have any--I mean how did that affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean it was big in the news and I was reading the news at that time, and the word in the community was that we should stay away from that because the white folks were gonna act crazy because that was this convention where the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] and all these other people were targeting for major protests, and word sort of went out that it was just not a place, you know, to be.  So for myself and a lot of young black men, the community was just like, you know, "Don't go anywhere near that convention because it's gonna be a bunch of crazy white folks there."

Speaker 1: So as a freshman, you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--As a freshman, I was a psychology major.  There is a guy named Theophilus Green, and he and I started a publication--I don't even remember what we called it, but we started a sort of black-oriented publication that was distributed inside the student newspaper and, and, and we did essays and different kinds of provocative stuff, at least we thought it was provocative, you know, about issues--about black issues, so Theophilus Green and I sort of had started that.
Speaker 1: So he's a student, right?
Speaker 2: He was a student.
Speaker 1: A fellow student.  Was he an upper-classman or the same age?
Speaker 2: He might have been a year or two older, but I--I think he may have been a year older, maybe a couple years older, but--yeah.  And he had some connection with the student newspaper that allowed him to do this, and we somehow came across each other and I think it was his idea to start this publication, and so we published that for a while.
Speaker 1: Can you remember what some of the issues were?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't; I can just guess, going back, to what some of the issues were because--I mean that was also going back '68 [1968].  I'm sure it just had a lot to do with racial issues on campus; I mean we had decided that we wanted black studies programs, we wanted all these kinds of things that all the black students were deciding they wanted on college campuses in those years, so we decided we were gonna agitate for things like that, and there was just general commentary about the state of race in, in, in the country.
Story_ID: 39742
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you like the University of Illinois?
Speaker 2: It was fun, yeah; I mean I was having a great time, I was working.  I guess at that time, I was working at Litten's Department Store as a salesperson so I was very busy.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So were you taking many psychology courses in the beginning?--just intro and that sorta thing?
Speaker 2: There were about--I was taking entry psychology courses but of more just the general mix of courses; I mean I was taking--they called it rhetoric, but basically English and biology and, you know, things of that nature.  But I remember the course that stood out was the rhetoric course, basically the English course.  And I had a woman--a teacher, I think her name was Mrs. Theme (ph.), a good name for an English teacher--I think Mrs. Theme--and I remember we used to have these discussions, these long discussions about politics, and looking back, I think maybe she had some kinda crush on me because she spent, you know, more time with me than a teacher is supposed to; nothing that was ever acted on, but sort of looking--thinking back to the dynamics of that--but I remember us getting into this big debate about the--Jesus, who was the Minister of Defense for the Black Panther Party?  Eldridge Cleaver--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Soul On Ice [Soul On Ice by Eldridge Cleaver].  'Cause Soul On Ice had come out sometime around then--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and she was a big fan of Soul On Ice; she thought it was really this wonderful book.  So I went back--so I went to read it and, and she said, "What do you think of it?"  And I said, "That guy's crazy."  (Laughter)  And she said, "Well why are you saying that?"  I said, "Well this is a guy who's writing that he's practicing raping white women so then he can go rape black women?"  I said, "This is nuts."  So I remember that was one of the (laughter)--that was one of the discussions.  But she was very taken by this whole black radical stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought that was amazing too that, you know, people would--well at any rate that's--
Speaker 2: But it was part of the time, it was part of the time that the--you know, the sort of, you know, the Avant-Garde, as they consider themselves politics, yeah.  Folks were very interested in that.  So that whole--my--so, so I was very much involved in a lot of things, you know.  My--and, and also I became visibly involved I guess with the Black Students Organization; I had some kinda title, I don't remember, but I had some kinda leadership position.  I don't even remember whether we had official titles but I was one of the leaders of the black student thing on campus.
Story_ID: 39743
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now this is--now did you know Fred Hampton?
Speaker 2: I did not know him but when he was killed, we had a big thing on campus, and I was one of the leaders for that, and we took over several other classes to have sort of a teach-in at the university, you know, around his death.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now Fred Hampton, just for those who are watching this and don't know, he was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--He was the then leader of the Black Panther Party and, and, and he and Mark Clark were basically assassinated by the police and the state's attorney's folks in those--you know, back there in December of what--'69 [1969], I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  He and Mark Clark were killed and several people were wounded.
Speaker 2: Got killed and several people wounded (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now was that--was their place near where you lived?
Speaker 2: Their place was within walking distance of where I lived; they weren't in the exact same community but they were, but they were, they were nearby.  And I got to know--I didn't know any of the leadership, but at some point I got to know Bobby Rush.  But I--but at the time, I didn't really know the leadership of the Panthers; I knew some of the members, and actually dated a young woman at one point, who was a, you know, was one of the--a member of the Black Panthers, but I was not close to the leadership at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  I know that really was a big incident in the fall of '69 [1969], your sophomore year.
Speaker 2: Well that was a huge incident, as I said, and on campus--we basically shut down the campus for a day, with protests and teachings about that event.  And that was also around the same time--you were asking about the Sun Times[ Chicago Sun-Times]--that was around the same time that I got connected with the Sun Times.
Speaker 1: Now tell us how that happened.  Now here's--the Chicago media--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --is trying to make sense out of what happened to Fred Hampton or not, depending on whose--you know, what station you were watching, and there's a lot of debate about what really happened and what did happen--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I think there's dramatic presentation of that door that one of the stations did some report on about the door that showed the--
Speaker 2: The bullet holes.
Speaker 1: --yeah, the bullet holes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 39744
Speaker 1: And so what motived you to go to the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times] to--were the Sun Times on the side of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It wasn't--it didn't really stem directly out of, out of the, out of the Hampton-Clark assassination, no; it stemmed out of my general sense of where I wanted to go as a, as a writer.  At this point, I mean I had written at least--I'd written, I think, two novels--both unpublished, a book of essays, I had gotten great rejection letters from publishers all over the country; some of them actually were amazingly good letters, but they were rejection letters.  One--I remember getting a letter from Alice Mayhew at Simon and Schuster; she's still there actually.  I remember getting a letter from Alice Mayhew at Simon and Schuster recommending agents to me, and basically saying, "You're not quite ready yet, but you need to have an agent and you need to have an editor, and these are some people who you should be talking to."  So, so I was very much--and I was feeling frustrated as a writer at that point, because I had written all this stuff, and even though I was publishing stuff at school and involved in that, I wasn't getting any--I wasn't getting--able to publish any of this.  And so I decided--and I certainly wasn't making any money from it; I was working at the clothing store.  And I remember saying to myself--I had this conversation with myself saying, "Ellis, you need to figure out where to get paid for your writing because this is a way to spend a whole lotta time and be poor."  And it occurred to me that, well journalists must get paid; people who write for newspapers clearly get paid for their writing, so I oughta write for a newspaper.  And so I sat down one Saturday and wrote some sample columns, took the stuff that I had been publishing in the school publication as well, and put a package together, and the package that I put together I sent to the managing editor of the Chicago Sun-Times.  There were four papers in Chicago at that time and there were two morning papers, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune.  The Chicago Tribune was a very conservative paper at the time, and I figured that they probably wouldn't be interested in me so I figured well maybe the Chicago Sun-Times would.
Story_ID: 39745
Speaker 1: So I got the managing editor's name from the masthead and sent it to the address 401 North Wabash--sent it to their address, and then waited for him to call.  And, of course, got no call, so after several weeks of waiting for the call, I decided to call him and so I, you know, got through to him actually, and I said, "Well this is Ellis Cose and I sent you some materials."  He said, "Yes, I recall,"  I said, "well did you have a chance to read 'em?"  He said, "Yeah, I did read 'em."  I said, "Well, what do you think?"  He said, "Well, they're pretty good."  I said, "Well, great.  So when do I start work?"  (Laughter).  And he said, "Well look, young man, you need to come down and talk to me."  And I said, "Fine."  So we made a date for me to go down and talk to him, and when I met him, he was a very nice older man who actually became an important mentor of mine.  But he, but he, what he says to me, he says, "Look, we don't hire"--I think I was eighteen at the time.  He said, "We don't hire eighteen year-old guys to be"--'cause I was telling him I wanted to be a columnist.  "We don't hire eighteen year-old guys as columnists for the Chicago Sun-Times, we just don't do that."  He said, "but you are obviously talented and you're bright, so I'll tell you what we're gonna do."  He said, "I'm gonna give you a job," he said, "but I'm gonna make you an editorial assistant and"--he said, "which is not a bad job for a guy your age."  He said, "You know, the editorial assistant is higher than the copy boys, and you will answer the phones and you will do some writing.  You put together little weather reports and other things for the newspaper; you will learn how a newspaper operates," he says.  "So we'll do that for you."  He said, "And in addition, you know we publish something that goes to schools as part of our reading the schools programs, and it's called Viewpoint for Schools.  We'll give you a column in that, and we'll pay you--in addition to what we're paying you to be an editorial assistant, we'll pay you $50.00 a week to write a weekly column for this thing that goes into schools, and we'll put your picture in it." And it has, I think it was, I don't know, 30,000 circulation or whatever.  He said, "We'll put your picture in it and you can write up whatever you want to, and we're gonna team you up with a white guy whose column that we're running."  And I don't know the white guy's name but he was a young white guy who was writing a column syndicated out of some other city.  He said, "And we're gonna make it On Being Young, and yours is gonna be On Being Young And Black and his is gonna be On Being Young And White."  He said, "How does that sound?"  I said, "It sounds fine to me."  And so I quit my job as a men's clothing salesperson and went to work for the Sun Times several--it wasn't full-time but it was several nights a week.
Story_ID: 39746
Speaker 1: So this was like--what, this is in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would have been, that would have been late '69 [1969]--
Speaker 1: Early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Early '70 [1970]; it was late '69 [1969], early '70 [1970], that I went to work for the, for the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times].  And I did that for a, for a year and I, and I wrote about--well, what young black guys were thinking, basically, at the time.  Some of it was politics, some of it was just general social stuff.  And at the end of the year, I got called into the editor's office--a guy named James Hoge [James F. Hoge, Jr.] who was, who was quite young to be editor of a major paper; I think he was in his thirties at the time.  And I got called into his office along with Raff (ph.), who was the managing editor, and I figured that they were calling me in because the school year was getting ready to end, and they were gonna suspend publication of this thing for the, for the summer.  So I figured they were calling me in to let me know they were suspending publication and I'd be getting $50.00 less a week because they were suspending publication of this, and they weren't gonna be running the column.  And so, you know, Mr. Hoge--or Jim--turns to me and he says, "Well you know, I've been reading your stuff."  I said, "Well do you like it?"  He said, "Yeah, I think it's actually quite good."  I said, "Well thank you."  And he says, "In fact, I have something to tell you," and I said, "Well what's that?"  He said, "Well, what do you think of writing for the real newspaper?"  I said, "Well, that's what I came here to do, so of course I wanna write for the real newspaper."  He said, "Well, starting Monday, you have a column in the newspaper--once a week."  And I said, "Great, that's what I wanted all the time."  So that's how the Sun Times deal came about.  And so for the next--for that next period, I wrote my column--I had this dual status at the time so I was, I was a columnist and an editorial assistant at the same time.  And after about a year of doing both jobs, I decided that an important columnist shouldn't be an editorial assistant (laughter), and I should be something more important than that.  And the paper was not inclined to make me a reporter and columnist at the time; I was still in college.
Story_ID: 39747
Speaker 1: So there was a paper called the Englewood Bulletin on the southwest side, in the Englewood community; it was run by a guy named Hurley Green--
Speaker 2: Hurley Green, right.
Speaker 1: --and I don't know who suggested or who somehow--somehow, somehow that paper came up, and I decided that what I need to do was find someplace that's gonna let me be something other than an editorial assistant.  So I talked to Hurley Green and somehow convinced him that I should become his managing editor, and so after about a year doing both jobs--I kept my column at the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times], but I let them know, I said, "I'm gonna write the column but I don't wanna be an editorial assistant anymore."  So I left the editorial assistant job and went to work for Hurley as basically the managing editor of the, of the Englewood Bulletin.  And it was--so it was a part-time job because the--it was weekly, and as I recall, I think Wednesday was when the paper went to press.  So I would basically work three days a week; I--well Saturdays--some Saturdays as well, so that makes four.  But I, but I would--and I had a small staff of reporters who worked for me; all of 'em were twice my age (laughter).  But I would make assignments and whatnot on Mondays, and then we would do the editing and whatnot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and then actually do the physical layout of the paper on Wednesday night, you know.  So I became even busier because I was very much involved in, in the, in the paper, and I became much less involved in stuff at school.  I mean I--that had been happening anyway because of my work at the Sun Times, but my other activities sort of took over from school.  And I didn't go to school very much after that.
Story_ID: 39748
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in that era, I mean there weren't--I mean this was a time when they had very few black journalists, period.  I mean I think there were, there were two black reporters, I think, at the, at the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times] when I arrived, and I was the first black columnist that they had hired.  There was maybe two or three at the Chicago Tribune; maybe even fewer than that;  I mean I know Joe Boyce was at the Chicago Tribune, and they subsequently hired Vernon Jarrett as a columnist, but Vernon came after I came; I mean I was a columnist before he was, you know, in Chicago [Illinois].  Lu Palmer had started off as a reporter at the Daily News [The Chicago Daily News] and he subsequently became a columnist at the, at the Daily News.  I don't remember the American having anybody; they might have had someone but I just don't remember them having anybody who was black there.
Speaker 2: And that was the first of those four to go.
Speaker 1: Yes, go down.  So at the time--then, I mean these were papers that had one or two, you know, black journalists if they had any, and we pretty much all knew one another; I mean we came in touch with one another at one point or another there, in subsequent years 'cause I was there for several years.  So through the years, they did hire more but at the time that I was there, I think they just had two black reporters.
Story_ID: 39749
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And I think during this period of time, between '69 [1969] and '70 [1970], that's where Lu Palmer leaves the Daily News [The Chicago Daily News], right?
Speaker 2: Lu Palmer left the Daily News, I think it might have been a year or so after that.  I, I'm--I would have to check, but I believe he left '71 [1971], '72 [1972] is when he left the Daily News.  And I don't remember the specific incident that provoked him to leave, but I do remember that he decided he just didn't wanna work for the white newspaper companies anymore; that they were, you know; they were somehow, in his opinion, screwing with his copy and they weren't letting him write the things that he wanted to write, so--
Speaker 1: Now this is--I don't know if he was the first black reporter to walk off of a job of a major white paper in Chicago [Illinois] but he did it dramatically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--He did it--Lu left in a very dramatic--I mean he was a high profile guy to begin with; he was a columnist, and he left in anger.  But not only did he leave, I mean he decided--and then that's why I think it was later because he decided once he did leave shortly after that--to start his own publication.
Story_ID: 39750
Speaker 1: Okay, now I know you had played a prominent role here so we'll let that, you know, ride for a minute and we'll go back to Englewood Bulletin.  So what--Englewood--just describe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's the southwest side of Chicago [Illinois], and it was a (unclear) poor, predominantly only black community, and this was sort of--the Community Newspaper, I think it was owned by the South Town Economist Company and Hurley [Hurley Green] was the publisher-slash editor of it.  And there were other black papers; I mean there was the--I mean I got to know some of the--and I remember Gus Savage being with the Citizen, you know, and he was around at the time, and there were a few other folks around at the time that I got to know a little bit because of that.  But Hurley was more the outside guy, I mean I was--once he hired me, then he leaned on me pretty heavily to actually run the newspaper and it was, it was, it was interesting because I was a kid.  I mean I was, I don't know, nineteen or twenty, something like that, and I had these grown folks who were reporting to me so it was, it was, it was one, the first time I had any real management responsibilities, and secondly, I was managing adults who I'm sure had some feelings about working for a college kid, but actually I got along fine with everybody.
Story_ID: 39751
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you ever--well I suppose you probably sent like a letter to the Defender at some point, right?  At the same time you were sending the letters to the major dailies, did you send anything to the Defender [The Chicago Defender]?
Speaker 2: No, I did not send a letter to the Defender; I mean I remember specifically wanting to work for a paper that I thought could pay some real money, and that also had a substantial circulation.  So I suspect if I had not heard anything, or not being able to get any response from the Chicago Sun-Times, it probably would have been my second act--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but since I did get such a positive response ultimately from the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times], there was no need to search any further.
Speaker 1: I only ask because the Defender is a daily, you know.  I think it was the only black daily in the country at that time--
Speaker 2: It was a--yeah, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--even though I don't think it was probably paying a whole lotta money, but it was--
Speaker 2: It was, it was certainly the biggest and most important black daily in Chicago [Illinois]; I mean it--by that time, it was no longer in its heyday, I mean there was a time when it was just a huge paper, over a hundred thousand circulation, and was carried--it was almost--it was sort of a national paper once upon a time; it was long past those days.  And I frankly didn't consider it that good of a newspaper; I mean I read it, and was not all that impressed with it, you know, as a newspaper, so it was not something that I aspired to work for.
Story_ID: 39752
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now what about Johnson Publications?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I certainly--I didn't write them because I had the sense that a daily newspaper would be much more immediate and that--much more you could do there; but I was certainly aware of Johnson Publications and Ebony, and the whole Johnson Publishing empire was right on South Michigan Street.  And subsequently, I did do a few things for them; I guess once I began writing for the, for the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times] and got to know some of their editors, and actually became quite close to Lerone Bennett at one point, in Chicago [Illinois], who was another mentor of mine and was their senior--I guess he was senior editor at the time when I was in Chicago, but he was a well-known historian as well.
Story_ID: 39753
Speaker 1: Another sort of historian is Vernon Jarrett.  Now we mentioned him during the break.  What was your relationship with Vernon Jarrett?
Speaker 2: Vernon and I had a very nice relationship; it was funny because he was so much older than me, but I got my column before he did.  So I remember him calling me before he went to work for the Tribune [Chicago Tribune], or maybe around the same time, and saying, "Hey, we just need to talk.  I'm gonna start writing a column for the Tribune; you need to talk about how it is working for these newspapers and what that's all about."  So he reached out to me and we established a relationship and it was always a very, you know--and we didn't consider ourselves competitors in any way, even though we were working for different newspapers; it was just always a nice warm relationship.  And he was such a, you know, a warm guy anyway.  He's always had jokes to tell and he was a--he was just a very interesting, funny guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the tone of your column in the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times]?  Did you have a particular theme that you--or areas you were focused on?
Speaker 2: Well, I did a lot of stuff around the black political scene; I mean what was going on with the black politicians and, and, and black community stuff.  But then a lot of sort of general social issues stuff, and it evolved through the years.  I mean as--because I wrote for them for several years, and you'd mentioned the Political Convention [1968 Democratic National Convention] in '68 [1968] which I did not go to, but I did go to the one in '72 [1972] and that was the one where I--I guess it was my first convention, and then went to the one in '76 [1976], also with the Sun Times.  And so I was evolving into a political correspondent as well, and actually covered the '76 [1976] campaign, you know, for the Sun Times.  So I was--so initially it was very much about black issues, about the--about politics, about Civil Rights Movement, and those kinds of things, and then evolved into more--well even though I still wrote about those things, a lot more general stuff.  So by the time '76 [1976] rolled around, I was writing about [President] Jimmy Carter and, and, and the other candidates, I was writing about the primaries and that whole process.  I remember doing a series of columns at one point; I guess it was shortly after I graduated from college, I did a series of columns about the new South.  I had not really spent much time at all in the South, other than flying in and out for one thing or another, and I took this journey which spanned several weeks; it was by car.  I remember driving--I guess starting in Washington [Washington, D.C.], and then driving across the south.  And so every week I'd be somewhere else, and I would seek out the various people in those cities who were interesting and talk to them about stuff, and it became--I ended up getting syndicated, and so this series of columns was appearing in publications throughout the south and elsewhere, and so it became almost an event when I would come into town because they'd been reading about me writing about other cities and, and, and then showing up in their city to write about what was going on there.  And so that took--yeah, it was several weeks; I don't remember how many weeks but that was my first real exposure to the south in any real sense of the word.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  This is in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: That would have been in the early '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 39754
Speaker 1: Okay, early '70's [1970s].  Now one thing I--the Englewood Bulletin, now how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: Well until I graduated, so--I graduated from college in '72 [1972], and once I graduated from college, I went to the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times] full time; by that time, they were ready to make me a reporter-columnist.  And I started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So when you get--I just wanted to go to college graduation for a second.  When you graduated, you had a degree in psychology, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are there any mentors at U of I [University of Illinois at Chicago] in terms of psychology, and did you feel that was useful after you finished it?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I think it's useful in the sense that virtually everything you read sort of adds to your store of knowledge.  One thing I realized was that psychology was less informed about how humans work and think than I thought psychology was, so I had less to learn from it in that sense; but it was certainly, it was certainly interesting and, and, and I--but also my attitude about college, as you probably are gathering, I mean I did not have a whole lot of patience with school, and for most of my college time, I spent a minimum of time there, and I was always one of these students who was very good at skipping all the lectures and most of the classes, and doing the reading and then getting an A on the paper; I could do that fairly easily.  So I got very good grades in college but there is a--but I was not there for much of it.
Story_ID: 39755
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  Did you know Dr. Bobby Wright?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did know Bobby Wright but I'm trying to--and I'm trying to think of when I got to know him; I'm pretty sure I got to know him after I was, after I was out of college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but he, but he was certainly--he was, you know, a figure in Chicago [Illinois] and a political activist type, and an educator; so I knew him, but I think I came into touch with him more because I was writing for the sun Times and--but I didn't attend his things, his--you know his weekly sessions, whatever he was doing back then.
Speaker 1: Were there any black psychologists that impressed you in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't know that many black psychologists; there weren't any teaching at U of I [University of Illinois at Chicago].  I mean that was around the same time or sometime shortly after that; it was around the same time--actually it was '68 [1968] that Grier and Cobbs came out with Black Rage.  I remember being very impressed with that, you know--which was the product of a couple of black psychiatrists, but at the time--and then a good friend of mine, who I went to school with, subsequently became a psychologist who was black.  Actually, a couple of folks I knew became psychologists.  But at the time, I never encountered a black psychologist in any of the classes that I had, and I don't recall ever actually meeting one until well after I graduated from the university.
Story_ID: 39756
Speaker 1: All right, I'm done with psychology; I just thought I'd ask you about--so you get your degree in '72 [1972] and you're still--you're writing with the Sun Times.  So your role increases at the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times]?
Speaker 2: Well it increased because I re-joined them as a full-time staff person.  For--the two years before that--or year and a-half, two years before that when I'd been working for the Englewood Bulletin, I had been freelancing my column once a week for them.  So once I graduated, they hired me full time and I became a reporter-slash columnist for them.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And my role increased dramatically because I was doing a lot of reporting in addition to writing the column.  And for a while, I mean they had me doing big series, so I--I remember there were snipers in Cabrini Green at one point and--shooting at cops, and they decided--actually the managing editor decided it'd be a good idea to send me into Cabrini Green and live there for a week 'cause I, you know--'cause I obviously knew the projects, I was--and to just do an inside report of what it's like living in Cabrini Green.  So I think that was my first big, my first big report.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is about the same time now--how did you come to get involved with the Black Express (ph.), and were you working at the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times] at the same time?
Speaker 2: No.  You know actually--actually, actually that might have been probably late '72 [1972]; might have been late '72 [1972] that I did the Cabrini Green stuff--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because the--and I would have to check these years because it's feeling to me as if I had been working at least a year for the Sun Times before the Black Express came along.  And I got involved with Express because of a--of Lu Palmer's personal request; I mean he called me up and this was after he left the Daily News [The Chicago Daily News] and I'm not exactly sure of the year; I'm guessing it was probably late '73 [1973], but I'm not positive on that year.  Lu called me and asked me to come meet him, and we met and he said, "Look Ellis, I'm getting ready to start this black community newspaper and I need help, and I'd like you to be involved with me in this."  And I said, "Well what exactly are you doing, Lu?"  And then he--and that's when he spelled out his vision, you know, of this newspaper.  And I said, "Well jeez, man, I mean I'm not sure I wanna leave my job to do this, I mean it sounds like it's important."  And he basically convinced me that I oughta come work for him, and so I went to my editor and said, "Look, I need to do this thing and so can we work something out?"  And so basically they agreed to give me a leave, and I still wrote my column for them so I was still--my column was still due every week, but my--but the rest of the time, I was free to work for the--for Lu Palmer and the Black Express.  So Lu brought me on as managing editor and for however long that paper lasted, which was not even a year I don't think, I was in charge of the staff.  And so Lu was very much--I mean he was very much the outside guy, I mean--not to say that he wasn't involved with the paper, he was, and he certainly wrote the editorials for the most part.  I think I wrote some of 'em, you know.  But in terms of the news, of the reporting that we did, I mean I was in charge of the reporting staff and we had a staff cartoonist; I was responsible for him.  And we actually considered our competition the Defender--the Weekend Defender.  And so we would try to cover, you know, all the news we thought that was interesting or important, but we'd try to cover it with a bit more edge.  We were, you know, certainly reflecting Lu's personality more than mine; we were quite outspoken about various things going on that we thought, you know, were right or wrong in Chicago [Illinois] at the time, and we tried to be provocative.  And we got a huge response from the black community, which is the audience the paper was aimed at; I mean in a very short time, and then you had to check the circulation figures, but in a very short time I think we were distributing I think like 20,000 papers a week.  So we're starting from nowhere and we had--we were much talked about so--but I think editorially, the paper was a huge success; financially it wasn't, and I think it could have been a success financially but at the end of the day, I think Lu was not really a businessman and he was not interested in having a--you know, making money, he was interested in putting out this organ which reflected, you know, his politics and his view of what was important and what was not.  So we were in a position of being a newspaper that actually turned down ads; I mean he wouldn't run liquor ads, I don't think he would run ads for cigarettes, you know, he wouldn't run--certain businesses he wouldn't run ads.  He was quite selective in who he would let give him money, and ultimately the paper just was not viable.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So that was in less than a year, you said, right?
Speaker 2: I believe it was less than a year; it was more--yeah, I'm pretty sure it was less than a year.  And I remember towards the end, when it became clear the paper was in trouble, there was a sort of a stream of people who would come through the office just to donate money; people, you know, who would come and give two or three dollars and say, "This paper is too important to go down," and people sending money.  And there were--towards the end, this big question of whether the issue would be able to come out or not because of whether we could get enough money to the printer to bring it out, and ultimately it just financially collapsed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I think we were talking earlier, I actually saw it in Ohio, you know.  It was distributed, you know--it had somewhat of a national distribution though probably limited (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I'm sure it was limited but it got around and it was, I mean it was a paper that people talked about.  And it was certainly widely talked about in Chicago [Illinois] during that time when we were publishing it.  And I didn't notice that the Defender copied a few of the things that we were doing; I mean we had a--as I said, we had an editorial cartoonist and we were doing a cartoon of someone on the front page and I noticed that after we started doing that, they did some of that as well.  There were some other things that I noticed they picked up from us.
Story_ID: 39759
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you covered the campaign in '72 [1972] you said.  Well, you didn't cover the whole cam--but you attended the convention, right?
Speaker 2: I attended the convention.  In '76 [1976], I actually covered the campaign and so I was, I was in several of the states for the primaries (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Let's talk about this 'cause you make a move to the Washington Bureau in '75 [1975], right?
Speaker 2: That was actually--yeah, '75 [1975]--late '75 [1975] I guess, I moved to the Washington Bureau and--I mean I never totally moved because what happened was that a slot opened up in the bureau but I think it was just a temporary slot, and so I kept my apartment in Chicago [Illinois] but I also got an apartment in Washington [Washington, D.C.], and I would fly back and forth between the two cities but I was working out of Washington at the time.  And then that flowed naturally into the campaign season and so I mean I was covering Congress, I was, I was doing--mostly covering Congress but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You arrive at the Sun Times Washington Bureau during the Watergate Hearings, don't you?  Or closely as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well around that time, but I wasn't really involved in that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that at all, that was--but yeah, it was around then, but I was not doing Washington reporting at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So by the time I was doing Washington reporting was late '75 [1975], and I remember living--I lived in Southwest Washington at the time, and I enjoyed it, I mean I enjoyed learning about Congress; that was mostly what I was covering and the various agencies I spent time in.  And that flowed naturally into covering the presidential contest in '76 [1976], and so I traveled with some of the, some of the--different candidates and ended up spending quite a bit of time with the [President] Jimmy Carter Campaign actually.
Story_ID: 39760
Speaker 1: Okay.  You wrote on one of your columns in '75 [1975] about school desegregation, which was a big deal then.  A lot of cities were rolling out a desegregation plan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember going to--and I'm not sure what column you're referring to because--and I certainly don't remember from back then but I, but I, but I, I actually covered the desegregation in Louisville [Kentucky] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, well there's a statement here I wanted to read and it's that you said at one point, you said, "Many of the blacks who once fought so valiantly for integration now also question whether schools desegregation was in their best interest."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean I was just reflecting a view; and there are some people even today who still have that view, but I think that the--and that was also at a time when there, as you mentioned, certain communities were still fighting desegregation.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Battles in Boston--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 39761
Speaker 1: --and a lot of other cities.  Okay.  So--the Carter [President Jimmy Carter] campaign.  So did you follow the Carter campaign exclusively or did you--
Speaker 2: Not exclusively, but--I mean by the time he became the candidate, and then of course there were no other Democratic candidates; but at the time, I mean I covered, you know, the primary as well--at least parts of the primary as well.  So I spent time with various candidates, and I remember, I think--who in the heck was running?  Who else was running in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Gerald Ford (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well that was the Republican, but it's the Democrats I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, the Democrats (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Was it Church that was running at the time?  I don't even remember who the candidates were at the time, but I do remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Kennedy was--Ted Kennedy until Chappaquiddick--I mean that's what took him out (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, but he wasn't really part of the campaign once it got going.  But I do remember traveling and--at one point in Florida, and there being three candidates who were in the state, and I had to sort of hopscotch from one campaign to the other during that time, so I think I had two hotel rooms in different parts of Florida and was leaping from one campaign plane to the other at various points in there.  But then of course after the convention and Carter [President Jimmy Carter] became the candidate, it was exclusively covering him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Had you heard of Jimmy Carter before?
Speaker 2: I don't think anybody had heard of him (laughter) much, before he came out of nowhere, during the early parts of the convention.  I mean I liked him; I mean I did meet him and talk with him a few times, and I was certainly impressed with him.  I do remember there being this uncomfortable moment once when he was asking me about how religious I was, and I remember thinking, 'Well, not all that religious but maybe I shouldn't say that to this guy,' and sort of dancing around the question.  But I--but yeah, I mean I certainly remember liking him.
