Speaker 1: Seven [2007].
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good, good enough.
Speaker 2: Let's cut that out and come back, they'll never know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Everybody gets wrong, surprisingly (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: I always had the hunch that even interviewing Einstein [Albert Einstein], he may have gotten it wrong.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 534078
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you a few People magazine questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it's supposedly just to relax you and to relax me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Of course.  And the first one is going to be: what is your favorite season or time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year for me is in the summer.  I like when it's hot out and there's no clouds and there's no rain, and I'm able to be out on the streets and traveling and doing things that I truly enjoy to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love seafood.  Chilean sea bass.  Black bass.  Those fish I didn't grow up on, but later in life, as I became a chef, I was afforded opportunities to eat that.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color.  Blue.  Brown.  I like red.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No one single color.
Speaker 1: No one single color.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's fine.  And your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation spot, Jamaica.  Yes.  Love Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Any reason?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was very fascinated when I went to the country, and back then when I did go, I was very unconscious.  And, for some reason, when I went there, there was a level of consciousness that came to me is why I really, really understood what real poverty was.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I thought I grew up in poverty, but I've seen firsthand what poverty was and in an island nation of African people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, finally, what is your favorite saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite saying.  I have a new saying today when I talk to young people across the country and people in prison: "If Chef Jeff can do it, you can do it."
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 534079
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you to give me your mother's full name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And your father's full name.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's maiden name is June Marie Giles [June Giles Henderson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Charles Henderson, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how far back can you take us where you may have heard stories or your mother may have told you; dad may have told you?  How far back can you take us on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I wrote a lot about my mom in my memoir, and I remember hearing a lot of stories about my family.  And different people told me about the history of my mother's side of the family, which originated in New Orleans (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --Louisiana.  My mother had two other siblings; an older brother named Louis Wilson [Louis Giles (ph.)], an older sister named Anna Mae [Anna Giles (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from what I remember and hearing about my mom from my dad and stuff growing up, my mother grew up not too much in poverty; they did live in a house.  My mother was pretty much raised by my aunt, Miss Jones; Deborah Jones [ph.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My father--my mother's mom, apparently, was a cook at one time and worked in a pool hall where she met my mother's father--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who--they were never married.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And at some point, my grandmother was admitted to a mental health--mental hospital, who died prior--before I was born and my sister [Junell Henderson] was born.
Story_ID: 534080
Speaker 1: My mother [June Giles Henderson] hated her father and she would never tell us why.  And I know a lot of people from the South liked to put all their family stories and rumors and stuff to rest.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They don't like to share them from generation to generation.  But I purposely made several trips down to New Orleans [Louisiana] to talk to elders in the family.  And rumor was that my mom was molested by a gym teacher in junior high school and one of the reasons why--that my mother eventually came to California.  They wanted to move her out of the South because of the rumors and the shame that it kind of brought the family.  My mother and father [Charles Henderson, Jr.] grew up together.  And my father grew up in the Magnolia Projects [C.J. Peete Projects, New Orleans, Louisiana], and my mother lived uptown on North Roman, North Roman Street.  And my mother was a tomboy, loved bicycles and messing with cars; she wore pigtails and always ran with the boys and fought the boys off, and kind of like was protective of my father to some degree, from what my mom tells me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And in the early '60s [1960s], my grandmother--my father's mother, Ethel Mae Dunn [Ethel Dunn Henderson] was her maiden name--took flight to California with a lot of Louisianans--and they helped with the situation my mother was in.  They kind of like married my mother and father up and they shipped her out from New Orleans to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's what I pretty much remember.
Speaker 2: So your father did not go to L.A.?
Speaker 1: Yes.  My father went first.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Oh.  He went first
Speaker 1: He went first.  And then my mother and father stayed in contact.  And my family, on my mother's side and my father's side, my nanny, my aunt--Miss Jones [Deborah Jones (ph.)]--was very good friends with my Grandmother Ethel.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they kept in contact, and, you know--my father really loved my mother.  They were the first ever to be together sexually--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --first love, everything.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now, just to reference all of this, do we have a date of when your mother and the family members moved to California?
Speaker 1: Yes, 1959 and '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 534081
Speaker 1: Let me just visit one more thing, and that is, you were telling us about your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How much did your mother [June Giles Henderson] tell you about your maternal grandfather?
Speaker 2: That he was a dresser.  He always ran pool halls, and he was a street runner, a lot of women; had probably a lot of kids.  She hated him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I later in life learned how--it gets a little emotional for me talking about this, but--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --my mother's life has been really (pause).
Speaker 1: Take your time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The father--my mother's father, apparently, used to beat my grandmother.  And my mother witnessed these things when she was growing up.  And my mother had a deep hatred for men.  And it came to show later in life, something that truly, truly affected me, that I never was able to even talk to my mother about it even to this day, but I talked to my sister [Junell Henderson] about it.  And she blames, probably, my grandmother's death because of him.  And they were somehow tied to the Zulus [Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club], the Zulu tribe from the Mardi Gras down there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So there was a lot of alcohol, a lot of profanity, a lot of children born out of wedlock, family and stuff.  I don't know if there was any incest or anything.  But, you know, these are the things that, you know, we hear about our families that come from the South.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.  And that's pretty much all I knew about him.
Story_ID: 534082
Speaker 1: Your father [Charles Henderson, Jr.], how far back can you go there or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A little more about my father because--I--my grandmother on my father's side pretty much raised us up a little bit.  And my grandfather [Charles Henderson, Sr.] used to work on the Mississippi River.  He was a stern black man, very strong willed, hard worker.  And he, too, was a great dresser.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he was clean all the time.  You know, Friday nights, get the paycheck, you at the pool hall; you know, they're doing the drinking and stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I remember the stories that my grandmother told me that--my grandmother comes from a family of five girls, all of them were redbones; Creole (unclear).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather and my Uncle Eli [Eli Henderson (ph.)] and a few other guys used to always come over to try to court them.  And they had to sit on the porch.  Couldn't go in the house, couldn't go on dates.  And I think that movies was, like, fifteen cents back then.  And my grandfather was telling me how they picked which sister they wanted, and Ethel [Ethel Dunn Henderson] was the one my grandfather picked, and the first and only man that my grandmother had ever been with.  And they eventually got together.  She's a beautiful woman.  And my grandfather was tough growing up.  And he was a hard worker.  He wasn't a loving man.  He wasn't a compassionate man.  And he was really hard on my father growing up.  And come to find out, my father's father--my great-grandfather--was the same way.  And he was a photographer.  And he was a clean dresser.  I mean, he had zebra striped suits.  And I have pictures of him, too.  And he originated from Mobile, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Charles Henderson, Sr. [sic.]--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I believe.  He was a Charles Henderson, too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There's three generations of Charles Henderson.  And my father was the only son of three s- there's four kids; my Auntie Barbara [ph.], my Auntie Joyce [Joyce Henderson Jordan], and my Aunt Janice [ph.], and then my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was the second--the third oldest.  And he was the only boy.  But he was special to my grandmother, 'cause my grandfather was hard on him, and he used to, you know, be rough on him, made him quit school in the seventh grade so he could go work to help put food on the table, and he would beat my father and sometimes whip him coming out of the bathtub when he was wet with a razor strap.  And it was the same treatment that he got from his father, but he always took care of his family.  My grandmother and my father always told me that he never stayed out all night, he always was with the family on the holidays, but rumor was that he always had another family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I rebelled against my father many times growing up--and my mother [June Giles Henderson]--because I--the things I wanted from my father I never was able to get.  But now, since I understand psychology and the cycles of poverty and the traits of this bad childhood, is that my father couldn't give me what he couldn't get me, and my grandfather couldn't give my father what my great-grandfather couldn't give him.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So back then, the motto was, "You work hard, boy.  You get a job, you take care of your family."  You know, but they always found time to party and hang out at the juke joints--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Story_ID: 534083
Speaker 1: And when the family decided to move to Los Angeles [California]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --this was the early '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --before you were born.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they all went.  Not--I don't mean at the same time.  But they all decided they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In groups.
Speaker 1: --going to relocate--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they all--my father--my [paternal] grandparents [Ethel Dunn Henderson and Charles Henderson, Sr.] went first; then the kids--the three girls came; and then my father [Charles Henderson, Jr.] came, I believe, last.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And maybe my Auntie Barbara 'cause my Auntie Barbara, the eldest of my father's siblings, stayed behind.  She was married in a very abusive relationship, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And give us Auntie Barbara's last name.
Speaker 2: Her last name is--her name is Barbara Kendrick [Barbara Henderson Kendrick (ph.)].  Her maiden name is Dunn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  Her maiden name is Henderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Henderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was an exact replica of my grandfather, because, you know, we learn inadvertently and indirectly, and we pick up traits of our first teachers, of our mother and father, you know.  And she's still living today.  Everyone's still living except my mother [June Giles Henderson] and grand- my grandmother and grandfather recently passed over the last ten years since I've been out of prison.
Story_ID: 534084
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five [1965] you were born.  Were you the oldest?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I actually was born in 1964.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Nineteen sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have one sister who was born in 1962.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Her name was Junell Marie Henderson [Junell Henderson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she would be the oldest child.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were the second?
Speaker 2: Yes, of my mother [June Giles Henderson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Of your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that sister was born in 1962.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Could you give me just the full name?
Speaker 2: Junell Marie Henderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good enough.  You were born, your mother was living in Watts [Los Angeles, California] at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When she first came--when my father [Charles Henderson, Jr.] was living in Watts, it used to be called the Eastside [Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --back then the Bottoms.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the Bottoms was where most black folks lived in that era, which you could--here are known as South Central to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] was mostly white families who lived there.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  And what are your earliest memories?  Well, let--first of all, tell me about your other siblings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and what year they were born.
Speaker 2: My sister--I have my sister Junell, who is my full blooded sister.  My father has several other children by different marriages and relationships.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My sister Charlene Henderson [ph.] by my dad's second wife; and then he has another daughter named Tonya Henderson [ph.] by his fourth wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But the only children that your mother had were--
Speaker 2: Is my sister Junell.
Speaker 1: --is your sister Junell (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 534085
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories there [Los Angeles, California]?  How far back--can you take us back to one year, two years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I do remember a lot.  You know, I remember--I don't quite remember when my father [Charles Henderson, Jr.] left, but I always remember that he came around.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Holidays he brought bikes, and he did what he could to help us.  And I remember my grandparents [Ethel Dunn Henderson and Charles Henderson, Sr.] a lot.  And my grandparents was like my mother and father (pause).
Speaker 1: Take your time.
Speaker 2: Even my grandfather, though how he was, he still was a good man.  (Pause) I remember my father coming around a lot on the holidays and taking his ride on his motorcycle.  He always had motorcycles, 'cause he loved motorcycles.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My father was a good man, too.  And my mother [June Giles Henderson], all my stepmothers today would take my father back, though he's been married four times.  He just had it rough.  You know, my father was a very humble, very soft spirited man.  Never heard my father curse, smoke, take a drink of alcohol or anything.  And my mother was tough growing up.  She was a tomboy and she was a hell raiser.  And she put my father through a lot of stuff, you know.  And I'm sure my father, he wasn't perfect; you know, he done his thing, too.  But, again, you know, my father and my mother went through a lot growing up.  And she was abused and apparently molested by this one man.  And I think that really affected her life.  And the fact that she watched my father--grandfather mistreat her mother and her mother going to an insane hospital, which really affected me as well, too, and my sister [Junell Henderson].  So I saw a lot of things that affected me my whole life living with my mother, you know, and my sister, you know, that were different.  You know, my mother, there was always a woman living with us, you know, growing up.  And I came later to find out that my father left because my mother--the whole marriage became a struggle.  But my mother loved my father.  And he hung in there as long as he could.  And it came to a point to where--that he had to go.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.  So I think my rebellious ways came from my mom.  I rebelled against my mother and--
Speaker 1: You had her spirit.
Speaker 2: I had her spirit.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But there was a part of me--I had my father, too.  And I understood why he left.  And I probably would have left if I was the situation, too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But my mother did the best that she could to raise me and my sister.  She kept food on the table.  We never were homeless.  It may not have been the food we wanted to eat, but we ate.  But my mother's lifestyle of the alcoholism and her personal life relationships affected us deeply.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I've never even had a conversation with this about my mother today, but it's something that I have to do to bring clarity and closure.
Story_ID: 534086
Speaker 1: Your mother [June Giles Henderson] was the single breadwinner during those early years [in Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did she work?
Speaker 2: My mother, she used to be a daycare provider for a paraplegic woman.  I remember back, she used to be into nursing, took care of people.  I know she worked in a studio at one time.  But then my mother always had men jobs.
Speaker 1: When you say studio, you mean--
Speaker 2: Music studio.  Recording studio.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Then she took on welding and became a welder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she worked at NASSCO shipyard [National Steel and Shipbuilding Company] building ships and doing things like that, and, you know, something that I never really liked much, because my mother had a rough exterior.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I had to deal with that growing up, and my sister [Junell Henderson] as well, too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, yes.
Story_ID: 534087
Speaker 1: During this period of your growing up, you're talking about the preschool years--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) two, three, four?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Two, three, four, five, six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first days of going to elementary school, kindergarten (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the schools that--the first school that I remember, elementary, was Toluca Lake Elementary [Toluca Lake Elementary School] in North Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], and it was an all-white school.  Me and my sister [Junell Henderson] were the only two black kids in the school.  And that's when I think I really unders- started learning about race.  And I couldn't understand why, you know, my hair was nappy and everyone looked different from me.  And it was a time where I, you know, I wanted my hair straight.  You know, I didn't like the texture of my hair.  But I did have light, bright skin, and I did fit in a little more.  But I never was, like, called names.  And I was beat up a couple of times by some white guys, but it just made me tougher.  But I never was called nigger or--, "What are you doing here?"  I was pretty much accepted into the school.  But I was conscious enough to know that the world was different that I grew up in.
Speaker 1: Now, you lived in Watts [Los Angeles, California], and Toluca Lake Elementary is a long way from Watts (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that happen that you were able to go to Toluca Lake Elementary?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [June Giles Henderson] moved to North Hollywood, and we lived on Cuyamaca--Toluca--North Toluca Lake Boulevard [sic.].  And I think it's close to Burbank [California].  It's around that area by Universal Studios [Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City, California].  And my mother was taking care of this lady who was a paraplegic--quadriplegic; wealthy family in the Valley [San Fernando Valley, California], and I think they moved us there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so that your mother--
Speaker 2: So we could be closer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) could be closer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to the person she was working with.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any more experiences there at Toluca Lake Elementary that you can remember or that--
Speaker 2: No.  I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) particularly stand out?
Speaker 2: --we were on the free lunch program.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I'm partial blind in my right eye, if you can notice.  Sometimes it goes a little whirly.  And that's when I found out that I was blind in that eye then 'cause I ran into a tree and bruised my eye.  And my mom took me to the doctors and come to find out that I had a lazy eye.  And when I think back, too, I remember we used to--we didn't get money going to school, and other kids always had money.  And there was a liquor store on the way to school.  And I remember my first years of, I think, shoplifting--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --is I used to steal these little Hostess chocolate and powder sugared donuts and Twinkies back then.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Every now and then my mom would give us a quarter or two on our way to school so we can get them.  But when she didn't, you know, I would take them out of the store.  I got caught once, and the store owner knew my mom and called her and told her, and I got a whipping for that.  And I never took anything out that store again.
Speaker 1: But you were trying to provide for you and your sister?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The--that was--what years were you at Toluca Lake Elementary?
Speaker 2: It would have to be in the--I was born in '64 [1964]; it had to be '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Early '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 534088
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And there came a time when you left--or cause--circumstances caused you to leave Toluca Lake Elementary [Toluca Lake Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] and to go to another school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  After we had lived there for a while, the last I remember we moved to San Diego [California].  I lived in San Diego twice.  My uncle, Louis [Louis Giles (ph.)], my mother's eldest brother, was in the [U.S.] Navy.  And his wife Rose [Rose Giles (ph.)], at the time, didn't know how to drive, and she had three children of their own.  And my mom--my uncle asked my mom [June Giles Henderson] if she would move to San Diego to help take care of his family while he was overseas on deployment for nine months, that we could live there in their home for free.  So it was the first real house that we ever lived in.  It was a duplex up in Murphy Canyon, part of Linda Vista [San Diego, California] Navy housings.  And my mother said okay, and we moved to San Diego.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's how we left North Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 534089
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what elementary school did you attend in San Diego [California]?
Speaker 2: I attended Kit Carson Elementary School [San Diego, California] and Linda Vista Elementary School [San Diego, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the Linda Vista section of San Diego.
Speaker 1: And were some of your experiences there that you can remember?
Speaker 2: I was acting out, getting in trouble and just rebelling and not focusing and paying attention, you know.  I started stealing from my teacher.  You know, she would leave her purse.  We would watch movies, you know.  I don't know if you've been--school back then, we had the reel to reel--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and we used to watch the Disney movies.  And I remember Jiminy Cricket and all the different movies.  And she would leave her purse under the desk.  And when the movie was going, she would leave the class and go and tend to business as she had to have been, and we would crawl down the side of the wall and take money out of her purse.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I, mostly times when I took money back then it was to buy food.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: You said we just then.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Would there be somebody accompanying you in this?
Speaker 2: Taking the money?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was one of my friends named Larry Daniels [ph.].  He was a white kid.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And another guy, a Spanish kid by the name of Joey Molina [ph.].  And they were being in--co-conspirators with me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: How long were you there at that elementary, Kit Carson [Kit Carson Elementary School, San Diego, California]?
Speaker 2: Kit Carson, was there for maybe a year or two; and then eventually my uncle [Louis Giles (ph.)] came back.  And it became tough for us to continue to live with my uncle because me and my sister [Junell Henderson] was growing up, his kids were growing up and we're clashing; became too big for the three bedroom house.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So then my mom [June Giles Henderson] decided to move, and we moved to Linda Vista [San Diego, California] on Comstock Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a two story apartment in these projects.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Any particular episodes that you remember living in the projects there in San Diego [California]--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) during that period?
Speaker 1: Just, you know, growing up; going through my little young rites of passage, and, you know, experimenting; you know, breaking windows and liking the girls.  And I remember once pulling the fire alarm.  Back then they had fire alarms on telephone poles throughout the community.  And if you pull it down the fire truck just automatically comes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I remember doing that once, and I was scared because all these police and fire trucks came and there was no fire, and I ran and ran, you know.  But I had a dog named Lukumba [ph.].  He was important to me.  And my mom bought me a motorcycle once, and I used to ride my motorbike down in the canyons--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --all the times.  I was very adventurous.  I always (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How old were you when she bought you that?
Speaker 1: I was in the sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Maybe sixth grade going into the seventh grade--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at Montgomery Junior High [Montgomery Junior High School; Montgomery Middle School, San Diego, California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So you were eleven or twelve?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And that was big for me, you know.  My mother loved motorcycles.  She loved cars.  We always loved the same things, you know, 'cause she learned that from my dad [Charles Henderson, Jr.], you know, when they were growing up in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Story_ID: 534091
Speaker 1: Now, graduating from elementary school to junior high, tell us about that experience, what it was like for you and what your early years in junior high--
Speaker 2: Junior high school was--I moved around a lot, because after my seventh grade year at Montgomery Junior High [Montgomery Junior High School; Montgomery Middle School] in San Diego [California], it was new for me because I was with older kids.  I was learning different things.  And I went to school with my sister [Junell Henderson].  She was in ninth grade then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time, I was really rebelling.  I was getting into trouble.  The school district tried to get me on the Big Brother program [Big Brothers Big Sisters of America], which they did eventually.  I had a big brother by the name of Doug Tucker [ph.].  He was an ex-military man, and he used to bring me to his house up in Kearny Mesa [San Diego, California] to cut the grass and try to do things where he could- he didn't want to just give me money, he wanted me to earn it.  And Doug taught me my times tables, 'cause I had problems with math.  And he wrote out one--he would--the ones all the way up to the twelves on a brown paper bag.  And he would reward me for moving--advancing from my ones, to the twos, to the threes, with shirts and clothes and bicycles.  So it was an incentive to learn, which really worked for me, you know.  I was getting suspended from school--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --for different things; fighting and acting out and stuff.
Story_ID: 534092
Speaker 1: So now you are in junior high school, Montgomery Junior High [Montgomery Junior High School; Montgomery Middle School, San Diego, California]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there in San Diego [California].  What was your next move?  Unless we're leaving out some detail where you wanted to relate (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really too much detail.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a vivid memory of Montgomery.  I know I never liked to dress up for P.E. [physical education].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And on the way to school, we would always raid a couple of yards where they had kumquats--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and the fruit trees in the yards on the way to school, 'cause we always had to walk through the nice white neighborhoods to get to school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And in the summertime, before the summer or the spring, they would have--the kumquats were in full bloom.  And we would go get bags of kumquats and plums off the people's fruit trees, 'cause, I mean, we never afforded plums and apricots and peaches, you know.  It was just all we had were those old red apples you get the whole deal for the big bag in the store and bananas and oranges occasionally.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that was a big deal for us.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So here we are.  We're at Montgomery--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Junior High.  And what is your next move?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was rebelling, getting in trouble a lot.  And it came to a time that my mom [June Giles Henderson] said, "You know, you need to be with your father [Charles Henderson, Jr.]."  You know, we had called my father and told him, and, you know, he decided to move us out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my mother stayed in San Diego [California], and me and Junell [Junell Henderson]--my mother had always swore to us that she would never separate the two of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So if she went or I went, we had to go together.  And we always stayed together.  So we went to go live with my father in L.A.  We moved to Culver City [California] on Cloverdale Avenue.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what elementary--what junior high school did you attend there?
Speaker 2: I attended the Palms Junior High [Palms Junior High School; Palms Middle School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In Culver City [sic.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  What was it like there?  Any memorable events?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Again, I was always hungry and didn't really have money to buy--you know, in junior high school they have, like, the regular cafeteria, and then they have a special kitchen that you could bring extra money and buy, you know, French garlic bread and pizza; slices and stuff like that, and I always wanted those things.  For some reason, when I lived with my dad--then he was married to then his third wife, Dixie Ann [Dixie Henderson], and she had two sons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were teenagers all living together, so we had some issues and challenges there; the whole stepmother and stepfather, you know, drama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Palm Junior High, I was in the seventh grade.  I graduated in '82 [1982].  So we're looking '76 [1976] maybe--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --seventy-seven [1977], '78 [1978], somewhere around there.
Story_ID: 534093
Speaker 1: I--you know, the same trouble.  Not paying attention in school, talking.  And there was a young white kid, we called him Fat Tommy, and his father owned a hardware store in that community, because Palms [Palms Junior High School; Palms Middle School, Los Angeles, California] was in a pretty upscale community over there by Cheviot Hills [Los Angeles, California] and stuff, if you're, familiar with that area.  And he used to bring money to school all the time to, you know, wanting to fit in with the boys, you know.  So I had a little crew, and he would bring twenty dollars almost every day or every couple of days, and he would buy us food from that special kitchen, you know, at school.  And then I guess he apparently got caught by his father taking money out the cash register, so he stopped bringing the money.  And I started putting pressure on him, said, "Tommy, you know, where's the money?"
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause I was eating this extra food every day.  And at home, my stepmother [Dixie Henderson] never cooked enough food, and I was hungry all the time.  There was never no seconds.  And my mother [June Giles Henderson] made sure we always had seconds.  And we ate grits a lot growing up 'cause, you know, grits swell up in your stomach.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you can go all day with a bowl of grits and some scrambled eggs, you know.  And I would--I put pressure on this kid to bring the money, and he got scared and apparently went and told the principal.  So they set me up, and they gave him a marked twenty.  And I took the twenty dollars from him, and I was in class waiting to go to lunch and to buy some food.  And they called the principal and a counselor came and took me out of class, and I'm like, oh, you know, I wonder what happened.  What did I do?  I didn't do anything.  He says, "Empty your pockets."  So I emptied my pockets, and then I had this twenty.  He said, "Where did you get this from?"  I said, "It's mine's.  I been had it."  Got very defensive.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they took the serial numbers and matched it to the serial numbers that they had.  And it was Fat Tommy's.  And I knew at that time I had been set up.  And I got not only suspended from Palms Junior High, I got kicked out of the whole L.A. Unified School District [Los Angeles Unified School District].
Story_ID: 534094
Speaker 1: So once you got kicked out of the--and we're still talking about elementary school--
Speaker 2: No.  Junior high [Palms Junior High School; Palms Middle School, Los Angeles, California] now.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Oh.  I'm mean--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Junior high.
Speaker 1: Junior high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How long were you suspended and how did you get back in?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, it was about almost a, almost a year that I was there when this happened.  And my father [Charles Henderson, Jr.] had just purchased his first home with Dixie [Dixie Henderson] in Long Beach [California].  And the timing couldn't have been perfect, because they didn't know how they was going to get me back into a public school.  I couldn't go to a school in L.A. Unified School District [Los Angeles Unified School District].  So what happened was that we were already moving, so the timing was perfect, and we moved to Long Beach, and he was able to get me into junior high school at Hamilton Junior High [Alexander Hamilton Junior High School; Alexander Hamilton Middle School] in North Long Beach [Long Beach, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you do any better at Hamilton?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I didn't do--I got suspended a couple of times, but not kicked out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And went to--Hamilton, it was the same thing, but there were things that I excelled--it was a little different about Hamilton.  I had took an interest in drafting and metal shop and woodshop. Excelled very fast in drafting.  I got--the only time I ever got an A in my life was in drafting.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I used to like to use those deals where you put the pencil in there, and it has like a sharp pen, and you take it and you go like this to make these circles.  So that's when I first started understanding about the pie diagram and the wheel to where--the percentages.  Here's a hundred percent of the wheel, and then you have 60, 40, and stuff like that.  But I did really good with the rulers and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went to that class every day.  I went to my metal shop and I went to my woodshop class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I never ever got any math and English.  I never ever really was able to relate how the teacher was teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because growing up, again, you know, coming from a generation of poverty and no education from my mother [June Giles Henderson] and father and my grandparents, you know, education wasn't taught.  It wasn't discussed in the home.  It wasn't--you know, we didn't sit at the table and I was--my mind was stimulated intellectually.  It was like, "Boy, you go to school today?"  "Yeah, I went to school, Mom.  I went to school," you know.  "What did you learn?"  You know, never was it--, "Did you learn anything?" you know.  "What did you--?" cause she couldn't help me.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: You know, so that's why I had the Big Brother [Big Brothers Big Sisters of America] and all the people around me who could try to help straighten me out, you know.
Story_ID: 534095
Speaker 1: So one of my friends that I became friends with in Long Beach [California] was a friend by the name of Marvin Kerchivoff [ph.]; Adolph [ph.]--what's Adolph's last name; can't remember Adolph's last name--and a white kid named Ernest [ph.].  We called him Ern-dog.  He thought he was black.  Got a Jheri curl, big 'fro and everything. That was my little crew.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Ernest had a friend, a family friend who brought up fireworks and stuff from Mexico.  So I started selling fireworks in school.  And I was in a bathroom stall making a deal on some bottle rockets, and one of them assistant principals came in, I got busted.  Selling fireworks, I got suspended.  And that was one of the things I started getting into, but I started breaking in houses, started stealing bicycles.  And several years later, I earned my first arrest--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at fifteen--fourteen, fifteen years old.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you were in junior high?
Speaker 1: No.  I was in high school then.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You were in high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So I did graduate from junior high--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --from Hamilton Junior High [Alexander Hamilton Junior High School; Alexander Hamilton Middle School, Long Beach, California], and I got--
Speaker 2: Went on to what high school?
Speaker 1: Long Beach Jordan [David Starr Jordan High School, Long Beach, California]--Jordan, Jordan High.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was in 1979 or '80 [1980]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at that time.
Story_ID: 534096
Speaker 1: And I had my first job when I was at the ninth grade--tenth grade.  I--the CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] program--I don't know if you remember CETA program. Tom Bradley was in office; great mayor, great man; started the summer work program.  You get to make five or six hundred bucks [dollars] working through the summer.  And my first job was at Kit Carson Elementary School [Hawthorne, California] as a janitor.  And I did real well, because my [paternal] grandfather's [Charles Henderson, Sr.] business was a janitorial business in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And so he taught me how to work young, 'cause I used to go on the truck with him.  And that's when I discovered I really believed the rumors of my grandfather having a second life, because he always kept a suit in his truck from Zeidler and Zeidler (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh.  Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: So I remember every detail, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So you were very successful in this job down in Long Beach [California]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --janitorial job.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause my grandfather taught me young.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, I knew how to work.  You know, back then, you know, our generation, we knew how to clean and, and work.
Story_ID: 534097
Speaker 1: Any other highlights during your high school days before we get to the part of your going off to prison?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I did go to Long Beach Jordan [David Starr Jordan High School, Long Beach, California].  And on February 1981, I got--almost got killed.  I was stabbed in Cerritos mall [Los Cerritos Center, Cerritos, California].  You know where Cerritos mall is there?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They tried to kill me.  They stabbed me here, and I was in the hospital for about a week.  And I almost lost my life--by some gang members from Inglewood [California].  They tried to rob me and my little brother of some clothes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother [June Giles Henderson] was still living in San Diego [California].  And at that point, she says, "I'm coming to get you guys."  And she took me back, me and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You and your sister?
Speaker 2: --me and my sister.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My sister had gotten pregnant--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as well, and my father [Charles Henderson, Jr.] had said that she couldn't stay there being pregnant; that she had to go back to my mom, because my stepmother [Dixie Henderson], you know, wasn't having it, you know, because she wanted a child, too, from my father, and he wouldn't let her have any more children.  And she said, "Well, if I'm not having no baby, you know, she's not having no baby in this house."  So eventually wind up going back to San Diego in 1981.  But during that period of high school, you know, I was coming into puberty.  You know, I had my first experience, you know, with a woman.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I had my break-ins of houses all in my neighborhood.  And my first arrest came at stealing a bicycle in Houghton Park [Long Beach, California].  And the police--it was a sting operation, I guess.  All the bikes we had been stealing, it got hot in that area (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we would always wait 'til Christmas and--to go out hunting for new bikes.  But we would take the bus out to the wealthy suburbs, Lakewood [California] and Cerritos [California] and case out our bikes.  And so the police set a brand new bicycle up in a park against a tree.  And me and my boys was walking down the street (laughter), and I said, "Wow, look at that bike, man.  It's just sitting there" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I jump on, I start pedaling down the street.  The next thing I hear (makes sound) (laughter); here comes the police (laughter).  How foolish, you know.  And that was my first--handcuffed and hauled off to Long Beach County Jail [sic. Long Beach City Jail, Long Beach, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you this:  During that period, we want to keep up with Junell [Junell Henderson], also--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and was she getting into any trouble?  How was she doing in school?
Speaker 2: Junell always did well in school.  She tried her best to look after me as much as she could.  When I was a young kid growing up, she fed me all the time, you know.  Mom was working and, you know, I love her.  She was like mom--sister-mom, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I was really hurt when she got pregnant.  And I always looked over my sister, because I know a lot of guys was trying to get to her.  She was young, she was a virgin, and she was very beautiful. And a guy by the name of Mike--they used to call him Money Mike--lived in Long Beach [California].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he was a cool guy, you know.  He was dating my sister, and all my friends tried to come around, but never left sister unattended.  But Money Mike always had money.  And I was always hungry.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And he came over--and my father converted our garage into, like, a family room so we didn't have to be in the house.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So Mike would come over, and he'd say, "Hey, Jeff [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson], why don't you go to the store, man," and he'd peel out these fives and tens.  And it took twenty--fifteen minutes to get to the store and fifteen minutes to get back.  And I think that was his strategy to get me away from my sister.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because when he over to visit in our family room, I was sitting right there.  So nothing ever took place.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, but he fooled me by getting me to go to the store.  And I guess that's how my sister got pregnant.  And then when I found out about it I cried, I went crazy, I kicked in our fence, and I hated the guy.  And, you know, I was mad at my sister and stuff.  And she graduated valedictorian.  But she had a promising future, you know, for college and everything.  And she could have went.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So when she got pregnant, my father said she had to go.  And at the time I got stabbed.  So here we were, back in San Diego again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --in February 1981.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The bicycle charge, stealing the bicycle--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that charge was dropped?
Speaker 2: It was a misdemeanor.
Speaker 1: Misdemeanor, okay.
Speaker 2: My father came to pick me up. First time, you know, juvenile.  So it was a slap on the wrist.  I think I had a six month probation or something.  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 534098
Speaker 1: And now you're back in, in San Diego [California]--
Speaker 2: Back in San Diego.
Speaker 1: --you and Junell [Junell Henderson]--
Speaker 2: Me and Junell.
Speaker 1: --with your mother [June Giles Henderson].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was it like being back there?
Speaker 2: Well, after she picked me up from the hospital after I got released and came back to the father's place in Long Beach [California], she was there; had all our stuff packed up in her car, and we made our way to San Diego.  My mother--at that time, my mother had an apartment in this--it was this upscale project we called the condos.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I remember vividly, you know, pulling up in there.  And there was a lot of activity going on, you know, guys shooting dice and lowriders, women; probably some prostitution and stuff, too.  It was exciting to me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, I was looking around seeing all these brothers hanging out.  They had jewelry and girls and stuff.  You know, it was, like, this is right up my alley here, you know.
Speaker 1: So you were looking for a mentor or someone to emulate.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or imitate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, you know, my dad [Charles Henderson, Jr.], you know, he was a good man.  And, again, he, his love for us was feeding us, putting a roof over our head.  We never played basketball, wrestled, shadowboxed or anything, you know.  You know, my dad never was, like, where he put his arms around me say, "This is my boy.  This is my son."  Didn't introduce me, and those are things that I wanted, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I wanted to feel that fatherly love.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I eventually got that by some of my criminal mentors in the condos, you know, which was T-Row.  Real name was Thess Goods [sic. Thess Good].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he eventually got killed about a year ago.  And I wrote about him in my book.  And there was another guy by the name of Richie Rich, and Boss Hog [ph.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And another guy by the name of Black Jesus.  And these guys were a lot older than me, and I had no--shouldn't have been hanging around these guys anyway; but I always was mature.  I never was a silly teenager who, you know, acts silly, played sports, run around.  You know, everything about me was I was looking for some activity, you know, something to get into, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And we moved there, and we lived in a one-bedroom apartment there catty corner from this guy, T-Row--
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the condos (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in the condos.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --in San Diego.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And I just started watching these guys.  And I--and they were fascinating to me.  And every free time that I had, I would be out there hanging around them, watching them and studying them.  And eventually they brought me into their world.  And T-Row, I used to wash his car, clean the rims on his car just to hang out.  And--
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell his name, again?
Speaker 2: T-Row.
Speaker 1: T, just the letter T?
Speaker 2: T with a slash and an R-O-W, Row.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: T-Row. T-Row was real skinny and--but he was a good looking brother.  I mean, people said--used to say I was like his little brother.  He was a fair-skinned brother, and he had gift to gab; you know, he had conversations, you know, with the women.  He was a Mac Daddy.  A real Mac Daddy.  He always had two or three gold chains on with a Cadillac medallion and the latest gear; the clothes, the shoes.  And all those things, you know, excited me, you know.  And he showed me love, you know.  He, you know, told me I was his little brother.  And, you know, he'd pick me up from school, he took me to school.  And every now and then he would let me up in his apartment, and he would cook steaks and T-bone steaks and poor man steak.  Black man steak by then.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's a porterhouse or ribeye.  It was a T-bone with--the tender piece was missing, you know.  And he would fry this Mrs. Friday's shrimp.  I loved it, 'cause, you know, again, back to that food; hungry always, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: And start building this confidence, and then, you know, there wasn't nothing I wouldn't do for T.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I would look out for him and everything.  And then eventually he had me holding weed for him and then selling and stuff like that.  And my mother confronted him several times--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --about dealing with me, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And about this time you were what, sixteen?
Speaker 2: I was sixteen, seventeen.  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 534099
Speaker 1: I was attending the Lincoln High School [Abraham Lincoln High School, San Diego, California], the school Marcus Allen graduated from.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And before then I was attending Madison High [James Madison High School, San Diego, California] for one semester, 'cause I moved down to San Diego [California] in the middle of the semester.  So I was bused to Madison.  And then my last year of high school was in '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that was '81 [1981] then when I first met T [T-Row].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I went to Lincoln High, and that's when I really started criminal tendencies.  Really, really start selling in to where I really didn't have a focus in school, to where my focus in school was hustling; you know, it was about the women; it was about selling my weed, as my hustle was my business.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: And so you were not--you had graduated from holding the weed for T--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to selling it.
Speaker 1: To selling it.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And eventually from selling it, I eventually started taking from T as well, because I started feeling used, 'cause I would make this money for T and take all this prison jail arrests for him, and he was just giving me a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I said to myself--you know, I started getting pretty good and building customers.  And I said it doesn't make sense for me to sell weed for him when I can do this for myself and reap more of the benefit, the profit.  So I started pinching off of T.  When he would give me big bags of marijuana, I would take, you know, several weed spears and keep it to myself.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And started stashing money on my own.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I eventually saved up enough money to buy my first car, which was a 1968 Coupe DeVille Cadillac.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I paid $375 for it.
Speaker 2: Now, you at this--at this time, you were not selling cocaine--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --or--okay.
Speaker 1: No.  I was just selling weed.
Speaker 2: Just weed.
Speaker 1: Just weed.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: And then I was in high school at that time, and so I had my first car in my senior year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I was on top of the world, you know.  But I had a little part time gig in the condos working for a man named Old Man Joe, we used to call him; Joe Wiley [ph.].  I'm sure he's probably passed away by now. He wore these overalls.  And he was from Tyler, Texas, and he had one finger missing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Joe reminded me of my [paternal] grandfather [Charles Henderson, Sr.].  He was a hard worker.  And I used to lay drywall and clean up around there to make extra money.  So I convinced my mom [June Giles Henderson] that I had saved this extra money to buy this Cadillac with, but it's really from my weed stash--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so I was going to school, you know, and I was on top of the world.  You know, at that time, you know, I was independent.  I had a little status in high school, reputation.  I was one of the few students in high school who dating cheerleaders who wasn't a football player--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --or basketball player (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But I had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that gave you, that gave you added status.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  An edge.  Yes.  I had the Cadillac, you know.  But my friends played basketball, football; but I was in the stands hustling--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, selling weed, and, you know, being the ladies' man and whatnot.  And, you know, that's what I did, you know.
Speaker 2: So you had the reputation then in the high school of being the main man if they wanted to buy some weed?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 534100
Speaker 1: And then eighty--'82 [1982] is when I graduated [from Abraham Lincoln High School, San Diego, California].  And I graduated from high school.  I had, like, a 1.5 or maybe a 2.0 GPA [grade point average].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And actually--even though I got to walk in full cap and gown, it wasn't actually a diploma; it was a certificate of completion.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And back in those days, schools were federally funded by how many students who actually went through high school.  So there was no test, you didn't have to--it was at a minimum of a 3.0 or 2.9 to get out of school.  So I really shouldn't have graduated or walked.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know.  So but in--but, you know, I did.
Speaker 2: The school was trying to--looking at the bottom line--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --that purse line (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause they wanted, you know, funded and stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I graduate in '82 [1982] and was--continued to sell weed, continued to hustle; did take on some jobs, you know, to supplement my little weed business.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then several years later, I think '83 [1983], crack cocaine--we called it rock cocaine back then--came on the scene.  And my couple years with T [T-Row], you know, under learning how to hustle; you know, T taught me how to keep money in my pocket and put food on the table; taught me how to steal cars and stuff and polish my, my game.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I got real sharp.  And T was a master at it, you know.  Never getting caught, was really smooth became my, my way of life.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And when crack came out, I was introduced to crack by T and some other guys from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and that was an opening to a beginning of a new world for me.  But also, it was the beginning of the death of generations of young black men across this country.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But I didn't come to realize that until later in life.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So, now, you have your crack business going, in addition to the selling of the weed--
Speaker 1: Well, I had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and--go ahead.
Speaker 1: I had stopped selling weed when the crack business came, because, you know, you can make thousands of dollars in one day.  You know, people stopped smoking weed and started smoking crack.  And I said, you know, I'm not going to mess around with this weed anymore.  It takes too long to make a thousand when I can make a thousand in a day.  And I started my weed--my crack cocaine business with $150 investment of--back then we called them a sixteenth of an ounce.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I used to work for T a little bit, too, because he had, you know, crack houses around the city.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--but after a while, again, T was beating me out of money, and I felt--and T had went to prison eventually.  And when T went to prison, I didn't have him to lean on.  And, at that time, I was ready to embark on my own.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I just started, every time I made more money, I would buy a bigger package of cocaine.  And we--cocaine and drugs was just like anything.  The more you buy, the better deal you get.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I stopped buying things for myself and kept reinvesting into my cocaine business--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to get it for a better price so I can outsell and beat--and sell my crack cheaper than my competition.
Story_ID: 534101
Speaker 1: Now, there came a time, I, I think I remember where you started a couple of bargain basement sales and some very innovative ideas in selling.  You want to tell us some those?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, sometimes on a weekend, like, when I used to cook cocaine, as my knowledge of this drug business grew, I used to be able to take one kilo of powder cocaine and turn it into two kilos of crack [crack cocaine].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So now--and I would buy the kilo for fifteen thousand five hundred [dollars].  So here I get a free kilo out of the one kilo.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I would sell one for fifteen five, make my money back; so now I get a free fifteen five.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I would even get more if I broke it down in smaller portions.  But I started selling weight.  So what I used to do is have extra residue on the stove from cooking this cocaine.  And then what I would do is scrape it, re-cook it, and then--into little kibbles; we used to call them g-rocks were a hundred dollar gram rocks.  And what I would do was, would go up on the block, and I would have a two for one; buy one rock, you get one rock for free--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just to make the little side money.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I would help the guys be able to hustle a little better.  So that was my special I would run on the weekend.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then, as I really started to getting my name out there for having the best crack on the market, on an ounce of cocaine it was twenty-eight grams, and I used to give up thirty grams in my house.  And so therefore, when people bought my ounces, they would make three, four hundred dollars extra.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So that's how I was able to corner the crack cocaine market in San Diego [California], 'cause everyone wanted to buy from me.
Speaker 1: Now, you were selling to those who went out on the street and re- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Resold it.
Speaker 1: --resold.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you weren't directly involved in selling it--
Speaker 2: To the user.
Speaker 1: --to the user.
Speaker 2: At first I was, but it didn't last long.  I was only selling to users for maybe a good month.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I figured out a way, how do I disconnect myself from the dangerous and scandalous part of that business.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I said I want to become a supplier.  'Cause now I'm dealing with sophisticated drug dealers.  And, as a businessman, we'd met in a hotel; we'd met in a restaurant and we would exchange money for drugs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's how I was able to do that.  I never was involved in gangs.  I never understood--I never could dislike someone because they wore a different color or they were from a different community.  So that was another thing that helped my business.  And I understood marketing.  I understand brand- branding.  I understood building relationships.  I understood and knew how to manage people.  And I did that very well, but I didn't understand that in that terminology until later in life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So this was something, you're saying, branding and all of these things that are very important to all sales people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Regardless of what they're selling.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is something that came naturally to you, even though you did not understand the philosophy behind it.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And also I forgot to mention, too, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock], is when I was young, the few jobs that I had, I used to be a candy salesman.  I don't know if you remember, these companies would get kids and take them in neighborhoods, and they come knock on the door and they would have their spiel.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I would knock on people's doors and say, "How you doing?  My name is [HistoryMaker] Jeff Henderson.  I'm trying to win a free trip to Magic Mountain [Six Flags Magic Mountain, Valencia, California] or to pay for my college tuition," and I was always the number one candy salesman.  I was always the number one paperboy.  You know, I would get subscriptions everywhere.  I would never let that person close the door.  I had some salesman techniques, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I parlayed that into the drug business.
Story_ID: 534102
Speaker 1: And everyone liked me.  I was a likeable drug dealer.  I was a good drug dealer.  A good and bad drug dealer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The bad part was I was poisoning people, I was influencing people and young kids were watching me.  But I never hurt nobody.  I never killed no one.  I never carried guns.  I help people.  I put drug addicts in rehab.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I told young athletes in school who wanted to get into the business--'cause a lot of the boys who went away to college, they could come home on spring break, and we were rich--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --hood rich, I call it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know.  And I truly believe I was a millionaire by the time I was nineteen, twenty, twenty-one years old.  And the kids would come--the guys would come home from college and be like, "Man, I ain't going back to school."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: "And I'm getting ready to get out," 'cause we're showing all the--we had all the bells and whistles of success, and they're going to school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they had--with nothing, building on their degree.
Story_ID: 534103
Speaker 1: Now, you were successful--you had successfully set up your business.  You were bringing new people into the business, even though you were not involving yourself directly--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to those that sold to users--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in there.  How many people do you think you may have brought into the business to assist you or to be that second part of the chain in moving it down the line?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, I was really a one man show.  I didn't have a second or third.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had people who were a part of the crew:  NuNu [ph.], Black Blood, Take Foe Bold [ph.], the Hit Man [ph.], Stevie Bobo.  That was pretty much my little crew that I ran with.  Another friend of mine's named L.A. Will, was part of my crew as well, and several people that I used to deal with up in Los Angeles [California], as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what I did is created opportunities for the people closest to me to make money.  I schooled them on how to do it in a way what would bring--create less risks from getting caught, and with the police; and even at points to where I would groom myself; and to where the police, if they pulled me over, the- I would look like some college kid.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Or when I transported drugs and whatnot.  And I--no one taught me that.  It's just that I was smart enough to know that I had to look--I couldn't look like everyone else.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But when I was hustling and doing business in the streets, I would, because I had to fit in.  So here we have Bloods and we had Crips; and we had different sects.  Back then it was the Skyline Pirus; we had the Syndo Mob, which was an offshoot of Lincoln Park Pirus; then we had the Buddy Boys from out of Emerald Hills [San Diego, California] who wore black; and then we had the East Dago Mob; and then we had the West Coast Crips.  Then we had the L.A. gangs coming down.  But I knew that in order to continue building wealth for myself that I had to build relationships with all these different crews in neighborhoods, because every neighborhood sold drugs and they had drug dens.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So if I became enemies of these people--it's just like, if you discriminate--it's just like during the South, I don't understand how a lot of white businesses didn't want blacks involved.  That was foolish.  And then when they started integrating, they start getting it that, hey, money is money.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Couldn't care whether it's black, white, Ku Klux Klan [KKK]; whatever.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And like I said, I don't care if it's Crip, Blood, East Coast, you got a bone in your head; that's money.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I covertly built relationships out of my base of my crew with all these different individuals in these different neighborhoods and crews.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And publicly, I wasn't seen with them publicly, but behind closed doors  I was doing business with them because they knew that I had a good product, I had a money back guarantee, that I was a straightforward guy; I wasn't a gangster, I was a businessman.  They didn't have to worry about getting robbed or getting jacked.  I had a good product.  I gave extra.  If they didn't have all the money to buy the drugs, I would give it to them on consignment, though they had to pay me a higher price for getting it on consignment compared to buying it outward for cra- for cash.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it worked to my advantage.
Story_ID: 534104
Speaker 1: You did all of the cooking yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't always cook.  I used to buy it already cooked from my connections in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] at first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, again, now, when I started hearing about how crack [crack cocaine] was made and how you step on it and stretch it, I said to myself--I'm going to L.A., was paying eighteen thousand five hundred dollars for a kilo of crack cocaine, which is thirty-six ounces.  So then I said, "You know what?  I need to learn how to cook it so I can get an extra thirty-six ounces for free."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's how all the boys in L.A. got so rich.  I mean, the guys I knew in L.A. were multimillionaires.  I mean, these guys drove Ferraris, Testarossas [Ferrari Testarossa]; Porsches; Corniche Rolls Royce [Rolls Royce Corniche].  I mean, these were brothers from out of the hood, ghetto; straight from the projects: Nickerson Gardens [Los Angeles, California], Imperial Courts [Los Angeles, California]; from The Jungle [Baldwin Village] out at South Central L.A., who became millionaires.  When I say millionaires, I'm talking about five, ten, fifteen, twenty million, easy.  And I said to myself, "That's the level I wanted to be on."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I never thought small.  I always thought big.  So eventually I learned how to cook by watching other people cook.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And started cooking it myself, and I said, "Okay.  Now, I'm really going to take this market in San Diego [California] 'cause now I can drop my prices way lower than everyone else."  'Cause San Diego was about ten years behind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of everyone down there, there's only a few people in San Diego who knew how to cook.  And I, when I started cooking my own stuff, then my profit margin just jumped through the roof.
Story_ID: 534105
Speaker 1: Now, your mother [June Giles Henderson] saw all of this money coming into the house, and, of course, your sister Junell [Junell Henderson] saw all of this money--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) coming into the house.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well--
Speaker 1: How did you account for it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my mother eventually got saved and gave her life to the Lord and--at a Pentecostal church and whatnot.  And my mother, we're all living in a one bedroom apartment.  My mother slept in the room.  Me and my sister had a corner group and we slept in the living room.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And at that time I had bought another car, a '78 [1978] root beer brown Cadillac that my mother cosigned for me.  I always kept a job.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I always kept a job.  During my early parts in my drug career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eventually I had to quit because I was just making too much money.  I couldn't focus, didn't want to be there 'cause when I got the check, I had it--my glove box was just piled up with paychecks from work.  I didn't take the time to go cash them 'cause--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I really didn't want--need the money, it was so minimal.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.  And my mother knew I was into something.  My mother thought I was nickel and diming.  She said, "I know this boy is out there doing something," and, you know.  And she eventually had put me out of the house.  And Junell was still at home and she was, you know, stashing and holding money for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the one time I came by to see Moms and I gave my mom, like, ten thousand dollars.  And she was, like, "My god." You know, "Where the hell you get this money from?"  I said, "Mom, this is what I'm doing."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know.  And she became blinded.  I went and bought her a new IROC Z28 Camaro truck; took her to Hawaii, bought her and her friends tickets; she went to Detroit [Michigan]; went to Canada; shopping sprees.  You know I would go to the mall, we'd spend five to six thousand dollars; she was able to quit one of her jobs; I moved her into a better apartment in Lemon Grove [California]; and she had everything she wanted, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Junell, bought her her first new car, a Mazda 626 [Mazda Capella], and my sister eventually started driving me back and forth from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], San Diego [California], helped me count money and she became corrupted; my whole family did.
Story_ID: 534106
Speaker 1: You had this growing business.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Very successful business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --going.  Where, where did you slip up?
Speaker 2: Well, I broke one of the taboos of a drug dealer, as you don't do business on a holiday, especially on Sunday, the Lord's Day.  Never done anything on Sunday.  It was a day of relaxation.  And, if you notice, a lot of gangbangers and drug dealers always had these big crosses--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on their neck like they're going to be spared from God for sinning, you know.  And really it's just that I believe that the crosses were--these guys wore these crosses and one day they was gonna have to answer.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then I didn't realize that until later in life.  I had a guy who transported some drugs from San Diego [California] to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] for me.  I had bought some drugs from a guy in L.A. because my connection was out and it was bad.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I went to cook it and it wouldn't gel together.  It kept breaking up in little beads.  And normally when you cook crack cocaine, you boil it with H2O, and it's a medium high heat.  And I don't want to talk about the total ingredient--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but as it simmers, it gels together.  It's like a liquid cloud, a liquid gel form that's bubbling in the H20.  And once it comes together, it drops to the bottom.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And this dope I had bought didn't do that.  It separated in millions of little pieces.  It was a fifteen thousand dollar investment I had bought this.  And the only reason why I went and bought is because so many people depended on me to continue to supply them so they could--it was their livelihood.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I didn't work during the holidays 'cause I had money, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so I told this guy, I said, "Listen," his name was Sweet, "I need to return this dope to L.A.  I want you to drive it in this car, and I'm going to take one of my custom cars to L.A. to get fixed."  And I let him use my girlfriend's car.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And it was a Nissan Sentra.  And this kid was a young, dark-skinned brother, and he smoked weed and he was a promising hustler.  You know, I had groomed him and taught him a lot of things.  And he was transporting the drugs to L.A., and we're going to the San Onofre border checkpoint [San Clemente Border Patrol Station, San Clemente, California]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and got pulled over; secondary inspection.  And I was looking through my rearview mirror.  I was driving my custom '64 [1964] Chevy convertible.  And I looked back and they had the footlocker bag sitting on the trunk of the car and had him up against the car like this.  And now they found the drugs, and there was fifty thousand dollars in cash as well.  So it started the whole investigation into my downfall.  And inside the glove box were bills of mine to my house; water bill, cable bill.  I just recently had a custom built three story house in Dictionary Hills [sic. Dictionary Hill] down in Spring Valley [California] overlooking lake--Sweetwater lake [Sweetwater Reservoir].  And once the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] arrested him and went through all the evidence--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they see, "Ah, [HistoryMaker] Jeff Henderson."  And then the car belonged to my girlfriend who worked for the police department at the time as a meter maid.  So this created--this locked in a whole conspiracy.  And after he got arrested and was indicted and was facing a lot of time, he decided to roll over on me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he turned over on me, and they came and picked me up a year later and indicted me for conspiracy with intent to distribute a controlled substance.
Story_ID: 534107
Speaker 1: And so they charged you, you went to jail.
Speaker 2: Went to jail, federal prison.  And I fought my case for eleven months.  And I took a gamble, and I didn't take a deal and fought my case all the way to the end.  It went to jury trial, was found guilty and sentenced to nineteen and a half years; 245 months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you started serving that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After that, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year we're talking about now?
Speaker 2: Eighty--'88 [1988] is when I went in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And '89 [1989]--September--no, not in September--October eight--September--October of 1989, I was found guilty--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and sent to Terminal Island federal prison [Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island] in San Pedro [Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to begin this twenty year sentence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So during--now, you are in jail.  You're walking in.  You're still a young boy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it like entering a federal pen for the first time?
Speaker 2: Well, it was scary because, you know, I'd never done no time.  I was a master at getting away from the police and not getting caught and really focused on my survival in the streets.  And here I was this skinny, little, light-skinned, high yellow boy from the streets--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and never was a--I wasn't a gangster, I was a hustler.  Wasn't a fighter, you know.  I was always a peacemaker.  I always was the guy who can talk my way out of something or, you know, was able to smooth, operate, do things.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And here I was on this chain gang of six different other convicts, and the marshals had dropped us off.  And my stomach started knotting up as I started seeing these gun towers.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I was, like, you know, nervous; almost diarrhea-ing on myself; peed on myself; everything.  And so as we were--they were bringing us out the van, I was shackled from my feet down and around my waist, like this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we were like little penguins, marching our way in to these big steel gates and fences of barbed wire and all this radio chatter from guards and doors slamming.  And we got in, and here I am, I'm real frail, you know.  I'm nervous and no appetite.  And I started to poking my little chest out to see--like if I was buffed, 'cause I'm going in this prison, and I just start thinking about television, like, these guys are going to rape me, I'm going to get beat down, they're gonna, you know, do something to me in there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I was scared to death.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And as we came onto the prison compound, which was a north yard, every Thursday is receiving day, inmate receiving day.  So all the convicts on the yard like to come up to the front to see who's coming on the yard.  And here I am going, I'm nervous, I'm trying to look hard.  I got my poker face on, mean mugging, you know.  And all I heard was, "Jeff [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson], Hardhead."  They used to call me Hardhead.  T-Row gave me that name Hardhead from the streets.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: "Hardhead Jeff."  I'm looking around, I knew half of them jokers on the yard.  So then my--
Speaker 1: So they were from San Diego [California]?
Speaker 2: All over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Long Beach [California]; guys I grew up with.  You know, sometimes you just don't see someone, and probably in your life somebody probably went off to college or went off to the [U.S.] military; that's why you haven't seen them.  But in my world, they were all locked up in prison.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and I felt comfortable.  I was saying, "I'm home.  This is the neighborhood here."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.  So after I got into receiving upstairs, and I went to the traditional investigation and interviewing process by the lieutenant--they let me--released me to the compound, and they had a care package for me.  Usually when new inmates come to prison, if you know guys, they give you a care package; soap, toothpaste, toothbrush and chips.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some Ritz crackers or something, just to hold you over; book of stamps until you start getting your, your stuff in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was at home, man.  You know, I knew half the people (laughter) in the prison there.  So that was a good feeling.
Story_ID: 534108
Speaker 1: You started to look at things a little bit different in there [Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California].  And tell us how you started to look at things a little bit different even though you were surrounded by friends--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there.
Speaker 2: It was different for me, because it was a culture shock.  It was in a whole new world.  I had to learn how to do time, 'cause at first the time was doing for me--doing me.  I was bitter at the world.  I hated white people.  I hated my mom [June Giles Henderson].  I hated Jesus.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I blamed everyone but myself.  And it wasn't 'til several years later that I started really accepting responsibility and the whole redemption saga set in.  I had to go through trials and error, and I experimented with everything.  I, I had to expose myself to so many different things.  So there were circumstances and situations and experiences throughout my early part of my incarceration that really brought about change in my life.  And it kind of much was like a Malcolm X effect.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, there were, you know, Neo-Nazis on the yard.  There were Mexican mafia.  There was Crips, Bloods; there were members of the Nation of Islam, were strong in prison; the Black Muslims; the Sunni sect orthodox Muslims were mostly African American in prison as well.  Then you had Christian groups.  You had radical Christians.  You had Jehovah Witnesses [Jehovah's Witnesses].  You had atheists. You had people from all walks of life.  And, you know, I began to get exposed to different things that I never was--it was foreign to me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Then you had members of the BLA, the Black Liberation Army, who operated in the South during the civil rights era, who smuggled guns from Mexico to defend themselves against the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and racist people during that period.  You had the Pan-African brothers in prison.  You know, just a whole ocean of everything.  And one thing about prison, everyone is trying to build their sects in prison--they're crews; they're not gangs, but organizations--bigger.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So everybody was vying for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, the Crips, the Bloods, the Nation of Islam, the Christians; everyone.  I've been a Christian my whole life based on what I knew--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --about Christianity.  But I felt Christianity let me down, because they allowed, you know, the criminal justice system to give me, you know, twenty years in prison.
Story_ID: 534109
Speaker 1: So one of the things that really started me thinking was the Nation of Islam and how--I always knew--heard about these guys.  I used to see them on the street corners selling bean pies and papers.  And we used to make fun of them, you know.  And the girls I used to run with was like, "Man, these some fine brothers, but I don't know what they doing standing on the corner selling bean pies and papers."  'Cause, you know, they're very disciplined and well groomed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --suited up and everything.  So there used to be a brother by the name of Eddie X and Kevin X in the Nation.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they used to always be recruiting and trying to get the young brothers to come up to the mosque on Sundays to watch Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] tapes and Dr. Khalil Muhammad [sic. Khalid Abdul Muhammad] tapes and tapes on the most Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  And I didn't (shrugs shoulders)--I said, "Man, I'm not with that.  You know, miss with that," 'cause they was on the prison yard with their shirts buttoned up.  They didn't have the bow ties, but they were able to button their shirts up, very disciplined, shoe shine.  One of the things that really impressed me about them, they would always address me as brother.  And I never used the word brother before until I went to prison.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And one day after I got off a visit, I decided--I said, "Let me go up here and see what these guys are talking about."  And I went up there and sat in a class, and the brothers were posted up at the door, very disciplined military style.  And they came in, and they had prayer. And I always prayed, you know, on my hands and knees, and my head down. And they pray with their hands open, and they would always say, "In the name of Allah, the most merciful.  I bear witness that there was no god but Allah."  And I didn't say it, because I'm like, "I never--I don't know who Allah is, and I'm not praying to something I don't know what that is," you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then they popped in the tape of Minister Farrakhan.  He started talking about the black man is God, and we had civilizations before we came to the wilderness in North America. And you should love your brother and love your woman and respect her.  But then he started talking about how the white man was the devil, and how he systematically mixed his blood with the black man, and that's why we have light-skinned, dark skin, and how, you know, it's his fault that the black man's imprisoned.  They bring the drugs and the guns, and all that stuff became interesting. And then when he said that "When I say the white man was a devil, it wasn't that I don't mean with horns and he's down in hell, but I mean--."  Then he brought the dictionary out, and he says, "Black man, look up devil."  And it says a devil in the dictionary was wicked and a murder and a killer.  And then draw a comparison to the slave trade and all the atrocities that were committed against black people in this country, and how we got here. All of that was foreign to me, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock].  I never knew anything about history and slavery and all--I was inferior my whole life.  And I always felt lower than white people, or lower than everyone else. So it really caught my attention, and I started listening more, listening more.  And I didn't have an opinion at that time.  And then one of the brothers, Kevin X, he was a lieutenant, and he used to come by my bunk and read to me all the time.  And he gave me a book called, 'Message to the Blackman' ['Message to the Blackman in America'] by the most Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and I didn't really want to read it, 'cause I wasn't convinced right them. But I used to just start thinking about, you know, who did bring the drugs, and, you know, why am I high yellow, you know?  Why don't I have my original name? You know.  Why did we have to--why did we work for four hundred years in bondage without pay?  You know, the whole nine yards, and then I just, you know, I wanted more.  And in this book, I just started reading more and more.  And then there was other books who were brought to me by other inmates in prison.  Another brother who was a Black Liberation [Black Liberation Army] member, Imze, he wore dreadlocks.  He gave me a book called 'Black Men: Obsolete, Single and Dangerous?' ['Black Men: Obsolete, Single, Dangerous? The Afrikan American Family in Transition'] by [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti; and another book by Chancellor Williams, 'The Destruction of Black Civilization' [The Destruction of Black Civilization: Great Issues of a Race from 4500 B.C. to 2000 A.D.'].  And then there was another book that really, really opened eyes by Dr. Ivan Van Sertima of Rutgers college in New Jersey [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], called, 'They Came Before Columbus' ['They Came Before Columbus: The African Presence in Ancient America,' Ivan Van Sertima].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it showed the big Olmec heads down in South America, to where the Indians [Native American] had big lips.  They did these sculptures of big lips and noses of their African trading partners, where he talked about how Africans were trading with the native people in the Americas way before Columbus [Christopher Columbus] and Veppici [sic. Amerigo Vespucci]--what do you--the other guy who helped discover America.  And I was, like, "Wow.  That makes sense."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Like, wow.  And, you know, the pyramids, and we had civilizations and stuff.  So that was building my self-esteem up.  So now I'm like I'm proud to be black.  I'm proud to be a brother.  And, you know, and I started reading the dictionary, went to school and got my GED [General Educational Development], and my vocabulary started changing.  I started hanging less with the brotherhood--the homeboys on the yard.  And I started taking flak from the guys that I was on the streets with. Like, "Man, why you hanging around them brothers for, man?  Why you--you know, they talking that madness and foolishness."  But I was learning.  But I never ever was able to embrace the religious aspect of the Nation of Islam.  I knew in my heart that I was still a Christian. But the social component of the Nation, I really, really grasped, and I really believed that that was one of the key areas that really got me to love myself and to love my people. Then I realized at that point I could never sell crack [crack cocaine] or could be an advocate for gangs and stuff ever again.
Story_ID: 534110
Speaker 1: But it wasn't until later, too, I was growing--I was ordering all these books.  Dr. Frances Cress Welsing, Dr. Ben [HistoryMaker Yosef ben-Jochannan], and Dr. Maulana Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga]. And, you know, I cofounded--I was a chairman of the black cultural workshop, the BCW.  I founded a black think tank in prison.  When we brought the brightest minds together, we debated religions, current events, politics, race, the whole nine.  And then I became friends with the white inmates.  These guys were Wall Street business moguls and CEOs of companies, and stockbrokers; and I became friends with them.  And they, "Hey, Jeff [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson], you know, you're a smart guy, man.  You know, why you hang around some of those guys?"  Like, "What do you mean?" I said.  And you know, he said, "Well, you know, there's something different about you."  And they started--in prison, you have the black TV room, the white TV room, the Latinos have a TV room.  And the white guys invited me into their TV room, and they exposed me to '60 Minutes,' '20/20,' 'Primetime Live' ['Primetime'].  My favorite news show was the 'McNeil NewsHour' ['The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour'; 'PBS NewsHour'].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They're not on that much now.  I don't think they're on anymore.
Speaker 2: Yes, they are.
Speaker 1: But the original guy died--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --one of them.  Yes.
Speaker 2: He retired.
Speaker 1: Retired.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they were straight to the point.  Wasn't no fancy newsroom.  They were on point with everything.  So what happened was the white guys gave me a whole different perspective of life, because now I had the radicalism.  I understood the black culture.  Now I'm understanding how society really works, understanding the difference between the haves and the have nots; difference between Republicans and Democrats; the difference between what I was able to understand now, that I knew marketing, I knew PR [public relations], I knew branding, I knew how to manage people because these were the sound bites that I heard from the white guys--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who taught business classes, and from reading USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Newsweek; you know.  These different news (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they were reading those types of materials while in prison?
Speaker 1: Yes.  While in prison.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they taught classes, educational classes in prison.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I joined--and they even had their own chapter of Toastmasters International.  And I eventually joined that and became the sergeant of arms [sic. sergeant at arms] to where I started working on my speaking ability and improving my vocabulary as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I knew then that I was on to something.  I said, "Man, you know, I'm smart."  And it was the white boys in prison who told me that I was smart, though the brothers did too in their own way, you know.  But I was growing because I knew that, you know, the knowledge I got of self, the knowledge of culture and history that I didn't hate white people.  It's that I came to understand them, and I knew that they had a superior knowledge, worldly knowledge than our people.  And most of the brothers that I was dealing with in prison, they had a great wealth of knowledge, but it was only one side of complete knowledge.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I knew I needed that other piece of knowledge that the white people had in order to be complete--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to have--find my own way and develop my own mission in life.  And that's what I got from them.
Story_ID: 534111
Speaker 1: Let me just go back a little ways because of something that you had said earlier.  And I did not want to interrupt that, because I felt that was a very important part in explaining how you've traveled this road.  But, you said they--when you got into prison and you--everyone knew you, and because of your marketing abilities, everyone bought from you.  What were you selling in prison?
Speaker 2: In prison?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Actually a bit--we definitely need to go back to that part.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I eventually was--you know, education became very addictive to me.  Knowledge and information became addictive to me.  It was like a drug.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, and I was always hanging out in the law library and the study room.  And I was messing up on my job.  I used to be on the Cadillac crew where we swept cigarette butts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I wasn't going to my section.  And I guess that day the lieutenant came by and he looked at my section and it was loaded with cigarette butts and trash.  And I was fired and I was put in the kitchen of pots and pans.  And it's an area where most people go to when they in trouble.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But the education became--I became, like, a--you heard of the term jackers on the street?
Speaker 1: I have (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When they started carjacking.  Remember that big thing was going on a while back?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Yes.   Yes.
Speaker 2: Where they come jack you for your car while you're in line for McDonald's?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I became an intellectual jacker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I sourced out knowledge, intellectual, intelligent men, and I tapped into their, their resources.  And I wanted to learn more about politics.  And one of the most profound books I read in prison was by Harry Kissinger, and it was called 'Foreign Affairs' [sic. 'American Foreign Policy,' Henry Kissinger].
Speaker 1: Henry or Harry?
Speaker 2: Henry Kissinger.
Speaker 1: Henry Kissinger (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  He used to be secretary of state for Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon]?
Speaker 1: Under Nixon.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Nixon.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that's when I really, really started seeing how government worked, because I always wondered, now, what the hell are we all over in everybody's country for?  I saw this about the diamonds, the oil, natural resources; that it was the power of the world.  And I was, like, I get it now.  I understand about the Contra [Iran-Contra affair], the drugs, the weapons, and the oil business and all the way up today about the Middle East, and, you know, Africa.  I understand about the country used to be called Rhodes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Do they have--
Speaker 1: Rhodesia.
Speaker 2: Rhodesia.  Named after the Rhodes scholar people [Cecil John Rhodes] and how it's really the Congo.  Correct?
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: And how all the rubber--the country was raped of it.  I mean it was just like, man--it was like--man, I was in college, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock].  I'm telling you. After my third year, I didn't want to get out.
Speaker 1: I hear you.
Speaker 2: I was learn- I was, like, why didn't they give me this in school?  You know.
Story_ID: 534112
Speaker 1: I think we're at a very, very important point I wanted you to continue.  You are in prison [Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California] now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you are learning, as you say, the complete side from these white businessmen who are in for white collar crimes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And from these brothers who were in for lesser crimes or other crimes--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and so forth.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what were you learning?  That's what we were talking about.
Speaker 2: From the white collar criminals?
Speaker 1: From both sides.
Speaker 2: From both sides.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, from the brotherhood in prison, from the black inmates who were conscious, the intellectual, historian imprisoned, I learned the knowledge of self, which was foreign to me.  I understood the poverty part to some degree, but I didn't understand why--I was able to understand why black people in America was living in such despair.  And I knew the root of it was knowledge.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Which equals education, you know, which equals information.  And I was able to get that in prison.  That part from them helped solidify me as a black man and be able to build my self-esteem, to love my people; not just my people but all mankind.  And what I got from the white intellectuals in prison was the worldly knowledge.  I had--it was the missing piece.  On this side I had the radicalism.  I had the black power.  I had the black consciousness.  I had the black pride.  I had the brotherhood and that.  But I needed this part here to become complete to be able to function in society and break that cycle of generational poverty not in my family, but all the lives that I strive to touch today.  And the white guys taught me is that:  you're smart, you have the astute of a businessman, that you were selling drugs, you managed people, you understood branding, you understood public relations, you worked in a hostile and dangerous environment, and you were able to survive.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And he says, "The difference--the only difference between the drug dealer and a successful Wall Street business mogul is the product and sometimes integrity.  It's the product and how one conducts business."  And at that point, I knew that I can take any product and sell it.  I can manage people.  I can become successful as my white counterparts.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that was the mission after I became passionate about the trade that I do today, which is cooking and a chef.  And besides, when I'm not in the kitchen, you know, working with young people and educate--I consider myself an educator; I'm a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I even have a degree.  A self-proclaimed degree.  I have a Ph.D. in streetology.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And you can pass it on to other kids.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And even to the educated folks who don't have the street part.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 534113
Speaker 1: Let's visit you now.  You were, as you put it, fired from sweeping [cigarette] butts.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they put you into pots and pans.
Speaker 2: Put me in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there were several lights that came on in the kitchen.  For one, I was able to--I realized, you know, being in the kitchen you got the leftover food.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So for one, I got to eat better than other inmates.  An eventually I realized there were other prisoners in the kitchen who felt they were punished.  Where they saw a punishment, I saw an opportunity.  And I was fascinated by these big kitchens.  You know, inside of Terminal Island [Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California] kitchen, there were little kitchens within a big kitchen.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The sally port where all the food came in and was inspected by the guards.  Then you had a big bakery, where the white guys controlled the bakery.  They did all the baking of the breads, the pies, the cakes; they fried the donuts.  And I always would smell those sweets all the way down to the dish room, because I've always been fascinated with sweets.  My [paternal] grandmother [Ethel Dunn Henderson] was the only one in our family who had a cookie jar.  And my grandmother always kept the cookie jar full.  And the cookies came from little Jewish bakeries up in Jew town, up on Wilshire [Boulevard], where my grandfather [Charles Henderson, Sr.] cleaned Mr. Charlie's bakery and deli.  And he would swipe cookies from there and fill up that cookie jar.  And growing up, we never had a cake stand in the house.  We never had just cakes sitting on the table.  Moms [June Giles Henderson] never baked them.  My sister [Junell Henderson] didn't.  So we got cakes on birthdays and holidays, you know.  So I was very fascinated by that kitchen, that bakery and smelling those breads and those, you know, upside- pineapple upside down cakes and German chocolate cakes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And eventually I would hang out in there, and I would watch the guys bake.  And I would see how they would work the dough and cut out the donuts and fry them and flip them with the wooden sticks, and make those piecrusts and take their fingers and put the little dents around and caramelize those apples and peaches.  And then the butcher shop.  Became fascinated how inside the prison kitchen they would lock the inmates in these cages, and they would have the knives that were chained to the table; how they would butcher the meats, so they couldn't cut the guard.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They couldn't do anything but cut themselves.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then the littlest kitchen they had in the big kitchen was a Jewish kitchen, which was called the kosher kitchen, where they prepared special meals and had these special kosher TV dinners for Jewish inmates.  And I was fascinated.
Story_ID: 534114
Speaker 1: Then there was a guy by the name of Big Roy.  He was the chief inmate cook.  Big Roy was the only inmate who didn't wear a prison white shirt because he was so large and he would sweat, you know, from his brow all the way down his shirt.  And Big Roy commanded that kitchen like a four star general.  And he managed all the meats and the vegetables.  And eventually Big Roy took me up under his wing.
Speaker 2: All right.  I don't think we mentioned the name of that federal penitentiary.
Speaker 1: Terminal Island [Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Terminal Island.
Speaker 1: Federal prison in San Pedro [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Go back in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: So Roy--Big Roy--
Speaker 1: Big Roy.  Yes.
Speaker 2: --took you under his wing.
Speaker 1: Took me under his wing.
Speaker 2: What was that like?
Speaker 1: It was intimidating at first.  Big Roy was--during Black History Month and Juneteenth--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or something--
Speaker 2: Big Roy was an African American?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  He was African American, and he was the chief inmate cook.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was a big guy, too.  Very intimidating.  But he was soft as cotton, though, deep inside.  But he carried a big stick, you know.  And he had the confidence of the prison officials, and he put passion into the food.  He made sure everything was seasoned, and he put that Southern spin on most of the food.  And it was during Juneteenth or Black History Month--I can't recall--that we had catfish, fried chicken, and cornbread and succotash, and all the southern trimmings that Grandma [Henderson's paternal grandmother, Ethel Dunn Henderson] used to make.  And I helped him clean chicken.  And I moved fast in the kitchen, and, you know, he took a liking to me.  Some of the other inmates did.  And eventually I came to work with Big Roy for a short period.  But it wasn't until I left T.I. that my cooking skills really took flight.  But I was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't until you left Terminal Island?
Speaker 1: Left Terminal Island.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Some years later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this: when Big Roy took you under his wing, you were no longer in pots and pans?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And what was some of the assignments Big Roy saw that you got as far as cooking?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Blanching vegetables and stirring the stews.  And, 'cause you know, stews, in order to thicken them, you put a starch--a thickener-- in there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And if you don't stir it, it'll clump up.  And I used to--steel--have this big metal pole with a whisk on the end or a paddle.  And I would, you know, stir these big, giant kettles of soups and stocks and, you know, gravies, and all these different things.  In prison, they were main prison staples.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Breakfast, grits and oatmeal every day.  And gravy and biscuits.  Old Sam Milton [ph.] would shit on a shingle. And we had it every single day.  And I guess we--now I understand food, is that it fills inmates up, you know.  The grits continue to swell in your belly.  So does oatmeal.  So I got good in making those things.  And I learned--I understood--learned the fundamentals.  But I also learned--picked up bad habits, because none of the guys in the kitchen were professionally trained chefs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we learned as we go.  You know, we got creative in ways of how we prepared, you know, certain foods.  But we always were under the watchful eyes of prison guards.
Story_ID: 534115
Speaker 1: Was it at Terminal Island [Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California] that you learned to cook things like sea bass and fried--southern fried chicken and so forth?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually, I didn't learn anything about sea bass until after I got out of prison.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After three or four years at T.I., I was transferred to a lower level security prison called Nellis [Federal Prison Camp, Nellis Air Force Base], which was here in Las Vegas [Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where I met my second mentor, chef cook mentor, was Friendly Womack [Friendly Womack, Jr.].  He's the eldest brother of Bobby Womack.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he's the one who really, really taught me the fundamentals of cooking.  Friendly was a little messy in the kitchen.  He used to always sing when he was in the kitchen.  I don't know if you remember this song.  It was way before my time.  You may remember.  It's an old song that goes (singing),  "Don't let the green grass fool you.  Oh, no.  Don't let it fool you.  Don't let it change your mind," ['Don't Let the Green Grass Fool You'].  (Laughter) Friendly used to always sing this song in there.  Friendly was--he had fun with the food.  He brought joy to the kitchen.  And it was a lower level security, so there was no prison fences and gun towers and a lot of guards.  And we used prison military recipes.  And Friendly taught me one of my first signature dishes that I learned was fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And right today, you can find that fried chicken at my cafe [Cafe Bellagio] at the Bellagio [Bellagio Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada].  And I nicknamed it after him, Friendly fried chicken.  It's a jailhouse recipe.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It's the best fried chicken you can get in America (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) The--I'm sure, because of your behavior--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you were transferred to a lower security prison.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I also had good behavior, too.  And I was fortunate in the period in my sentence why I had my sentence reduced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Originally had nineteen and a half years sentence and had it reduced to, I think, twelve years, seven months--no; ten years, seven months.  So I served almost nine years and a couple of months off the twenty-year sentence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you're in Vegas.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At a lower level prison.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're working with Friendly.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What else is he teaching you besides southern fried chicken?
Speaker 2: Well, he's teaching all kinds of things.  Taught me how to make lasagna and biscuits and omelets.  I became an omelet grill master.  And Friendly--I used to be--more attention to detail when I cooked.  And we didn't make omelets in omelet pans.  We would take--Friendly taught me how to take eggs and pour them on a whole flat top, then I would just throw cheddar cheese and mushrooms and omelets on there and take that spatula and make these lines as the eggs cooked.  And I would do, like, maybe fifteen, twenty omelets at a time.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And Friendly, he taught me how to make the grill talk to me and not be intimidated by, you know, the grease popping.  And Friendly would in and chop, chop, chop, chop, chop these omelets.  "Next."  And then I started calling the omelets down.  "Inmate Such and Such.  What kind of omelet can I get for you for the military?"  And I was whipping them out left and right.  So I became very--one of the skills I had in the kitchen was very organized.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was very focused and I was very passionate about every dish I put out.  And I learned that from Big Roy.  I learned that from Friendly.  You know, it was flavor first.  You know, flavor first had to be there.  And Friendly always kept the chicken wings back, because that's how he tests his fried chicken batch.  You know how you season the flour, you season the chicken.  And you would fry it first, and you pop that wing off there.  "Henderson [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson], come on, man.  We need a little more salt, a little more pepper, a little cayenne," you know.  And we would tweak that flour, and we would make a big batch so the chicken would stay consistent.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So--and that's how we perfected the Friendly fried chicken.  But he cooked.  He taught me everything, you know.  He taught me how to work the equipment and, you know, the steamers, the kettles and the ovens; and how sometimes the ovens cooked at a certain heat temperatures, certain areas of the oven; had to turn and rotate the cornbread and different things like that, so.
Story_ID: 534116
Speaker 1: There came a period when you went to several bases, U.S. military bases--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --and cooked. And tell us about that period.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, after a while, I was there at Nellis [Federal Prison Camp, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada], I heard about a culinary program at Maxwell Air Force Base, another prison camp down in Maxwell, Alabama [sic. Montgomery, Alabama].  And by that time, I had ordered me in a lot of the cookbooks from the Culinary Institute of America, New York [Hyde Park, New York], and got information; and from Johnson and Wales [Johnson and Wales University, Providence, Rhode Island], L.A. Trade Tech [Los Angeles Trade Technical College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But Friendly [Friendly Womack, Jr.] passed his time cooking in the kitchen.  Big Roy passed his time cooking the chicken--in the kitchen.  Me?  I looked at it as an opportunity.  I got good.  And people started praising me for my food.  After Friendly, I became the chief inmate cook.  So I ran the kitchen.  And I said, "You know, this is something I think I'm going to try my hand at."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I said, "I really want to take it to the next level."  And I put in for a transfer.  My case worker had me transferred down to Maxwell, Alabama.  And down there, I got a job in a kitchen working as, like, a cook three.  I wasn't the man down there, because most of the inmates had their kitchen on lockdown, pretty much.  They had it sewed up.  And before I got into the culinary program the warden had canceled it, 'cause one of the inmates wind up having an affair with one of the culinary instructors from the culinary school on the outside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I got stuck down there for about six months and worked the kitchen down there for a little while, and eventually got transferred back to Nellis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In Las Vegas [Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're back and--you--Friendly was finally discharged?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was discharged.
Story_ID: 534117
Speaker 1: And stayed at Nellis [Federal Prison Camp, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada] for a little while and eventually put in for a transfer to go up to Sheridan, Oregon--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) where I eventually got released from prison in 1996.  And up there, I went up there to partake in a drug treatment program.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And in this drug treatment program, if you pass the program, you get out early--a year earlier on your sentence.  So I was able to work another year off my sentence by taking the drug treatment program.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I did something that I'm not proud of, and I lied to the case worker and told them that I used to use in order to get into this nine month program.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But I really wanted to get out.  And I really wanted to get up to Sheridan to get this year off my sentence.  But the program really, really helped me, because I got to really understand the effect and the psychological mindset that drug users had.  And they had criminal lifestyle programs, and they had anger management.  So I really grew from that particular program.  And I had an educator by the name of Alan Hershman.  And I call him Mr. H., the most passionate prison educator in the system.  And I learned in that class to really, really take a look at myself in the mirror and accept responsibility, and totally get off the victim bandwagon.  And up there I had the opportunity to work in the bakery.  And this is where my baking skills and pastry skills took flight.  And I ordered more baking books from the outside.  And I was the chief inmate baker up there, so I was running my own bakery cooking for thousands of inmates every day, baking.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And just to set the record straight--in fact, though, you h- never had used drugs--
Speaker 1: No.  Never (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) or drinks.
Speaker 1: Never drank alcohol.  I never done drugs in my life.  Cocaine, marijuana or anything.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was a--my addiction was the money.  My addiction was the lifestyle, the status.  My addiction was to get my family out of the hood.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Never used.
Story_ID: 534118
Speaker 1: So as I remember, you went in in 1988--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and here we are in 1996.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so far it's eight years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you go into the drug program--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as you said, to take off another year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now you're down to, what, nine years--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to go?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No.  Actually, when I got released--actually, I went in 1988.  I got out in 1996.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But I actually spent six months in a halfway house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On home arrest.  And then I was on federal parole for three years, probation for three years.  So it's right close around nine years all together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Plus the first eleven months, I spent in fighting my case as well before I was sentenced.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.  They gave you the credit for that time.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: The--now, you go to Sheridan [Oregon], you spend a year there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you're released on probation.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Into a halfway house.
Speaker 1: Into a halfway house.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are you doing in the halfway house?
Speaker 2: Well, prior to my release from prison, I started writing letters to potential employers on the outside.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And an article came across the desk of Mr. Hershman [Alan Hershman] from the USA Today about the top African American chefs in the country.  At the time, it was Patrick Clark, [HistoryMaker] Marcus Samuelsson and Robert Gadsby.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I started writing letters to Robert Gadsby, because he was opening up his namesake restaurant in Beverly Hills [California] at 672 Wilshire Boulevard in La Brea [Los Angeles, California].  And none of them answered me.  And I used to write a letter saying, "My name is [HistoryMaker] Jeff Henderson.  I'm formerly incarcerated and I'm looking for an opportunity once released from prison."  And no one ever responded. So I had a game plan.  I was focused.  I had my mission set.  I was going to become a top chef.  When I read that article about those top African American chefs, I realized then that African American chefs cooked other food than soul food.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I said--that's when I started learning about the sea basses and all the fancy foods from Europe, the foie gras, and all the bok choys, and loup de mer, and black bass, and scallops and lobster.  I never had those things in my life.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I set my sight on going to work in Beverly Hills.  And I went to--after I got out into the halfway house, I put my pre-release plan together, made my way up to Robert's restaurant.  And I had to go there for a month.  Before then, I threw trash for the City of Glendale [California] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --temporary agency.  And then eventually he hired me as a dishwasher.  And he was a black man.  I had to convince him that I was worthy and capable of the job, because he had bad experiences hiring young black males.  So I was the first in last out. And I proved to him that I was worthy and capable of the job.  And he took me under his wing.  He taught me how to wash dishes the right way.  He taught me how to use knives and how to cut, how to butcher, how to make desserts, how to make pastry, saute, grill.  And I worked my way all the way up to pastry cook and eventually line cook.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But not only did he teach me how to cook, he taught me the rest of the part that I needed to survive outside.  He taught me how to survive in Corporate America.  When I came out of prison, I was pretty bulked up from lifting weights, and I didn't learn how to smile, and I was still a little hardened.  You know, I was institutionalized a little, but I had issues with claustrophobia.  I had issues with anger.  I had anger management issues.  I had--I didn't like to be around crowds of people, you know.  So I had issues, you know, when I first came home.  And Robert humbled me.  And he taught me how to interact with corporate white males.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he groomed me, you know.  And he said, "Jeff, you know, you need to get rid of the goatee."  And I cut the goatee off of my face, and clean shaved, and took makeup and covered my earring hole up and I straightened up the way I walked and learned how to sit up in a chair and tightened my--even though my vocabulary was pretty good, I had to polish it and learn the corporate lingo, the corporate sound bites; you know, the things that sound off that corporate people want to hear; passion, drive, focus, career track. You know, all these different things, and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and it helped me, you know, especially after I left Robert and I went in to work in the big hotels.
Story_ID: 534119
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the first hotel that you worked in?
Speaker 1: The first hotel was Marriott [Los Angeles Airport Marriott, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Not here, but in Los Angeles [California] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In LAX [Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California].  LAX Marriott.  And I tried to get a job at every hotel on that strip, and they would turn me down because of--I had no work history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: When you say the strip, you mean Century Boulevard?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Century Boulevard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  On that whole Century Boulevard strip there.  The Westin [Westin Los Angeles Airport, Los Angeles, California], Sheraton [Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel, Los Angeles, California], Hilton [Hilton Los Angeles Airport, Los Angeles, California]; everyone turned me down.  And then I put together a strategy.  Again, I had to go back to my street senses, you know; how to survive. Build relationships.  I said just knocking on doors is not good enough.  So I started going on recon missions.  And what I would do, I would go into the hotel and I would sit in the lobby or I would go around to the employee exit.  And I'd sit there and I waited until saw someone who I felt approachable.  And I saw a tall African American man who was the sous chef, the number two chef at hotels.  His name was Sterling Burpee.  And I rolled up on him, and I said, "Excuse me, sir.  My name is [HistoryMaker] Jeff Henderson.  I'm an aspiring cook, and I've really been trying hard to get a job at one of these hotels."  He says--yeah, I told him, I said, "You know, I don't want a handout.  I want to work."
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: "And I would appreciate an opportunity."   He says, "All right.  Have you filled out an application?"  I said, "No, sir."  He said, "I want you to fill out an application.  When you fill out this application, you call me and let me know it's in."  And I did.  And--but I told him, I said, "Listen.  There's something I need to let you know."  The first thing he says, "You have a record?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He kind of could tell a little bit 'cause I was, you know--most guys who go to jail, they lift weights and they're big up top--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but (laughter), they don't work out--we don't have no legs and no behind.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know.  So he spotted it right off, you know. And he worked some magic.  He got me in.  And he put me in the pastries.  And I really wanted to prove that I can do this.  And I wanted to make him proud of me that he didn't put his name out there and for me to come in and fake the work, you know, argumentative, can't work with the other people.  And I came in as a man on a mission.  And they were, you know, all the people who worked there were very proud of me.  And so he gave me that opportunity.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I did well.  After three months, I was doing so well, that Marriott bought a new property on Coronado Island [Coronado, California] in San Diego [San Diego County, California].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they sent me down as a taskforce to help open some new restaurants.  And I left LAX Marriott at three months and went to San Diego.  And I got an apartment down--at that time, you know, I had my--I was married.
Story_ID: 534120
Speaker 1: And I need to talk about I got married--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and stuff and got a family.  My first son was born, and I'm working at the Marriott [Coronado Island Marriott Resort and Spa, Coronado, California] down in San Diego [California].
Speaker 2: Let's go back to recapture that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Because, well, you're right.  We did skip that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Tell us about that first time that you met your, your wife.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Well, before she was my wife, she was a very interesting woman, a good woman, loving woman, very family oriented.  And my wife has traveled the world.  She comes from a very famous family.  Her mother was Mary Wells, the first female superstar of Motown Records.  And she was married to Cecil Womack, Bobby Womack's younger brother.  And at that time, he was in Sam Cooke's band.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she traveled the world.  And at that time, she had no children.  She was in a relationship, but it wasn't strong.  It wasn't one that she wanted to be with.  And prior to my release, I started writing letters to Friendly [Friendly Womack, Jr.], her uncle and his girlfriend, at the time, saying that, you know, "Listen.  I'm getting released.  I need some help, pretty much.  I need to find a job.  I need to get some shoes.  I need some clothes.  I want to go eat and I need a driver's license."  So I sent a picture.  And one of Friendly's nieces had came by his ex-girlfriend's house and saw a picture of me.  And Delores [ph.] was, like, promoting me.  Said, "Hey, this is my friend Jeff [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson].  He's in prison.  He's getting out soon."  And so she saw the picture and eventually Denise [ph.], the lady had told me earlier, she--in the past, she said that, "Oh, he's nice looking. I--."  She kind of felt sorry for me.  "I'll take him to buy him some shoes and get his driver's license."
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So we started writing each other and talking on the phone.  And I started sharing my vision and my passion to be a cook and stuff when I get out.  But also, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock], I want to go back to prison again--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --then come back here.  When I was in prison, after--I came--I went through this whole rebirth, this whole born again thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I cofounded a program called TAPS in Nellis [Federal Prison Camp, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada].  It was Teenage Awareness Program.  I started working with young kids in prison.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What--TAPS stands for?
Speaker 1: Teenage Awareness Program.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I wrote a proposal to the warden, and they allowed me to bring young kids in from the outside.  And I put together a panel of inmates with different criminal pedigrees who changed their lives.  And we talked to these young kids about choices and consequences.  And that became my mission as well, because I knew that in order for me to be successful in life and, not only that, I had a moral obligation to give back and fix the wrong that I've done.  So that became a major part of my mission.  Throughout the rest of my time in prison and in later years after I got out of the prison, I started giving back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I told Stacy [Stacy Womack Henderson] that that's what I wanted to do.  I needed to give back.  I needed to fix the wrong, because our--we, as a people, are always looking for solutions, organizations and mentors from educated people to fix our problems.  But I truly believe the only way we're going to fix the problem is bring back the people who broke it in the first place.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because the young people listen and respect the people who they model their lives after, the T-Rows [Thess Good]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the Richie Riches, the Boss Hog, the Jeff Hardheads [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson].  And I told her this is what I want to do.  And she wanted to help me, and we fell in love through the telephone and through letters. And I got released October the 2nd, 1996, and she flew up to Portland, Oregon, to pick me up, and we flew home on Alaskan Airlines.  And I never looked back.  And, you know, I came back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  She cooked me my first gourmet dinner in a halfway house.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She even brought champagne glasses, but she had apple cider in there.
Speaker 2: So she's a cook also?
Speaker 1: She's a good home cook.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't cook at home (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: That's her kitchen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Every now and then she'll call me in or she'll cook, and I'll come home and throw the side dishes together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I love my wife's cooking.  And everyone else is intimidated to cook for me, but she isn't.  She knows.  And she--my wife's vegetarian.  And she fries chicken for me and she hits it on point all the time.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What year were you married?
Speaker 1: I was married about a year after I was out, 1997.
Speaker 2: Seven [1997].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you have how many children?
Speaker 1: I have three children now.  My first born was Jeffery Jr. [Jeffrey Henderson, Jr.].  He's nine.  I have a daughter named Noel Marie [Noel Henderson].  She's seven.  And my youngest daughter Troy Kennedy [Troy Henderson] who is five.
Story_ID: 534121
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I'm married now. And got married, had my son [Jeffrey Henderson, Jr.], living happily ever after, moving my family all over the place as I change jobs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And my wife [Stacy Womack Henderson] had her music career, had a contract with MCA Records, and she put her career on hold for my dream.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.  And I got to transfer to San Diego [California], so I moved my family down there; helped open up the Sky restaurant [Altitude Sky Lounge, San Diego, California].  I managed that. And they loved my work down there.  And a white woman, good white woman, by the name of Sara Bowman offered me a position as the chef of the Sky restaurant.  Stayed there for a year, and she taught me--she beat me up in that kitchen bad.  But you know what?  She gave me the foundation after Robert [Robert Gadsby].  And Robert gave me the--he gave me the cooking skills.  He gave me the life skills.  He taught me how to survive in a world that was foreign to me, while I was able to go into the Marriotts [Marriott International, Inc.] and all the famous restaurants and hotels I eventually came to work at.
Story_ID: 534122
Speaker 1: Now you're down in San Diego [California].  You are the chief chef down there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how long did you stay down there?
Speaker 2: I stayed there one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then eventually Marriott [Marriott International, Inc.] started cutting back on the high quality of standards for this particular hotel.  And one thing about me, I'm very--I'm on fast track.  Once I stop learning--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I got to move on.  I don't have patience.  I can't sit around.  If I'm not learning or observing, it's time to go.  I had mastered everything there.  I felt that I had gotten enough information and knowledge from the chefs, and I was ready to move on.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I wanted to try my hand at the more upscale hotels, which were The Ritz-Carlton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I applied to work at The Ritz-Carlton at the fine dining room in Marina del Rey [California] for a famous chef named Gerard Ferry; was a Michelin [Michelin Guide] three star chef.  I eventually went there and went to work for him.  But I didn't work for him right away.  I had to prove myself, work my way to get in his kitchens.  So I now was at learning French, Mediterranean cuisine.  And it was a tough job.  I didn't really understand the chef.  I don't know if he ever worked with any African Americans before, but it was tough.  And he put a whipping on me.  But I never, ever took it personal, because Robert [Robert Gadsby] always had told me, he said, "Jeff [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson], never take it personal.  You take the high road.  Just absorb.  Keep your mouth shut.  Go in with big ears and a little mouth."  And I just intellectually robbed him for all the knowledge and information that I needed to help me with my career.  And eventually, they closed down his restaurant.
Story_ID: 534123
Speaker 1: Then I moved on.  And I went to work for a couple small, freestanding restaurants in Beverly Hills [California].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then my next break came at the world famous five star, five diamond Hotel Bel-Air up on Stone Canyon [Road] in Bel-Air [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And came there.  Went to work there as a chef tournant.  I worked all the stations there.  I dealt with a lot of racism.  I dealt with a lot of sabotage where people had put salt--sugar in my salt.  And they would turn my oven on broil and burn up my stuff in the oven, because I was just moving too fast.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I was an hourly worker.  And when they couldn't pay over, I would come two or three hours early on my off days.  I would come in and work for free.  If there was a VIP party going, "Chef, I'm here.  I want to help to do the party," because I wanted to see anything new, anything different that I never saw.  So my coworkers were jealous, and they were like, "Man, what are you doing here?  You're not getting paid."  I said, "I know.  I just want to learn, you know."  So I got in several confrontations with them, and, you know, there were some threats, apparently were made.  And eventually, you know, the chef promoted me, and I became the first African American banquet chef.  So I did all their high end party--private parties there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I became the first black banquet chef ever at the Hotel Bel-Air.  And that hotel is very old.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's very prestigious as well.
Story_ID: 534124
Speaker 1: So after I learned everything I learned there [Hotel Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California], I eventually went to work for another five star, five diamond hotel, which was the L'ermitage [Viceroy L'ermitage Beverly Hills] in Beverly Hills [California] on Burton Way.
Speaker 2: Right.  I know it.
Speaker 1: And was a chef there as well, sous chef, working for another renown chef, Joseph Antonishek.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Learned everything I could there.  And then I set my eyes--I worked at all the top places in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is after maybe, let's see, four years in L.A.  So I pretty much been grooming myself, and everybody's talking about Las Vegas [Nevada].  They pay a lot of money in Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I came to Vegas on a one way ticket.  I had lost my job, was forced to quit from L'ermitage, because I had a confrontation with one of the managers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it pretty much ran me out of there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I was just too aggressive.  You know, I wouldn't let--I was just too--there were, like, this guy was just on fire, you now, just focused and stuff. And so I left the L'ermitage and set my eyes on Vegas.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you came to Vegas.
Speaker 1: Yes.  My wife [Stacy Womack Henderson] was a little nervous, "Honey, slow down." My mom [June Giles Henderson] was, like, "Why you keep quitting these jobs?"  Well, I went--I wasn't afforded the opportunity to go to culinary school.  So, me moving around and quitting jobs, starting new jobs; that's how I taught myself.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I assisted and I strategically went to work for chefs who cooked different types of cuisine.  So when I finally came to Vegas, I had a repertoire of Italian, French, California French, progressive American and I knew southern.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I knew institutional cooking.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now I didn't have just one--some people work at jobs for thirty, forty years and only know that one particular style of job.  But I wanted to be well rounded.  When I came to Vegas, people would say, "Man, you crazy."  They said, "Man, you're an ex-con.  No one's going to give you a job."  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you had to leave your family behind?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I left my family behind for a while.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I went out there on a one way ticket, and I got a job next door to the Bellagio [Bellagio Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Bellagio was the place I wanted to come.  It was my dream job here in Vegas.  It was the Bentley of them all.  You know, five diamonds all away across the board.
Story_ID: 534125
Speaker 1: And everyone turned me down on the Strip [Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada].  I mean, I was knocking at doors.  I went on recon missions.  I built relationships.  The whole nine yards.  And I couldn't get in.  And had an interview for the Bellagio [Bellagio Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada].  Bellagio standards were like impeccable.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I felt I was qualified, but I didn't have the degree and the resume good enough for them.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I saved my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And still people were looking at that record.
Speaker 1: Looking at my record.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know.  I would say, you know, "When I was young, I made some wrong choices.  But from those wrong choices, I'm a better person today."
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't enough for all.  Then on my way out back home, you know, I tell my wife [Stacy Womack Henderson], "I haven't got any--I haven't gotten a job."  She faxed my resume to Caesars Palace [Las Vegas, Nevada] where I had a history at Caesars.  I used to be a high roller there back in the days.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I really wasn't trying to go to Caesars because I had done a lot of wrong there.  Drugs and, you know, gambling and stuff.  But Caesars called back.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Jim Perillo was an Italian man from New York.  And I surely didn't intimidate him.  He was a big fella.  And I came in his office, and the first thing he said to me, he says, "Henderson [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson]."  I said, "Yes, sir."  He says, "Can you cook?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He says, "Have you ever killed anybody?"  I said, "No sir."  He said, "I want you to come cook for me and some of my boys," which were the VP of food and beverage, different executives.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I put my resume together and my, my menu.  And I came to cook for them, and I blew them away.  I did, like, six, seven courses.  And the first chapter in my book is called, "Six Courses in Sixty Minutes" ['Cooked: From the Streets to the Stove, from Cocaine to Foie Gras,' Jeff Henderson].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it was about the food I cooked at Caesars.  And they hired me right on the spot, you know.  Paid me forty thousand dollars a year.  I called the wife, said, "Honey, I got the job."  And the chef said, "When can you start?"  And he didn't care about my record.  He--at the end of the day, he just wanted to know can I cook.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I had been out of prison for four or five years at that time.  He says, "Well, if you worked at all these other places, I'm sure if worked at the Bel-Air [Hotel Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California] and The Ritz-Carlton [The Ritz-Carlton, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] you can cook."  So he hired me right away.  And my career, my Vegas career was launched at Caesars Palace.  And within three months before my ninety day probation, I was named the first African American in the thirty-five year history to become the chef de cuisine at Caesars Palace.  So here I am, an ex-con, four years out of prison, three months on the job, and I'm a restaurant chef of a multimillion dollar restaurant.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you--in three months you were named with that honor.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And how long did you stay at Caesars?
Speaker 1: I stayed at Caesars about three years.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And eventually in 2001, I won Las Vegas Chef of the Year by the American Tasting Federation [sic. American Culinary Federation].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And another award in 2002, Award of Excellen- Culinary Excellence.
Story_ID: 534126
Speaker 1: And people couldn't figure it out. They said, "How did this guy come in here and take over these union kitchens when these employees been there for twenty years?"  Well, I went back to my old street mentality of managing, motivating, encouraging, and including people of adversity into the process.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Into my--my success is your success.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: If I eat a steak, you're going to eat a steak.  If I grow, you're going to grow.  And everyone who worked in the kitchen looked like me, walked like me, criminal records, low self-esteems.  And when I go into those kitchens and I see a guy, whether he's white, black, Asian or whatever, I will say, "You know what, man?  You got some skills.  You've been here for a long time, and you know what?  I see you running this place."  I say, "But you know what?  There's a couple of things that I recommend that you change. Can I make a suggestion?"  "Yes."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I showed them different ways I had learned from all the world renowned chefs.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: No one's ever told them that.  No one ever told them they were smart.  No one ever told them they could become a chef.  No one ever told them they could make more money than they make now.  So they believed in me.  So I took my street--some of my little savviness (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --into the kitchen and it worked.  And I came in, I called all the guys chefs.  I came in, I called meetings.  I empowered them.  I would write menus, but what I would do is, I would empire- empower my top cooks.  Bring them in my office.  I would say, "Listen, Timmy.  Easter's coming up.  Thanksgiving's coming up.  What suggestions do you guys have?"
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now I gave them ownership.  And then when we--I would talk to the waiters about the menu.  I would say, "Timmy, tell the wait staff what our main entrees are."  Never ever articulated food in his life.  So now he's saying, "You know, we have turkey with sage rub and rosemary under the skin, stuffed with cornbread dressing.  We got giblet gravy going--."  So now he's feeling proud.  Now he's feeling ownership.  So I give that to them because it was given to me.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: An old man in prison told me once, Imze, who gave me the book, 'Black Men: Obsolete, Single and Dangerous?' ['Black Men: Obsolete, Single, Dangerous? The Afrikan American Family in Transition,' Haki Madhubuti], I tried to pay him for the book.  He says, "No, I don't want no money for this knowledge.  All I want you to do, what you owe me is to share what I shared with you with the next man."  And that's what I did.  All this information I have doesn't belong to me.  I give it back through whether it's cooking, whether it's through working with young people on the streets.
Speaker 2: And that's what you are doing with your book ['Cooked: From the Streets to the Stove, from Cocaine to Foie Gras,' Jeff Henderson].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 534127
Speaker 1: Now, you have been at the Caesars Palace [Las Vegas, Nevada] now three years.
Speaker 2: Now, yes.  Two and a half, three years.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's your next move?
Speaker 2: Next move after that--again, I mastered and learned everything I could get out of Caesars, and I set my sights on the Hard Rock Hotel [Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada].  Went to work for Peter Morton.  I was the first African American executive chef to run the steak house owned by the Morton family of Hard Rock hotel [Hard Rock Cafe International, Inc.].  I worked there for about four months.  Got bored real easy 'cause I wasn't able to change your menu and be creative like I thought.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I said, you know what?  I'm going to try my hands at this Hollywood business and do a private dining company.  So at that time, I had my family living here in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], and I went back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I started working for some celebrities in Hollywood.  You know, I did time with Terry Lewis, [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley, Dorien Wilson, Tisha Campbell [Tisha Campbell-Martin], Duane Martin; and done events for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Urban League, and different black organizations.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And it was tough for me, because sometimes I wouldn't get work.  So I decided then, I said, "Well, you know what?  I heard rumor on the street was that they changed regimes at Bellagio [Bellagio Resort and Casio, Las Vegas, Nevada]."  And the chef that was there before who would never give me an opportunity had left to open up Wynn [Wynn Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada].  And a new chef had took over named Wolfgang von Wieser from the Four Seasons [Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada].  And so I shopped my resume up here and I was able to secure a meeting with him.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I talked to him.  I told him that Bellagio had always been my dream.  And I told him that I do have a background.  There were some things I'd done when I was young that I wasn't proud of.  You know, I never hurt no one, never intentionally, and never, you know, used drugs, I never killed anybody.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I'm not a thief, I didn't robbed anybody.  But that experience in prison made me who I am today.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he respected that.  You know, I didn't come in with the hard sell and--, "I can do this, I can do this," you know.  Little talking, big ears.  He asked me to come cook for him.  Gave me an opportunity to do a tasting.  Again, I blew them away.  They hired me right on the spot.
Speaker 1: What did you cook for him?
Speaker 2: Oh, my first course, actually, I remember vividly.  I gave them an amuse [amuse-bouche].  Amuse is what chefs send out to customers as a palate amuser.  Something to cleanse the palate of whatever you've been eating or drinking for the day.  So I sent out one of my signature dishes, which is a watermelon cube marinated in Remy Red cognac.  I take a little citrus from a lime, a lemon or orange, a blood orange in mint.  And I put it atop the watermelon cube with a little bit of Sonoma Valley goat cheese.  Then I take some twelve year old balsamic vinegar and I reduce it with crushed blackberries until it becomes like a syrup. And I paintbrush on a plate so that it's very acidic, with the texture of the strawberry and the watermelons, cleanses your palate so it's fresh with a grapefruit lime.  So for your first course.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And after I gave them that, they was like, "Okay.  This is different."  You know, there's people that--when I have watermelon on the menu, they'll probably say, "Oh, he's going to do a big, old watermelon with the rind."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know.  No, no, no.  It's redefined, very sophisticated.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then my first course was tuna tartare with avocado, crispy leaves in a hot ginger soy broth.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I even brought my own china in.  Every time they ask me to do something, I went above and beyond.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I went past their imagination.  I brought in special china.  I do the extra courses.  They was like, "Oh, we don't have that china here."  I say, "I know, sir, I brought it in from the outside."  I say, "I want to enhance my presentation."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I did a foie gras dish.  I did a filet mignon.  I did a maple braised beef short rib.  Yeah.  Also I did the striped bass with braised savoy cabbage with organic creamed corn and a little bit of infused chive oil.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you blew them away, obviously.
Speaker 2: Blew them away.  Hired me on the spot.  I became the number two chef at Cafe Bellagio [Las Vegas, Nevada], which was the executive sous chef.  Again, within ninety days, I was named the executive chef at the Cafe Bellagio, the first African American to become executive chef of a restaurant in the world famous Bellagio hotel, the same position that I hold today here in 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And here we are.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm riding high now.
Story_ID: 534128
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure this is not going to be the last time we're going to visit you, because you're going to go a long way, I think.  Is there anything that we may have missed in this interview that you would like to get on the record?
Speaker 2: My time in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], five years since I've been in Vegas, up until the Bellagio [Bellagio Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada], I had begin--I started a foundation called the West Side Foundation, and eventually started a consulting firm called Urban Education Consulting [ph.].  And through those organizations, I set out across the country.  And when I wasn't in the kitchen, I was building relationships around the country and sharing my message of hope, inspiration and change.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's very, very important.  Really more important than the cooking, because I fell into cooking, but I truly believe that, you know, my passion for giving back and fixing my wrong and the wrongs of others, is equally--there with that passion of cuisine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 534129
Speaker 1: And probably a little bit too early to be asking you, but I want to ask you anyway, and if things change, we'll just do an addendum to this, but how do you want to be remembered for your life?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be measured by the lives I've changed and my ability to empower and inspire a generation of a socially challenged people.  And that's my passion, is socially challenged, the ones who are from the gutter, from the hood, from prison.  I want to leave a legacy for my children that my father--that their father wasn't just some criminal.  He wasn't a drug dealer.  He was a victim of circumstances as well, but he was able to overcome all those barrier and roadblocks in his life.  And my father, I want them to know that their father saved lives and changed lives, and he became a successful, professional chef, but also a very powerful mentor and a powerful life changer.  That's the legacy that I want to live- leave behind.
Story_ID: 534130
Speaker 1: We want to get to the history of your book.  Very fine book that you have written.  You started that book in--or first started thinking about it while you were in prison.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, once I started, you know, changing my life and started becoming a speaker in prison and a leader in prison, I felt there was a need for me to tell my story, because though, many people in society are--is amazed and appalled by my story, I was amazed at myself.  And still today when I look in the mirror, I be like, "How did you do it?"  You know.  I'm proud--I'm so proud of myself.  I, you know--and I tell young people, "Don't always wait for someone to pat.  Pat your own self on the back."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Self-praise yourself, but not in an arrogant, selfish way; but as a way as a self-esteem builder.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I started writing my memoir, when I was locked up, in pencil on white legal paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my book 'Cooked: From the Streets to the Stove, from Cocaine to Foie Gras' [Jeff Henderson] is an eighteen year mission of mine in a dream.  And the book 'Cooked' is not about [HistoryMaker] Jeff Henderson.  It's not about Chef Jeff.  It's about a man.  It's about a man who had a purpose in life from a young--as a young child.  It's about a person who had a dream.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And a lot of American dreams in my community were just to eat better; was just to have a house and a mom and a dad, and a fruit bowl, and a cookie jar and all those different things and opportunities that all American kids had.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But the door--it went astray.  The book is about overcoming life challenges.  And it's a vehicle for inspiration.  It's a vehicle for redemption.  And that's what I want people to know 'Cooked' by.  It's not about me selling a book and getting on New York Times bestseller or making money.  The book, it's about everyone.  And the book is very powerful.  And it's my life story and how I remembered it.  Very proud of it, of my work, and I'm very excited about all the opportunities that came from the book.  Will Smith just purchased the life rights to my memoir, and he's going to play me in the movie, hopefully, 2009 it will come out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The book went to The New York Times bestseller; held there strong for--it stayed on that list for three weeks.
Story_ID: 534131
Speaker 1: And I'm working on a reality show for the Food Network.
Speaker 2: Okay. Tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where I'm going to take--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I'm really excited.  Everything that I do, everything that Chef Jeff [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson] does is tied into the community.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't want to do just a cooking show.  I want to use my life the Chef Jeff's model for change as a vehicle to change young people.  So I created this show where Chef Jeff's in the kitchen.  And he brings in inner city youth who have a love of cooking, but who are at risk; who are on the verge of going down the road that Chef Jeff went down.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we're going to teach them life skills.  We're going to teach them how to cook.  Not only be passionate and focused and driven about food and a career, but passionate, focused and driven about life.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, how to get jobs, how to live in two worlds, how to manifest your dreams.  And that's something that's very, very important to me.  And in meeting with Will Smith, I spent several hours with him. And we talked about the integrity of the movie.  We talked about the social components that the movie redemption has to have in there, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It has to talk about the one out of four black males who are incarcerated through America.  It needs to talk about the addiction of crack cocaine and the effect crack cocaine had on a generation of babies born in this country.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The high prison population.  It needs to talk about the children born out of wedlock.  It needs to talk about the responsibilities of mothers and fathers of color that they have to their children.  And those things are very, very important to me, the political aspect of it.  Not just the glitz and glamour of Hollywood and portraying another drug dealer's life.  We've seen them over and over--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in movies.  So definitely has to have that message and component.
Speaker 2: Well, we wish you all the luck in the world.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock].
Speaker 2: And I'm sure this won't be the last book.
Speaker 1: Actually not.  I'm actually working on my next book, which is going to be a business motivational book of strategies; how young people can take those good skills--they may use them bad on the streets, but take those skills and flip them and utilize them legitimately in the real world and become successful.

Speaker 1: This is me dis- Chef Jeff [HistoryMaker Jeff Henderson] displaying some of my signature cuisine that I call posh urban cuisine.
