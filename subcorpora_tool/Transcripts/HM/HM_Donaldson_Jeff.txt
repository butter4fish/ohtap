Speaker 1: There's five questions I ask of everyone.  They have no meaning.  Short answers are required.  But they're--you know, I just ask them of everyone.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) I would probably think black-eyed peas.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: I can't afford that.  I'm an artist.  I have to love them all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All colors, I'll say.  Okay, favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) I just don't want it to be very cold.
Speaker 1: Not winter.  You like summer, spring, it doesn't mat--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I just don't want to be very cold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, favorite place to vacation?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) Let me try to explain how I view life.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughs).
Speaker 2: I don't have any intervals.  It's all a circle.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) A continuation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Don't worry.
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't go on vacation.
Speaker 1: I understa--okay.  Oh, okay. I understand.
Speaker 2: I vacation wherever I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's fair enough. Oh.
Speaker 2: Or I try to.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Other people may think--may know that but I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's fair enough.  Okay, wha--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Probably no.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) We're gonna get st--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The word "no".  The word "no" is probably my favorite saying.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously laughing)  Oh! It is your favorite phrase.  Okay!
Speaker 2: (laughs)
Speaker 1: (laughs) No. Okay.  Oh, that's a shame! (laughs)  That's your initial reaction to everything.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No.
Speaker 2: Then you have time to examine it.
Story_ID: 6593
Speaker 1: You were born in Pine Bluff Arkansas?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And, your mother was Clementine [Frances] Richardson [Donaldson]. And I'd like--. Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Her maiden name.  And I'd like you to talk--tell us about your mother and what you know about her background.
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was a wonderful woman.  She was a high school principal.  She was widowed when I was four years old--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --with three children.  And, uh, I don't know how much money she made as a principal in Arkansas but it wasn't very much.  But she was able to hold together the family.  And, we all did pretty well, I guess.
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about her?  Did she ever talk--was--was she from Pine Bluff?
Speaker 2: She was born there, around 1900 and, she was quite an activist from youth all the way throughout her life.  As a matter of fact when she was in, in college, she--she led a boycott of classes because the man who was in charge of instruction: I believe may--he may have been a dean or (pauses).  Yeah.  I guess he was a dean gave one of the young ladies in the school silk stockings.  And of course that was unheard of during those days.  So the basketball team that she was a member of boycotted and caused the guy to, to, lose his job.  As a matter of fact, the, the--brought in the first I believe black administrator of that institution.  I believe.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Now, what do you know much about her background and her family?  I'm just trying--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about that? And be careful.  That's why I touched you right there.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, um-hmm. Okay, I was shifting. My mother's mother [Janie Clayton Richardson] was from Georgia, and her father [Jeff Richardson] was from Georgia.  His mother was from Sudan in Africa.  And we don't know who his father was.  But he was raised by a white man named Pat Richardson whose name he took--a grocer in Georgia and they moved to Arkansas.  Um, my great, great grandmother Aunt Sudi the one--the African, was a, a girl, a teenager, I think about sixteen when my grandfather was born.  He became director of the sanitation department in Pine Bluff Arkansas during Reconstruction.  And, of course after Reconstruction he lost his job. But,  my mother grew up in that kind of environment.  A politically astute environment, aAn environment that placed a lot of--a lot of stock in education.  As a matter of fact, she never made any grade lower than an "A" her entire life. And once I made a "D" and that was almost the end of my life.
Speaker 1: (Pauses) Did she--you said she went to--she--I guess she went to the local schools there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: It was called Branch Normal.  It later became A.M. and N. [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal] College.  Later--as a matter of fact now it's called the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.
Speaker 1: And did she share any other stories with you about her growing up?  Anything that stuck with you or remembrances or--you know, things that may have affected her in her adulthood?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One thing I remember very vividly it, it, bothered her greatly.  That throughout my dad's life he was never called "Mister".--and that throughout the neighborhood in Arkansas, the, the African Americans were invariably referred to by their first names.  By, by white people.  And either by their first name or some prefix like "Aunt" or "Uncle" or "Professor."  Anything except "Mister".  And we'd have to change grocery stores because as soon as the people found out my mother's first name and called her by that name, she wouldn't go back to that store anymore.  So we had a difficult time getting groceries there for a while.  It involved a lot of distance.  But I--it was a lesson well, well learned.  She, she insisted upon being treated with respect.  And I can recall once a white man saying, calling her Aunt and she asked the guy which one of her sister Gert's children he was.  We didn't go back to that store either.
Speaker 1: So you had--you had a mother that had a lot of sense of self and you know, wasn't gonna put up with anything.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, and on, on my father's side too.  The, the people were very, very conscious of who they were and where they were. And--they wanted to improve themselves.
Story_ID: 6594
Speaker 1: Let's talk about--your father's name was [Sidney] Frank Donaldson?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he--so he passed away when you were four?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But talk about what you--I mean you were-well, you were young probably you don't--do you have many memo--any memories?
Speaker 2: No.  All I have is myth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] was a single [widowed] mother and there was no male presence in the house--my brother [Sidney Frank Donaldson, Jr.] was drafted into the army during World War II.  He was a little bit older than me.  And so there was no male presence there.  So she created this mythology about my father being such a great man and having such great expectations for me, so that I feel that I have knowledge of him.  But I really don't.  He--he had a variety of jobs.  He was a stationary engineer in a mill.  A sawmill, a wooden sawmill.  I guess that's the only kind there is.  A wood--a saw mill--yes.  And he also worked in a bank.  Not as a clerk or anything.  I don't know what type work he did there but it was basically something menial.  (pauses) But as I said she, she created quite a myth around him and what he expected of me.
Story_ID: 6595
Speaker 1: What do you know about his family?  Did you have much inter--much interaction?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He [Jeff Donaldson's father, Sidney Frank Donaldson] had nineteen brothers and sisters.  And my grandfather, a legendary farmer and, and I guess, sire.  He married two women.  He had four children by my father's mother.  And then he had subsequently sixteen by a second wife after his first wife died. But he was a legendary figure in, in Alabama and Arkansas.  I'll give you one little anecdote.  In the South--or I guess in any farm country they have a tradition of laying by one-half of the land. That is they don't cultivate one-half of the land during one planting season so that the land can rest and rejuvenate itself.  So they have to clear the new land each year.  And he would wait until everybody had assembled with their horses and their tractors, tractors and chains to pull up the roots after the trees had been cut.  And then he would go out there, take off his shirt, and pull up one of the stumps with his bare hands.  Another time he was said to have gone into the woods--always with people around, and taunted and challenged a bear to charge him.  And he had two daggers in his hands.  And when the bear charged, he raised his arms so that the bear could hug him and then he comes down on both sides with the knife.  And he never had to go back to the farm to work at all during any of those seasons after doing those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: John.
Speaker 1: John Donaldson.
Speaker 2: He was quite a man.  He was born in slavery. And--I guess he was maybe enslaved for about fifteen years.  This is not a great grandfather.  This is my grandfather.  My dad was about 50, 51, 52 years old when I was born.  But he was able to convince the man that had bought him away from the original family that was a King Plantation from the Carolinas--he was able to convince the guy who bought him whose name was Donaldson to bring his mother and his sisters into that slave family.  Later on, one of his sisters was assaulted and he and his brother took care of that guy, to the extent that he would never do that again.  And the guy who had been his "owner"--quote, unquote--helped him to get out of Ar-- Alabama.  He and his brother.  And they ended up in Arkansas.  And his brother became a physician.  Changed his name and became, became a physician.  But my grandfather didn't change his name and remained a farmer, kept the same name.  He was a pretty tough guy.
Story_ID: 6596
Speaker 1: Your siblings--I'd like you to state their names and the order.  You (unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My older--my oldest brother was Sidney Frank Donaldson [Jr.].  Who served in World War Two in the Navy.  He moved to Chicago along with most of my family in the Great Migration.  You know, uh, the Second Great Migration.  And began as a laborer at Campbell Soup and rose to be plant manager before he died at the unseemly death--age of 47.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: But--and my sister was a caseworker in Chicago until she retired.  And she's still there.  My sister's name is Vida [Donaldson] Stewart
Speaker 1: And--and are you the baby?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.  There was a child between me and my sister who died.
Speaker 1: Now, I want to talk about you as a--you know, as a youngster. And I was wondering if you could share with us, you know, memories of you, you know, in, in your young years.  Why do you have that puzzled look on your face?
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't know where to start. Perhaps you could kind of--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well, I'm talking about in the--you know, I mean some of your earliest memories that you have.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Can I ask first about what Pine Bluff was--.  What kind of community it was like?
Speaker 2: It's a black college town.  It's the second largest city in the state of Arkansas.  What else can I say?  (pauses).
Speaker 1: How many blacks?  How many whites? I mean even--or were there whites?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--quite a number of them.  I wouldn't know the proportion.  But I would say the population may have been as much as 50-50.  It was the largest town in that particular part of the state.  And so a lot of people came in and out of the city a lot.  And because it was a university town it has--had a little bit of a more cosmeto--cosmopolitan air perhaps than some of the other smaller towns in Arkansas.  But it was a rural state and it was a city within that state.  We had one public--well, we had three public high schools for black people.  I think just one for whites.  And there were a couple of private schools like the catholic school for black people and, of course, there was a laboratory school at the--at the college.
Speaker 1: So did--what's the history of that town?  Do you know much?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not really.  I was really basically interested in getting out as fast as possible.
Speaker 1: But now some of the--I'm going back to early memories.  And when I say--I would like to know some of your--you know--do you have an earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember realizing early on where I was.  Because I can recall early on in my life, my mother led a boycott of the local iceman and also of the local newspaper because of some slight that had occurred in our community.  And, you know, she was able to take all those slights and teach lessons from them.  So I, I, I remember being very, very aware of the fact that to be male and black in the South at that point was a very dangerous thing.  And you had to be very careful.  And so, we were.
Speaker 1: So what about family life?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, the nice thing about it if, if, if there is such a thing as you know--and certainly there were some nice things--is that in our isolation--in that segregated community that we lived in, we had a whole universe, a parallel universe, that unless you stepped outside of the borders or unless someone intruded on that area, you were basically in, in a world that was isolated from all of the discrimination and segregation that you would encounter ordinarily if you went outside.  And if you didn't work as a kid as I was you didn't encounter very much of it.  But you were always subject to being insulted riding in the back of vehicle or public transportation.  I understand in some parts of the South it was much worse but--I don't think I was ever very, very, very comfortable there.
Speaker 1: When did you mo--what age were you when you, left?  Were you up?  I mean older or were you--
Speaker 2: Well, I was in my early teens.
Story_ID: 6597
Speaker 1: Any other stories of you know playing or you know, or your friends or--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah!  I think one of the major--one of the things that sticks in my mind more than anything else is the number of people who disappeared.  That is to say when we started off in high--in junior high school for example, in high school ninth grade, there were about 250, 300 kids in the class.  The entering class.  When we graduated, there were 75.  Now many of those people went away.  Went to California or went North.  They went West.  They went East.  But there were many many, many that just weren't around anymore.  Nobody knew where they went.  I'm not suggesting anything except what I said.  The thing that always interested me and fascinated me was the way the people came and left.  So that when we graduated--now the class by the way was about 50-50 male and female when we entered ninth grade.  When we graduated, there were 13 males.  The rest were all females.
Speaker 1: You hear talk about that.  Okay, now but okay.  Oh.  Now what other--were you, um, a quiet child? Were you a shy child?  Were you, you know--
Speaker 2: None of--no.
Speaker 1: None of those.  Can you describe how you were?
Speaker 2: I mentioned the fact earlier that my--the, the child before me died. So apparently they were so happy that I had lived, that they kind of cre--developed a laissez-faire attitude toward me.  Which gave me a lot of room to experiment and learn things so I wasn't quiet and I wasn't--no, I wasn't a nice kid.  I was not bad but I was very naughty.  And very inquisitive and I hope creative which got me into a lot of difficulty at times.  But, all in all my, my growing up years were not unhappy.  I don't want to give the wrong impression.  Because we had our own community.  We had our own culture.  And we were reasonably comfortable.
Speaker 1: Did you ever miss having a father?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I still do.  You can never replace that type figure in your life.  I wouldn't recommend anybody going through life without a father.
Speaker 1: So how--what effect do you think that had on you or would you, you know, did you sort of envision him as he was?  Or you know, or you thought he might be?  Or--based on your mother's stories?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.  Yes, but nothing about--nothing about the kinds of things that I could use in my own--in my own life.  Because the kinds of questions that you'd want answers to, you couldn't get them from a mother.  Particularly my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] who didn't like to talk about things that were, you know, things that were--not--how shall I put it?
Speaker 1: Of the world?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was very much of the world--don't misunderstand me, but life between the sexes for example were the things that I kind of found out on my own.
Speaker 1: Not unlike most of them (laughs).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Yes.
Speaker 1: I had two parents.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you--I mean who were some of your friends that you had growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had great friends.  Great friends.  We had--as a matter of fact many of our friends were white.  Because we lived closer to white people in Arkansas than we did in Chicago.  As a matter of fact, a white woman use to do our wa--our laundry.  So, like I said the only problems that you had were with the officialdom.  When it came down to the law, when it came down to interaction between different people of different races, that's when you had problems.  Particularly if they were adults.  The kids got along until they reached puberty and then they separated.
Story_ID: 6598
Speaker 1: You went to elementary school where?
Speaker 2: In Arkansas.
Speaker 1: No, no. I know in Arkansas and I know in Pine Bluff.
Speaker 2: Oh!
Speaker 1: --but the name of the school.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact because my--when my father [Sidney Frank Donaldson] died, my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] began taking me to a school that she was teaching at at that point in the suburbs called Faith.  A place called--a community called Faith [Arkansas]  So, she started taking me to school at four--when I was four.  So, I sat in the first grade class.  And the first grade class was also the class where they had the second grade.  So by the time I reached six, I knew what was going on in the first, second grades so I got double promotions.  Which meant that I was propelled through high school too fast and got out at sixteen.  But in any event, because there was no babysitter or anything like that, I went with my mother so I had been going to school since I was four.
Speaker 1: And were there any--some things that sort of intrigued you about school?  Were you a good student? Or were you not a good student?  Were you, you know.
Speaker 2: I was a good student through osmosis I think.  I never put forth too much effort except in art.  Which got me into a lot of trouble because when I was in sixth grade, I got so involved in drawing.  There was no art taught of course in the segregated schools that I went to.  I got so involved in drawing that I began to neglect my other courses and I earned a couple "D's".  And of course that was something that was just unthinkable for my mother who'd never earned anything less than an "A".  So I was forbidden to do artwork and I had to go underground for a couple years.  I think I learned more during that time.  Unfortunately, we couldn't go to the library, get books on art or anything else in Arkansas.  So basically you had to copy things from newspapers or magazines or things--magazines that my mother might subscribe to and that sort of thing.  But then she found out I was very serious about it and that I could balance the academics with the art and she encouraged me to continue.
Story_ID: 6599
Speaker 1: What was this desire to draw and do art?  When did that sort of come about?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That started when I was three.
Speaker 1: Three!
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was--I was very much influenced in everything that I did in my early life by my older brother [Sidney Frank Donaldson, Jr.]  He was my hero.  Still is.  My oldest sister [Vida M. Donaldson-Stewart] is my hero.  My mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson]--all of them wonderful, wonderful role models for me.  So he started to draw.  It was a phase that he was going through.  But apparently it caught on to--I caught the bug.  And I was doing it because he was doing it.  He went through the phase.  I continued to do it.
Speaker 1: So what types of things were both of you drawing or you drawing?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember what he was drawing anymore.  But I was doing cartoons.  Comic books.  Because that's all I had seen.  You know, I'd never seen--there was--there was no art museum there.  And I say there was--as I said there was no art taught in the high schools or the college.  And that's an interesting story too.
Speaker 1: So did you--the--and your drawing of the, of the, the comic books, what were you--.  Did you, you know, were you just trying to mirror what was shown in there?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh no, no, no, no!  I was doing my own from, you know.  But using the format.  But my own characters, my own stories.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And this--so you had always an active imagination is what you're--can you talk about some of your characters?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.  And that got me into a lot of trouble.  Because--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But I wanta--I want you to talk about it.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I never was the kind of person who--kid who would make up stories or, you know, living in a fairy tale world or anything like that.  But my imagination did cause me to exaggerate things to a great extent.  And I see it in my kids, by the way, the same tendency. I, I find it abhorrent in them, of course.  But in any event, I, I, I had that tendency. I may still have it.  To spice up a story a bit with just a little bit more this or that.
Speaker 1: And the characters that you drew.  Were they--who, who were some of these characters?
Speaker 2: Oh they were superhero types.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Were they black?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That was never a, a problem or anything.  You know, we, we--ours was the norm.
Story_ID: 6600
Speaker 1: You had last talked about also drawing before that in sixth grade.  And I'm just wondering--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  That's when I got the "D's".
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were drawing.
Speaker 2: Yes, instead of--you see when I--I had been going to this small school [in Faith, Arkansas] that my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] was teaching in.  So whenever there was a problem, you'd answer.  Every kid got an opportunity to participate.  When I went to the bigger schools [in Pine Bluff], I'd raise my hand and the teacher would call on me and I'd answer.  She knew I knew so ultimately she stopped calling on me.  So I stopped studying.  And once she found out I had stopped studying, she started to call on me and my mother [a high school principal] was a legendary figure there, and she knew my mother.  And she called my mother and--but that same teacher bought me some paint.  Well not really paint.  She bought me some paper and some charcoal pencil type things.  Gave me a book on--by Horat- --Horatio Alger.  I'll never forget that.  And I read it.  And I said, "Why did she give me this damn book--?"  I couldn't read it--it was about this white boy who had gone on from nothing and become a millionaire, and all kinds of things.  And I, I then realized that these people had created a world apart, in which they saw themselves as succeeding within the context of the culture that they were victims of.  And I, I have to use that term.  So that she thought I would apply whatever I got from that to my own life.  And settle for something within the context of being a schoolteacher, or a mail carrier, or--those are great jobs in, in, in Arkansas during those days.  As a matter of fact, when I--when I first went to Chicago and started working in the post office as a clerk, during summers from college, and I wrote to my mother and told, told her.  And she said, "Well, I hope you'll come back to college since you got that good job in the post office, you'll be tempted not to go back, you know."  She was looking at it from the perspective of Arkansas.  In Chicago, you know, a post office job is like well what is it like?  It's a good job.
Speaker 1: It's a good job!
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It's a good job there.
Speaker 2: But, but the people in Arkansas who carried mail were the pillars of the community.
Speaker 1: Right.  Oh, I understand.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: The pillars.
Speaker 1: Now, you--so this one teacher.  What was her name?  The one--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Della Ruth Atkins.  She became a high fashion model in New York.  Beautiful woman.  She left that place.  I told you people were always leaving.

Speaker 1: When your mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] --so she, she both tried to nurture your art, and at the same time she was trying to challenge you to do better.
Speaker 2: She wanted me to be a success in whatever I did.  And to get a "D" [which he did in junior high after spending more time on art than studying] was to be a failure.  No matter what you were doing.  So if the art got in the way of my schooling, it, it had to, you know, take a second stance. Because all she knew about was--about artists was that they starved to death.  The myth that everybody believes.  And especially a black artist.  I mean we, we--and fortunately there was a guy in that town who was quite an artist--named Isaac [Scott] Hathaway who ended up designing,I believe a coin during the Roosevelt era [sic, in 1946] with some black individual on [Booker T. Washington], on the coin.  His name was Isaac Hathaway. And later on he, he went to--down South.  I believe Tuskegee some place.  But in any event, he was succeeded by another guy named John [M.] Howard who happened to be the best artist in Arkansas who was teaching at the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff which was A.M. and N. College [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College] when I went there.  Of course they didn't have an art major.  And at that time, a black woman had been admitted to the University of Arkansas Medical School, a white school, and a black man had been admitted to the law school.  But those were the graduate schools.  And I had an opportunity to integrate on the undergraduate level to study art there.  And fortunately I had an opportunity to visit the place.  And I decided I didn't want to be with those people.  And the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the area--there were some great people like a man named Howard Flowers and of course another guy named Wiley [Austin] Branton who ultimately became dean here at the law school at Howard.  But, what we did was to cause an art major to be created at Arkansas A.M.&N.,  and I was the only student.  And there were two faculty members.  So I had the best of all worlds.  And, we didn't have very much equipment but I had one-on-one instruction like you'd had in medieval guilds times you know?  And like I said this guy was the best artist in Arkansas.  He had studied with Hale Woodruff who was one of the leading figures of the Harlem Renaissance.  He had painted murals with him and, and it was just great.

Speaker 1: What was the school system?--I know you, you know, started early--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --and you graduated early but you went from, you know elementary went up to what period?  Eighth grade or did it go--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh no.  I went to the school where my mother taught in the suburbs until I was fifth grade.
Speaker 1: And what school was that?
Speaker 2: That's what's called Faith.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was a community called Faith, Arkansas.  Then I went to Merrill Junior High School.  Sixth grade.  And after junior high school, Merrill High, ninth grade.
Speaker 1: And was Merrill High School--Was it a mixed school or was it all black?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, it was all black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  There was one of the three you said that--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) There was another one called J. C. Corbin [High School], which was the, uh, the lab school at the Universit--at the college.  There was [C.P.] Coleman High School, which had been called Jefferson County [High School] before that.  But ultimately my mother became principal of that school.  That high school.  Then there were, as I said there was a Catholic high school.  For black kids.  I guess there was one for white kids, too.  And then there was of course there was a Pine Bluff High School for white kids.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--in your high school, what--tell me what kind of student you were and, you know, also--.  You have this smile on your face.  Well you know, what kind of stu--this is not an interrogation. I'm just trying to pull the story out of you.  But you know, what kind of student you were.  Were you totally entrenched in art?  Were people coming to you to do things--?  You know how sometimes--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes. Oh yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --when you have artistic--
Speaker 2: I was--I was the artist in every class.  As a matter of fact, I was the yearbook artist in high school and college.
Speaker 1: (pauses) So, what are you--at this point--are you painting, drawing?  How are you developing, you know, in high school?  Was it, you know, were you still doing cartoons?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The one constant in my life has been art.  And no, I wasn't doing cartoons once I got to college.
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about high school.
Speaker 2: No, in high school, I was doing cartoons, of course.  Yeah.  That was it.  In black and white.  Because we had no, no paint.
Speaker 1: And was there anyone that you would say who stuck out, who influenced you in high school? You know--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Drawing style?
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--Yeah. Mentor or you know--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) As awful it may sound, it was Al Capp [Alfred Gerald Caplin] who did something [a comic strip] called 'Li'l Abner'.  And he was a conservative of the rankest order.  But he had the most beautiful fluent line and I was impressed with the line.  Not with the--what he was doing--he was ridiculing white people in Arkansas.  But his line was so beautiful. He had a very, very expressive line for a cartoonist.
Speaker 1: And what intrigued you about cartoons?  Why were boys attra--you know what I mean? But you're not--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was all I was exposed to.  There was no art.  No art books, no art museum.  You know and people gave me--ultimately started to give me things that--you know, a book here, a book there.  And then I did a--entered this "Draw Me" contest.  You seen those in magazines, draw me and win a scholarship?  You never seen that?  It used to be in all the comic books and all the magazines.  It would have a drawing of a dog or a person.  And you'd draw it in.  They'd send--you'd send it in.  Everybody won a scholarship by the way.  But everybody paid.  So I won a scholarship but the guy came by my mother's house and that was--she took that as an opportunity to teach me about scams.
Speaker 1: Scam--I bet that was a disappointing lesson to learn, right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, it was a good lesson to learn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a good lesson to learn.
Story_ID: 6603
Speaker 1: Didn't you move from Pine Bluff when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: You said?  Now what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in--I had been going to Chicago in the summer.  Then when I graduated from high school--see my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] made my--my father [Sidney Frank Donaldson] asked my mother not to marry again until I got out of high school. My grandfather had persuaded the girl, his first wife to persuade the young girl next door to marry him on his--on her deathbed.  And my male antecedents are good at extracting deathbed promises out of women.  But in any event, when I graduated from high school, then she was free to marry the first boyfriend she'd ever had.  Then moved to Oklahoma.  So I lived in the dorm in Arkansas.  I had a scholarship.  An art scholarship that paid, you know, tuition, room and board and everything.  Because despite the fact that I had not had any training in art, all of the aptitude tests that they give you, the battery of tests that they give you when you go to college? Indicated that I could never be a success at anything else.  (pauses)
Speaker 1: So it was clear.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So at this point--
Speaker 2: But there was--but I still couldn't major in it because there was no major.
Speaker 1: Okay!  So you actually--so then okay you decide that whatever.  Was it Arkansas State?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was called Arkansas State, A.M.&N. College, yeah. [Arkansas State Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College (later University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff),  Pine Bluff Arkansas]
Speaker 1: Okay, but Arkansas-- it was the white Arka--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) There's an Arkansas State that's a white school.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --and you said that was--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --that was no--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)  You weren't gonna integrate that.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was no--no the University of Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, you weren't gonna integrate that.
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then here it is.  Do you know at this point John [M.] Howard?  You've--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You've started working with him.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's obvious.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started working with him when I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let him know that I wanted to learn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, something about paint.
Speaker 1: And so he's teaching in Arkansas A.&M.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: A.M.&N.
Speaker 2: He's teaching it, and you know you could get an art minor at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was also director of public relations.  And that's also something that I learned very early.  That you have to go beyond just being an artist when you're black in a university setting.  Or in a teaching situation. You, you've got to do other things.  And I, I was, was always taught that you gotta do more.  So the organizing coordinating things became something that I learned early on.  My mother was an organizer and it's just in my blood.
Speaker 1: So when you--so you set up this--I'm just saying you set up this major.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm!
Speaker 1: Sort of.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Basi-- I, I requested it.
Speaker 1: And they set it up for you.
Speaker 2: And they said if this co--if the university--if the state won't fund it, then you'll have to take it in the white school as an undergraduate.  And that would be unheard of.  (pauses)
Speaker 1: So they s--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) and I didn't want to be there.
Speaker 1: Right.  Plus-- so they set this up for you--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They created a major.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fabulous!
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this--so your mother's moved to--she's moved to--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) She's in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Chicago.  Oh!
Speaker 2: She went to Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Oklahoma fir--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother [Sidney Frank Donaldson, Jr.] and sister [Vida Donaldson] followed my aunts and uncles to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so you're here--let's talk about these years--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --at A.M.&N. and what--how you were influenced then and how things have changed for you.  I mean you're--you're basically the only student in the department.
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  When I went there, I had to major in sociology, which was something that they suggested that I major in.  You know, because there was nothing else I was really interested in.  And then in the back of my mind, I was going to make it possible--I was gonna study art somewhere.  Somehow.  And so we got involved in that.  And it happened.
Story_ID: 6604
Speaker 1: Tell me what kind of person you are at this point.  Remember you said earlier--well no, I'm just asking these questions. Have you--you know, because you're a young adult sort of.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You're in your late teens?
Speaker 2: Then?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, early--late teens.
Speaker 1: Late teens.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I stayed in college five years as an undergrad by the way because they didn't have that [art] major [when he started college].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was in, in sociology for the first two years.  (pauses) Yeah.  In sociology for two years.  And then I had to do three years in order to get the degree in visual art.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what are you--what are you thinking in your mind?  You want to be--?  Are you thinking you want to be a John Howard? Are you thinking when you learn about Hale Woodruff, that you want to be Hale Woodruff?  What are you thinking?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be beyond wherever they were.  And, I must admit that I was so young and so much involved in so many other things that I really didn't give too much thought to what was gonna happen.
Speaker 1: So what were the other things you were involved with?
Speaker 2: Just about everything that you could do in college.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay. So you were exploring your--you were exploring yourself and your manhood--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and your new-found freedom.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.  Yes.  For example the girls had to be in, in the dorm at night.  The freshman at seven, sophomores at eight, juniors at nine and seniors at ten during the week.  And then on the weekend, they had a more flexible.  But as an art student and the only one, my girls could stay out.  Because, you know they were with the crazy artist.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) So what--then what they--what you were doing, portrait studies or something? (laughs)  Okay. Okay.  So you were a handful.  You were exploring--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And I, I visited girls in the dorm and that wasn't done then.  You know?  That wasn't done then.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I stayed on probation, by the way, in college.  They'd, they'd put you on social probation, (laughs).  As a matter of fact in the--in my last year, they, they had me and a number of other people who were kind of rebellious in a special dormitory.  That they called 'Esquire's Palace,' with no supervision.  Every--all the other dorms had supervisors.  We had none.  They hoped we'd destroy each other.  And we almost did.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) So--so who were some other people there since you were the only artist?
Speaker 2: Oh! Listen there was a singer named Sam Fletcher. Beautiful singer!  As a matter of fact, when Dinah Shore did her last show, she said she wanted to introduce two people that she knew who would be great stars.  One of them was Sam Fletcher and the other one was Barbra Streisand.  Sam died.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Hmm.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, very early before he ever realized his full potential.  But he did two albums that are terrific.  Who else?  A guy named Malcolm Hemphill was part of that, that group, he became a Big Ten official, a, a basketball official.  Another guy who became vice-president of an insurance company.  Another guy became a city official.  As a matter of fact two or three of those guys became city officials in East St. Louis, Illinois and they all went to jail.
Speaker 1: So but--but we had a char--we had a group here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know they--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's why they had tolerated us. Because we were--we were you know, kind of different and kind of wild.  But we were all good students and we all had some focus and some direction.  It was a great, great time--great group.
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Ah!  There was one guy who was on the periphery of that group named Samuel [Lee] Kountz, Kountz who became the leading kidney transplant surgeon in the United States--before he went to Nigeria and picked up something that kept him in a coma for five years and he died.  But, they even have a special program in his honor named for him at Howard [University] at the hospital.
Story_ID: 6605
Speaker 1: What other things were happening in your--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Ah! When, when, when we were going through college [at Arkansas State Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, later University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff], you, you know, Brown versus Board of Education had just become a reality [in 1954, the year he graduated].  So we were on the cusp of that.  Although no, no changes occurred dur--in our school.  But people were going into s--you know, "integrated situations" throughout the country.  So it was an exciting time. It was a time when, you know, you could see things happening, see changes, "S-E-A" changes and things.  I can recall one summer going back to Chicago and they had just passed the regulation that forbade segregation in interstate commerce?  And we got on the train in Arkansas.  And at that time you had to sit at--behind the engine when you were black?  And we showed them our tickets to Chicago and sat where the hell we wanted.  That was great.  That was really great.
Speaker 1: So it was a heady time, sort of, this, all this--you felt like you were in, in process--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And we had integrated things earlier like buses that went to the black communities--we commandeered those.  And sat where we wanted to sit.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you think were the benefits in going to a black--you had been black all the way through actually when you think about it.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.  What was the major advantage?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Those faculty members that I talked about like the woman who gave me the [Horatio] Alger book?  In order to get the advanced degrees, they had to leave the state.  You couldn't get an advanced degree from the  black institutions there.  Of course you couldn't go to the white ones that gave it. So that Arkansas would give you money to go to Illinois.  To go to Connecticut.  To go to New York.  To go to California and get a degree if you agreed to come back there and teach.  So these people got those degrees and they tried to get work in those cities like Chicago and Hartford and New York and Los Angeles and couldn't.  And they became very bitter.  And they came back and they taught us things that they had learned outside the classroom about the history of this country for example.  So the educational experience that we had really got down and dirty.  For instance we knew about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings  back then.  You know.  We knew about the number of people who were brought over here and who died in the Middle Passage--back then--I mean elementary school.  And we had black history week and that--those weeks extended all throughout the year in the black schools because nobody white was ever there.  Except to come and give you diplomas and make a speech every now and then.  So they were teaching (pauses).
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: They were teaching revolution.  And that is why the major figures that came out of the struggle in the '60s [1960s] came out of the South.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Because they had been educated by those disillusioned black people who had gotten degrees in the North and they were--there was no currency.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: They couldn't use them there.  I can recall the first time hearing a black man say--this guy's name was Guy Darnell.  He had come from Yale.  And he was teaching economics at the university--at the [AM&N] college there.  And he came to our high school [Merrill High School, Pine Bluff Arkansas] to speak.  And he said, "I vowed when I was twelve years old that I would let no white man master me.  Either we will be equal or I will be the master."  (whispering)  I'd never heard anything like that from a black man before.  And I never forgot it.  Nobody in that audience, I think, ever forgot it.  It was the most revolutionary statement I'd ever heard.  Because everything around us said that we were less.  And here was this guy standing here saying that.  And the teachers beaming!  You know?  (Smiling)  Our teachers beaming said, "Are you, are you listening?  Are you listening?  Are you paying attention?"  It was--it was wonderful.  And that was the case throughout college.  For example we learned that one [U.S.] president I won't mention who had something called his kitchen cabinet.  And anybody who's an asti--an astute historian of, of American history will know which president I'm talking about [Andrew Jackson].  After these cabinet meetings, he would say, "Come gentleman.  Let us repair to the slave quarters and partake of some yellow wenches."  You would never have learned that in any other classroom except the kind of classroom that we had down there.  That was in high school.  (pauses)
Speaker 1: Well, that's a blessing though really.
Speaker 2: It's a blessing inside a curse.  Yes.
Speaker 1: It's a blessing inside of a curse?
Speaker 2: The curse was to be there!  Where everything said that you were not worthy.  But in that atmosphere to have someone come from the outside who looked like you, who spoke like you, whose rhythms were the same as yours.  Who was able to stand there and tell you he could--he had mastered that!  That he had worked with Peat Marw--what's the name of that accounting firm in?
Speaker 1: Arthur Anderson or Peat Marwick--Well, there's Peat Marwick.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 6606
Speaker 1: I wanna ask about John [M.] Howard--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm!
Speaker 1: And why he was such a wonderful mentor to you.  You talk about him as a mentor--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: And so I'm just wondering why.  Because--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Because he taught me so much more than, than art.  Given the fact that it was one-on-one instructions for a lot of the time.  After the first year, a couple more people came into the program.  But because it was one-on-one, the instruction was formal and informal.  And it had to do with life as well as art.  And he was always talking about there was no structure in the black art world.  So that, you know, you had difficulty marketing your work, there were no outlets--and so you had to create a system that supported the work that you'd do.  You have to institutionalize and create agencies that will promote what you're doing.  So that's why I say his influence on me was greater than, than just being an artist, just learning how to paint or draw.
Speaker 1: Now when you--from him.  That's when you first learned of Hale Woodruff.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 6607
Speaker 1: Is that [college] the first time you heard of the Harlem Renaissance?
Speaker 2: No, I'd hear--No, I'd--my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] was very much involved with--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that--that kind of--My mother had, had, uh--My mother had Garvey stamps. Garvey--what do you call those?
Speaker 1: She was--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) She bought stock in the Black Star Line--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.  Oh so she was a  Garveyite?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No!
Speaker 1: No, she wasn't, but she at least bought--Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah.  She subscribed to the 'Crisis' throughout, you know, I think.  That's the first magazine I ever saw.  She was a member of Madame--Mary McLeod Bethune's group, the National Council of Negro Women.  I come from a long line of what they call race (unclear) women.  You know--so they, they were always involved with matters of the race. Not just here but also abroad. My mother was always involved with--in her Baptist church with the missionary group.  You know.  I don't know what they did in Africa.  And neither does she.  But she always wanted to go.  And she always knew that she was African.  And always kept the memory of Aunt Sudi alive.  That was our link to, to the continent.
Story_ID: 6608
Speaker 1: What fascinated you in the story about Hale Woodruff? And that appealed to you, you know, when John [M.] Howard [who taught Donaldson at Arkansas State Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, later University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff] told you about him?
Speaker 2: Oh!  Well, I recognized the importance of public art at that time because Woodruff had been a very important artist in the WPA. Howard had worked with him on a mural out in California.  But also they had a group at Morehouse [College] where Woodruff--act-actually, Woodruff was teaching at the other school.  He was teaching at Morehouse and his students came from Atlanta U. [Atlanta University, now Clark Atlanta University], I believe, and Morehouse and I guess Spelman, as well [sic. Hale Woodruff taught at Spelman College].  [Nancy] Elizabeth Prophet at that time was at Spelman.  The sculptor.  But in any event--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You mean Elizabeth Catlett.
Speaker 2: No!
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Elizabeth Prophet.
Speaker 1: Prophet!
Speaker 2: You never heard of her?
Speaker 1: No!
Speaker 2: Oh, she was a wonderful figure that--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Hmm.
Speaker 2: She pre-dates the Harlem Renaissance as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: And she spent a lot of her time in, in, in Europe.  As a matter of fact I think she died in Paris.  She may have.  She spent a lot of time in Paris.  In any event, they went out into the countryside and they painted the shanties and outhouses.  As a matter of fact, they called their group the 'Outhouse School.'  Which was like, you know, a play on Bauhaus the great German movement that was part of the 1919s and early 20s [1920s].  But that sense of social con--social consciousness  coupled with technical excellence was the thing that, that Howard taught.  There was a special thing that an African American artist had an opportunity to produce.  Because we were presented in such negative ways in the media at that time.  You know, the minstrel shows, the Sambo type characters in the movies and Stepin Fetchit and the Willie Best and that whole Hattie McDaniel kind of thing.  He recognized that artists, particularly visual artists could correct some of those, those stereotypes.  And combat them.  But beyond that he also wanted to establish the legitimacy of the pursuit of, of art as a career for an African American person.  And of course he and Woodruff and ultimately most artists in this country have to teach.  Black, white, no matter what color.  As a matter of fact, it's been said that the universities are the Medici of our age.  Because as the Medici then supported the Renaissance artists, so the, the universities now support us.  So, the whole notion of then the artist as an independent entrepreneur, independent worker, was one that he wanted to see in his lifetime.  Of course he never did.  But we have seen it.  There are a number of African American artists who are supporting themselves strictly with their art now.  Proportionately, in, in pretty good proportion to what the, the majority group artists are doing.
Story_ID: 6609
Speaker 1: Well, I told you there was [at Arkansas A.M. & N. College] a second teacher--
Speaker 2: George [Granville Monah] James, right?
Speaker 1: No, George James taught black, black history.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right but he--
Speaker 1: And African history.  But he was also--at least I read in one article that it said that he was, you know, also influential to you.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, no question about it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And your development.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know he wrote a book called 'Stolen Legacy', which talked about how the Greeks had been given credit in history for a whole lot of things that developed in Egypt.  He's another example of the kind of man who had you know studied at Oxford.  Had been every place, had done everything but yet he couldn't get work.  Except--and he died under very mysterious circumstances you know.  'Cause he had written something about the Masons down there. And, (pause) you know he died.  Very mysterious.
Speaker 1: He wrote something about the white--their white an
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No--the, the origins--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh!
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --of masonry--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --that challenged the existing conventional wisdom as to where it starts, and  what it really means, and that sort of thing.  I'm not suggesting anything untoward happened to him because he was very old.  But he was in great shape.  Great shape.  He walked about five ten miles everyday.  Hmm.
Speaker 1: Called it his constitutional.
Speaker 2: And what things did you learn from him from him you felt? Or you know, ways that he opened up your sort of mind (unclear)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) For example 'Tutankhamen' means 'I am life.'  'I am black.'  Did you know that?  Things like that.  So when you hear people say 'King Tut,' you realize that you know, that's a terrible thing to do.  Because it takes away the whole meaning of the name 'Tutankhamen'.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: He talked about other things, about the power of the pyramids.  He talked about how the stones were moved.  He talked about seeing men talk to other men hundreds of miles away using mirrors only.  This was a man with a Ph.D. and to hear that kind of talk, it just made you know that there are other worlds.  That there are other belief systems that just--are just as valid as the Western one.  And more in tune to our rhythms.  Those are the kinds of things that stay with you.

Speaker 1: There was [in the art department at Arkansas A.M. & N. College] a lady named Ivy Foster  whose son was--the Dr. Foster that Clinton tried to appoint as--. To be, uh, surgeon general?  Remember?  But anyway she taught weaving.  I hated weaving.  (whispering) I hated it.  And she made me do it.  Because she said, "This weaving, if you go through this discipline, you can do anything in art.  Because you hate this so."  And she made me make a rug and I just thought it was beneath me.  But it was such a good experience working with that texture, this texture and getting that rhythm in that loom you know?  I didn't ever--ever let her know that.  But it was a great lesson.  And it taught me discipline like I have to impose that on myself down here.  For example this painting (indicates large painting behind him) I'm have--I'm having to start this new--this painting all over again.  After I've shown it.  Because it didn't work.  So it's going--it's going--.  But that thing that Mrs. Foster made me go through is, is what makes me do that.  To go back and, and, and say, "Start all over again.  Take it apart and reassemble it."  That's what you had to do with that rug (laughs) you know, with that, that, thing that--I didn't even learn the proper terminology. I hated it so much.  But I made that rug.  I had to.

Speaker 1: You graduate [from Arkansas State Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, later University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff]--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1950-something [1958].
Speaker 1: It was after Brown v--versus Board of Education.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You said it was.
Speaker 2: Just after.
Speaker 1: So like maybe 1955 or 1950-?.
Speaker 2: In that area yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mid '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: And--and then your thought at that point is what?  That you're gonna come and join your family--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, sure, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And why?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But then John [M.] Howard [chairman of the art department at Arkansas AM & N] intervened.  And asked me to go down to Mississippi to start an art department down there.  Because they were having trouble down there.  The white schools had art, the black schools didn't.  And they had to have some one who could teach bla--art in the black school in Jackson--the black high school there [Lanier High School].  His dean at Alcorn where he went to college was the principal.  A legendary figure in Mississippi history. His name was-- I. S. Sanders.  His son later played with Stevie Wonder.  But in any event--played piano with Stevie--in any event, Sanders asked Howard to send him some one to establish an art program.  And Howard asked me to go to Mississippi.  Emmett Till had just been killed in Mississippi.  And I went down there.  And met Medgar Evers and was the only black teacher in Mississippi and a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]  Can you imagine the NAACP being considered a subversive organization?  And teachers not being able--black teachers not being able to belong to it?  I didn't know that.  But they had to have me.  Because they didn't have anybody else in the state qualified to teach art!  So they tolerated me for that year.  And I was going around the meetings with Medgar.  Because he was a good man.  And he was talking truth about what--It was a terrible place to be in, Mississippi.  Luckily I got drafted into the army out of there after a year.  But, one of the things that I find appalling was the, the fact that the black people in Mississippi accused--blamed Emmett Till for his death.  Said, "He should have known better."  (Pause).  (Whispering)  I was appalled.  I couldn't believe that.  I'd just left Chicago where there were three blocks--lines three blocks long to view his body.  And people going down there in caravans in cars with shotguns to avenge his death.  And the people in Mississippi saying, "That boy should have knowed better."  Just goes to show you, when you, you know, beat people down, they start to--they start to blame themselves for their posi--for their condition.  Of course that's not original (chuckling), (unclear) but I saw it firsthand.  I mean and, and it was frightening.  It was absolutely frightening.
Speaker 1: So in that process, you did establish a program that year?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Okay.  And do you think--you said it was lucky that you did get drafted.  Do you think you would have gotten in trouble?
Speaker 1: I know I would have.  Look at what happened to Medgar.  Not that I was doing what he was doing but I did go to meetings with him.  And speak up.  You know, I spoke up.  And I identified myself.  Because I knew--.  First of all, I didn't want to be there.  I went because John Howard asked me to go.  And I felt obligated to do it.  And I felt it would make a statement if I had gotten kicked out of there.
Speaker 2: What was Mississippi like compared to Arkansas?  I mean in many ways?  Was it a continuation?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) There was a palpable--there was a palpable oppression in the air in Mississippi.  You could feel it!  You could feel it!  It's like when I first went to Boston.  You can feel it there too!  Except in, in, in Boston, you feel that maybe you could defend yourself.  You know, maybe.  But in Mississippi, you knew it was hopeless.  But I met some great people down there.  And some great music.  Wonderful people!
Speaker 2: You mean just warm and caring?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.  And talented!  You know?  And just so acclimated to that pla--that way of life.  That they didn't even feel that they were indi--they were denying what they were living!  They, they wouldn't want to go down sta--downtown and buy anything where they--you know they wouldn't let them try on clothes. You'd have to buy the clothes without trying them on.  And if they didn't fit, it was damn--too damn bad!  That was the case here in [Washington] D.C. too, I understand.  That was never the case in Arkansas, that I knew about.
Story_ID: 6612
Speaker 1: So, when you got drafted, you said that you actually--did you say you got off?  I mean you sta--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I was in the Army.
Speaker 1: For--okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And then they came around and said, "We've got to have birth certificates.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right--! Okay. But so--I don't understand.  But, that's why I was conf--so you--they said you have to have--but you had already been drafted.
Speaker 2: Yeah!
Speaker 1: And then how--so--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Because I had, had to give an age when I registered for the draft.  And if you didn't register for the draft, you couldn't get a deferment from the Army.  From the draft!  You see?  You couldn't get a scholarship.  You couldn't do anything!  You had to have a Social Security number.  But I didn't know that you did--that you had to have a birth certificate.  But I made the best of the Army.  I had a suite of rooms in a Paris hotel and two French secretaries and I didn't wear a uniform.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) That was like totally over my head.  But no, anyway, where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: In Paris [France].
Speaker 1: Oh, you were--oh! So that's the--okay.  Oh, no wonder!  You had a ball there!
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: I was--I was drafted.  And I was sent to Fort Lee Virginia for a second--second level of basic training.  To be train--trained in P.O.L. Operations.  That's petroleum, oil and lubricants.  And I found out very soon after I got in there that just about everybody else in the company was a volunteer.  And just had high school diplomas and I was one of the few with a college degree like the officers.  So at night I would make speeches in the barracks about how we few were being drafted and other guys were getting two years lead on us?  So the officers called me in and asked me, "What's your problem?"  So I told them!  You're lose--"I'm losing two years!  And these silly people are asking me to do things in--you know peel potatoes and shoot a guns." They said, "Well, you become the--you be the company artist!  So you keep the scoreboard looking good, you know, where to shoot and where--and you don't have to do all that.  Just stop making speeches."
Speaker 1: So you had a nice time in the army.
Speaker 2: Well, then they had something they called guard duty in the army.  And they had--they always take more people than they need.  Because you don't know what--some guy may fall out walking around.  Okay.  Some guy may fall out walking around, you know.  So they have what they call supernumeraries.  Those are the guys who are sitting back drinking coffee just in case some one can't perform.  And then they go out.  Usually they just sit there all night and sleep.  So I found out about this.  And I also found out that you got to be a supernumerary by looking good, having your uniform spiffy and being able to answer questions about current events.  And I knew that I knew more than those guys in there who had the high school G.E.D.s.  So I got a guy to shine my shoes, you know--because I, I really didn't never get to that understand the spit shining thing.  And I had a uniform with creases and everything.  And so it came down to me and this other guy to be supernumeraries.  And they asked me what the colors in the American flag represented.  And the other guy didn't know.  And I was an artist.  And I didn't know either.  But I talked about color--and what red represented and what blue represented and what white repre--and by the time I finished, the sergeant had tears in his eyes.  So I became the colonel's orderly.  Which meant that on Saturday morning, when the colonel went out to inspect the troops, some soldier who was exemplary would ride with him in a jeep.  So we were riding around, me and the colonel.  And he said, "Well, soldier, how do you like the army?"  I said, "Well, you know sir if we go out this gate, you and I can't sit together like this."  And he was very upset.  He said, "You know your people live better in this country than any place else?"  I said, "I haven't been outside the country."  He said, "Well, where would you like to go?"  I said, "France, Paris."  He said, "Okay."  When basic training was over, everybody else went to Korea and Far East, and me and three other guys went to Paris.  And I had studied French in college.  And I lost that--I was actually stationed in Fontainebleau which is outside Paris.  And I was in a company that had very few people with skills.  It was with people who lifted oilcans and stuff.  This is what P.O.L. was. And the one guy  that was running the headquarters, the, the type--the clerk typist, was being transfer--discharged.  So they looked through all the company records.  They had people stationed all over Europe.  This petroleum oil company. And they didn't find anybody with any skills as a typist.  So the next thing they did was look at I.Q.'s and they--mine stood out.  So they said, "Well, he ought to be able to learn how to type."  So they took me to--shipped me to a place called Boussac La Forêt--'Boussac in the forest.'  Southern France.  Horrible place!  And I learned to type well enough to do the little things.  And I would carry on conversations with the French people who worked there, the secretaries and the janitors and what have you in French.  And one time, the guy who was the captain came through the office when I was conversing in French and he was from Mississippi, this white man.  And he said, "Boy, you speak Franch?"  Franch?"  I said, "Quelques mots--a few words, you know." He said, "I'll fix your ass!" and went into the office and he came back and he gave me orders to go to Paris to live in a French hotel, to get sixteen dollars a day for a clothing allowance.  Because the French wouldn't have you in Paris wearing an army uniform.  They thought you'd, you know, look like an occupier.  So you had to look like a civilian.  My job consisted of going to a French depot where we had air--av gas, aviation gas, jet fuel and all kind of stuff. We would rent storage tanks in these depots in France.  And of course we would tell the French people how much gasoline to put in tanks and then put the label on it and it would go to different parts of France or Germany, or Spain or wherever we had troops, air force and army.  So the job could be done really in about thirty minutes.  I'd go in there in the morning. I'd get the orders that came in from all over Europe.  I'd type it up with the other guy who was there.  Then we would supervise the French guys putting--loading in the stuff, make sure the labels were on the tanks and then they would go.  And then we were free to do whatever we want.  So I would put on a tight black suit, wet my hair and go into France--into Paris and pass as a French student from the Sudan or from Senegal or from Ethiopia or from Somalia--until I ran into somebody else from one of those countries.  Then I had to shift my nationality.  But the--it was important to do that because nobody wanted to have anything to do with a soldier.  So you had to make yourself a, you know, a student or something.  Also I was able to go to the Sorbonne [University of Paris] to classes!  Because they don't take attendance and they don't give a damn.  You know so you can sit up there.  As long as you don't make a disturbance, you can sit up there and draw all you want to.  So I was able to do that.  So the two--eighteen months over there weren't too bad.
Story_ID: 6613
Speaker 1: [While serving in the military in Paris, France]I was able to, to, to go to the Louvre  places I had read about, you know, I had--was able to see those great works firsthand.  That I, you know, I had seen them in the Art Institute in Chicago.  But not on the scale that you saw in the Louvre or in the Jeu de Paume, you know.  All those museums.  And then to go to the ateliers and to hang out with the musicians who were always coming over, you know.  And there were a lot of guys that stayed over there after World War II. And they were established.  There was a guy named Art Simmons who played piano in a place called--oh, I'm forgetting the name of it, some kind of cat.  And anyway, Nelson Rockefeller used to come there.  This Doris Duke woman used to come there.  And it always amazed me 'cause they left the so--the cars would be running the whole time that they were sitting in there.  Their limos would be running outside.  And it wasn't to keep the chauffeur warm or anything.  It's just that they didn't want to wait until the car could be started up to leave.  So they wanted the cars running when they walked out.  And I saw Miss [Eartha] Kitt over there, and Miss Ava Gardner over there with bullfighters and what have you.  It was very interesting.
Speaker 2: Did you ever--was--what was Josephine Baker doing at the time--
Speaker 1: She was down in southern France at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  (unclear).
Speaker 1: But I also got--had an opportunity to appear in a movie of, but the kibosh was put on it by the lady who was the star.  A black lady from here who was the star.  She had had a very unfortunate experience with a black man.  Married to a black man and she--
Speaker 2: Who was that?
Speaker 1: I won't name any names.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: I just won't.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: It was Miss [Dorothy] Dandridge.
Speaker 2: Oh!!! So she was in a movie then.
Speaker 1: A movie called 'Tamango'.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was gonna be Tamango.
Speaker 2: You were!!!
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  So what--how--did you rehearse with her and everything?
Speaker 2: No, no, no!  Never got to that stage.
Speaker 1: Okay, Okay.
Speaker 2: She, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, that would have been exciting!
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually, actually she didn't put the kibosh on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The French had passed a law that said you couldn't have more than one star from outside France--from one--any one country.  So they got Curd Jürgens from Germany.  They had Miss--Miss Dandridge from here and they had a boy from Haiti play Tamango.  So I was kidding.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay, I was wondering.  I'm like--
Speaker 2: But you know she had a big problem because of the experience that she'd had.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You mean with, with black men?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then there's that whole infamous affair she had with what's his name.
Speaker 1: Harold Nichols.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, she was married to Harold.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now, okay.  So you have this experience.  You know, you're--you've become very much international.  Um, did you hang around though, the people from Sudanese, you know from the Sudan--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Uh, no. No.
Speaker 2: You didn't?
Speaker 1: No because I, I was passing as a Sudanese.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I know, you said so.  Well, I thought you were studying, to pass.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) You passed and then--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.  Senegalese, you know, if they, if I found out they were Sudanese?  I would say I'm Senegalese.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) That's cute.  You know what, I can't believe and you were all B.S.ing the whole time (laughs) but--
Speaker 1: They were B.S.ing too!
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Because you know I--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You know it was very--it was very little work for black people at that time.  So you had to have something going you, you know if you were there.  You were a student or, you know underworld or gigolo or some'n.  Because they weren't gonna hire you for anything, you know, unless you were in show business.
Story_ID: 6614
Speaker 1: So you came back [from being stationed in France while in the Army].  Did you go to Chicago [Illinois] immediately?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Okay
Speaker 1: Yeah. Oh yes.  Because most of your family is there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, your mother is she in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: She's still in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She never lived in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh (unclear).
Speaker 2: She didn't like it.
Speaker 1: So you got there and then did--is that when you go to I.I.T. [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right. When I got out of college, I mean out of the army, I had the G.I. Bill.  So I used it there.  Went to I.I.T. in studio design.  They had great people there at that time.  Like Aaron Siskind and Richard Koppe, Cosmo Compoli--
Speaker 1: Did you mention Misch Cohn?
Speaker 2: Misch Cohn, yeah.  Yeah.  A great printmaker.  So I really benefited a great deal from that experience.  The Bauhaus system of, of art making was very much--has been very useful for me.
Speaker 1: Can you--can you just talk about that a little bit.  Because you've mentioned it several times?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Basically it's, it's, it's--"form follows function."  You've heard that.  And "Less is more" and that kind of thing.  And you know about [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe architecture and that sort of thing.  And basically just about all the utensils that we have today are Bauhaus  inspired, much of the furniture.  And I can relate that very much to--you know they, they emphasized materials and being true to the material and using the material and bringing out what's in the material. That's so very African, you know.  So very African!  And in so much, you know, it's just something that I just like and just feel.  'Cause you know you--there's no such thing as non-utilitarian art in Africa.  You know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you are not gonna move on that stool anymore--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I'm not.
Speaker 1: I told you I promised and you promised me.
Speaker 2: Now, I'm gonna get like this and I'm stopping.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  Now, there's also at this point there is some there--.  Okay, see--what year did you finish I.I.T.?  I'm sorry, you said '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sixty-, '63 [1963]. Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 6615
Speaker 1: Are you meeting peop--other people--you're meeting a lot of other artists.
Speaker 2: At that time [early 1960s] I'm showing a lot in Chicago at art fairs.  Outdoor art fairs.  And meeting a lot of people.  Yeah.  And it was at that time that I started talking to people about starting a movement.  Because my art hist-, my teaching had--my-- experience--educational experience as far as an artist was concerned taught me that all art has to be a part of a school.  Right? It doesn't exist otherwise.  Because you got to have a frame of reference.  So I was always talking with other artists.  "Let's start something, you know. Let's start a school of art."  And people would say, "Yeah, that's interesting.  That sounds good."  But nobody wanted to really (unclear) it.  And then we started an organization around 1966 or '67 [1967] called OBAC  in Chicago.  Which was an organization made up of, of well, Hoyt Fuller who was editor of  'Negro Digest', later became 'Black World'.  Gerald McWorter [Abdul Alkalimat] was the spearhead of, of the organization.  He was a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Chicago at the time. Conrad Kent Rivers who was a poet from Ohio died under cir--. Horrible circumstances.  He drank himself really, chugalugging liquor with--somebody. And anyway, the whole idea behind OBAC, it stood for Organization of Black American Culture, was to use the talents that we had homed in the interest of the movement--in the interest of the forward movement, thrust of black people.  More specifically to organize artists in Chicago so that they could make contributions to the struggle.  And I was assigned the job of organizing the visual art workshop.  Hoyt took the writers.  Somebody else --Val [Grey Ward] had Kuumba [Theatre Company].  Abena Joan Brown was involved.  Anne Smith, Dr. Anne Smith at the Illinois--University of Illinois--. That's someone you should talk to.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Definitely some one you should talk to.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: E. Duke McNeill who she was married to at the time--was--strange, strange interlude. A number of us.  And I was able to attract some artists to the Visual Art Workshop.  Among them, Wadsworth Jarrell, Norman Parish, Bill Walker Myrna Weaver, Barbara Jones-Hogu.  It's always a problem when you start naming names because you gonna leave somebody out--Elliot Hunter who died right after we really got started.  I mentioned Bill Walker, William Walker?
Speaker 1: I don't know if you did Bill Walker.
Speaker 2: Bill Walker became very important in the group because he wa--it was his idea that we paint a wall--that we all endorsed.  Edward Christmas was another one of the artists. And then you had the photographers like Bobby [Robert] Sengstacke and Roy Lewis, and Abernathy, Bill Abernathy and  Darrell Cowherd (ph.) (Pause.) I've forgotten one of the very important photographers in the group.
Speaker 1: Is he still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah. He's still around.  He's still in Chicago and he had to leave the project early.  Because he was dodging the--
Speaker 1: The draft?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Hmm!  I wonder who it is.  I know some of the photographers uh--.
Speaker 2: He's now working in television.
Speaker 1: Television.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I've forgotten.  I can't think of his name.  I know it as well as I know my own.  Maybe at some point I'll think of it.
Story_ID: 6616
Speaker 1: People in the A.A.C.M. [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians] were very, very close to the group that--well, first of all, let me explain about OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture].  We had a meeting at the Lincoln Center in which I introduced the idea of a Visual Art Workshop and invited photographers and artists to come.  And that's was the group. The OBAC Visual Art Workshop that began meeting.  We--my idea was to start a school of art.  To bring together all these artists, see what we all shared in terms of the visualization and try to see if we can use those things that we had in common.  And create something that was distinctly ours, that-- a school, a style.  And the only thing really we could agree on was the fact that we wanted to use our talents in the interests of the movement.  So the Wall of Respect project became an ideal project, I thought would bring the group together and perhaps we could after that establish a, a movement or a school.  But I did not anticipate what went on in 1967 in Chicago when the FBI started something called COINTELPRO.  We--You know, that was a guerri--guerilla mural--mural.  In other words we didn't ask permission to paint the building.  The building was owned by a guy who didn't live in the neighborhood, who didn't come in the neighborhood.  So we just commandeered it.  And painted it.  He came by after we started it because, you know, there was a great deal of publicity generated in the local press.  And it went from there to the 'Washington Post',  'New York Times' and even stories in 'Der Spiegel' in Germany and all kinds--all over the world, actually.  It became bigger than anything any of us had ever envisioned.  People were coming from every place to look.  And at that time, 1967, J. Edgar Hoover began something called COINTELPRO. Counter Intelligence Propaganda.  And they invaded groups like Students of the Democratic Society [Students for a Democratic Society], the white group, the Weathermen, and they also infiltrated all the black groups that they could infiltrate.  And the idea was to use an old communist trick--to get into a group, create dissension within group, and let them destroy each other.  And that's what happened to the OBAC Visual Art Workshop.  We imploded after that wall was completed.  What started out as a extreme camaraderie and fraternity and brotherhood and sisterhood turned into meetings where we were all packing hate.  Because we would get letters purporting to, to identify people as spies, as informants and stuff, and "The next time you get up on that scaffold to paint, you'll be shot down." And all kinds of things.  One guy showed up with a new car.  And everybody was then given the impression that he had taken a big chunk of money from Sammy Davis, Jr. because Sammy Davis, Jr. was gonna do a commercial in front of the wall to promote Robert Kennedy's candidacy for president.  So that was another thing.  So ultimately the Organization of Black American Culture Visual Art Workshop imploded.  Because we had all kinds of people coming to the meetings and expressing all kinds of weird things--people who were not involved with the wall at all.  But what happened was after that, over the next three or four years, more than 1200 of these murals were done in every major city in the country.  Particularly in the North, in the East and in the West.  And a few in the South.  And it has spread even into other areas of the world.  For example the Europeans give us credit for having started the street mural thing that encourages revolution and, and, and retribution, not revenge.  And celebrating. Actually ours was just a celebration of the greatness of black people.  It was a Negro history mural really.  But the fact that it was done outside on a two story building 60 feet long and 30 feet high made Mayor [Richard J.] Daley and the powers that be in, in Chicago very uncomfortable.  And [Congressman] Ralph Metcalfe chose the Wall of Respect, you know, to announce his break with the re--[Chicago] Democratic machine.  Shortly after that, that whole area was condemned and that building was torn down that had the Wall of Respect on it. And of course the neighborhood was in a tizzy over that.  And so the city promised that they would build a recreational center or something there and do all kinds of things on that site.  And as of today [2001] that's a vacant spot at 47th [sic, 43rd] and Langley in Chicago.  There's a little plaque that's almost overgrown with weeds talking about that's where the Wall of Respect was.
Speaker 2: So can you talk about--a little bit about--'cause it is a high I'm sure--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--in the group when you were doing it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: And can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Haki [Madhubuti, formerly Don L. Lee] and the poets from OBAC would come out and recite.  Gwen [Gwendolyn] Brooks wrote a poem about the wall.  She recited at the wall.  The A.ACM would play.  Darlene Blackburn and her group would dance.  Kuumba [Theatre Company] would come out and emote.  We had crowds like people going to a rock show watching us paint.  There's a picture in 'Ebony'--I'll show you when we're finished--that shows you the kind of, of, of crowd that came out daily to see what was going on.  Now it's ironic that when we went to this site, the only thing on that wall was a gang tag identifying that it's a gang's turf.  That gang never left.  And they never disturbed us working.  As a matter of fact, we were able to leave our scaffold up, our paints and our brushes and everything in situ on the spot overnight.  Nobody ever touched any paint.  Nobody ever touched a ladder.  Nobody touched the scaffold, anything.  And when the project was completed, the gang started to extort money from people to come and look at the wall.  Even the photographers who came to take pictures of the, the wall that they had the pictures on.  It actually Nishi- Nitchi, Nitshi, what's the German uh--
Speaker 2: Ni--Ni--
Speaker 1: [Friedrich Wilhelm] Nietzsche
Speaker 2: Right Nietzsche.
Speaker 1: Said there's nothing more uncontrollable than something new coming into the world.  And that people who--I'm paraphrasing.  But people who bring something new into the world should be aware of the fact that they don't control the consequences of that.  So that Wall of Respect was a great thing that happened.  And people all over the world plugged into it.  Particularly groups that had a gripe.  But on the home turf where it really went down it destroyed a neighborhood. Now I don't know where those people went.  But they, they cleared that area out.  And if you go there now, they still haven't rebuilt it.  It's almost like the land is scorched earth, you know?  And what happened after that was really bizarre because all the--just about all the people that I've been mentioning were offered jobs some place else. All the whole AACM went to New York.  The group that's there now is the second or third generation of AACM.  I was offered a job here at Howard [University] and when I got here, I got a call from somebody who didn't identify themselves who said, "Are you satisfied now?  And will you keep your big mouth shut? (pause)  Do you like your job? You're making a lot of money?  You got a good position?"
Speaker 2: Hmm.  That's very interesting.  Hmm!  You hear these things--
Speaker 1: Oh! It's, it's, it's absolutely true.  And it wasn't just--They were equal opportunity oppressors.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, it's true.
Speaker 1: They got everybody.
Speaker 2: Right. Right.  So now--so you came--But you came here [to Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: In '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 6617
Speaker 1: AFRICOBRA was formed in '68 [1968] when, when,--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) In '68 [1968] when you--
Speaker 1: --when OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] imploded.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: I realized you could not build a [artistic] school around a project.  You had to have a program.  So I gathered together kindred spirits from that experience that I knew were interested in something beyond a project.  And we set out to establish a set of principals that we would work with and elements that we would work with and try to promote a certain agenda, that had a political aspect as well as an aesthetic one.  And that was AFRICOBRA.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And AFRICOBRA stood--well, there were two, two.  But there wer--it stood for what?
Speaker 1: It stood for--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, the afri--
Speaker 1: The African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists.
Speaker 2: (Laughs)
Speaker 1: But it also stood for Black Revolu--African Commune of Black Revolutionary Artists.
Speaker 2: Now was there a lot of discussion about that?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You know, afterwards?  I mean--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  First of all--
Speaker 2: You were aware that you had imploded.  I mean that's one thing.
Speaker 1: Oh, no question about it.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: People were carrying weapons against each other and threatened each other's lives! It was very serious.
Speaker 2: But do you think you were aware of what, what had really happened? 'Cause a lot of groups didn't realize what happened at the time.  Its years later--
Speaker 1: We didn't know who was behind it!
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We knew what was going on.  Because it was going on all over the country.  It happened in California.  You remember the US Group out there and the Black Panther group were fighting against each other?  They would shoot and yell "Black Panther"?  And then they would go to the other neighborhood and shoot and yell "US"? And then they'd fight among themselves.  And you know, that kind of thing took a lot of lives.  Took a lot of energy and destroyed a lot of careers.  And it was an awful time.  An awful time.  And I still can't get the records and the file that they created on me back there in 1960.
Speaker 2: Even using the Freedom of Information Act.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's right.  They have two caveats.  One: If what they have on you is a part of a continuing investigation; they don't have to reveal their sources.  And two: If what they have on you will reveal the name of a confidential informant.  So what does it do?  It makes you distrust everybody you know.  Because you know only that person could be reporting on you.  Somebody who knows you.  So you're very cynical toward all your friends. And secondly, you're very nervous because they say it may be a part of an ongoing investigation.  And then to cap it off, they wrote down there "But you needn't be worried.  We only have two references to, to you and it's in somebody else's file."  Now I'm supposed to buy that?  If it's so--if it's so unimportant, why don't they give it to me?
Story_ID: 6618
Speaker 1: When AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists]  started, I mean this whole thing--You had now, um, Wadsworth [Jarrell], he had been part of--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The Wall of Respect?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) The Wall of Respect and so had Barbara Jones [Hogu].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But I also had heard the name Nelson Stevens was--
Speaker 2: Nelson joined later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nelson joined right after,--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: --we got started.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was really the three of you. You being--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, it was me, Wadsworth Jarrell--actually the core group included Nelson Stevens, the first time we showed as an AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] group.  We had shown with other people but we never called ourselves AFRICOBRA.  But we always had that in mind, that we would be an entity.  We would have a group.  Nelson was teaching at Northern Illinois University. And he had come to Illinois from Ohio from Cleveland.  So he became a part of the group and so did Napoleon Jones Henderson who was in Chicago.  Omar Lama who's still in Chicago.  Beck.  What's Beck's name?  Sherman Beck is still in Chicago.  I think he still works for Johnson Illustrations.  Carolyn Lawrence, and Jae Jarrell and Gerald (ph.) Williams.  There were ten of us.
Speaker 1: And so what was--so this--you had decided that you--so what were--what were you going to be doing?  I mean you had a manifesto.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And the manifesto it says was written by you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughs) and I read some place that it was extre--that's how someone described it as sort of extreme accomplishment thus far.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: But what were the--what were the critical parts of what--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We talked about how would we use color, how we'd use design, what, what kinds of inspiration we'd be looking for, what kinds of subject matter we'd, we'd find appropriate for what we were doing. That sort of thing.  And more than anything else, we wanted to create art that was affordable.  Prints that people could afford who did not have the resources to buy original art.  So we tried to make things that were susceptible and, and adaptable I should say to printmaking.
Speaker 1: And you said you had a technical, you know, quality or, you know, the, the, tec--technical--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Excellence should be balanced with--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: With social responsibility.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So more than zeal was needed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But see around this time you had people painting, you know, black figures on velvet--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you had--you had--you know you had different things--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --happening around that time.
Speaker 2: And it was all good!
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Because it created a consciousness of art!  And peoples who put up those little cheap posters in their college dorm rooms you know, now are middle class and buying, you know--so we created a mar--a market really.  And it, it took the Elvis type velvet paintings, you know, to make people see a difference between quality and schlock.
Speaker 1: So now how were you--this is just a question like--it's the one like Richard Hunt who was not part of this group.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now Richard had already been established.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The thing about us is none of us had a name.  None of us had anything to lose.  But Richard had been the fair-haired boy of the Chicago Art Institute since he was in high school.  Yeah.  Incidentally he's a wonderful artist, and, and a good friend.  And, I see him as a mentor too even though I may even be--I'm sure I'm as old if not older than he is.
Story_ID: 6619
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to cap--capture AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists]--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --because it was critical for its--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  We would meet often.  Often.  Sometimes more than once a week if people had things to show.  And we would critique each other's work on the basis of those principals that we outlined and those--the direction that we had stated as the way we were gonna go.  That was very helpful.  You know?  It was the kind of thing that, that Bauhaus--the Bauhaus had done.  On a grand scale in--because they were into furniture and architecture and everything.  We were just into visual art.  But we also tried to create a kind of a guild-like atmosphere, a family kind of thing really.  That's why we called it a commune.  Not the communist.  We had no, no desire to do anything that had anything to do with communists.  Because in our experience, black people who flirted with socialism just got the social part and none of the other.  And we didn't need that.  So it was not about communism.  It was nothing about--.  We wanted to make America America.  We liked the way it looked on paper.  We wanted to make it real.
Speaker 1: And you were drawing from--you were saying that there was a continuity--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --between you know--between Africa and the other--and the contemporary (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well that, that's something that I learned in FESTAC. [FESTAC '77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, in Lagos, Nigeria]
Speaker 1: Okay, but FESTAC was seven years past that.  Or even longer--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: 'Cause you said '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: This is almost nine year--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, but we started FESTAC in '72 [1972], planning it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we suffered through three coups d'états, before it actually came to fruition in '77 [1977].  And all that time, we were traveling back and forth to Africa and seeing things.  And seeing commonalities in the way people were painting there and the way we were painting here.  We saw as many Malcolm X paintings at FESTAC from outside the United States as we saw from artists here.  Because people had identified with the struggle.  And we were in the forefront of what was going on worldwide as far as people on the colonial conditions and under segregated conditions such as we were under all over the world!  They, they saw what we were doing as being, you know a vangard.  And be--and, and you can trust me on this.  The same problems that the cities experienced in this country in the '60s [1960s] are gonna be felt in Paris and in London and in Germany because they're getting--developing critical masses of black people in those areas and they are giving them the same kind of treatment they gave us here.  And it won't work.  They're gonna have the same kind of thing in this decade that what--happened here forty years ago.
Story_ID: 6620
Speaker 1: Because you're an academic--I, I figure I can ask you this question but what when you look back at AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists]--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: I mean if you can have that distance since you started, what would you say is its importance was or--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Was? Is!
Speaker 1: Is, is.  Okay.
Speaker 2: First, I think it is important to show that people could sublimate their individualism to a group idea as artists.  And of course artists are respected because of their individuality in this culture particularly.  So for artists to come together and say "We're gonna make group efforts and we're gonna criticize each other and promote each other and push each other." That is quite different from what we were taught in school.  So it was very difficult for us to sit there and listen to people heap criticism on the work.  Because that was not something that we had been accustomed to.  Now we had critiques in college.  But those were very polite.  Believe me, our meetings were not polite.  They were very rough.
Speaker 1: Give an example.  So were you trying to--I mean--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, people were--people were being criticized for a type of subject matter that they did.  You know, we didn't--want to do any "Lord have mercy" kind of work, you know.  For example, this work here.  Aunt Jemima and the Pillbury's--Pillsbury doughboy.  I did--started that work the day of the March on Washington [1963].  Because I like everybody else was very impressed with all of that pomp and circumstance and the wonderful speech by Martin Luther King.  But I was very disappointed because no marching orders were given.  I mean, you know later Mr. Mohammad--Elijah Mohammad told me if he had ever had that many people listening to him, he'd never have to march again.  But in any event, (chuckle) I knew that after that that the struggle would then revert to the streets.  The minions.  The people who had no voice would express themselves in a violent way because we were being treated violently.  The police were brutal!  Even the black police!  [James] 'Gloves' Davis and his type, you know.  'Gloves' Davis was the guy who was involved with the killing of--what's his name?  Fred Hampton.  Bur--boasted of it.  You know, West Side cop.  He had been infamous for years over there on the West Side.  But in any event, that was the first of many Aunt Jemima paintings that were done in this country.  And the notion was the minions.  Those with no voices.  Those with no stake, really. Who had nothing to lose were gonna rise up and they were gonna have to do battle with the forces that are put there to protect those who have from those who have not.  And that's the police.  So that's, that's how that one, one started.  But that was before AFRICOBRA.  That's what you'd call protest painting.  We were doing propaganda.  So for example there's a painting over here called God Bless the Child.  And it shows a guy in an army uniform standing juxtaposed against a guy in street clothes.  A street dude.  And the idea is are you gonna fight in Vietnam or are you gonna fight in the streets here?  Because we had battles going in both places.  That was the kind of thing that AFRICOBRA would deal with.  Raise that question.  Do you go over there and fight or do you fight here?  Where do you have the most to gain?  Where do you have the most to lose?  So we tried to be more sophisticated in what we had to say on it. We were not saying "Have mercy on us, be good to us because we're nice people."  We were saying, "We are a force to be reckoned with."  We helped to build this country--we're fighting for it in every damned war this country has ever had on both sides of the damned Civil War even.  So, we came to the--to the table with food.  We didn't come to just eat.  We brought things here.  Skills, we brought labor and we worked 350 years for nothing here!  You know?  So we had no, no illusions about the goodness of the American people.  We recognized that the people who came here took this land from the people who had it!  Because they had a superior force.  And in the cities, we had superior numbers!  It was our terrain.  It was our turf and particularly in the night.  As a matter of fact, a guy wrote a poem called "We Own the Night" during that time--what's his name?  Jimmy Garrett from the West Coast.  He was a member of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  Very active in SNCC.
Story_ID: 6621
Speaker 1: Who were the forces influencing you?  Was it the black power, you know was it the black power movement?  Was it--was it Muslims?  Was it, was it--I mean there are all these--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm! Um-hmm!
Speaker 1: Was it--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We [AFRICOBRA, African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] were part of the black power movement.
Speaker 1: You were part of the black power movement.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.  No question about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And related to organizations like SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  We were friends of SNCC in Chicago. CORE [Congress on Racial Equality].  We didn't have too much to do with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or with Martin Luther King's organization.  But we were very respectful of the [Black] Muslims.  Because given our experience, turning the other cheek was not solving any--would not solve any problems.  And if you were conscious during Martin Luther King's lifetime, you know that he's being treated quite differently in death than the life he led and the life he--And the way he was treated.  J. Edgar Hoover called him "the lyingest man in America."  While he [Hoover] was sitting around wearing dresses.  I mean--and then the alternative would have been Malcolm [X].  So once Martin was killed, he becomes the savior.  He becomes the people that you name all the--the man you name all the streets for.  And have you noticed the worst neighborhoods in the country all have a Martin Luther King Boulevard?  The very worst ones.  The most dangerous areas are named for the man of peace.  What a slap in the face!
Speaker 1: There was an article recently that I read--you know that talked about that that appeared I think in the Tribune, you know, talked about that.  But--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The Tribune!
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Is that right?!
Speaker 1: Um-hmm!
Speaker 2: Chicago Tribune!
Speaker 1: Chicago Tribune. Yeah!
Speaker 2: Is that right!
Speaker 1: (Laughs)
Speaker 2: Things do change!
Speaker 1: They do change! Yeah!  The Chicago Tribune is--in fact, they're like our, our media spots or whatever but--they also--They've been trying really--they're do--doing it in a different way but they--are sort of trying to change their image, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Oh!  They have a lot of work to do.
Speaker 1: They still have a lot of work to do, it's true.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm!
Speaker 1: So you--so you identify with the black power movement.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: So was everyone in the group also politically active as well?  Was it--were the things for it--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) More or less.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Some more or less, some less.  I was very politically active.  I'll just leave it at that.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you find--did you feel that the--that being--were you saying essentially that art and politics and social action was all one in the same?
Speaker 1: [W.E.B.] DuBois said that.  Remember?  DuBois said, "All art is political although all politics is not art."  I mean when you make a. a painting of a thousand Campbell Soup Cans, that's a political statement!  It talks about the ability of a country to mass-produce, to make the same thing no matter how bland it is over and over and over, the same way?  It says something about a psyche, about a culture, you know?  There's no--there's nothing innocent about art.  There's nothing apolitical about art.  Even when you try to be apolitical you're being political.  (Unclear) And that's not to say you have to be a Democrat, or you have to be a conservative, or you have to be a liberal.  But it is political in that it touches the lives of other people.  And it doesn't come alive until another person, the significant other, responds to it.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: I mean these pictures don't exist if nobody else sees them except me.
Speaker 2: So in these things--in these sessions, people were really hard on people to stay to the mission.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 2: You know and to stay true to the mission.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And also we had theme that we explored together.
Speaker 2: Like?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Theme pieces--like the black family was the first piece we all did.  Because we felt that the f--black family was under attack. [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan had just written that book ['The Moynihan Report', 'The Negro Family: The Case for National Action', 1965]  that talked about the black family being fragmented as if there had--there had been no slavery.  You know?  The very thing that destroyed the black family and kept it separated was the very thing that this man was promoting.  So that was something we dealt with.  Because we, we saw the black families being more than a man and a woman and a child.  But families can be distant cousins and surrogate fathers and surrogate mothers and the guy who delivers the ice.  The extended family thing was very much alive in, in the communities in the South and in the North when I was growing up.  So that was the kind of thing that we were doing.  A new reality.  A new way of looking at what people were, were, are, are seeing.  A new way.  And more than anything else, we wanted to express African-ness in the work.
Story_ID: 6622
Speaker 1: Would--why--AFRICOBRA[African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists]?.  It struck me that it couldn't've come out of a city other than Chicago.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm!
Speaker 1: And I was wondering--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm!
Speaker 1: --if you could talk about the f--you know, the forces that were at work that would allow something like that to happen.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, there--Chicago--you recall, jazz didn't take off until it hit Chicago.  (pauses)  It may have started down South and come up North but it--and blues didn't either!  All the great blues singers ended up in Chicago. Muddy--From Muddy Waters, Big Bill [Broonzy], you name them!  Howlin Wolf!  The guy who played the twelve string--twelve string.  Jimmy  [Reed] what's his name on the West Side?
Speaker 1: Uh, oh! I know 'cause I was just over with Maxwell Street.  I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm! Um-hmm! But I--what I'm saying to you is Chicago is a hub and at one time planes didn't fly over Chicago.  Trains didn't--trains still have to stop in Chicago and connect.  So it's, it's a--it's a place where a lot of energy--a lot of energy is generated.  People come from everywhere to Chicago you know.  And particularly whole communities from the South.  Like that area around 48th and St. Lawrence where we lived?  Just about everybody that's around there was from Arkansas.  You know?  Yeah! Vincennes all the way over to Forestville, all the way over to Langley!  Just about everybody (laughs) 46, 47, 48th Street, just about everybody came from, from that area.  And you went to the West Side and all those people from Mississippi, and, and there's a, there's an energy in Chicago.  And a sense of--you remember when Harold Washington ran [for mayor]?  His, his motto was "It's our turn".  And I don't think any place else in the country, anybody would have run for office on that same thing.  (pauses) And I think there's something about that city that makes for people who come to you more like, straightforward.  Hard--when it was a hard blue-collar town.  And you had all those industries and the steel mill and the, and the, and the stockyards.  I mean those were people who worked with their hands and their muscles and they didn't have time to bullshit.  Here for example in Washington [D.C.], nothing is made except paper.  Paper, paper, paper, paper.  That's all!  They don't do nothing else here in a company town!  And the company is the government.  You can be arrested 25 different ways in Washington.  That is to say about 25 different police forces.  They got that many here.  At least!  (pauses)  You count the FBI and the CIA, the embassy police, the congressional police, the Metro police, you name it!  (pauses)  "Chicago, city of the bo--big shoulders."  It's a tough town.
Speaker 1: So out of this town and out--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --but it's also--always--it, it, it's always been a creative place.  For everybody who's there.  Not just black people.  Everybody whose there!  Great writers came out of Chicago you know.  Some of the greatest writers this country has produced came out of that area.  Musicians, artists, athletes.  It's, it's, it's a place that's a magnet and it's a place that has sent forth people to do things.  I guess that's true with a lot of places but when we were in Chicago, man, there was something going on.  There was stuff going on.  That was--the melting lava flowing.  Creative lava juices flowing every place.  You know there was a time when Second City--when Second City was at its apex in Chicago from the other side, you know?  And all those people who went on to New York to Saturday Night Live and stuff they came out of Chicago.  We were contemporaneous with a group called the Hairy Who.  I don't know if they are still around.  From the North Side.  And had exchanges with them. Don Baum and people like that.  You know Don?  A nice guy.  Yeah.  It's an interesting--it's an interesting town!  It's, it's, it's a place where I'm sure I'm gonna end up.  And I really don't have a lot of dis--I don't dislike this place.  It's just that the rhythm here is so different!  And it's slow.  And never it--it's all smoke and mirrors.  You know?  Nothing is what it seems to be.
Story_ID: 6623
Speaker 1: 1968 you said you [Organization of Black American Culture] imploded.  Okay--
Speaker 2: It was '67 [1967].  Late '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) In '67 [1967] you did the Wall of Respect.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you didn't implode unt--did you implode then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the one and only thing the OBAC Visual Art Workshop did.  That was it.
Speaker 1: And so then--but in 19--but at the--At least the group that trusted each other still came together with some new people.
Speaker 2: That was--became the nucleus for AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists].
Speaker 1: AFRICOBRA.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: The--but then AFRICOBRA, it lasted really until you--you at this time though you're--you've gone--you're also getting your PhD. at Northwestern [University].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --during the time of--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) During--in art history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now, why did you feel that that was important because back to this teaching--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Because I wanted to be able to make statements that other people would have to refute.  When you have a PhD., you can do that.  I also knew that nobody else in the world had ever gotten a PhD. in African American art history.  And Northwestern was willing to support my doing that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So what--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) So I got the first degree anybody ever got in African American art history.
Speaker 1: So what did you do your, your research,  your doc-- your disser--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) On, on a group I call 'Generation 306.'  A group of artists living in Harlem during the Great Depression.  And I compared them with the artists of the so-called Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 1: So they were the artists that came after the Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: Oh!  So what were those artists?  Who were they?
Speaker 2: Romare Bearden.
Speaker 1: Okay!
Speaker 2: Jacob Lawrence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charles Austin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So all of them--okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charlie White in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Sure.  But Ch--right, in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Margaret Burroughs.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But New York tries to claim them.
Speaker 2: Charlie didn't--Charlie is a Chicago man.
Speaker 1: (Laughs)  I knew he couldn't--
Speaker 2: New York doesn't claim him. California tried to claim him.
Speaker 1: I thought this--'cause  I saw him in a book--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--he ended up in L.A.
Interviewer: you know that the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York] had. And I said, "He's a Chicago man."
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah he--he got TB in New York and almost died!
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Lost a lung! Lost his wife!  And that's another story though isn't it?
Speaker 1: (Chuckling). So, so you--so you, you went and did this program.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They, they, they paid for me to go all over the country and talk to [Hale] Woodruff and Bearden and all those people.  And it was Bearden who inspired my work and he served as adjunct advisor.  Because they really didn't have anybody at Northwestern who knew African American art.  They had a guy there who was great--Will--Frank Willett.  And I went there to study with him to study African art.  But I learned that all the books on African art had been written by Europeans!  And I said, "This is terrible.  I can't learn this!  I mean I may have to unlearn this!  And then I said, "Why don't I do something in this field that I know something about and that I have a vested interest in?"  And I went to my professors Jim [James D.] Breckenridge and Bob [Robert H.] Strotz who was president at Northwestern at the time all thought it was great.  And they put all the resources of that great institution behind my doing it.  They made me take all the European art that they taught.  Because that's all they had.  And once again that discipline that Ivy Foster [an instructor in his undergraduate art studies] forced me to helped me there.  Because I had to--I had to go through that.  But I ended up knowing more than they did because I know the black part as well as the European part.
Speaker 1: So what was that whole experience like?  You know you have, you have exposure to Romare Bearden.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You're going around meeting all these other artists--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.  And interviewing them.
Speaker 1: And interviewing them which is similar to this experience.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So that was, that was a pretty--pretty much of a (unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes indeed.  Yes indeed.  Yes indeed. I learned so many things.  I still have to do the book.  You know?  I still have to do the book on some of the things I learned.  I went through some tough times.  You know all those people, Dick Wright?  Richard Wright?  Chester Hines, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Charlie Parker--they were all contemporaneous you know!  I interviewed one guy for example named Charles Austin.  He went to Betty--Betsy--Bessie Smith's last recording and Billie Holliday's first.  Can you imagine that?  (pauses)
Speaker 1: So what in this process, this made you more--you brought--would you bring this information to AFRICOBRA?--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Then, and that, that would be--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And you know you learn so much.  For example did you know that all that great work that was done in the so-called Harlem Renaissance in, in Broadway they had to wear blackface?  The black performers? on Broadway?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You've heard of the great show called 'Shuffle Along'?
Speaker 1: Of course I have.
Speaker 2: You know they did it in blackface?
Speaker 1: I didn't know about that.
Speaker 2: That's the kind of thing that is not written about.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And the black people couldn't go to the Cotton Club as patrons.  And the performers had to enter through the back door.  And you had to be a certain tone in order to be in the chorus line if you were a woman.  That was true at Howard, too you know.
Story_ID: 6624
Speaker 1: So, but then that breaks up when you co--I mean really you ship off [1970]--I mean you say the group implodes but you-- you're here at Howard [University].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well now, that was OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] that imploded. Not--OBAC.
Speaker 1: No, I know but, but AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Not AFRICOBRA didn't implode.
Speaker 1: But AFRICOBRA--even though you ended up--even though--let's see.  Nelson Ste--did he stay there?
Speaker 2: At one time were all in D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: One summer.
Speaker 1: Napoleon [Jones-Henderson] though--
Speaker 2: Yeah he was here too.
Speaker 1: He was here?
Speaker 2: One summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We were all here [at Howard University] at one time.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Because--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --except Barbara [Jones-Hogu].  By that time Barbara was out of the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And Carolyn [Lawrence], too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But yes, I came here and then I hired J--Wadsworth [Jarrell]. Gerald Williams came here as a student, got a master's degree.  Jae Jarrell got a master's degree. Wadsworth got a master's degree.  Frank Smith from Howard and Nelson [Stevens] went to Massachusetts.  Napoleon went to Boston.  I went to New York.  Oh no.  A guy joined later from New York, Adger Cowans.  The--we were spread basically over the east coast.  (telephone ringing)
Speaker 1: (Unclear) That's the office?.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know AACM, you know.  I know (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --but I didn't know that AFRICOBRA (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Um, so--
Speaker 2: There are--James Phillips.  There are four of us in town now.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And then Murry [N.] DePillars is in Richmond.  Nelson Stevens is in Mass.  What's his name, Napoleon is now down in North Carolina at Bennett College. And Michael [D.] Harris is in North Carolina at North Carolina--University of North Carolina. And Adger Cowans is in, Adger Cowans is in New York--
Speaker 1: New York.
Speaker 2: Wadsworth Jarrell is no longer in the group.  So there were--there are seven of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. Hmm.
Speaker 2: Right.  Eight of us now.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 6625
Speaker 1: Is its philosophy [of AFRICOBRA] still the same?  Is it still has its (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Its philosophy is still the same, but many of the things that we've tried to accomplish have been accomplished.  So it--you know you got to find something else to do.
Speaker 1: So there--is there, that discussion going on now?
Speaker 2: All the time.  All the time.
Speaker 1: And what, what, what is the tone?
Speaker 2: I'm very much interested in reparations .  And some of the others seem to be interested, too.  But how-- what do you do with that?  You know?
Speaker 1: I'm very interested in reparations myself.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But I'm, I'm also interested in, in, in another thing.  You ever hear of Nat Turner?  You ever hear of anything named for him?  No schools?  No streets?  He was a hero. He was a freedom fighter.  They killed fifty-five white people over a three-day period.  People who were not just random, people who claimed to own them.  They took their freedom.  Yet we are so intimidated by this culture, that we, uh, cannot stand up and applaud our heroes who fought for freedom.  They were freedom fighters in the--in the finest sense of the word!  We don't have a single name for him!  Nothing!  So I'm doing a painting about it.  And you know there was no raping?  There was no robbing, there was no pillaging?  Did you know that?  You know they started out as six men?  You know how many they ended up with a day and a half later?  Seventy five?  They freed over 300 people?  And you hear about Harriet Tubman.  But they fr-- they freed them by killing the people that owned them.  Now people say, "Ooo!  They killed people!"  Just the other day. And this is tragic!  Somewhere in Maryland, they found-No, in Virginia where Nat Turner was!  Which is not far from here in Henrico, in Sussex County.  I think it was Sussex.  Or Surry. One of those.  Anyway, some people discovered that.  I'm supposed to be looking at you aren't I?
Speaker 1: Yes, you are.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Some people discovered that Gabriel--you ever hear of Gabriel's uprising?  There was a guy named Gabriel who had a better plan than Nat Turner.  But he got--they--their problem was--they got betrayed.
Speaker 1: People found out.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Now there's a black councilman in one of these towns near.  Found out Gabriel was there.  And he wanted a ska--a statue erected for Gabriel. Like they have the confederate soldier all over Virginia.  You know they got these confederate soldiers like in Arkansas too.  Every place in the South.  You got a confederate soldier at the courthouse.  You know that.  Well, this guy said, "Well, we ought to have a black guy who planned an insurrection just as these guys planned to, to secede from the Union."  And the black commissioners--the white commissioners said, "You are right."  And the other black commissioner who had the deciding vote?  Said "No."  Can't vote for somebody who would kill people.  America is about killing!  That's what we are!  We're the killers!  We kill people!  And we don't take nobody killing us!  We feel like we ought to be able to go over there and spy on China like hell!  And they better not come over here!  We'll kill them!  'Cause we kill people!  That's what we do! It's un-American not to kill!  Don't you agree?  Our history is bloody!  And for a black man to stand there and say because this man wanted to kill the governor who kept him enslaved!  We're supposed to forgive people for enslaving us for life?  And if we strike back, we're murderers?  Patrick Henry said, "Give me liberty or give me death!"  He owned 200 slaves when he's saying those words!  (pauses)  I love Patrick Henry.  I think he was right.  And therefore we should honor Nat Turner. And all of the Nat Turners.  You know?  We should honor them!  And they weren't fighting--they weren't fighting--they didn't want any, any, any revenge!  They wanted to be free!  These guys were headed to the damned Chesapeake Bay! And do you know they wiped the city off the map?  That they were headed to?  It was the county seat and it was called Jerusalem.  There is no Jerusalem, Virginia anymore?  It's called Isle of White now?  Do you know what they did to him when they caught him?  They flayed him.  Do you know what flaying is?  They skinned him!  And they hung his skin up on the courthouse.  And they made every slave from fifty miles around come by and look at that thing!  Did you know that?  That's what a segregated education gave me knowledge of.  They flayed him!  And made people come and look.  (pauses)  Do you know that his insurrection struck fear in the whole damned country?
Story_ID: 6626
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I mean a people who are unable to recognize their own heroes.
Speaker 2: (whispered) That's right.  (aloud:) Well we don't know.  That's the problem.
Speaker 1: Those that know don't do it.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No that is--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's the problem.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That is true.
Speaker 1: See, those that know don't do it.  When was Nat Turner born?  You knew about Nat Turner.  When was he born?  What year?
Speaker 2: I don't know what year he was born.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) what day was-- what year was his inurrec--insurrection?
Speaker 2: 18 was it, 18--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) when did Martin Luther King make his March on Washington speech?
Speaker 2: 1960--was it -4 [1964]?
Speaker 1: Three [1963].
Speaker 2: Three [1963].  Okay.
Speaker 1: You knew that didn't you.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: He didn't talk about nothing--about doing nothing to nobody but loving them.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Stop. Stop.
Speaker 1: Serious!
Speaker 2: (Laughs) No, it's true.  Okay, it's true.
Speaker 1: And I love Martin Luther--I met Martin Luther King!  I--he's a wonderful man!  Wonderful man!  But he let somebody spit on him.  I don't want to run with nobody that let somebody spit on him.  Can you?  Some might get on you if you're with him!  And then you have to kill them!
Speaker 2: (Laughing) But you know, I was just, oh--wait a minute, okay, I--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) This is not on--we're not running are we?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, it is! It is!
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm just rappin'! Nah!
Speaker 2: But no, no, no! Wait, wait wait, that's okay. I'm going back to Howard. But you know what? No, I just wanna say, no, I was reading, I'm reading John Lewis's book--
Speaker 1: Poor John.
Speaker 2: But, but, you know, someone said that he would--well, that's what they said, too, that he would--never mind. But anyway! But he talks there--I mean, I don't think, really, I think about what had there--had there not been a nonviolent movement would we have made as much progress?  That's all.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) We would have made more.
Speaker 2: You think so.
Speaker 1: Were you around?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I was a--I was--
Speaker 1: How many civil rights acts were passed?  How many damned civil rights--
Speaker 2: That's true!
Speaker 1: --acts do you have to have before people have their rights?
Speaker 2: Well, no, that is true!
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Three were passed in less than a decade.
Speaker 2: No is--that is true and actual--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And you know what?  When most of them passed?  After an insurrection.
Speaker 2: Right. That's true.
Speaker 1: Martin Luther King would be running around here praying now!
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Okay.
Speaker 1: And nothing would have happened.  But when this, this damned industrial giant was shut down, the cities burned!
Speaker 2: Right.  That's true.  That is true.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --and when you start messing with white people's money--they pay attention.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Okay.  Well you got a point because really this pro--project that we're [The HistoryMakers] working on, 'Pioneers in the Struggle'?  I got really confused when he introduced civil rights legislation in 19-- (laughs) I mean in 1877.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: So I'm thinking civil rights!
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Whose civil rights is this?  (laughs) The only civil rights I know is that--.  So anyway I know you're right about that.  And they did.  People kept passing things.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --and if you look at when most of the black businesses got started, they were started in '68 [1968].  Why were they started in '68 [1968]? Because little riots.  So-called riots.  And I don't refuse to call them riots.  I think--I know for example things were planned in Chicago.  And unfortunately some of the things were planned by FBI agents.  I was in on a meeting where a damned agent planned the damned burning!  I'm telling you!  I know what I'm talking about!  Because he gets points for going back and reporting that there is gonna be a burning.
Story_ID: 6627
Speaker 1: My guy [FBI agent] who had watched me [in late 1960s Chicago] told me, "Look,  if you are ever gonna do anything that's gonna get you in real trouble, I'm gonna warn you because you're my best--,"  What did he call me?  I forgotten.  They got a name for whatever it is, you know your assignment.  He said, "All you're gonna do is talk.  And you'll put two of my kids through college."  He said, "I'm gonna protect you."  (laughs)  And that's really what makes you mad you know, when somebody says some'um like that.  Or you're in some place like Kenya.  I was in Kenya.  No.  I was in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania at a meeting called 6-PAC.  The sixth Pan-African Congress that was held in 1974?  And there was this guy who came over with us,  who was a photographer.  And told me he wanted to do a story of me and my wife who were heading the--one of the little delegations?  As you know, black Americans who were over here co--you know, working with all these other Africans and try to come together?  And we had a sit down--a strike by the interpreters at the conference so we couldn't talk.  So we went into town.  Sittin' up in this bar and this guy comes in, white guy.  He comes up and he says, "I see from your shoes that you're an American.  Would you like a drink?"  I said, "Sure!"  Had a drink and we talked about the games.  You know, baseball and who was dong what. And he said, "You want another drink?"  "Yeah."  So we had about three drinks.  Then he said, "You know, you could've been dead two drinks ago.  The bartender works for us."  And I looked over there, the bartender said, (holds thumb to forefinger in 'OK' signal).  The guy said, "Be cool over here."  I never saw him again.
Speaker 2: So you hear tell of it--and you know that these things exist.  But it's you know--anyway you live through it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's the greatness of the country.
Speaker 2: Right.  You lived through a period of time (unclear)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's the greatness of the country.  And do you know what's interesting and what I appreciate about the country? If it has an irritant, it will try first to make a pearl of that irritant.  If that doesn't work, it will kill it.  But they give you the option.  Be a pearl or be dead!
Story_ID: 6628
Speaker 1: Now I want to ask about your work with  FESTAC. [FESTAC '77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture]  Yes.  That was interesting too.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --you started in 1972.
Speaker 1: Humm. Man!
Speaker 2: And then it took--'cause that was a big, big deal.
Speaker 1: Big, big deal.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And we got involved in the--in the '72 [1972] crisis with the oil.  You know.  At that time, you know the, the Arab nations put the kibbosh on the getting the oil over here.  And they were getting most of their oil out of Nigeria at that time.  Our country!  And at that time Mr. [Henry] Kissinger [U.S. Secretary of State] was pushing a program in Rhodesia then called--now called Zimbabwe.  Wherein black--white people would be compensated for giving black people back their land?  And he wanted Nigeria to support that.  And Nigeria had considered him persona non grata and wouldn't let him in the country to even talk to them about it.  But I was going into the country as a representative of the United States and Canada with FESTAC and I was going in as a V.I.P. not even going through customs.  And since the State Department was sponsoring our participation, they tried to get me to try to persuade the Nigerians to support the plan in Rhodesia to reward white people for exploiting black people.  And when we didn't do it, they threatened not to let our people participate to send the planes over.  When they had discouraged us from raising funds from the private sector.  They said, "We want our delegation to be the biggest and the best!  We'll sponsor it!"  The State Department!  And you know that the C.I.A.  They're the people that don't even have a--to report what their budget is.  Well anyway, they helped us to set up an office, to organize this thing and stayed with us through all the coups and all that stuff.  But then when the--Nigeria wouldn't cooperate with Mr. Kissinger, they decided "Well, well we're not gonna send anybody over there."  And it's in the dead of winter in '77 [1977].  Right?  In February.  And the Nigerian oil is so sweet.  You can mix it with that Arab oil and it almost purifies it to the point that you don't even have to distill it.  I mean they call it sweet oil.  It's so good.  But anyway the Nigerians had put so much into this festival and we were threatened with no participation because they had--didn't like--well the, the, the final thing was when we had the centennial here, the bicentennial [of American independence]?  The people from all over the world like particularly people like from the Caribbeans who had been invited to Washington [D.C.] to participate in our bicentennial and the African countries where--from whence we had come.  And people asked us what was our participation in the bicentennial?  And we told them we were not observing it.  Because we took the same position Frederick Douglass took about the Fourth of July.  I mean they--people talking about freedom and we were being held in bondage!  How can you ask us to celebrate the fact that we were in bondage for another hundred damned years after this '77-- 1777 stuff.  So as a result of our saying we weren't gonna participate, a lot of African countries and the Caribbean countries didn't participate.  State Department got pissed!  And we, we just told them.  People asked us if we were gonna participate? We're not!  So they decided they weren't gonna send a delegation over.  So we told the Nigerians that.  And by the time I got back to my office from the Nigerian Embassy, the State Department called and said we had planes to go to Nigeria.
Story_ID: 6629
Speaker 1: [Dr. Donaldson continues talking about the participation of his art group, AFRICOBRA, the African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists, along with other African American visual artists, in FESTAC '77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, held in Lagos, Nigeria. Earlier in this interview, Dr. Donaldson related that the State Department had initially arranged to sponsor AFRICOBRA and to provide all travel arrangements; then, after he refused to undertake a political mission for them in Nigeria they said they would not provide the promised air transport, but, he stated, AFRICOBRA themselves spurred some international pressure and finally convinced the government to provide the airplanes.]
Speaker 2: And so there's this feeling of even coming back to the Motherland and it's all around the arts, you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: You know it's--this is a first time thing and you've played an instrumental role.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It was the second time.
Speaker 2: It was the se--Oh Senegal!
Speaker 1: They had, had one in Senegal [in 1966].  But it involved very few people.  But the thing that made our experience so different was the same guy that I'm accusing of poisoning us, also sold our space.  They didn't think--the word that he had gotten from the [U.S.] State Department was that they were not gonna sponsor us. See he was working with them. And so he engaged a troupe of dancers from New York that paid him to say that they--to say that they were the representatives of the United States.  So when our people got there, our lodging, our meal tickets, our cars!  Everything had been given to this group from New York.  The Pearl Primus Dance Group. Okay?  Our people had to go into facilities that were not completed.  Wiring hadn't been finished. The plumbing hadn't been hooked up. But the thing that saved us was the fact that they had canceled the festival so many times, that only the hard core black nationalists remained in the festival program.  And they were not discouraged.  They tapped into the phone lines just like they had done in the projects, tapped into electricity, got the lights on in those joints, got the (laughs) got the plumbing going.  Started meeting with people, introduced all kinds of strange things to the other delegations.  I won't go into any details.  But I'm telling you they spread things in Africa that had never been done in Africa before. It was a village you know?  That they--the Nigerians built a village to house the participants.  So you had people from Somalia on your right, people from Cuba here, people from--we found out that there were ten million African-Americans in the Pacific on one island!  Did you know that?  Guy over there grooving to Stevie Wonder from,  Papua New Guinea! Stevie was there too.  The only big name that was left.  Because everybody else--the big names Aretha Franklin, James Brown, the, the Dells, the spinners, all of them had expressed an interest in going to that festival and participating.  But there were so many coups and so many changes and so many reductions in the number of people they could accommodate,  that those people couldn't keep adjusting their schedules.  So what we ended up with was Sun Ra and his Arkestra as the biggest name musical group.  We had dance companies.  We had gospel groups.  We had 75 visual artists that we took over there.  Which had a great impact on the subsequent art that came out of black communities in this country.  You had people getting married, children being named 'Festac' in Africa all over the continent!  It was really an experience that will never be duplicated.  Because you know so much graft went on in the connection with it.  But the people who came back from that festival experienced things that,  they'll never forget.  It was--it was--Lerone Bennett [Jr.] called it the great Congress of the African World.  It was really something.  He was over there.  Gwen didn't go because you know; she didn't fly at that time.  And my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] died a week before the festival began.  That was the one thing that I wanted.  To take her back, you know.  She wanted to see it.  (long pause) That was the biggest disappointment for me.
Speaker 2: She was--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And I was totally disoriented the whole damned time.
Speaker 2: I was gonna say that would be hard for you.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: 'Cause so--Oh! That's horrible.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: So you--Did you stay over just a month?
Speaker 1: I didn't stay a month!  I had--You see the State Department agreed to that one plane.  And once they got that over there, went to the State Department and I said, "We need another plane.  We got another delegation!"  And Lawrence Eagleburger [then Deputy Under Secretary of State for Management] said, "We didn't want to send the first damn plane over."  So I went and told the Nigerians.  By the time I got back to my office, [Samuel Ichiye] Hayakawa from California was calling to say they had a second plane.  He was a [U.S.] senator at that time.  And then we had to figure out how to get the people from California to New York because that's where the plane was leaving from.  So they got some transportation and bussed them to New York.  Or flew them to New York or whatever.  And see what we did was to send gospel groups over there, ballet dancers.  And,  the Africans were tolerating very quietly, you know accepting of it.  But they said, "We want to hear the jazz and stuff you know?"  And as it was, you know, we were already the hits of the festival.  And then we brought that second group over there.  We had all the bad people in that second group.  And they just took off.  And we got a begrudging thank you from the State Department and congratulations, you know.  But it was a cur--curried victory, as you would call it you know.  The--The operation was a success but the patient died.  They had done so much negative propaganda about our participation in it.  And begrudgingly said that, you know, we were not just a success but we made the country look good.  And when we went over there, every other country had given flags to their participant. And we went to the State Department representatives over there and said, "We need a flag."  They said, "We don't have any."  And our people made such an impact, that the flags appeared all over that damned village before we left there.
Story_ID: 6630
Speaker 1: What were your impressions of Nigeria after that?  Or you think mostly (unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Well,  I have--I have had wonderful experiences in Nigeria and some terrible ones.  I think it's a potential giant, you know, in terms of engines.  It generates movement and progress--progress.  Because they, they, they have such--. You know they were so well respected in Africa--in West Africa particularly.  And,  because they have the power.  They have done so much to create art and create you know, their history goes back to great civilizations,  before Christ even. And you know the great king of Benin was better than Amsterdam before slavery started.  It's interesting that 1492 was the year that the Europeans went to the Bight of Benin and started bring people out of there to work in the fields over here.  It just happened that that coincided with Columbus' discovery of this place.  The Renaissance, you know, was born at that time. The High Renaissance.  It was the Low Renaissance for Africa.  Writers who traveled in Africa in those--the 14th 15th centuries said that there were no European cities to rival the great city of Benin in, in Nigeria.  It, it was an empire. It extended all the way over to present-day Mali.
Speaker 1: So in this whole exper--you stayed how long when you went to--,
Speaker 2: To FESTAC [FESTAC '77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture]?
Speaker 1: FESTAC.
Speaker 2: The festival lasted a month.
Speaker 1: A month.  Okay.  So you were there--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was only there two we--two weeks because I had to bury my mother.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --and I had to stay here and get that second plane.
Story_ID: 6631
Speaker 1: You've been at--I mean really Howard for a long time.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I came to Howard in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was off--I took off to do the festival [FESTAC '77]
Speaker 1: Right.  That was how many years?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I mean you've been sort of an institution at Howard is what I want to say  (laughs)
Speaker 2: I was in the institution.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) No, you weren't, I know.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I was institutionalized at Howard., yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) No I said you were an institution within Howard.
Speaker 2: (Pauses) Really?
Speaker 1: Well I think so!  I mean look how many years you were there!
Speaker 2: Well, I was doing a lot of things there.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) From '70 [1970] to--Right, I mean, and that's--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And a lot of good things happened during the time I was there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 6632
Speaker 1: You coined this term, you know, the Trans-Africa.
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: And I'd like to know--I mean, you know, what I'm trying to understand is that you know, this whole thing.  Remember, here you are with AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] and you're talking about, you know the African diaspora--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and you know, the relationship, you know, the relationship with African Americans and that whole thing.  And then you go there and you have this experience [at FESTAC '77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, held in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1977], you say, you know, "I almost died" sort of too. You know from that--Was there--you know and then some people it's their first time going, they're naïve.  You know, they're going back to the Motherland and they think "Well, well, I don't know if I like the Motherland.  You know, maybe the Motherland isn't what I was thinking of."  Or other people that fall in love with the Motherland.  and so I guess what I'm asking was there any mature--you know, any sort of evolved sense of, you know, what this TransAfrican  meant you know--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.  Oh yes. Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: --that came out and I was wondering what--
Speaker 2: What, what, what  that experience showed me was that there wa--there was a oneness.  It was--and I'm, I'm not talking about something being homogeneous. But there was--you know you hear blues in all of Africa.  And you know we had been brought up to believe that blues was the consequence of slavery?  And you got blues in Ethiopia that make you cry even if you don't know what they're talking about.  I mean it's that sad.  You know, and it's that joyous--say, blues, I heard a guy sing the blues that was milking a cow.  It was reluctant to give milk and he talked about how pretty she was.  And how soft and juicy her udders were.  And soon you could hear the, the milk flowing into the pail.  Quish, quish!  The cow was flattered.  But I mean I went to Africa and I see people with a herd of goats.  And a guy calling off, "John will you get back in line?"  I mean this guy don't have a stick or nothing!  He's herding with his voice.  He's talking to these animals and treating them like, you know, a different way.  A different--And I mean I'm not saying Africa is better than anything.  I'm saying it's different!  And that difference is in us.
Story_ID: 6633
Speaker 1: The difference between the European in this country [United States] and the European in Europe is us.  (pauses)
Speaker 2: That's probably--that's probably (unclear)
Speaker 1: It's very true.  And the European here is superior to the European over there.  And they know it over there.  Because the whole time, for example, that the British were in Nigeria--unless there was some punitive expedition, unless they had to bring in the army or the navy to put down a revolt or something, there was never more than fifty British people in the country of Nigeria.  When they--during that whole hundred years of the colonial period.  So the, the, the Africans didn't know the European.  And the Europeans don't--didn't know the Africans.  The ones that they would take into their institutions in Europe were the elite.  The kings and princes and what have you.  So there was no real contact!  But from the very beginning, the European and the African have been like this here.  So we know each other.  And we have mixed blood!  There's no pure blood in this country.  We all have--it's all mixed up!  And you have white people here who have a sensitivity to black people that's unheard of in Europe and vice versa.  Black people here have a sensitivity to white people that's unheard of in Africa.  We don't see each other here as the Other.  We may treat each other as the Other.  You know, I'll never forget when they integrated the colleges down South?  The universities?  And the black guys started playing football and one of the s--like Alabama or some place down there, Mississippi--said, "D'you see that nigger tackle our black boy?" You understand what I'm saying?  "Kill that nigger!  He hit our boy (laughs)!"  There's a sense, you know--like when you--when we went to Europe in the army and the situation was horrible here.  We were fighting in the streets!  We didn't stand for any Europeans talking about that.  We fought like hell with, with our fellow Americans over there in France, you know. We'd have street fights on, on in the camps--in the camps and every place when stuff was going on at night.  But we didn't have it--we didn't betray each other to those Europeans.  Do you follow what I'm saying?  Because our fate is one thing here.  We either all go down together or we all float together.  There's no getting--and there's no way to get rid of us.
Story_ID: 6634
Speaker 1: You very much are an American in many ways.
Speaker 2: Well, I had to go to Africa to learn that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had to go to Africa to learn that.  Because we're impatient.  You know one thing you have to have in Africa is patience.  You have to know how to use your waiting time.  We can't do that!  We ain't used to that.  We're used to putting the money down and getting the service!  (laughs)  (claps). You know?  And if we don't, we raise hell.  Even in Arkansas!  And that's ingrained!  And you can't, you just--you just you'd, you'd get an ulcer living, you know, because a woman is sitting there in the--at the teller's desk knitting at the bank.  Waiting for some guy to bring her a little piece of paper that he signed.  You know, instead of you doing that and doing that and doing that while she's waiting.  This is what we're doing now.  We'll take care of this and then we'll do that.  And which is the civilized way to do it I guess.  But we ain't got time for civilization here!  We are in pursuit of the new!  (pauses) That means it's fresh, it's hot, it--otherwise-- (pauses). And there's no yesterday.
Story_ID: 6635
Speaker 1: You've been with the [Howard University] College of Fine Arts [Washington, D.C.] since, I mean--,
Speaker 2: '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: 1970.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you first were the--
Speaker 2: I went there to be chairman--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Chairman!
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --of the art department and director of the Gallery of Art.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And then you became after that,  associate dean--well, you were professor and then you were associate dean,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --and then you were dean.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I want to talk--you know, because this whole thing--Remember how you were saying art--I mean, art was always associated with teaching.  So this is what you wanted to, you know, do--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Artists, artists.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right, right.
Speaker 2: --usually teach in this country.
Speaker 1: So what has Howard--what Ho--has Howard University meant to your development?  And what are the things--? That's one question.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) As an artist?
Speaker 1: Yes, as an artist.
Speaker 2: It's given me support to do artwork.  Basically.  but I never--I tried very hard not to impose my political view on what I was doing as an, as an administrator.  That wouldn't have been fair to the students.
Speaker 1: So you didn't--You found that you as an art--So you, you, you have right brain, left-brain so you were able to be a good administrator?
Speaker 2: If I was, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Chuckle) Okay.
Speaker 2: I know--you know; I knew something about that through my mother [Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson] who had been a teacher.  And she told me, "If you go into this teaching game, know full well that you're going into a profession that is full of cowards.  And don't look behind you to see if they're supporting you.  They won't be.  Be prepared to face being isolated if you want to do right.  And be prepared not to be supported by people who believe in what you believe in."
Story_ID: 6636
Speaker 1: You said earlier that there were se--you know, several things that you were proud of.  What
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --came out of that period.  And I'm wondering if you would
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, the gallery [Howard University Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.] for example.  In the gallery we were able to reestablish that gallery as a place where major artists show.  And important new artists show.  That had been the tradition there in earlier years.  And that had kind of fallen by the wayside with the aging of certain individuals in the, in the college.  We doubled the size of the faculty in the college, in the Art Department.  We attained national accreditation for a--in the National Association of Schools of Art.  We were the only black institution in that, that organization.  I was elected to the board of directors of that organization, at one point.  Then as Dean I was able to complete the certification of the accreditation of the theater department, which had produced great people like Ossie Davis and--who?  Roxie Roker.  The sisters Allen.  A number of people.  Charlie Brown, a number of people who were very good in theater.  In--on both sides of the camera, on both sides of the stage.  a number of good directors came out of there.  We have this girl here for example was a student at Howard.  Now she plays,  the female lead on the 'Steve Harvey Show'.  What's the name of--That's, that's exactly what it's called, the 'Steve Harvey Show'.  Have you seen it?
Speaker 1: I've seen it.
Speaker 2: She plays the principal.  Wendy Raquel Robinson, a product of the College of Fine Arts.  (pauses) The kid who is the heir apparent to Miles Davis, what's his name?  Chuck (unclear).  This is so embarrassing.  I'll think of his name before we finish.  He's married to Geri Allen, the great piano player, who also came out of Howard.  You don't know Geri Allen, girl!  (Whispering) Oh! She's fabulous.  She was with--in with, in with Betty Carter in her last days.  She's, she's--. I was able to hire her to teach at Howard too.  I was there when she was a student and when she came back after she achieved some success in the profession, and a couple more degrees.  Wallace Roney is the heir apparent to, to Miles.  He came out of our program.  We had, a couple of people--several people who've made very great strides on Broadway and on a legitimate stage.  And of course we had a number of people in the movies.
Story_ID: 6637
Speaker 1: So are there things that were disappointing to you?  Or that you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were they?
Speaker 2: The fact that the College of Fine Arts was merged with the, College of Arts and Sciences [at Howard University].  The major reason why I left.  Because I had gone to school in an art part program, an art department.  It's not the same as the school of art.  And the only black institution of, of the over a hundred black institutions in this country.  It was the only one with a college of fine arts.  The only one that ever had a college of fine arts.  So it was just sad to see, you know, that merger.  And they're still functioning.  But to have a distinct identity, a distinct budget, and a distinct mission.  'Cause you know, a dean of college of liberal arts, no matter how well-versed that person is in the arts, it's not the same as being in the community of artists.  And artists need each other, need to be isolated.  They need to be within speaking and touching distance of the rest of the people.  But they got to be isolated so that they can agitate, sharpen each other up.  Honing each other to perfection.  And it can't be done unless you put them in isolation.  That's just the way it is.  There's still a lot of magic involved with art, you know.  A lot of magic involved in it.  And it does not lend itself to logic and reason.  Only its own logic and its own reason can, can, can be expressed and understood in an academic situation.
Story_ID: 6638
Speaker 1: Then were you constantly seeing, yourself, well John Howard [Donaldson's teacher at Arkansas AM & N College] in you?  In many ways?  Or, you know, the role that you had there--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, well--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) --were you--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) In a sense.  But I wanted to avoid being distracted from art.  And he was distracted from art, you know.  He was a PR [public relations] director for the university.  That's a full-time gig.  And when he created an art department, it made it very difficult for him to do both.
Speaker 1: And so do you think you were successful in, in your time there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were totally surrounded by art and it was a college.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, and I was able to bring in people like Al Freeman, Jr. you know, quality people.  Geri Allen I just mentioned.  Great musicians, jazz musicians in particular.  Because what we had at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] was a situation where everybody was trained in classical art, music, and all the students wanted, wanted to major in jazz.  And so these people with tenure, of course, in the classical field, you know, were a little bit hostile to that.  So working with that was very, very difficult.  But I was the champion of both the classical students as well as the jazz students.
Speaker 1: So did that--did that work its way out?  Work its way through?
Speaker 2: Well, it's still being worked on, I think.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Well Howard has always been, you know, they wanted to (unclear) beholders of the black race of America.  So (unclear) you know, they always want to be--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But the tragic thing is that,  we've created without trying so many great jazz musicians.  You know, and very few classical musicians of any repute.  Now we have, we have Jessye Norman, of course.  And we're all very proud of her.  But it's significant that Jessye's has done more for the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] where she got an advanced degree than she's done for Howard.  And there are many reasons for that, because she didn't have a very good experience here.  Because it didn't have anything to do with her talent.
Story_ID: 6639
Speaker 1: You've been trained in both worlds.  You know, you started your educational environment with the, you know, HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].  And, you know, spent a significant amount of--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --years on the faculty.  And you (unclear) really on the faculty.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, I taught at Northeastern [Illinois University] in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and I taught at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's fine, okay.
Speaker 2: But that was brief.
Speaker 1: Right.  I'm just saying the bulk--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, the bulk.  No question about it.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Yeah.
Speaker 2: The bulk, no question about it.  You're talking about five years in those other institutions--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as against 30.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I wonder here--I want to ask you about your feeling about the role of the HBCUs.  Because we're talking about over a whole
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --period really of time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with development.
Speaker 2: Well, I have to temper my, statement.  By saying that my experience with HBCUs has been limited to Arkansas [A.M. & N. College] and to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]. --as a student at Arkansas, so I didn't know the inner workings of what went on at the top.  As an administrator [Dean of the College of Fine Arts] at Howard, I did know.  And Howard is pretty much unique in terms of other HBCU's.  For one thing, we have a line item in the federal government budget.  You didn't know Howard was a form of repar-, reparations? Yeah.  Sixty-five percent of Howard's budget comes from the federal government.  So in a sense every black person has a stake in Howard.  See the only, only other institution that has a line item in the federal budget is Gallaudet [University, Washington, D.C.], the national institute for the deaf--the national institute for the deaf here.
Speaker 1: (Pauses) How could that come about though?  I did--How did that come about?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Howard.  I'm just saying that's--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) There was a man named General [Oliver Otis] Howard who was an old Indian fighter with one arm.  Who saw the freedmen as a meal ticket.  And he set it up so he would train the freedmen to be teachers and preachers.  And they were--they were given land up here.  One of the members of the Board of Trustees, was on the board one day.  And he applied for a loan to buy this whole area that's called the Druid Park that surrounds Howard.  Got an interest-free loan from the board of directors, built all these houses including the one we're in.  And then built a fence around it to keep black people out.  And the first students at Howard, you know, included two white girls, who were daughters of the Board of Trustees.  Howard eventually went to jail for--he either went to jail or was threatened to go to jai--to be jailed for misappropriation, I believe of money in the Freedmen's Bureau, he was very much involved in that.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) That's (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) General O. E. Howard. [sic, O.O. Howard]  Oliver was his name.
Story_ID: 6640
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite piece that you've done?
Speaker 2: Mm-m.  They're all favorites.
Speaker 1: They're all favorite.
Speaker 2: Just like children.  You don't have a favorite child.  You know what I mean.  They all have certain things that you like and certain things that you don't like.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Usually it's the last piece that's the one that's your favorite.  The last one you did.
Speaker 1: Now you, when you look-- Can you objectively look back at your work and see--
Speaker 2: Like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean when you look at your work, do you see stages yourself--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --in your development. (unclear) and could you just go through them?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Excuse me.  I couldn't name them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I can show you examples of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For example, this work, The Aunt Jemima is a reflection of the John Howard - Hale Woodruff style.  Muscularity, dramatic, thrust, diagonal movement, subdued color--Color subdued to two lines.  and social consciousness.  That, that kind of thing.  Then, then I became allergic to oil paint.  When I was at I.I.T. [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago] working with those solvents with Mick Kent Cohn (ph.) Broke out like hell, had to go to Doctor [Theodore Kenneth] Lawless. No, you don't know Dr. Lawless.  But he was a great dermatologist.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I've heard of Dr--That's why I know the name.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Legendary, legendary.
Speaker 1: Yes.  They said people used to be parked up in those and the white clientele would be there also.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because he had a white waiting room.  He was a black man who had white people in one room and blacks in another.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay.  I didn't know that part.
Speaker 2: He was an interesting man.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't know that.  But someone recently told me about Dr. Lawless.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--and he's got a whole orchard or something in Israel that he paid for.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: 'Cause so many of his clients were rich Jewish people.  T. K. Lawless  He was a hell of a dermatologist.  And some of the things, he, you know, his whole hands were like eaten away from x-rays that he had used in the treatments of things.  But he was, he was quite a man.--
Speaker 1: So you said that--You were saying that, you know, you stopped working with oil paints 'cause you--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  Because I broke out.  And then I started working with watercolors.  And that piece over there, 'The Wives of Shongo (?)' is an example of that.  Which is an open color kind of style.  a linear effects were emphasized.  And that gets into AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists].  That moves from OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture]-- That comes between OBAC and AFRICOBRA.  this is AFRICOBRA the one that I just talked about, The God Bless the Child.  and then, I've been in like that groove.  But it's becoming more and more--and less figurative.  But one of our themes in AFRICOBRA is that the art should be based and must be based on the human figure in some way.  Art just doesn't come out of the air.  It is an expression of humanness, peopleness.  it is a reflection of what we see in African art.  Distortion, exaggeration, whatever you want to do.  Improvisation on the figure, but fine.  But let's have some figures.  And we, you know, define figuration as --including things like this.  Which looks like totally abstract.  But if you keep looking at it, you'll see other things.
Speaker 1: And then what other period?
Speaker 2: This is the--I'm working on this right now.  I don't know what you call it.  But it's not my job to name the things, you know.  People who were in the Renaissance didn't say, "Hey! We're Renaissancing today!"
Story_ID: 6641
Speaker 1: I'd like the work to be in the major museums in the world. That's where I'd like for it to be.
Speaker 2: Do you have someone in this--is anybody representing you?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's what I thought.
Speaker 1: But I have stuff in certain galleries.  But don't--no representative, no.
Speaker 2: Would you ever look at that now?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is something very new for us as African American artists, you know.
Speaker 2: You know, but I'm telling you.
Speaker 1: But you need an agent.
Speaker 2: You need an agent.  And I'm telling you, we just did these interviews in, in Chicago [Illinois] for artists.  And it's a different world out there.  I was like totally, totally--Like my mouth opened.  Like (pauses) it was a different world than what I had remembered.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean.  They're making good money.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think, you know they're not living--It's no hand-to-mouth existence--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and I was just--We did, well, now Allen Stringfellow was old.  But we did Richard Hunt.  We did the two Kerry James Marshall and Dawoud Bey.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was a whole different
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean their, their intent, their everything was totally foreign to what I had known.  But I have--you know; they're successful in a financial way too.
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 2: And making lives as artists.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Now this is what I--I want--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --but they both teach.  They all teach.
Speaker 2: That is so true, (laughs).  That is true.  Okay.  That's true.  Okay, well we haven't gotten--that's true.
Speaker 1: But that's the way of the art world here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's, it's expected.
Speaker 2: That's true.  Oh.
Speaker 1: The biggest names, unless they're drunks and degenerates, you know.  And even some of them teach.
Story_ID: 6642
Speaker 1: Someone who's really dedicated their life to, the evolution of black art, what are your hopes, you know, going forward?  you created, you know, AFRICOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists].  But what are your hopes? You know, because for someone who wants to pursue a career as a black artist expressing the works?
Speaker 2: But you know, we're living in a time when things are really undergoing significant changes.  For example, when I first went to Howard, most of the students who came in there wanted to be "fine artists."  Now they want to be designers.  Now they want to work with computers.  Because that's what's happening.  It may be that we're seeing the last generation of so called "fine artists."  Maybe that, you know, we're relics.  So I'm not so sure I can--I'm in the position to say what, what comes next.  But what I will say is that what we are doing now is very, very, very, very important to say, "This is where it stopped.  And then it became something else."  And I think that's important.
Speaker 1: Do you see that you're African American first, artist second or artist first?  Or African American second?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  That's, you know--Well years--No, you weren't around when the black power thing was going down.  Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Touré] spent about a year trying to explain what "Black Power" meant.  Now first of all, words aren't even our language.  And it was people, you know, white people asking him what, what do our words mean.  (pauses) It was a device.  It was a  trickery, distraction.  You know, we, we--One of the major errors that was made in the '60s [1960s] was that we were trying to cleanse.  We were going through racial cleansing--"Who's blacker than, than who?"  You know.  and it became like parlor game.  Because we were so frustrated in trying to get the things advanced that we wanted to advance, we turned on each other.  And we were aided and abetted by the powers that be, like the COINTELPRO thing.  But we wouldn't have been vulnerable to that if we had, had our own direction set.  And had said, "It doesn't matter whether other people understand the language you're using.  Because it isn't for them in the first place."  So I don't--I don't get involved with that chicken and egg thing.  You know, we're both here, the chicken and the egg.  I'm an African American and I'm an artist, and I'm an American and I was an educator.  And I was an art director.  And I was an this and that.
Story_ID: 6643
Speaker 1: Then what are your hopes for, for black people here in the--or African Americans?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh we're gonna be all right.  No question about it.  We've come further in this culture than any other race of people in the history of the world who came from the kinds of, of conditions that we were in.  It's been, it's been less than 200 years and we didn't even have last names for God sake.  And we couldn't even travel from one part of the country to another.  And even if we escaped from the slave state, we were sent back by the free states.  Now we got [U.S. Secretary of State] Colin Powell going around, you know, telling people what the United States is going to stand for or not stand for.  Now, I'm not necessarily saying that's a good thing. You know.  As far as I'm concerned, he's Othello.  But that's what he chose to do.  And as long as we have an opportunity to choose what we want to do, fine.  That's where--that's what the whole business is about.  Choice.  And black people should have the right to make the same silly-ass mistakes as other Americans.
Speaker 1: So if you could--Would you if you could rewrite the Civil Rights Movement that came through.  Would you rewrite any of it if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I don't recognize the Civil Rights Movement, okay, as a distinct thing.  When did it start?  When did it end?  (pauses) 'Cause as long as I can remember being alive, people have been talking about fighting for rights.  And everything that I've been able to read from when the first group was brought over here, people have been fighting for rights.  And if you look at the history of this country, they used to watch troop movements during the period of our captivity in this country.  You know what the army was for.  (pauses) So, you know, I'm, I'm very optimistic.  Not only about us, but about this country.  Because like I said, we are the difference.  When I say "we", I mean the diversity that we bring.  And the diversity that's being brought from other cultures is what's gonna make this country stand when all the others fall down.  Because the powers that be in this country have decided now.  And this is gonna--This is really gonna shake the foundations of most people when they come to realize it.  People have decided they're gonna have one race here.  And they're promoting what they used to call miscegenation.  In removing the popular meaning--media.  White people and black people sleeping together in a movie.  That never was a--They didn't even have road maps for black people among themselves when I was growing up.  You didn't see black actors kissing each other.  Now white people are kissing black people and black people are kissing white people.  And they're having babies.  And you now check two or three races on the census.
Speaker 1: So Jeff Donaldson believes in the melting pot.
Speaker 2: It's not about my belief.  It's inevitable.  They have created such a mythology about us in terms of sex that he can't resist us.  And some of us have even bought into the myth.  And that's the disturbin' part, (laughs).  When you walk around thinking you a super stud. (laughs).  I can remember being in the army.  And, you know, we had Joe Louis, and we had Muhammad Ali.  And most of the black cats thought, "I can beat any white man, because I'm black."  I saw a white boy beat the hell out of a black, black dude in the [U.S.] Army.  And he thought that because he had seen these black guys doing this, that he could do it.  (Pauses) It was a lesson that was not lost on any of us.  I mean, you know, we're all in this together.  And the whole world hates every one of us.  And the whole world is envious of, of--When we go overseas, we are stunned to find out that people in France think black people have something to do with setting policy in this country.  (laughs) They say, "Your people are doing this."  "Who?!"  (laughs), We, we (laughs) don't have nothing to do with it, they didn't count our damn' vote!"  You know?.  But we can vote.  It's just no way to get it counted.  The next step is to get it counted. You know, but things are really different.  And anybody who has been here for 20, 30, 40 years, they know there's a difference.  You know.  I remember, you know, in some parts of the country, white people coming down the sidewalk, you're on the sidewalk, you had to step aside, when they--to let them go by.  That wasn't just in the South.  You know, I remember when you had no recourse to any injustice.  So, you know, we have changed things here.  We, the collective we.  And we've had to do it in order to survive.  'Cause we would have destroyed each other in the '60s [1960s].  And there were some of us who were hell-bent on, "Either we're gonna have some of it or it ain't gonna be."  Because it was on our backs it was built.  (pauses) and we've never been paid, never been paid.

Speaker 1: I'm a big believer in reparations.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, I believe in reparations too.  But people like you and me don't need it. (pauses) What I've learned over the years is that the people who are in the projects now are the people who were in the worst situation during the period of our captivity.  So-called slave days.  People don't move into the projects, they move out.  Those are the people that need the reparation.  That never had an opportunity, that never had a chance.  People like you and me, you traveling all over the damn country, talking to people being feted and fed and--You don't need no damn reparation.  You need to be giving up something. (pauses) No, that was a joke.
Speaker 1: I know.  But our institutions need reparation.  I believe some of--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We--(unclear) yes some of them, but then--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I believe some of our institutions--there needs to be--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But, but then at a, at a certain point we don't have to have separate institutions.  That's where we've come now.  We're getting more and more white kids in the black schools, you know.  Because it's cheaper, it's closer.  And you're getting the same thing you're getting in other institutions.  Even the President of the United States [George W. Bush] has a brother who's married to a Hispanic.  (pauses) What does that say?  And they're from Texas!  (chuckle).  I'm, I'm--don't, don't misunderstand me.  I don't think the millennium has arrived.  Not far from it.  But from where I saw things, and see things now, my daughter [Jameela Kaneeka Donaldson] and my son [Tarik Jeff Donaldson], you know, they, they--the world is open to them.  If it's not, they're gonna have the wherewithal to bust it open.  And they're not gonna accept anything less.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: It's out of my hands.  I don't want to even deal with it.  It's out of my hands.
Speaker 1: It's out of your hands.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I didn't say I wanted to be remembered.
Speaker 1: You want AFRICOBRA to be remembered.
Speaker 2: I didn't say that either.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: What I'd like to do is say that, you know, that a live was, was useful.  That it meant, meant something different.  That it--that whatever I was involved in was better because I was involved in it.  I think that's the legacy I'd like to leave.
