Speaker 1: All right and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 10, 1951 in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Photographer.
Speaker 1: And you were at one time White House photographer right, during the--
Speaker 2: Yeah I was for eight years, the White House photographer, one of four, and then the last two and a half years I was director of White House photography, but more than anything else like even today, I am your community photographer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, but that's a big deal for people watching this in the future that you were the official photographer during the Clinton Administration or one of the official photographers in the White House.
Speaker 2: I was one of four.
Speaker 1: Okay. And I was the first black woman, there was a black gentleman named Ricardo Thomas who worked for [Gerald]Ford who I met at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] 'cause we were the only two colored people shooting pictures of Ford at the graduation and he's looking at me going "who you?"  I'm looking at him going "who you?"  And that's how I met Ricardo, but that didn't lead to the White House, just doing good work did.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right now what, what is today's date?
Speaker 1: Today is the twenty-ninth of April, 2008.
Speaker 2: All right and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 1: We're at A. Salon Artist Studios [sic, DC Arts Studio], it's a studio cooperative.  It has about 100 members, the Washington [National] Opera is on the top floor and then the rest of us have different studios scattered in the building, and we have twenty-four-hour access so we can be creative any time of day or night we'd like.
Speaker 2: Okay so this is Takoma Park [Maryland] or Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 1: Takoma Park, Washington, we're on the Washington D.C. side.
Story_ID: 128704
Speaker 1: All right, okay all right, now before we go into depth there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.  The first question is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Any kind of vegetable, any kind of vegetable, 'cause it's healthy, it builds cells.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like all colors, all colors make up everything.  I like everything, all colors make black, I love all colors.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No, I love all the seasons, as a photographer variety is the spice of life.  You can't just shoot hot weather pictures, shoot cold weather pictures, inside, outside.  I do all of it, I think that the weather is part of the joy of being on the planet.
Speaker 1: All right, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, my idea of a good vacation is to stay home 'cause I travel so much doing my work.
Speaker 1: Okay and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "Yo."
Speaker 1: Okay, "yo."
Speaker 2: "Yo,"
Story_ID: 128705
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Winifred Lancaster, L-A-N, oh Winifred, W-I-N-I-F-R-E-D, middle name Lancaster, L-A-N-C-A-S-T-E-R, Farmer, F-A-R-M-E-R.
Speaker 1: Is Lancaster her maiden name.
Speaker 2: Un-hun.
Speaker 1: Okay and, well what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Chapel Hill, Maryland and she was born January 24, 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  Do you have a, I mean first of all how far can you trace them?  Can you trace them back to slavery or to Africa or, or reconstruction or?
Speaker 2: I can't but I have cousins who can trace my great, great grandfather's buying property and having property in Chapel Hill and the two brothers farmed together from the late 1800s through the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].  Henry and Albert Shorter were their names, S-H-O-R-T-E-R and from there we all evolved.
Speaker 1: Shorter, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Shorter, so it was called "Shore Land Farms" back in those days.
Speaker 1: Are they related to the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Shorters you know?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: There are some Shorters that are associated with the founder at Wilberforce University in [Wilberforce] Ohio.
Speaker 2: Oh I'm not, not familiar.
Speaker 1: They had a Shorter Hall [no longer exists] was a major building on campus for many years.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I just wanted.
Speaker 2: You're going, now you're making me curious.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have cousins who have done extensive research and they live in Upstate New York now, the last time we had a family reunion on my momma's side with everybody from the Shorter clan and the Lancaster clan, was almost 20 years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's significant, so they bought property in Chapel Hill, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Un-hum.
Speaker 1: And were farmers there even though they were Shorters they were farmers (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), so any, any stories about those days, I mean did they?
Speaker 2: I would--I seem to remember most that my grandmother's husband always bought a new car every two or three years so he could get to town.  He was one of the few black people that worked at the Bureau of Standards and in Chapel Hill at the time you couldn't get past grade school.  So if you wanted to go off to junior high and high school, you had to go to school in town which is what they call Washington, D.C., that was called in town, going to town and my father would take the other--I mean my grandfather would take his kids, as well as other kids in the neighborhood who were now prepared to go to junior high school, and they went to--what's that school over there on Southwest?  Francis Junior High School [Washington, D.C.], and he would let them out they'd walk to school and then when got off work, they'd wait, play games until he was ready to get off work.  He'd come by and pick 'em up and then back out to Chapel Hill they would go.
Speaker 1: Okay so Chapel Hill is not that far away?
Speaker 2: It's about twenty miles outside D.C.
Speaker 1: Twenty miles outside of D.C., all right.
Speaker 2: Un-hum, down Indian Head Highway [Maryland Route 210].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, lies between Friendly [Maryland] and Fort Washington [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and Fort Washington's the one they made the movie about I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 128706
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No they were both, I knew my grandmother, my grandfather was dead by the time I was born.  My grandmother I knew very well.  When my mom [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] and dad [George Thomas Farmer] were school teaching, sometimes when we were still too young to go to school.  We'd stay with her down in Chapel Hill [Maryland], so we enjoyed summer nights and weekends and grandma always cooked.  Once we got older and got ready to go school my mother had grandma come help us get ready for school.  So she'd come up and take care of us and the house.  We were very lucky, school was always in walking distance and grandma was always there at lunch time, we could come home for lunch and she'd get dinner ready for the day or dinner ready for the weekend so all mom had to do was heat it up.  We didn't know my mother couldn't cook, my grandmother hid that very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now did your mother--did she grow up in Chapel Hill or?
Speaker 2: Yes, she ended up majoring in education.  I think she went to Bowie State College [Bowie, Maryland].  If you wanted a master's at the time they wouldn't let black students get master's at any of the Maryland institutions, so she went to New York University [New York, New York] and got her master's in education.
Speaker 1: Okay, the N.Y.U. [New York University, New York, New York] okay, that's, that's pretty good.  Was she, she one of the first people in her family going to college or had there been a tradition of people going?
Speaker 2: She was one of the first.  Some other cousins had gone to college 'cause they were educators, they were older.  They were school teachers, I remember some very older cousins of my mamma's that taught school and even had sisters.  They lived in a house on the hill in Chapel Hill, Gladys, Billy and Evelyn and that was the place we always stopped at going, leaving grandma's we'd stop by there and say "hello" to them, everybody was close.  It was a very tight family.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 128707
Speaker 1: So, did your mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Yes she did, she talked about the dances and studying 'cause she wanted to do really well. She learned to sew from her Aunt Vi [ph.] and from her mother.  My mother seemed to always be dressed very neatly.  All the pictures I saw there turned out that my uncle had taken, he was a photographer who figured out how to make some money when he was at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], so he got the two sisters, my mother and her sister to give him money for a camera. He says he will quit borrowing from them if he could just make a little money with a camera.  So they gave him enough money to buy a camera.
Speaker 1: So he was a photographer, so he, he would shoot?
Speaker 2: He shot fraternity things, social events; I saw some of his old photos.  There is a picture of my mom and dad [George Thomas Farmer] he shot, of them sitting on the couch, you know, they're courting still that--well they'd been married maybe a week and they're sitting on the couth together in Grandma's house.  I had no idea; we have lots of pictures of old pictures.  I don't know who everybody is; I'm still asking relatives who's that, who's this so I can get the story together.  My mother was very good at keeping things but we don't know who some folk are now since people are now in their eighties and starting to pass away.
Speaker 1: Right's it's important to get those names you know now.
Speaker 2: Yes it is.
Speaker 1: So did your uncle make a living as a photographer or did he just do it, just kind of avocationally?
Speaker 2: He was in school, he was in the what do you call the R.O.T.C. [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Hampton, but he used it to make money, that's what he did and bricklaying on construction sites, but photography seemed to be a way to him to make a lot of extra money.
Speaker 1: Did he continue shooting when he got out school?
Speaker 2: He was in the Service so he got to travel, so he always had a camera, Okinawa [Japan] and Germany.  He was in the Korean American War. His family traveled with him, so they were gone, they were the family that was always overseas somewhere, but he always had a camera.
Story_ID: 128708
Speaker 1: Give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, George Thomas Farmer, Cedar Grove, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: So he was in, from Cedar Grove, West Virginia.
Speaker 2: Un-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, is that, is that closer to Virginia or Pennsylvania, or how would you?
Speaker 2: I never quite understood 'cause we use to travel by mountains.  I remember being in the back of the car and we'd go home to see his family. They seemed to be a pretty good distance away.  It took a long time to get there.  I remember we could sleep and have lunch, sleep and have lunch some more and we'd still not be there.  In West Virginia the roads were very wind and then it was somewhere near a big hill.  Train tracks I remember, I remember having a fun with my little cousins who I was getting' to know.  My grandmother on his side made a monkey sock dolls for us to play with.  His father was a coalminer and he was killed by the time my dad was three, and I'm not sure if it was a mining accident or somebody had a disagreement with him, I'm not quite sure.  Nobody's every quite told the story so that I understand what happened to my father's father.
Speaker 1: He didn't die of natural causes (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: It wasn't natural causes, that I'm clear, but how--never was clear.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay oh, what's your father's date of birth, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Let's see September 19, 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there, there any stories from your father's side of the family about slavery or reconstruction of any of that or do they go back that far?
Speaker 2: No but he talked about being in the [U.S.] Navy and how some of the difficulties were difficult and my father decided to be a gunnery person rather than deal with being in the mess or cooking or any of that other stuff.
Speaker 1: Now he, he served in World War II then right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know they, they tried to put all black in the galley is what I heard to cook.
Speaker 2: My father refused.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father absolutely refused and when he got out the Navy--he said the best thing about the Navy was coming to Washington D.C. for shore leave and that's where he met my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] at who was a hostess with her sister at the Twelfth Street Y.M.C.A. [Young Men's Christian Association] in North West and back in those days if you were a hostess you never gave the sailor your right name, so he met her a couple of times at the place and then, I guess escorted her and her sister home via trolley car one night, but when they got off the trolley car he couldn't see where they went so when he decided he wanted to see my mother again, he went to that corner, and hung out, kept asking people "do they know these two sisters" and finally someone did.  So he managed to hook back up with my mother again, and they eventually fell in love.
Speaker 1: Persistent paid, paid off.
Speaker 2: Persistence pays (laughter).
Speaker 1: So it was like a--they were having like a U.S.O.-type [United Service Organizations] thing.
Speaker 2: It was a black U.S.O. because back in those days it was no integration in the Armed Services hardly at all, the very few that were, were exceptional people my father said so.
Speaker 1: Now did your father have a chance to go to school too?
Speaker 2: Yes, he started at West Virginia State College [Institute, West Virginia] and then went to the Navy and then when he got out of the Navy he wanted to go back to West Virginia State.  So my mother helped that happen too, so he finished school and got his bachelor degree, and the same issues again about getting masters, so he went to Springfield College in [Springfield] Massachusetts to get his master's in physical education.
Speaker 1: Did, did the whole family move to Springfield?
Speaker 2: No, we stayed in [Washington] D.C. and my mother was school teaching in Brentwood, Maryland, North Brentwood.  She was a school teacher; I remember dad coming home on holidays and some long weekends and he'd appear about two or three in the morning getting a ride with somebody else who was in school with him too, and it was always fun anticipating when he was coming home, 'cause we'd stay up.  We'd try to stay up, but as soon as we heard him crack through that door we was up and jumping on him.
Story_ID: 128709
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your parents' [Winifred Lancaster Farmer and George Thomas Lancaster] personalities, what were their dispositions like and what were, what kind of talents did they have and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I take after both of them, my mother loved music and made sure I got to explore all the creative arts.  My father being into physical sports, made sure that I could throw a football, bat a ball--I learned all the sports left handed 'cause dad was left-handed even though I did everything else pretty much right handed.  I remember being a little kid like five or six years old and after school my mother would take us where the team was practicing and we'd wait around for dad to get off of work from the football practice and some of the football players would sometimes pick up me and my brother and run us down to the end of the field like we were footballs.  So, I had pleasant memories like that or even waiting for basketball practice to be over.  I could wander in the gym and get lost and sometimes I'd wander in the wrong place and the next thing I know a towel's over my head and I'm being carried to my father's office (laughter).  It was, it was a good life, going to the games, meeting people, crawling underneath the bleachers, pulling on peoples' legs see how much money dropped out of peoples' pants.  I had a good time during all the games, no matter football, basketball whatever he was doing.
Speaker 1: Was he, so he coached all these?
Speaker 2: He coached the whole time that I was little, from--till the time I got to the eighth grade, then he became an assistant principal and went off to Kent Junior High and we're like "you can't do that" but by then we knew a lot of sports and me and my brother and my father loved to watch all the sports, football, basketball, didn't care what it was, and my mother would sew or on the phone talking to neighbors and friends, but she didn't watch as much sports as we did, but they were both pleasant.  I never heard them cuss or say an ugly word, and I heard them say things like "a dog that will bring you a bone, will take a bone", trying to give us some intelligence about how people would goad you into doing things that weren't proper.  I noticed that some other school kids had a really hard time in our neighborhood about their parents and about doing the wrong thang.  We never got whipped, by the time my parents got through talking to us it's just like, "we never gon' do it again."  You could be at the kitchen sink washing dishes, dad would walk by and go, "you know that thing you did a couple of weeks ago?"  And you're like, "which one?" 'cause you know you got in hot water then and he'd bring it right up just like it was yesterday, and you're like, "I'm never doing this again," 'cause you had to reexamine again why you did it and by then it's the fifteenth, eighteenth time and you're like telling yourself, "I swear I'm never gon' do it again" (laughter), and they talked us to death, so we, we behaved really well.
Speaker 1: So they had strict standards, high standards they held you to?
Speaker 2: They were educators and we were the only family members on my mother's side living in [Washington] D.C. and even on my father's side at the time. They were all in Chicago [Illinois] or West Virginia but we were the only ones that lived in the city and they taught in Prince George's County [Maryland] and were principals in Prince George's County.  My mother was one of the first educators to integrate elementary school over in Seat Pleasant that she eventually became the principal of and now the library's named after her today.  My dad went from Kent Junior High to being principal of Maryland Park Junior High and from there from Samuel Ogle High [School] in Bowie [Maryland] and both of them were in education more than thirty years before they retired in the '80s and he retired two years before she did so they were always just even.  They liked to have a good time, they'd go out.  We get left with our cousins or go down to our grandmother's house when we were younger and they'd order party platters and friends would come over, they'd be all dressed up and next thing we know my dad would say "see you tomorrow" and we wouldn't not see them again until noon the next day or maybe 8:00 in the morning like from the Easter Dawn Dance, he was a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] so you know fraternity brothers gotta hang out and of course they went to everybody else's dance too.  My mother always regretted that she didn't pledge Delta [Sigma Theta Sorority] when she was in college but she was too busy, but when she retired she did become a Delta, so I had the joy of pinning her.  So my mother became my soror too, but we were already great friends.  My dad and my mom were my best friends even when I was little.
Story_ID: 128710
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Just one other, just one brother, he was fourteen months younger than me.  He's a lawyer and when we were growing up, we stuck for each other because it was just two of us and lot of other families had more than two so we both were in accelerated programs but his program came along a little bit later than mine but when my brother's program started, his program accelerated past mine, so by the time I got to the seventh grade my brother was doing eighth grade work and ninth grade work and here I'm doing seventh grade work going "I'm the oldest!"  (Laughter), but it was fun to learn.  We use to like to read like crazy.
Speaker 1: What's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Jonathan Farmer.
Speaker 1: Jonathan Farmer.
Speaker 2: Jonathan Lancaster Farmer.
Story_ID: 128711
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah being dressed up to play in the snow and so much snow that I remember it coming up to my chest and my father [George Thomas Farmer] walking us down to an alleyway where we could put the sled out and sled up and down the hill, that's, that I remember that probably the most.  I remember Christmas time getting a guitar and me trying to play it left handed instead of right handed.  I remember dinners, I remember watching TV.  I remember little ceramic things that sat on the edge of the phone table when I was little and I tried to pick it up.  I remember a cap gun I had I shot my uncle with by mistake 'cause we didn't know the little piece of metal was still in there.  So the cap made a concussion that made the piece of metal give him a wound, just glad it didn't end up in his face or something.
Speaker 1: From a cap gun really?
Speaker 2: Yeah the piece of stuff they coat the cap guns with wasn't totally out of the center of the barrel, it was a brand new cap gun so that was a flaw of a cap gun back in those days, 'cause back in those days it was about cowboys and Indians.
Speaker 1: Right, that was the big thing to play when you were a little kid, cowboys and Indians.
Speaker 2: Had little figurines I'd make, I'd make mountains in history and I already knew the Native Americans weren't gettin' done right then 'cause my mom and dad use to buy us these series of books that told all these wonderful stories and then we got the classic books about the Mohicans, 'Last of the Mohicans' [by James Fenimore Cooper] and Captain Kidd and the Ship.  My mother figured if I was going to read comic books that had Superman and Batman I should read the classics too, so I still have my comic books.  I have about 2,000 comic books.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) oh, that's something, that's something, yeah those, those are valuable now.
Speaker 2: I haven't even tried to figure it out, I'm just glad.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: to have 'em.
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: I'm like little, little queen Midas just hoarding them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah they are.  I wish I had the ones I had you know from back in those days.
Speaker 2: I got the ten set version.
Speaker 1: I didn't throw 'em away, but (laughter).
Speaker 2: See, naw' I told 'em, "nothing happens to these books" plus I put them in a big barrel in the basement of the house and sealed it up so they would stay intact, and I just go in there now and then and go "yeah" (laughter).
Story_ID: 128712
Speaker 1: We always ask this question though you're already answering it, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Cooking 'cause my grandmother did cooking, I remember the tunnel of fudge cake, I remember knowing the broccoli was gonna be cooked and we didn't like broccoli or the smell of it 'cause it was limp by the time it got done.  I remember the pies always smelled great, you get chocolate chip cookies we'd go nuts for 'cause she put--my grandmother put pecans and walnuts in 'em.  Surprisingly enough years later my father [George Thomas Farmer] turned into a chef.  His specialty became fruit cakes at Christmas and he put the brandy 'em or the rum and we're like "go ahead, Pop"  Who knew he could cook but he did so many other things that we were all shocked to death when he liked cooking and then at that time we said you gotta quit cooking we're all getting fat, 'cause he'd just make a recipe and just go to town with it, but by then my grandmother was very, very old and not doing as much as often, but we've had a great life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where did you live in the city in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Southeast, Benning Heights.
Speaker 1: Southeast?
Speaker 2: Always lived in Benning Heights or on E Street in the apartment buildings over there at first and then just before I turned five years old we moved a few blocks away to Hilltop Terrace and they bought a house and it was a block from school--
Story_ID: 128713
Speaker 1: So what was your personality like growing up, what, what, were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Curious, kinda they could get me to do almost anything they wanted, 'cause by the time they explained it just made sense.  I remember totally being not interested at all in sewing and yet I was putting together model airplanes and goofy, crazy car figures that had action stuff and big eyes and lots of garish colors and I had made some Batman and Superman plastic models by Aurora you put together and paint and my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] said, "you should try sewing" and I said, "why"?  And she said, "it was just like putting together a model airplane except it is a little harder 'cause you gotta cut it out.  These are not pre-made parts."  Okay, so that's how she got me hooked, so the next think I know I'm sewing and then at the same time there's a class coming along in Home Ec. when I'm in junior high school about--so I make my first apron, make my first wrap-around skirt and my mother's always made our clothes.  She made shirts, you could tell the farmers at a picnic 'cause all of us would have the same, but different style of top you know at, at the gatherings but my mother always made even her fanciest gowns and dresses and her work clothes, so she was very meticulous with her sewing so we could go look at stuff people were selling and look inside at the facing or the hem or something and go "not made very well" and she loved the Vogue patterns and McCall's [patterns] and I'd go with her to the fabric stores and I began to appreciate the difference of being able to create your own clothes and have something that nobody else would have so, I too turned into a seamstress until music bit me and then it was like, I'd rather practice.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you started sewing?
Speaker 2: I'd say probably about twelve. Twelve.
Speaker 1: And then you got involved in music?
Speaker 2: I was already in music, when I was eight I started taking piano lessons.
Speaker 1: Okay. When I got to junior high school I started playing clarinet and I was interested in alto clarinet but didn't have one so I started playing bassoon.  So now I'm playing bassoon, clarinet and piano through junior high and high school so much so that the basketball morning practice went by the wayside, 'cause I'd rather play with the band or the orchestra during rehearsals in the morning, so.  I joined the D.C. Youth Symphony Orchestra [sic, D.C. Youth Orchestra] and I was second string bassoonist forever, could never unseat the first bassoonist.  We'd have competitions, "Sharon's ready, she's gonna unseat 'em," and it wouldn't happen. I could never play well enough to knock him off, but I went off to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] as a bassoon major with a minor in piano and clarinet.
Story_ID: 128714
Speaker 1: Okay, well I won't get you to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] yet, but what was your first grade school, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: At Davis Elementary [School, Washington, D.C.] right up the street.
Speaker 1: Davis Elementary School, okay and so did you like school initially or?
Speaker 2: Oh I loved school, you learn stuff.  You always felt the teacher cared, no one was really cutting up back in those days to make so trouble you couldn't learn and we had lessons and we had homework and we knew what the expectations were and plus when I got to my house I knew I had to do homework 'cause I'm living with two educators, so you do your homework and you couldn't watch TV till you had it done and by a certain TV's off, time to go to bed so you can ready for the next day, but I'd always practice my music at night in the house.  By the time I got to be about twelve, they had built an addition onto the house, maybe even sooner than that, maybe ten.  They had built separate rooms for me and my brother [Johnathan Lancaster Farmer] on the top floor 'cause we had shared a room next to theirs on the first for the longest and I could even practice even more upstairs.
Speaker 1: Now this is in Benning Heights [neighborhood in Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: This is in Benning Heights.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the house 'cause by then we were living in the house, yeah.  We have a big back yard.  All the people in the neighborhood had kids too.  We all pretty much got along so we played and the yards were connected because they were no fences up except on one side so we could do sporting events, we could sled down the hills and slide into the alley and keep on going.  It'd take a little bit--it was fun, it was like being on a speedway on the sleds.  I remember riding bicycles around the block and being told you couldn't go past the block so that means that you could cut through the backyards and fly down the hill 'cause you'd still be upright by the time you landed at the hill.  It was fun, we had some older people who did other things but we didn't hang with them, because they were a little bit more rougher than us, mainly because their interests were different and we were all about within a five-year range of each other so we could play a lot.  We could play out late at night; we could do "hide and seek."  We could play horse, dodge ball, kick ball.  I remember all the sports, I remember my father [George Thomas Farmer] coming to me one day saying "okay, that's it no more football."  "I'm the quarterback what are you talking about?"  He's like, "no just touch."  "Oh, no, no I just rocked his side."  "You're not listening, Sharon."  I looked at him and said I'm telling you so, I'm like what is he talking about.  So my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] started dropping the hint that my football days were finished and I'm like looking at my brother [Jonathan Farmer] going "you can't let this happen, you can't catch a book--a ball without me," and he's like "yeah, but I think dad's like concerned that the guys you know, you're growing a little."  "Okay."

Speaker 1: We're, we're back so Davis Elementary School [Washington, D.C.] you started there.  Did you, did you go all the way through eighth grade there?
Speaker 2: No, went through fifth grade and then I had taken a test that propelled me to go a school that integrated over closer in the town.
Speaker 1: What was that called?
Speaker 2: Penn Branch area, oh it was called Randle [Highlands] Elementary School [Washington, D.C.] so my brother [Jonathan Lancaster Farmer] took the test the next year and next year he ended up over there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you finish at Randle?
Speaker 2: For elementary and then junior high I was Kramer [Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Was that with a "C" or a "K?"
Speaker 2: A "K."
Speaker 1: "K," Kramer Junior High School okay.  Was this also a special program, a gifted program?
Speaker 2: No not at all it was the next, it's either go there or go to Sousa [John Philip Sousa Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] and Kramer allowed me to continue to go to school with the people that I'd been at that last year in elementary school with and then lo and behold some my classmates from Davis ended up at Kramer also, so it was like reunion time, plus it was right next to the Anacostia High School [Washington, D.C.] which I would've gone to anyway so; I like student activities so, I was a member of clubs, I played chess all the time, I was the chess club president, even won third prize one year for the city-wide championship.  Chess was always integral and plus my neighbors played chess where we grew up at and they were a little bit older than us and they taught us strategy and then one guy who was my age really could play chess and he'd whip everybody including the adults, so every time I played Hughie [ph.] it was a challenge and if I even made him scared a little bit I was thrilled to death you know (laughter) with that psychological, total involve, the next you know the day is gone.  I love chess.
Speaker 1: Now who taught you how to play or?
Speaker 2: Between Hughie and my next door neighbors across the way.  Oh, and then Martin Boone [ph.] use to date my cousin and we'd ask too many questions when he'd come over to visit my cousin.  He says, "You and your brother [Jonathan Lancaster Farmer] know how to play chess?"  We're like, "no."  He taught us how to play chess first, that's how we first learned.  He showed us how to make the moves and then my brother and I were getting gross playing chess and we'd be upstairs and my cousin's downstairs with her boyfriend, we just happy to play chess (laughter).
Speaker 1: He was probably glad he taught you (laughter).
Speaker 2: I am.
Story_ID: 128762
Speaker 1: So okay now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I liked all the subjects, music was probably my favorite--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Because of the creativity and to be able to play things you couldn't play, and to be able to read music was fun, but I liked all the classes because we had a good--good teachers, they really spent time with us.  They'd come early, stay late.  I remember a white guy named Mr. Frye's [ph.] English class.  It was like intellectually stimulating to talk about English and these things that we had discovered and loved about good books.  Who knew a good book could be all of that?  So I began to appreciate things I didn't know about and then I'd heard about 'A Raisin In The Sun,' [Lorraine Hansberry] but had not seen it or knew that much about it.  So I managed to get a hold of a small booklet about 'A Raisin In The Sun,' I'm like who is this Lorraine Hansberry?  So that she was black was fascinating to me and then I looked something up in the encyclopedia and ran across Zora Neale Hurston and the Harlem Renaissance they were talking about so that piqued my curiosity about who was writing what.
Speaker 1: So this is all in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had really good, we had dynamite English teachers.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Anacostia.
Speaker 1: Anacostia High School [Washington, D.C.]. Okay so did you have black teachers there?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was mainly black and had a lot of white teachers too.  When I got there the principals, all the principals were white, even the assistant principal who use to be the football coach Lombardi.  We had about half and half, fifty, fifty, but we had more black students than white students and that number diminished the older I got but we all got along, there was no animosity.  If anything it was like the school across town, McKinley Tech [McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.], 'cause they whopped everybody in the sports and then they had the nerve to be rude and rock our busses before we'd get on and leave so it was interesting.  The biggest thing people seemed to do at school was either go to school or not, and if you didn't go to school we knew you were the bad kids, hanging out, drinking, hadn't figured which way was up and we didn't run around with you, plus my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] and father's [George Thomas Farmer's] position was I couldn't go out with anybody unless they had met their parents.  So my life was controlled, but yet I could get into fights because I was disciplined. So I remember going home from school with my bassoon when I was still in junior high school and my team had whipped the business section playing the championship basketball game.  I think I was in the eighth or ninth grade and it just one thing led to another and the next thing I know I got a little gang of girls gon' follow me down to the bus stop wanting to beat my butt. I remember setting my bassoon down and going "come on, let's just get this over with," and they all backed off and went on away, but the big, little ring leader wouldn't leave me alone so she tried to get me one day at lunch.  That's the only time I ever got into a fight that my parents got called to school for and I didn't get into any more fights after that.  They kept me so busy and they wouldn't give me a ride to get where I had to go.  I had to catch the bus.  My father "oh you're gon' learn how the city works."  I looked at him "I need a ride to get to," "oh, no, no take the bus."  "Mom, dad's busy will you give me a ride so I can go to my music lesson?"  "Oh, take the bus, 'cause you're gonna learn how your city works."  So I had to do three transfers to get from Southeast up to [Calvin] Coolidge High School [Washington, D.C.] for the D.C. Symphony Youth Orchestra [D.C. Youth Orchestra], but they did that so I couldn't get in trouble on weekends, 'cause I would.

Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Now was there any indication when you were growing up that you were going to be a photographer?
Speaker 1: Only that my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] had a camera, so if we got cleaned she'd take our picture, go to church take our picture, somebody's birthday she'd take the pictures and then they gave me an Instamatic but I wasn't particularly--I didn't care, but my uncle always had a camera so I wasn't particular but I watched the pictures grow through the years.  When I went off to college my mother said, "don't call, you can write, send pictures."  So they gave me a small camera and I never knew this was gonna happen like this but it just all worked out.
Speaker 2: Okay, so well when you were in high school now you were involved with a lot of clubs you said and a lot of activities.
Speaker 1: Even the school paper, The Kramer Remark in junior high school, The Anacostia Indian Newspaper.  I liked to write, I wasn't taking pictures for either one.
Speaker 2: Okay. But I like clubs, I like people who got things done.
Speaker 1: All right, did you have a favorite teacher in high school or?
Speaker 2: I liked 'em all, I guess the music teacher, Mr. Blaine [ph.] because he just kept that band going and we had uniforms.  We did better, we went from having nothing to a lot and pride, the, the civic pride of being with your school and then watching the Anacostia Museum [Washington, D.C.] open on Good Hope Road and we were the marching band that opened up the museum and now it's years later, John Kinard [John Robert Edward Kinard] is dead but the museum goes on, it's a hell of a legacy what got started and to be part of that, that's what I remember about that we marched in there and played music.
Story_ID: 128764
Speaker 1: When--so when you were a senior you--well you know you were going to college but how did you choose a college and what did you wanna be?  Did you want to be a?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a concert bassoonist.
Speaker 1: Okay. I had been accepted at all the colleges around [Washington] D.C. and only for the heck of it did I apply to University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio], Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] and Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] actually tried to recruit me and then I said well I don't want to go there, I want to stay in D.C.  I don't want to travel anywhere and my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] and father [George Thomas Farmer] were like, "oh no you're going away for at least a year," and I'm like what are you talking about I don't want to go anywhere?  I thought they were trying to get rid of me, but my dad said to me you know after a year if you don't like it you can come home.  My mother was like yeah, after a year, but before that you're outta here, and I was just like "what's wrong with you people?" and gave me the camera and who knew I'd get away and love it?  Didn't know and I played my bassoon faithfully for about 18 months and then one day a guy I was dating was taking a photo journalism class and went to the dark room so I got to see how images were made.  I just thought it was fascinating as it could be.  I still intended on being a concert bassoonist until I found out you had to wait for somebody either to die or retire because back in those days if you held your chair, you held your chair.  You could be eighty-nine years old still playing the timpani in the band or being the viola person as long as you could maintain the symphony sound.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now correct me if I'm wrong, but I guess most orchestras have maybe one or two bassoon players?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: That's, that's about it right?
Speaker 1: That's it?
Speaker 2: And they really don't want any more than that?
Speaker 1: You gotta be outstanding.
Speaker 2: So you might have a, might have a legion of flute players, or a battery of clarinet players, but when--or trumpet players but when it comes to bassoon or oboe you got one or two of 'em.
Speaker 1: You are special.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Plus it looked weird and it sounded very different and by then I had heard Sun Ra Arkestra and I could hear a bassoon in the background going "you kidding me," and that piqued my interest.
Speaker 2: Now where did you hear Sun--how did you hear Sun, Sun Ra?
Speaker 1: The people I use to run with in college, that's how I figured out who what 'Maiden Voyage' [HM Herbie Hancock] was with Herbie Hancock was my first jazz album. Somebody played it for me I'm like, "holy, moly" and I'm playing all this concert and Brahms [Johannes Brahms] stuff, I'm like I need to switch.
Speaker 2: Now did you parents play jazz at home?
Speaker 1: No but they played albums, I mean they played a lot of albums, they danced a lot so I got to hear the music but I was into Temptations, and Martha and the Vandellas, and Junior Walker and the Allstars, and I'd brought song books based on those songs.  So I could play 'Shotgun,' [Junior Walker] and Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) on the oboe?
Speaker 1: No, on the piano, I had fund, never, because all the YouTube, all the, all the stuff with the bassoon was not there until I heard this band with Sun Ra I had no idea you could really stretch outside of what you are used to.  When I was coming along Duke Ellington was seeming old and stayed, and Herbie Hancock and Billy Cobham were the hot things, and then I discovered Ibrahim, Al--I mean Ibrahim, Dollar Brand [Abdullah Ibrahim formerly known as Dollar Brand] he was in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Ibra--yeah.
Speaker 1: And to hear the piano
Speaker 2: Abdullah Ibrahim.
Speaker 1: Yeah and to hear that piano do all that, I'm like was it, what's the key to jazz, then I discovered it was chords and knowing for real your scales, no messin' around not knowing your scales, so it was very interesting.
Speaker 2: Now that is something, those, those are some of the most creative you know performing, Abdullah Ibrahim, you know Sun Ra (unclear).
Speaker 1: Then I got turned on to Mary Lou Williams the piano player and I began to understand women played jazz too besides singing.  I knew all the women singers but how many women were really the musicians and I, I can see the difficulty with some of that and then at the time when you got into an orchestra, starting pay was anywhere between $18,000 and $22,000 a year, if you were with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra or the one in Cleveland [Ohio] so other things began to look like different, plus we were going through campus turmoil back in those days at Ohio State.  When I got to school at Ohio State you got 40,000 students on campus and less than 500 black in undergrad are black so there was some polarization here.
Story_ID: 128765
Speaker 1: So you graduated from high school in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, you started okay, or (unclear) you in 1969, what 40,000 students, Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] is and then was the largest or second largest school in the nation.  I think the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] at one time was the largest.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think UCLA [University of California, Los Angles, Los Angles, California]--three of 'em vied for it.  They, they--flows back and forth.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now Ohio State is I think at the present time but it's a big university.
Speaker 2: Wow, it was a hell of an experience, yep you had to always be humping to get to class on time if you didn't catch the jitney, it was deep.
Speaker 1: So it's in, it's located in the heart of Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 2: In the first two years I stayed in the dorm and my third year I had some, an apartment with two of my friends.  After that I stayed in an apartment, I didn't like congested living (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what was the turmoil on campus?
Speaker 2: White students didn't have to show any I.D. and black students did to ride the jitney, cultural differences about how some things can get done, musical entertainment, how you wanna spend your evening or your weekends.  The lack of money, you could give money to one group of people but yet not to another bunch to make sure they stay in school.  Who was getting the scholarships and yet all the State money should go for what, I mean so you figure how many black people live in Ohio and out of those black people how many black students are getting a scholarship?, Well nowhere near what their tax dollars were paying, so we had lots of disputes about how the grant money was being given out and the fact that you had to work so hard and still be in school but work so hard and you saw other students who were not of color who didn't have to worry about any of those issues, so where's the parity?  So we began to have these discussions on campus about being fair to every student on campus, so that's what my era was about to me and meanwhile Kent State's [Four students shot at Kent State University, Kent, Ohio in May 1970] unfolding.  I remember them tearing the sidewalk up when--the day they heard people were killed.
Speaker 1: That's, that was your first year right, this?
Speaker 2: That's--by then it's my--is it '70 [1970], now it's still my first year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the spring of '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Spring of '70 [1970] and I'm gone over 'cause I pledged Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] in the fall of '69 [1969].  Well back in those days you stayed on line forever and I went over in April of that year and by then we're acting stupid about some things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's big campus unrest in Ohio, we had the killing of the students at Kent State [Kent, Ohio] after a Vietnam [War] demonstration.  It made national news, front page of the Time magazine, Ohio State--I mean all the state schools in Ohio and in many of 'em they were afraid that there was gonna be a lot of fear in the air I remember.
Speaker 2: Well especially for the black ones who were still mad about what happened at Jackson State [Two students killed at Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi in May 1970].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: People knew people who went to school down there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, two students at Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi] were killed right, in Mississippi? So the people I met at Ohio State were very intelligent, they read a lot, very political.
Speaker 2: Yeah we were talking off-camera about Ako Kambon was the head of the black student organization and--
Story_ID: 128766
Speaker 1: Michael White who went on to become mayor of Cleveland, Ohio; we had some people doin' some stuff and we didn't know, and then there was dean Chuck Williams [ph.] who was an assistant dean of students and in order to get school money to function you had to have an advisor and Chuck ended up mentoring and advising almost eighteen different groups on campus.  He'd make the time to do that for us and he was very intelligent about how we had to do our politics if we were gonna negotiate with the administration who really carried the whole ball of wax, so Chuck taught us how to be good, good citizens as well as politicians to make a difference.
Speaker 2: So would you consider him like a mentor to the black students?
Speaker 1: I went to him with everything 'cause he knew stuff and he never failed us, he never did not have time to listen to what your problem was, or how somebody could be helped or he knew some student needed some money to get something done.  He'd, he'd make a way, he'd find a way.  He'd get you a job--Chuck was very, he showed us the world way before we had to really deal with the world.
Speaker 2: He also--and also the head of Black Studies was it [Dr. William E. "Nick" Nelson] Nick Nelson?
Speaker 1: Nick the stuff that was going on then, Charles [Ewanza] Ross was the original head of black studies and the people who ran Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] didn't like Charles Ross because Charles challenged him on everything that they said and did.  We could talk about the institution of racism at Ohio State and have a leg to stand on just going through history and even with Jesse Owens having been there, graduated from there and had his achievements, we knew what a hard time he had at Ohio State.  We began to meet older black alumni that would come visit the campus and talk about what it was like to be a student at Ohio State in the '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s],'50s [1950s].  And your eyes are just getting' bigger and bigger going "wow" and now you're looking at what the person's doing now, they're close to retirement, they're a doctor, they're a lawyer they have made some achievements, but they said none of this came without struggle.
Speaker 2: Okay so there was an inner-generational transference.
Speaker 1: Chuck Williams made that happen, he, he and some other people knew the value of bringing older students to campus and at that time two, it was only two black folk on the board of trustees at Ohio State and they were pretty much removed from us, they were not engaged with the campus population at all.  They'd meet and go home, and.
Speaker 2: Who are they, I mean what do they?
Speaker 1: Let's see, first guy's name was Dorsey [Robert S. Dorsey], I can't think of his first name.  His daughter is Jacqueline Dorsey who's a newscaster down in Atlanta and I can't think of the lady's name [Patricia D. James] who was from Cleveland now, but those are the only two black board of trustees members I ever met at the time when I was at Ohio State.  I remember there as one, just the man, and then the lady came along a few years before I graduated, but it was an issue.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what--tell us what happened to Charles Ewanza Ross we use to call him.
Speaker 1: Oh, Charles yeah, Ewanza Ross, he basically got fired from the job and then started doing I'll say community teaching and still he had his degrees so he could still write his papers, do his thing, he was never reinstated and then Nick became the head of the--but Nick was acting for a long time.  They wouldn't make Nick the one.  They're testing Nick the administration is so before they made Nick the guy.
Speaker 2: Nick Nelson, yeah so, so was Richard Kelsey there, Marabi Kelsey [Dr. Richard "Moriba" Kelsey]?
Speaker 1: Yep, he was there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in the department.
Speaker 1: He was quiet.
Speaker 2: Okay he didn't.
Speaker 1: He didn't, he'd show now and then but he was quiet.  Dr. Greg [ph.] over in the Department of Education was strong, he may even still be there, but he never, he, he was good at getting stuff done but he just did it his way in black education.
Story_ID: 128767
Speaker 1: But you were majoring in music right?
Speaker 2: Uh-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you take courses in the black studies department?
Speaker 2: Umm-umm.
Speaker 1: You didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I was hanging out with people who did poetry and wore black Afrocentric clothing, no I didn't feel compelled 'cause I read so much I was still reading books and I was beginning to enjoy jazz and my peer group had a lot of knowledge about some things because they came from other places, and I'm from [Washington] D.C., they from the Midwest.  They know how things work.
Speaker 1: Now did you have interaction with a lot of the other students in the other schools?  Now for those who are watching this and don't know Ohio's got more colleges probably than any other state and they are all just black students at all of 'em.
Speaker 2: We hooked up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Otterbein [University, Westerville, Ohio], and Wesleyan [Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio] and there's so of those black, Capitol University's [Columbus, Ohio] got black students.
Speaker 2: Only with the sororities, if we, if the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] had a function other Deltas from other schools would come.  Because of the black student newspaper we had Our Choking Times we'd get together with other black students.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Our Choking Times.
Speaker 2: Our Choking Times, so we'd get together with other black students from other colleges that had or either Bowling Green [State University, Bowling Green, Ohio], University of Miami [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio] and we all met at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] a couple of times trying to see how we could all help each other.
Speaker 1: Our Choking Times, who came up with that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Melvin, Melvin came up with that.
Speaker 1: Melvin, you don't remember his last name?
Speaker 2: What's Melvin's last name?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Melvin Williams.
Speaker 1: Melvin Williams, okay.  Gee whiz, so, so they was a highly organized black student group at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: We talked to each other, you know you speak to people on campus, you nod your head, you say "yeah," the newspaper was part of our connection, the campus life at lunch time and after dinner.  The student union, we could go and know where you are gonna see somebody there you knew, find out where the parties were, who's having a hard time studying, who needs some tutoring--heard you need some tutoring, they tell you that, that and you, you'd deal with it.  You had older student who actually said to you "you do wanna go to grad school, there is money available,"  And you'd look at 'em "I want outta here, I'm not staying for grad school" but we made a strong enough program that Ohio State began to go after grad students that came from Historically Black Colleges 'cause that was our way of paying back the community saying "everybody can share an education here," some people need it and we need it so you're gonna have to build your next generation of leadership and Ohio State's a damn good institution to learn a lot of stuff at.
Story_ID: 128768
Speaker 1: Okay you were saying I know before we started that you were going back for a reunion this weekend--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And of all the black students who came out with you.
Speaker 2: Through the years, Ohio State's [Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] almost 200 years old now [sic, OSU was founded in 1870, at the time of the interview was 138 years old] and all through the year's there's always been some black students, but we've always come pack in "knit" in pockets, a little bit here, a little bit there, and is the biggest reunion we've ever tried to have.  We're going after all classes all students so we can talk about what has to happen for the next generation's coming.  Money's still tight for education; it cost more than ever to go to school.  How do we ensure for future generations that you still have access to quality education?  I got a quality education at Ohio State, never mind the difficulties it was or the slights that went on in school.  I made a point to sit on the front row no matter where I was, not matter how difficult the topic, and I was gonna be there on time if nothing else, but that's part of what you do as you get ready for the world, 'cause you got students older than you, you got students in Grad school, you got your sorority sisters, they've seen it, they've been there longer than you.  Some of them are still on campus but not the way they use to be.  They got jobs in the City but they come back for the parties and you begin to understand there's another way of life and what's expected of you, and then Chuck [Williams] [ph.] would always talk about the adversarial thangs and I remember Angela Davis was on the run and we all felt that was very unfair about how they decided she had something and they didn't have any real proof, and she had done something and therefore now the government now was after her.  So that was very adversarial to us because this is someone trying to help people and here we are at Ohio State.  We trying to help some people too so we could, we could identify with her as a black woman.
Speaker 1: Did her sister ever come to speak Fania Davis [Jordan].
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know I heard her at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] I guess during those same years in '71 [1971] I guess I heard her in Oberlin.  Her brother [Benjamin Frank] Ben Davis went to Defiance College [Defiance, Ohio] in
Speaker 2: I remember that name okay.
Speaker 1: And ended up playing for the Browns.
Speaker 2: Okay, yes, yes, I lost track of all that, but yes I remember.
Speaker 1: It's an interesting group of people you had the strong, the National Black Political Assembly had a strong presence in Ohio, in those days (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was very strong 'cause of Ron Daniels.  I mean I remember the first meetings "what we gon' do, how we?"--Ohio had one of the strongest delegations in Gary, Indiana 'cause of that fellow.  I still admire Ron Daniels to this day even in New York [New York] 'cause he deals with the constitutional issues that they're trying to erode our rights about.  He's still on the front lines after all these years.  He's a hero to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah he was right there in Youngstown [Ohio].
Speaker 2: He a bad boy, he understands the nature and that's why he and Chuck [Williams] got along so well.  I learned a lot.  I bet some of that came from Ron [Daniels] that Chuck learned.
Story_ID: 128769
Speaker 1: Okay, so Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] had probably the largest collection of black students and you know you (unclear) said you like the organization, so you're talking about a couple thousand students, probably black students on campus?
Speaker 2: No, well not, not in those we still had what--let's see when I, I got to Ohio State less than 500, when I graduated there were about 2,200 black students on in the Ohio state system, and that's grad and undergrad, they never.
Speaker 1: That's out of 40,000.
Speaker 2: Yes and by the time I'm leaving school now it's 50,000 students on campus.  Ohio State is still growing, a growing, a growing, so you know it's still a drop in the bucket for--all you want really in the end is parity and I'm with Rodney King, why can't we all get along?  And my parents [Winifred Lancaster Farmer and George Thomas Farmer] never exhibited prejudice about anything.  She'd always--my mom and dad would always say "you can do better and that you're smart and never let anybody tell you you're dumb."  I did not hear the word the "N" word until I was in the sixth grade going to that white school I went do because I did better and I'm a crossing guard too and I heard this young man across the street say that word and I said "what does that mean," he says you don't know what that means?  I said "naw," I went home and asked my mother and father, they were appalled.  My father said if anybody says that word to you, you tell them they can't say that word and if they say that to you need to tell me and you go tell principal, and I was like "oh yeah" and I went back and told that young man, "I dare him to say that word again," 'cause my father was angry.  That's the first time I've seen even flash an anger, but he knew I could take care of myself, 'cause I could fight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Story_ID: 128770
Speaker 1: So now and so you majored in music at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], you, you, did you take a photography course at Ohio State?
Speaker 2: Um-hum I took the science of photography from Dr. Harry Beniel [ph.], he made it so much fun and I had no idea.  I just thought I would take one course and be done with it, but it was fascinating and one course led to another and by then I'd know how money I could make if I get out and become a concert bassoonist and also by then campus was much more active, and I wasn't for staying hold up five to six hours a day alone practicing, so I was getting more gregarious with the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority because we did community projects on campus and off campus too and then being a part of Our Choking Times newspaper, I was with some dynamite people, small bunch of us.  We put out a great paper and every two weeks it was like gone, I mean everybody read it and The Lantern which was the official school paper would say one thing, we were like "that ain't gon' happened" and we run it down our way and then at time Nestle Corporation was really hittin' up on the food department to buy more of their products.  Well someone on our staff had read that Nestle milk products were killing kids in Africa and so we wrote a big story about it, why you should boycott Nestle.  Next thing I know the paper Babylon with oh, Kathleen Clever and them are paying attention to what we're writing.  Our paper is starting to get out to more than a few places so Kathleen Cleaver came and visited us at Ohio State University.  It was deep.
Story_ID: 128725
Speaker 1: We're rolling again and you're talking about the Wall of Respect in Chicago [Illinois] that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Wall of Respect in Chicago.
Speaker 1: [HM] Roy Lewis, a local.
Speaker 2: Roy Lewis had shot the Wall.
Speaker 1: [Washington] D.C. photographer shot.
Speaker 2: Right and, and I remember seeing Ebony magazine going "all right, somebody's mad," and they gon' do they art, I like that.  We were more political in Ohio, we didn't do culture except as music.  We didn't have any black art teachers on campus and by the time Robert Stowell [ph.] came he was into pottery and you couldn't exactly up on the wall and we had complained about all these different departments on campus not having one black professor, not one person of color, no native Americans, and we're like "just try to make a little change here" and the university [Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] fought us tooth and nail.  The vice president of the university  was the hatchet man, John Mount [John T. Mount, vice president for student affairs] so can you imagine my disappoint years later, I'm visiting Ohio State's campus and I discover there's a building on the other side of the Olentangy River named after him.  I was just like "no," (laughter) how could you do this after all the things he said and did?  He, he tried to thwart us, all kinds of ways.
Story_ID: 128726
Speaker 1: Now, now did you have any interaction with the--now those are the years when Ohio State's [University, Columbus, Ohio] football team was the biggest deal in the country, Archie Griffin and--
Speaker 2: I always had football tickets, Archie use to ride back and forth with me and Cornelius [Greene].  I was the only from [Washington] D.C. that had a car for the longest and Archie and Cornelius, the first black quarterback.
Speaker 1: Cornelius Greene.
Speaker 2: Un-hun, he and Cornelius got to be great friends and he'd go visit Cornelius--they'd catch a ride with me, 'cause they'd say "Sharon you going to D.C.?"
Speaker 1: So Cornelius was from.
Speaker 2: Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Washington, D.C. okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah he was a fantastic young man.
Speaker 1: He's the toughest, thin quarterback if I've ever seen, I mean he would.
Speaker 2: He was bad, he can scramble really fast.  He knew how to dodge, he could dodge really good.  You get ready to clutch him all of a sudden you got air, he was very, very good, plus all the football players would stay around during the summertime because they all had summer jobs so they could start working out getting ready, and because my dad [George Thomas Farmer] was a football coach for so many years I always had tickets going to the game.  I'm a big sports enthusiast--
Story_ID: 128727
Speaker 1: I really got mad though when I discovered that the marching band didn't have any women in it.  So that wasn't helping my attitude about music.
Speaker 2: Now I didn't know that, so Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] band in those days had no--
Speaker 1: When I tried to join the band and they said no bassoons, and I said okay well I play clarinet and then they finally broke it down that they--did I notice that there were no women out there and I hadn't it (laughter), but when you realize it, you get a little mad and then you begin to say that pictures are looking really good and then I was grilling hamburgers making part time money in the student union and discovered I could take pictures and get $5.00 down from anybody--go work for one of the newspapers around Columbus, Ohio thanks to Amos Lynch and to the Call and Post I quit grilling hamburgers and photography just took me over.  I met another photographer named Valentine who was the Columbus [Ohio] community photographer.  Valentine worked for everybody, he, he'd make it work for them because he said he was always doing a service to his people and his attitude was so, so cool and he and his wife loved each other and she was as supportive of him as he were of her, and then years later she got multiple sclerosis and somehow he managed to take care of her and still get his photography work done, but for years he cared for his wife like a loving guy just could, so.
Speaker 2: What's his full name?
Speaker 1: We always called him--there is no full name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's just Valentine.
Speaker 2: Valentine, all right.
Speaker 1: And if he's got more parts to.
Speaker 2: Well, we can find it out.
Speaker 1: Yeah I never knew.
Speaker 2: Any, anybody who's serious about looking up will find it out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: In Columbus you'll, you'll find Valentine.
Speaker 2: Valentine, he was, he was a photographer for the Call and Post?
Speaker 1: He was for everybody, he did Call and Post stuff too.
Speaker 2: And for everybody, okay.
Speaker 1: But he was like your portrait family guy, your wedding guy, your, you-got-a-funeral, you know.   He, and then he'd say to me "Sharon, I can't do this, you wanna go do this?"  And I'd go do whatever it was he couldn't do sometimes.  He was very encouraging, he'd say "you don't got to go to school for this, you don't got to go to school for this," and I'm like "well I'm in school now" (laughter), my momma [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] and daddy [George Thomas Farmer] gon' hate it if I don't get my degree in something, so photography just and then a minor in the music, so it all worked out.
Story_ID: 128728
Speaker 1: Okay, can--did you get pictures of those sports stars in those days or?
Speaker 2: Only when I shot for the yearbook.  I used to work for the yearbook on campus and the first time I went to the Rose Bowl was because of the yearbook and I shot pictures on the field.
Speaker 1: The first time you went to the Rose Bowl [1973]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Most people never get a chance to go to the Rose Bowl.
Speaker 2: Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] was tough.
Speaker 1: So you had a chance to go.
Speaker 2: Twice [1973 and 1974].
Speaker 1: Ohio State went twice during that era right?
Speaker 2: Un-hun, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they--that's the era that [Archie] Griffin won the.
Speaker 2: The Heisman.
Speaker 1: The Heisman Trophy twice.
Speaker 2: It was great, yeah he was bad.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was bad, that's a bad dude, plus he was pleasant all the time, he and his brothers.  He had a large family; all of 'em were nice and friendly.  His parents were outstanding.  I mean he was an outstanding young man.  He never let the bad things get a hold of him at all.  He knew what he was about.  That's a very, very good determined person, so he was an outstanding example even though he's a few years younger than me you know of keeping your eyes on where you need to have 'em.  He was, he was extraordinary.  So now he's in charge of the alumni association.  Things have changed, he was the athletic director a few years ago, but now he's an alumni man.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet [Wayne Woodrow] Woody Hayes, or you have any thoughts about Woody?
Speaker 2: Lots of times, oh my God.  Woody Hayes was "win at all costs," that's what I learned from Woody Hayes.  There's nothing Woody wouldn't sacrifice to win and I use to have a boyfriend that played defensive tackle for Woody and he told Woody football didn't come first.  The next thing I know Mallory sitting on the bench, okay.  Riding the bench and Mallory says to me "Sharon, I can't stay here.  I'm not gon' be able to play, I'm going to Nebraska.  Why don't you come to Nebraska?"  I'm like, "no, I'm gon' stay right here at Ohio State, love you, bye!  I'm not going anywhere," but Woody believed football was first and most football players, John Hicks, Harry Howard, they were, they were all tough stuff, they played hard, Rex Kern, hey, that was, that was some team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John Bardis, oh my God--John Brock, John Brockington he could though the line--just open up, hell of a foot--fullback.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forgot about him, yeah, yeah, John Brockington right.
Speaker 2: God, un-hum.
Speaker 1: Pete Johnson was another one.
Speaker 2: Yes, we had some people who could really and were nice friendly men too on top of it.  So and there not that many black students so you all celebrate each others' things and they would all come to the black cultural stuff, they'd hang out you know, it was, it was a good, good mix.
Story_ID: 128729
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so as you were winding down your, your time at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] were you, was your, your major still music or what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No it was photography by then.
Speaker 1: Photography, okay.
Speaker 2: And then I was getting an internship at the Associated Press in Columbus, Ohio but the head photographer was not pleased to have to work with me so we didn't get along and.
Speaker 1: Were you the first black intern?
Speaker 2: Yes, his name--and his name was Steve Powell [ph.] and the editors of the A.P. [Associated Press] made sure I got my assignments and they said, don't even deal with Steve just go do your work, go in the dark room, do what you need, we'll give you the equipment you need, but don't worry about Steve 'cause there's no gettin' around his prejudicial, crazy self.  And I wasn't gon' deal with it 'cause by then I been through a few things too.  I know how to deal with you, I know how to write letters too, and they got tired of my memos.  So I learned that if you wrote one memo, you might just triple C it to everybody else you can think of so everybody knows what's going on and that way there's no mistake about it got started and this is where it's at, 'cause you got a paper trail now.  So, it was good for me to even have the adversity at the AP.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what kind of things did you shoot for at the A.P. when you?
Speaker 2: Oh weather shots, go out and get weather shot, it's raining bring something back that says "this is the weather", or head shots or stories about somebody but they got no picture of it, whatever the assignment was I went and did it.
Speaker 1: Okay so you captioned yourself as a weather, as a news photographer I guess, then that's what you were, you were.
Speaker 2: That's what I was more interested in.
Speaker 1: Heading towards, yeah.
Speaker 2: And then one of the TV stations came.  At the time they were still using film and they were telling me that I could be a great camera person and I'm like--I had taken a cinema class at Ohio State and I got a "D" in it.  I think that's the worse class I had and I didn't wanna try to do moving pictures anymore.  I just rather do stills 'cause that's where I knew what I was doing and the equipment was good that I had, so we could do a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so what were you, so were you thinking about going to graduate school when you were a senior?
Speaker 2: No, I took the LSAT [Law School Admissions Test]--I was thinking about law school 'cause my brother [Jonathan Lancaster Farmer] was interested in law school, but after I took the LSAT I was not interested in law school.  I was like these questions are like--I'm not gonna do this all day long, and then it turned out I scored higher on the LSAT than he did.  I still wasn't compelled and by then I began to shoot pictures that standalone by themselves as "artwork".  It doesn't necessarily need a caption to it, and I'm beginning to have a nice body of, of work at a young age and a portfolio that says something.
Story_ID: 128730
Speaker 1: Now at that time you were still, still in Columbus [Ohio]?  You were a senior, and?
Speaker 2: Yep, and by then it's--I'm in my fifth year and I'm running the paper at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and I'm also part of that year student body vice president and I ran for office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With a real farmer named Dennis Sergeant [ph.].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) a real farmer, was he a member of Future Farmers of America and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: He was, yep, yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: So he was the president and you were vice president?
Speaker 2: Un-hun, that's to keep the black and white coalition, that's, that's the time the black and white students really got along together at Ohio State.  I remember it was not a whole lot of animosity unless you were new to the block and didn't know we didn't do that (laughter), but it was a pleasant time after we'd had our disagreements in '70 [1970] and '71 [1971].  Unbeknownst to us though, sophistication had come into play about how things were allocated, so you had to learn what that was.  So you had some people who could school you about, well on paper it may say this, but in reality you don't have the funds, so it's like having a black cultural center, you have it but what division are you gonna be housed in because Ohio State allocated it's money according to who had been on campus longest.  So the English department was gon' get the money first, then biology.  However, however the universities and colleges fell into place, so if the black cultural center just got there, all by itself, they'd cut the funds the next year and kill it, so we had to be housed with somebody that was gon' keep us safe.  So there was an argument about housing, under the minority provost office which was new or under the student affairs office which has been there forever.  So my position was I want a Cadillac but not without bumpers, so to me the bumpers were going with the oldest organization as opposed to going with black studies who wanted it.  [Dr. William E.] Nick Nelson was determined to have it or going to office of minority affairs.  Well it didn't happen my way but at least the center did happen and lo and behold it still exists to this day so thrilled to death about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, does the center have a certain, I mean has a special name or is it--what is it called?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's named Frank Hale who was the first minority provost, Dr. Frank Hale, H-A-L-E.
Speaker 1: Frank Hale Cultural Center [Dr. Frank W. Hale, Jr. Black Cultural Center]?
Speaker 2: Un-hun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's on the south side of campus; it's the old Bradford Commons.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we were saying when we were talking off camera that you think it should've been named after.
Speaker 2: Chuck Williams [ph.].
Speaker 1: Chuck Williams.
Speaker 2: Because Chuck--Charles "Chuck" Williams took so effort to make the office of minority provost happen, he worked really hard to get other black professors to campus.  He tried to organize 'em to get together at least you know, once every few months to talk about their difficulties and what he or anybody else could do to help them, 'cause coming to Columbus [Ohio] wasn't the easiest thing for everybody, not at all.  I mean back in those days you could sure enough see a Confederate flag still riding on somebody's truck down the street; it's adversarial.
Story_ID: 128731
Speaker 1: All right, so, well when you were shooting were you, I know I've--I was trying to tell you during a break that I first saw the work of James Van Der Zee in '74 [1974].  Did you have any sense of the history of black photographers at that point or who had come before you?
Speaker 2: Yeah because a couple of things happened: weren't that many black students in my photography classes and two, I'm shootin' for the, the publications on campus and especially for the black student papers, so you begin to read things and you look at the credits, you go "well who's that?"  Well then you go look up who that is.  So I heard about [James] Van Der Zee, but didn't know how important he was till after I was out of school.  I'd heard of Roy DeCarava because of 'Sweet Flypaper of Life' [Roy DeCarava, Langston Hughes] which I had a copy of and I'd always admired the photography that seemed to be so natural, but yet so strong and the idea of coupling up with a poet like Langston Hughes was very, very important so that was, that was creativity.  There were very few black photographers hired by newspapers back in those days and my goal was to be a newspaper photographer, 'cause my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] said to me do you want to go to grad school?  And I said oh no, and she says well I guess you better go to work, and I'm like um.  So I started doing baby photography when I first came back to [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 1: So did you come immediately back to D.C. after school?
Speaker 2: I couldn't wait to leave Columbus [Ohio]. I was through at the A.P. [Associated Press], they were offering me to go further out west and I really wanted to be anywhere on the East Coast and the internship had not gone well because I wasn't getting a recommendation from Steve Powell who had passed away since then and he and I were just like, you know you talking about oil and water and I'm a woman too, so it's just like you know he was like "women can't take pictures."  I'm like how this ya-hoo (ph) gon' tell me what I can do?  And by then I've experience Ohio State's [University, Columbus, Ohio] finest racist incidents.  It's just like "this monkey will not stop my show," so once you realize who's his boss that's who I went and talked to, 'cause it's like what kinda experience you think my internship is gonna be and what do you want me to walk outta here saying about ya'll, 'cause that's where I was at 'cause I had to say that, 'cause as long as you say it's not about them, then, "oh yeah suffer gladly and smile and don't tell us your problems," but you've got somebody being overtly hostile, not being helpful and you're there as an intern.  I'm not like trying to take this guy's job so you obviously the wrong guy to be teaching me, but that wasn't gonna stop me from reading as many books as I could on photography, going to the library in Columbus [Ohio] and then having those helpful professors at Ohio State who did wanna see me do well so, it just all worked out because I kept my eyes on the prize and the idea of taking strong pictures that stood for something and had people comment, they tell you what they thought of the picture no matter what, you know, be it good or bad, so that was a good thing.  You get instantaneous reaction.  So that was part of the spur on photography too, plus I felt like I could compete so you can if you're given the opportunity.  I got some great pictures at Ohio State even during the demonstrations when we got serious about what we weren't taking anymore, so that exists now for posterity, it wouldn't of happened before if I hadn't taken the time--those golden years.
Speaker 1: So you shot pictures of the demonstrations and the, the negotiations, and the student meetings.
Speaker 2: And the student meetings, the Deltas[members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] doing their thang, the dances.  I documented life on campus because that's how you practiced your craft, you weren't gonna get better.  I can think about my earliest pictures and go "yeck, I took that?"  And then go look, "oh, there's my gem," I'm starting to, something's starting to happen here so it takes a while to figure out how to see.
Speaker 1: Now, now what were you shooting with when you started?
Speaker 2: A Nikkormat, my parents [Winifred Lancaster Farmer and George Thomas Farmer] had brought for me when I asked them to buy me a camera, that I needed one with a--initially a fifty millimeter lens and then later on they bought me a little short zoom.
Speaker 1: You know it's like a junior Nikon or something, what a Nikkormat?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, junior Nikon that's exactly what it was, very heavy, you could drop it and it still worked, yep.
Speaker 1: All right I think, I think the photography students that I met in those days were shooting with those at Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio] you know (unclear).
Speaker 2: 'Cause the Nikon was the big Kahuna and the professionals had that and those cameras cost a few thousand dollars and Nikkormat I got for less than $500 bucks.  I think it was maybe three something back in at that time.
Speaker 1: Which is still a considerable amount of money for those days.
Speaker 2: For sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: When you can have--this is what you would pay for good used car.
Speaker 2: Yep you could, you could make money to keep the small things going so I wouldn't have to call my parents asking for money you know and I could work at my pace and do my schoolwork, do my photo work and then go to the dark room.  I'd just try to get everything done.  Back in those days it was film and slides, so.  It was an interesting process and the slides always had to go to the lab.  There was a guy named Cap [ph.] from Chicago [Illinois].  I also took a little photo studio with him.  We opened up a little business that lasted all of six months.  We weren't smart enough to figure out what overhead was and what it was gon' take to make the business work and that maybe we were too far from campus to make this business work so, but we tried for about six months.
Story_ID: 128732
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came back to [Washington] D.C. in the, in 19', what was it 19'?
Speaker 2: I came back in December of '74 [1974]
Speaker 1: December of '74 [1974]
Speaker 2: And then by January of '75 [1975] the holidays were over and I'm looking at "boy I'd better get to work doing something" so started looking for photography jobs in the paper and I already called the Washington Post trying to get an appointment.  I said well I have this degree in photography, I could show you my work.  Well I went down there and showed it to whoever was in charge at the time and he didn't say much, and nothing happened, and I started looking harder in the paper for photo jobs and showing my portfolio, but the baby photography thing was, was starting, and for a few months it was okay then I got a booker that started putting the babies in different zip codes so that stuff wasn't together.  So I'm running around one side of the Beltway to the other and I'm like, this is not cool.
Speaker 1: So you had come, you'd go to the babies?
Speaker 2: Um-hum whoever had the newborns within two weeks of birth--they had this business set up that you'd go take baby pictures and I had met a guy who was already doing it named Charles Ford and Charles had turned out to be born the same day I was and we hit off.  I can't remember quite how we met except that I think we were shooting somewhere together and he's like "who are you," and I'm going "well who are you?"  And by this time I'm also back, I'm calling Ricardo Thomas who made a point to make sure I met Roland Freeman and it turns out that Roland Freeman, he's a wonderful Civil Rights photographer.  He did the history of the slave cabins; he's got books out on quilting.  I'm watching this guy looking at the work, I'm going "this is fantastic work."  Ricardo gets he and I to go out to brunch together and we're coming back standing out in front of Roland's place, a woman's driving up.  I'm saying "wow, it looks like my French teacher."  Roland was like "that's my wife," so unbeknownst to me she was married to Roland when I was in high school and I was one of her problem-less kids because by them I'm behaving and I'm learning French, not interested.  I really liked Latin, 'cause Latin was about gladiators, war and methodology.  French was like "come to dinner", "go to work", I'm like "eck", but she was a great teacher but I just didn't take to French like I did to Latin, so it's really a small world so now here is Ricardo working for Ford, here's Roland the guy who's really running off shooting important stuff.  I'm getting to see Roland's work and I'm just blow away in what he's interested in. I reminded me of my little revolution days at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] about not forgetting about what you're about and what should your work be about?  So, it turned me in another direction for making sure that I was gon' be a photographer and if I was gon' be one then I had to accept criticism, I had to exhibits.  I had to do things to prove what I was about.  So I started to do all that stuff, and Ricardo--one of my worst critics but, 'cause I could stand the criticism it made me a better photographer.  Roland wasn't generous with praise either.  Roland's thing was "don't think 'cause you young and coming in here I'm gon' give you up my secrets.  Anything I know you gotta learn on your own."  That's real plain and blunt, so it's like "I better get to workin' hard."  So you just start working and you let one thing lead to another and because I was so accessible to trying everything as a photographer it just made me a better person and a better photographer and my parents [Winifred Lancaster Farmer and George Thomas Farmer] never quit on anything either.  I never remember my father--he couldn't figure out how to get something done in the car, he'd go read about it about and go back in there and tackle it again.  I remember I use to pass him--he use to pass me the tools and then he'd say "get that (unclear) for me", and I'd be like "yeah Pop".  So I'm not scared of cars, when Charles[Ford's] car use to break down he didn't know how to get it going, he'd call me up.  By then were not hanging out so tight but it's like "yeah, I'll come rescue you," and I'd come give 'em a jump or get the valve open to the throttle so he can get the car going, follow him home (laughter), but those are, those are the things that let you know what you can do, and part of it is working with people who are difficult, and everybody's not difficult, so as time goes on I've learned to let bad people, that's all they can do is make me appreciate the good ones.  They can't rock my socks, they can't stop my world.  I've had so many people tell me what I couldn't do when I was at the Washington Post just freelancing and I could still do it and more, so you have always encouraging people and you always got ones who aren't so encouraging.  It's okay, that's the nature of the business.
Story_ID: 128733
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's kinda track your chronology of what you did.  Now you were a baby photographer you went from that to?
Speaker 2: Running a camera store. Okay.
Speaker 1: Being a--what do you call a photo finishing consultant.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was the turkey that had to tell you why your film didn't come out (laughter) back in those days.
Speaker 2: Nobody wants to hear that (laughter).
Speaker 1: A snapshot, nobody wants to hear and then you're the new kid on the block you're the one telling 'em and.
Speaker 2: Now what camera store did you work for?
Speaker 1: Snap Shops in L'Enfant Plaza [Washington, D.C.]; it was run by District Photo up in Beltsville, Maryland, and at the time they had one of the largest photo processing plants in the nation.  They put envelopes in newspapers all of the country and you could mail it back in for a reasonable price as long as you weren't expecting it in less than two weeks.  During their lull they would do all this film from outta state.  So they had these film shops, if you were local you could get it back in 24 hours.  You outta town, a week to two weeks but the price was so cheap $5.00 for a whole roll of film and you get all 36 prints back, not a problem. So they had gang-busting business and I stayed there for almost three, four years and then I did that and then they moved me to another store in Landover [Maryland] where I became an assistant manager.  As time went on became the manager and at some point within that four years they moved me back to L'Enfant Plaza and I became the manager there where I started at, but by then I got two careers going.  I'm managing the camera store, and I'm freelancing photography when I'm not in the store and managing to stay busy, 'cause one good thing leads to another. So if you do good work people tell you about it, they tell other people.  If you do a lousy job, people tell you that too, so you learn if you're gonna have good business you got to change your business practices.  So being on time got to be more important than anything, and showing up on time got to be more important than anything and then the idea you have to wait on some people.  I always say what the heck is a watch for, so I'm a time tickler, but I think it's good because the older I get now, the faster time flies by.  I don't know where the day went.  I get up at 5:00, 5:30 now just so I can say by noon did I accomplish what I wanna get done this day so?  Age is an important thing.
Story_ID: 128734
Speaker 1: So what happened when you left Snap Shots, Shops?
Speaker 2: I didn't tell my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer], she kept saying--I kept saying I wanna be a photographer full time and she's like you don't have enough clients to keep you going like that, you gotta worry about your pension and health insurance.  My mother kept coming up with these things, I'm like yeah, yeah, but I wanna--I'm young right now, if I don't jump now I'm never gonna do it.  She's like, you can wait.  So, I quit my job and didn't tell her.  I got a big bonus that last year I was there 'cause I had the second highest profit margin in the whole chain, so I said well I could live off of $10,000 for a year and try to make my thing work and the only person I told I left the job was my grandmother and she kept my secret as long as she could, and one day my mother called the store looking for me and I wasn't there, and they said, "Sharon been gone."  I walked in the house, "hi how ya'll doing, da, da, da."  My dad [George Thomas Farmer] said, "so how long you been gone?"  "Hun" (laughter), and they knew and I said well you didn't want me to.  "Now what are you doing, how long is your money, what are you doing up there, can you pay your rent?  They was just going through the whole thing, I'm like yeah, yeah, and things had started getting a little bit better and then a friend of mine who was freelancing for the Post's weekly section had to have a surgical operation for her mouth and wasn't gon' be able to work for two months.  She says, well I don't want nobody else to just take this job so let me introduce you to the woman who give me my marching order and that was Vivian Aplin-Brownlee who was a, the editor of the Section and lo and behold Vivian ended up being the first black woman that had a reporter's job at the Cleveland Plain Dealer way back in the day, but at the time I didn't know that.  I found that out later down the pipe and she was very inspirational.  So they gave me one job, one job led to another job, next thing I know Lee's coming back. They don't want Lee back.  I'm like, oh no you can't do this.  This is gon' mess up my friend's stuff and Vivian's like we'll still give her work.  This is the nature of the business Sharon, but you do a great job, so just, just look at it how it is.  You earned the position to be here, whatever we give you, you come back with it.  So much so, now the photo office wants to use you so that then Matt Lewis who director of photography at The Washington Post started hiring me to go out and do jobs.  So by then I knew I could make enough money for my rent and my basics and I always made sure I was around so I started out doing one job a week to doing five to six jobs a week for The Post.   So it took care of things, but I never kissed enough butt to get a job, so jobs would be available 'cause would retire or something had opened up but they weren't considering the freelancers, and we knew we could, you know we kickin' butt so what is this all about?  So I ended up going to binding arbitration because of all this madness and we didn't know the union had sold us out. So after that I was like the hell with unions you know I'm very picky now about.
Speaker 1: So you're a member of the photographer's union?  I mean what, what's it called (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No it was called The Newspaper Guild and they were the ones negotiating for making sure the freelancers got a better deal than what we were getting, 'cause by us freelancing there was no health insurance to pay for us, no sick leave, none of that stuff but we're working as much if not more than their regular staff. So they're basically exploiting and abusing us, but if you want a position you either had to be nice about it, get along to go along or something, but I wasn't gon' do all that.  Some things require that you do some things and my father and mother said I didn't have to do and I wasn't gon' do 'em.  So if you can't see on my work merit that I'm badder than some of the people you got in here, that's your problem 'cause my attitude from Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] was, "it's your loss if you don't know what's going on and what's right, so I stuck to my guns and meanwhile we get sold down the river.  None of the photographers get hired and out of the seventeen or eighteen people who were up before this arbitrary committee stuff, one person got hired and that was Richard Harrington who was the music critic, nobody else got a job, so it was just like threw myself more into freelancing.
Story_ID: 128735
Speaker 1: All right so, so about what, what years were these when you worked for The Washington Post freelance?
Speaker 2: I started in '78 [1978], '79 [1979], I think '78 [1978] the year before and by '79 [1979] I had quit the job may--let me see I went in '74 [1974] is that four years, somewhere in '78 [1978] I quit the job and--
Speaker 1: For the Washington [Post] wait, wait you start the Washington [Post]?
Speaker 2: No, I quit the camera store.
Speaker 1: Quit the camera store, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I started freelancing within six months of that for The Washington Post because of Lee's [Vivian Aplin-Brownlee] situation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, figure our fiscal year ends in August and then I got my $10,000.00 and said I can live off of this for the next year.  So I'm going through the next year being a photographer just freelancing around, things aren't going gun-ho but Lee knows I'm doing it so she's the one telling me to come check her job out and she was freelancing too.  So the other thing that happened was a group called Sweet Honey in the Rock the first year I was.
Speaker 1: The group (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the camera store and Milton Williams, another black photographer who worked for The Afro [The Baltimore Afro-America] 'cause I read The Afro--and used to see Milton at the things I shot for the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] he said this program was gon' be on channel five called Black Reflections and that they had a filmmaker who worked at the station but they needed a black woman to talk about black photography as a woman.  So the three of us end up on this program, ended up meeting Michelle Parkerson and Michelle works as a TV engineer for WTTG and in the course of this we get along, and she says to me later "I'm working on this project for this group and we need a photographer.  Would you be interested?"  "Yeah, sure," so it turns out to be Sweet Honey in the Rock.  I go show my portfolio to and Bernice [HM Bernice Johnson Reagon] and them see the pictures and they're like "well why aren't you working for yourself?"  Light bulb goes off in my head.  I'm like "wow somebody thinks I'm good and they just met me," so but I showed them the body of work.  So I got the gig shooting their next album.  She said to "I wanna see things with clarity because our first album you really don't see us, you see us moving" and its this abstract geometry thing that's on the first cover of their first album and she says, "this we wanna see everything.  We wanna an essay," so I worked my pants off every show they did around [Washington] D.C., every rehearsal, when they went to the studio I was there too, we set up shoots in my apartment. At the time I still had no furniture, if you can understand having a mattress on the floor, film in the refrigerator and a good stereo system, that's about I had and the walls were still bare so I could make it like a studio and set lights up and got some really good shots that were used for the album and everybody in the group wrote about something.  It was four of 'em at the time, Pat Johnson [Patricia Johnson], Bernie Reagon, Evelyn Harris and Yasmeen Williams and I had never before worked with women who said "we gon' get this done and get done."  It got done in time, all that stuff, there's also some other women who are into production so I meet sound engineers, the vocal coaches McClain Bousfield [ph] who sang 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin] in the '50s [1950s] and she's a good friend of the poet [HM] Maya Angelou.  I didn't know Maya sang back in those days, she's a contralto herself and Sweet Honey's vocal coach McClain was so inspirational, then it ended up she lived across the street from me so we spent more time together and she was into her music. I began to appreciate vocals more than ever and I had sang when I was in junior high and high school with a group called The Walton Singers in D.C., so I always doing concerts dressed up and I sang in the second alto bunch and I was the youngest member forever, and those old folk made sure I didn't mess up and I got home on time.  My mother let me go with them wherever they sang at and it was like thirty to forty of us and a lot of them were students in music and vocal music at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  That's the other reason why I became a music major 'cause it seemed like a good life, that you were always creating and the people in my church were always very musical so that was fun, but to see the album project get done and completed and then the next project, and then your group was on the road singing and nobody's singing like this, they're singing about "Joanne Little, she's my sister, she's my"--you know and she killed that guy who tried to rape her so here you got a strong bunch of people singing about stuff that's the truth.  The Wilmington Ten were due to get outta jail and everybody was giving them a hard way to go.  These people had suffered, been railroaded to jail.
Story_ID: 128736
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ben Chavis [HM Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.] and (unclear) I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sweet Honey [in the Rock] had great songs that just inspired and part of my problem when I first got back from school at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], I started running around with my old high school buddies again.  Some of 'em hadn't changed.  I couldn't be drinking wine every weekend and act stupid.  My father [George Thomas Farmer] would look at me and go, "what are you doing this weekend, planning already on Wednesday what you're gon' do on Friday."  That's when I was still living in the house and I was like, okay I guess I'd better not do that at least not that he can hear.  So then you run up against The Sweet Honey and the Rockers [Sweet Honey in the Rock], they're very political, they're very serious, and you're like, this is life.  Michelle [Parkerson] is serious, things are on time, the budget's on time, we're going out to Omega Studios once a week to do these big you know recording sessions that last three and four and six hours.  Sometimes we don't finish until two or three in the morning so I begin to appreciate how music occurs and they're not writing it down.  Now mind you I read music and I can play anything.  They're not reading nothing, they're singing and telling each other the parts and it's sticking with them, and then every time they sing, damn if it doesn't sound better and better and better, so I enjoyed that experience and then it was another band called Linda Tillery and her group that came from Oakland [California].  So by then we make an organization to put women's music on the road because women don't get parity.  When you talk about rock and roll and singing and being booked and playing clubs and doing all these things and they need a photographer.  I'm happy to because photography is just another outlet and everybody you take pictures of ends up being a collaboration, you do it their way, you do it your way next thing you know you got a magical part of a photograph you'd never experience or thought could even occur, but this thing happens, you're like "yes."  So you begin to get a reputation for doing a good job and doing it on time and I come bring that back to them because they demanded you be on time, they demanded you do things a certain way that made a better product, so that was good for me and it made me read even more and keep up with people who cared about demonstrations.  Randall Robinson by now is hosting marching around the South African Embassy to free Nelson Mandela.  So we march for two and a half years rain, or shine, snow, sleet didn't matter.  We telling people not to buy the Kugerrand, Sweet Honey in the Rock goes to jail.  People start to come down just to go to jail to free Nelson Mandela, and you have Mother's Day marches, Father's Day marches whatever the significant holiday was we're gonna have a march on that day for Nelson Mandela, and Randall was always out there just extolling us to keep on keeping on.  So it was just a beautiful thang years later to know that perhaps because we marched so much they finally gotta let boy out, they gotta let him out of jail.
Speaker 1: We kept the pressure up.
Speaker 2: So, yes kept the pressure going so to go from that point to years later meeting this guy 'cause I was at his inaugural.  I got to take pictures because of the Clintons [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton] sent me to be the photographer with (simultaneous) (unclear).
Story_ID: 128737
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go back a little bit and get this chronology.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Together then, so, so you're at The Washington Post and when you finally got, got with Sweet Honey in the Rock and started shooting.
Speaker 2: I was with Sweet Honey in the Rock before The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Okay before The Washington Post?
Speaker 2: Un-hun 'cause I was still in the camera store, I was still manager of the camera store when I went to show my portfolio on Fifteenth Street.  Now I hadn't gone to The [Washington] Post.
Speaker 1: So, so what happened with The [Washington] Post did you--how, how long you--were with The Washington Post?
Speaker 2: I freelanced for them for about thirteen years.
Speaker 1: Thirteen, okay.
Speaker 2: And what happened was Matthew decided to retire, two new guys came in from Miami [Florida] and they didn't care about the freelancers and they even tried to cut the money, we were trying--we were already making.  And it was like how you gon' cut our money 'cause you can?  So they were really trying to get rid of me and the other couple of freelancers even though we were good.  So, I ended up freelancing without The Post after '91 [1991], '91 [1991]?.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about, that's thirteen years yeah.
Speaker 2: Before that '90 [1990], '91 [1991] yeah, and.
Speaker 1: From '78 [1978] to '91 [1991].
Speaker 2: And I'm starting to work at The Hilltop helping students with their paper.  I'm still freelancing doing weddings.
Speaker 1: That's at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], that's Howard's Paper.
Speaker 2: At Howard, yes and I'm still freelancing and doing stuff and I'm working at American University [Washington, D.C.] by now because Howard's being very obstinate.  I had to go sign for all these cameras.  They were closing down the art departments of the photography curriculum and getting rid of all the stuff and nobody from the school of communications wanted to sign for the equipment.  So I'm not even on the faculty I'm just an adjunct teacher and I go over to the art department and get the cameras and sign for 'em and bring 'em back in my car and get the guys who run equipment and loan it out in the school of communications to check it all in and give it numbers and people got mad.  I didn't care and they kept talking trash and not being great about things.  Meanwhile I got friends at American University, "Sharon, come teach over here you'll be appreciated."  "Naw' I gotta help out over here."  "Sharon, we got a full dark room."  "Dark room, you got a dark room?"  'Cause our dark room still wasn't up and running after even the stuff I had done to get it going, so I left and went to American University.
Speaker 1: Now, now weren't there photography teachers at Howard before you that--didn't [HM] Roy Lewis teach there at some point or who?
Speaker 2: They didn't get 'em to stay; they couldn't get the program going.  You had to please so many masters you know, you have to go off camera when you start talking about Howard (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they just couldn't, now.
Speaker 2: Some things that should be aren't, you know.
Speaker 1: Jim Donaldson [HM James Donaldson] was there, you would think that.
Speaker 2: Some, let me tell you everybody got their own fiefdom [ph.], and they don't want their fiefdom [ph.] messed with and they don't want their resources for their fiefdom messed with either, and nobody had been strong enough as a photography teacher over there to make it work, to show the students had merit in what they were doing so they closed the--that's what they did they closed the photo section down 'cause they couldn't get the teacher to leave so the way they did it was to say, "this program does not exist anymore" so the only thing you have after that is the school of communications photography, and the guy teaching over there is only doing slides, okay; because he finds it easier to send into the lab to get done rather than have them do chemistry which I thought was a big mistake, so he and I had a fundamental difference of opinion on that one and the woman I was working for and working with was the editor, they hired her, Karen, what was Karen--Holze, Karen Holze, Holze, H-O-L-Z-E, she's now a family court judge.  We look back at those days and go "do you believe we went through this stuff with our people to try to make things happen for the students?" So then they hear a few weeks ago that The Hilltop has stopped publishing because they had run out of money.  What, I mean at one point?
Speaker 1: So that's just happened just recently?
Speaker 2: That just happened in the last two or three weeks that they had, they're so far--their printer was down at The Washington Times.  I can remember when the New York, I mean when The Washington Post donated the paper and the pulp for the Howard paper to get published and done.  So a lot of things have changed since I've been gone and The Washington Times?
Speaker 1: The Washington Times is a, sort of a right-wing paper.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: That, okay.
Speaker 2: So your resources from anywhere?  Hello, (laughter) yeah, it is very that way.
Speaker 1: Um, so, so.
Speaker 2: Yes it is.
Speaker 1: But you, you're an adjunct professor at Howard from, from when, when was that?
Speaker 2: Well like two years.
Speaker 1: But what years?
Speaker 2: That'd be like.
Speaker 1: This in the '80s [1980s] or?
Speaker 2: No this is like '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: Ninety okay.
Speaker 2: '89 [1989], '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then from there to American University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Un-hun.
Speaker 2: I did about a year's worth of classes with them, three semesters, and then by then the people at White House were calling so then I left.
Story_ID: 128738
Speaker 1: Now the election--you worked in the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] White House.
Speaker 2: Um-hun.
Speaker 1: How did they, Clinton was elected in '92 [1992] so what, so how did they become familiar with you?
Speaker 2: The head guy for him, [Robert] Bob McNeeley got the job and I'm in my dark room trying to knock some work out and he had people looking for me.
Speaker 1: He was the head photographer (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was head--Clinton had asked him to be his personal photographer in Little Rock [Arkansas] and he has his wife call me and she's trying to tell me you know what it is that she wants, and so I think it's one of my friends playing a joke on me so I hung up on her.  When the election was going on.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) so you thought she was playing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when the election was going on.
Speaker 1: Did they call, what did they say to you, they call and ask you to?
Speaker 2: She says my husband gonna be Clinton's photographer, he wants to hire you, and I said "yeah right" boom.  I'm like this is bullshit 'cause I had submitted with some other photographers a packet to the Democratic Party so we can at least cover and get some of the business during the inaugural festivities.  So she called back again, I'm like "I ain't time for this," I just hung up again and I said I'm trying to get some work out 'cause it's like eleven o'clock and I promised my client I'd have all this stuff done by three, and I still got thirty prints to make in the dark room.  I got a phone down there, I mean I got a little office down there, the red lights going.  I got the TV on with a red screen on so I can see the news or whatever's going on.  I'm in my own world.
Speaker 1: With a red screen (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes and when she calls back the third time she says "listen you, this is the house where we were at last night."  She says the name and I know the people.  She said, "we were at this party last night, they know your name and your phone number," she said, "that's how I got you."  She says, "my husband's gon' call you in a couple of weeks."  I was like "yeah right," so I don't tell nobody 'cause I don't believe it and I'm number two they don't know me, plus I hate government.  So it, they can't mean me, plus I still have an F.B.I. [Federal Bureau of Investigation] record, they cannot mean me.
Story_ID: 128739
Speaker 1: So, now you were telling me off camera what the F.B.I. [Federal Bureau of Investigation] record was about.  Now what was that about?
Speaker 2: Our activities for demonstrating and marching at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] for bringing up the folks from.
Speaker 1: The Republic of New Africa.
Speaker 2: From New, from Dayton [Ohio] to guard [HM] Angela Davis and Kathleen Cleaver and anybody black of note, because one, we didn't trust the campus police, did not trust Columbus [Ohio] cops who at the time.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Had nobody black on their staff.
Speaker 1: And for clarification the Republic of New Africa had something called the Black Guard.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were often used by black organizations as security.
Speaker 2: Yes, because they were outstanding, they dressed very neat, they were very polite.  They didn't cuss.
Speaker 1: Yeah. The women were as treated as equally as the men, there was no messin' around, there was no bull, it was a great group.
Speaker 2: So General Chui [John Taylor, changed his name to General Mwesi Chui] in Dayton.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: John Taylor [sic, General Mwesi Chui] who was the head.
Speaker 1: He was, yes.
Speaker 2: Of the Black Guard in those days and would bring?
Speaker 1: And we always brought 'em up.
Speaker 2: Bring security?
Speaker 1: Yes, because we wanted it done right and we're bringing people from New York City [New York] and from California, we even said to Harold Cruse one time, "want a bodyguard?"  He says "I'm my own bodyguard."  He was a--Harold Cruse was a bad, bad, black intellectual.
Speaker 2: The author of 'The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual' by Harold Cruse.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes and we still got that crisis going on, you believe it, 30 years later, we still got this crisis issue.  Anyway.
Speaker 2: So anyway so the F.B.I. record, record from those days and so you thought they had.
Speaker 1: Because of Choking Times.
Speaker 2: They, they had to be playing?
Speaker 1: Right, and I remember Giles Haygood who has his own business in Columbia, Maryland was one of our good fearless leaders back in those days.  We were having a meeting and we're at our Choking Times offices, this guy comes in here and brings guns, tell us we're ready for the revolution now and we said "are you crazy, you get this stuff outta here, that ain't how we gon' deal with this, you take all these guns outta here right now."  Well years later I found out he was the snitch because I filed my freedom of information papers and so did another colleague of mine on the paper and the stuff that wasn't blacked out on hers was blacked out on mine and we could figure out who it was.  If I ever see this guy I was gonna hit him upside the head, because he caused us more misery than we needed to have and the idea that he was a snitch for the, for the people, and now we understand(Unclear). Why he was always dressed immaculate, why he was never in class, he always hung out at the Student Union but you didn't see all that then, you know we didn't know but if I ever see this boy again.
Speaker 2: I think that's a theme that could run through a lot of these--those who brings guns, guns to those settings are usually the snitch, the guy that's working for the government (unclear).
Speaker 1: But none of us figured it out then, we were just too young and idealistic about what it was gon' take to make the campus understand that what we were asking for, not even demanding, asking for was fair given how many tax dollars flowed through their place based on how many people pay their tax.
Speaker 2: Yeah isn't it ironic too that, that I guess the government wanted to paint or thank of or the American public thought of people who disagreed with government policy as being so violent they wanted to tear something up when it was the agents that were providing those.
Speaker 1: The stuff [ph] you know I don't appreciate J. Edgar [Hoover] not one bit or his crew or the ideology that would make you be sneaky 'cause you know truth will stand.  This lies and this conniving stuff will not so that was a very good lesson to learn early.
Story_ID: 128740
Speaker 1: Early--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So when did you ever decide that they were really legit in calling you about the White House job?
Speaker 1: Oh, the guy finally called me back, he didn't call me back that week or within the two weeks she said.  He called me sometime in December, late December after Christmas saying in a few weeks this is what we gon' do and I'll be back in touch.  I'm like, who is this?  I still don't tell anybody.
Speaker 2: Now this is the December before the inauguration?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's before the inauguration in January.
Speaker 2: This is '91 [1991] yeah okay, December of '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Um-hum '91 [1991] 'cause by '92 [1992] we're in office yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, or '92 [1992] we get elected.
Speaker 2: Well he's elected--okay.
Speaker 1: No, '92 [1992] he was elected, '93 [1993] we're in office.
Speaker 2: Say like, right in '93 [1993] in office yeah there you go.
Speaker 1: So in '92 [1992] he's elected and '93 [1993] we're going through the gyrations.  He calls me up, again.  He says, meet this guy at this tree at this time.  What?  This is the reunion on the mall [America's Reunion the Mall] stuff when they had the concert outside that Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin performed at and I'm pinching myself saying "you gotta be kidding" that's deep.  [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton had a foreign policy speech before that event so we had to--I had to meet him at Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], that's when I first set eyes on [Robert] McNeeley and everybody else including the Vice President's [Albert Arnold "Al" Gore] photographer working for Gore.  That's the first time I had met Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton and Mrs. [Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson] Gore, so I'm like "they must got the wrong person, they must not know about me" (laughter), and everybody's very cordial but I'm like scared shitless for where I am and I just worked as hard as I could work and one thing rolled into another.  It took me the longest to get clearance because I basically told the F.B.I. [Federal Bureau of Investigation] none of they business about a lot of questions they had and whatever I said the guy was mad, he came back to my office the next day and says to Bob, "well that's what she said," and Bob said "so" (laughter), that's how we all were, so, and the guy said "well shit," and Bob said "so, get outta here."  So it took me about a year and half to get full staff credentials, so everybody else had it way before me so I know there was some tussle about me (laughter).
Story_ID: 128741
Speaker 1: Okay, well kinda well walk us through, what happens, now, now are you on salary at this point?
Speaker 2: Um-hun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah my first real job after the camera store, I was salaried.  You get health benefits, my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] and father [George Thomas Farmer] are ecstatic, plus they're going "well we knew she was about somethin'".  My parents were like really thrilled to death, who knew?
Speaker 1: So did you report to the White House for work?
Speaker 2: Yeah every day.
Speaker 1: Every day?
Speaker 2: Um, you got a parking space either on the Mall if you wanted to be in the garage, but I never wanted to be in the garage, I like being out in the fresh air.  I didn't mind walking, I thought walking was a healthy thing to do, but there's two women and two guys and the head guy's pretty much decide how the schedule runs for the day.  So if you're the seven o'clock person you gon' do the job with the President [William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  If you are eight o'clock person you got Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton's schedule.  If you come in at noon, you don't know when you're going home 'cause you can't go home until he finishes his work for the day and then the boss comes and goes as they please.  He basically cherry picks what he thinks is the best off the schedule.  So we got along real well for the first two years and then he started not coming to work and it was like chafing at the bit 'cause we have to make decisions as a--the three of us about how we're gonna cover stuff, there should be four of us for, and my guy's not paying attention so much plus this is his second time around.  He worked as [Walter] Mondale's Vice Presidential photographer so he has a whole nother idea about how things ought to run because he's been there before, and all of us, the three of us were all freelances, Ralph Alswang, Barbara Kinney and me and we're used to being determined about what it is we want and I've never suffered unfairness quietly, you can't do that to me and think it's okay.  If you're gonna have a staff meeting you can't tell me I can't participate and what I think, why have a meeting, and I say things like that too, they get quiet in that little office, and he quit having staff meetings, you know and then finally he crossed the line he shouldn't of crossed and he was outta here and I threw my hat in the ring and I ended up with his job, but it just goes to show.
Speaker 1: So when was that, about when did that take place?
Speaker 2: That was like oh, we got out in 2001, '98 [1998], '98 [1998], '99 [1999] I got the job.
Speaker 1: So you were head photographer of?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that what they call it?
Speaker 2: They call it Director of White House Photography [position is currently called Director and Chief Official White House Photographer].
Speaker 1: Director of White House Photography.
Speaker 2: Eric Draper is the one for [George W.] Bush now.
Speaker 1: He's black too?
Speaker 2: He's black too.
Speaker 1: Let's see there was another one who, another black.
Speaker 2: Ricardo [Thomas].
Speaker 1: Another black, Ricardo.
Speaker 2: But he wasn't the head, Ricardo worked for [David Hume] Kennerly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was a--he started out as a [Nelson] Rockefeller vice presidential photographer, made Rockefeller mad, so Kennerly moved him over to the Presidential side for [Gerald] Ford who was really easy going.  Ford is a nice guy, just period, nice guy.
Story_ID: 128742
Speaker 1: Now what are the dynamics of being a White House photographer in terms of the--who really--does the President really call the shots, "here get a picture of this" or what, yeah?
Speaker 2: Sometimes yes, sometimes you need to know that's what they want. It used to just floor me that he would say "make sure we get that picture" and it'd be somebody you were like "oh, who they?"  Doesn't matter, to him they were all important.  So we turned out a lot of work, if you gotta handshake with the President somebody's gon' get that picture.  Two, when--on every Presidential outing one did the close up "grip and grin handshakes" and the other one would be back with the "press group" and you'd take it from another angle with longer lenses.
Speaker 1: What did you call the handshake a--?
Speaker 2: "Grip and grin handshakes" so that made you the body person which means you were close snapping every handshake he did with somebody or if he had a meeting going on or something in the little quiet corner you could use your likas which hardly made any nose at all and you could just edge yourself around.  The name of the game was stealth not draw notice to yourself.
Speaker 1: So you didn't want to be obtrusive at all?
Speaker 2: You didn't want to be obtrusive at all, you didn't participate unless you were demanded of and the first two years I was quiet as a mouse, I had nothing to say to nobody about nothing.  I remember Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton saying to somebody one day, "Does Sharon talk, let me ask Sharon if she talks," and she walked right over there and go "so," and I'm looking at her going "yes ma'am" (laughter) but that broke the ice 'cause up until then I had nothing to say to nobody, 'cause I'm still pinching myself everyday going "this is two years later".  I live in [Washington] D.C., I use to give this building the finger every time I rode by especially when [Ronald] Reagan and [George H.W.] Bush were in office because what was going on in Nicaragua and Bush's madness with the beginnings of--how you gon' have a riot in Los Angeles and not care?  I'm never gonna forget [HM] Maxine Waters going "Mr. President, do you see this" what--he's talking about the weather, his trip flying out from D.C. to California.  He ain't said nuthin' about the riot stuff that's occurred there because of Rodney King, he ain't hoping for racial harmony, none of that.  We're all watching Nightline.  I'll never forget, we were just blown away.  So the idea that I was gonna be there working plus I didn't like government.  Why would I like government when you tried to put [HM] Angela Davis in jail, you tried to do all kind of stuff that ain't right.  I can go back to Roswell [ph.] and all those places and get mad, get mad--knew about the Wilmington Ten, I can get mad about all that stuff.  Sweet Honey [in the Rock] sings freedom songs, cause we still ain't free.  D.C. can't vote we the last plantation, what are they doing to us?  And we pay more taxes than forty states.  I don't care what combo you use and we still don't have a say in our budget.  So I'm chafing at the bit about all this stuff, doesn't make me feel good so why am I gon' be up in here.  You want me in here, must be a new day.  Then I started seeing handicapped people rolling around the White House in wheel chairs.  Some people blind, some people deaf, America was in the White House so I had hope that this was a different kinda group of people.  We might have a better day for real.
Story_ID: 128743
Speaker 1: I guess the [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton Administration had a more diverse mix of people than any previous administration, right?
Speaker 2: Hugely so, anytime you can have a group shot and you got more than twenty-five heads in there, I remember [George H.W.] Bush had one.  I don't remember anybody from [Ronald] Reagan.
Speaker 1: I haven't heard that term in a log time (laughter) "heads", twenty-five heads in there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Un-hun.
Speaker 1: That's you know we do a lot of these interviews, we got maybe 2,000 of these now and, and I know a large percentage of people that I've interviewed, have a picture of themselves shaking hands with President Clinton more than any other President.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, we shot a lot of film.
Speaker 1: So you shot a lot of, a lot of "grip and grin" pictures?
Speaker 2: A lot of film, a lot of event, we were, because we were all trained as photo journalists, we really were creative about going after a picture no matter what kind of light it was, no matter the angle.  We tried angles, we tried to outdo each other, we tried to compete as photographers with each other, so much so the boss would claim some of our photos as the ones he shot and that was not case, so I began to demand like our names should go on the back of the photos, what the hell is this?  They can do it and you're not doing it?  That took a year and a half to just get the initials on there, but I raised cane about it because when you talk to other photographers about, the only thing left after the photo is your credit, that, that's the thing that's gon' carry you to who did it to the next step, so I was just adamant, I didn't come in here to be nameless.  I'd say stuff like that, so he had to finally give in, but at some point he shoots himself in both feet and he's done it a couple of times and some of us said "well better to work for the devil you know than the one you don't."  He finally shot himself in both feet couldn't nobody help him and didn't want to because by then some people turn into despots, time for you to go (laughter), you don't like your job as much as we like your job.
Story_ID: 128744
Speaker 1: What did Bob [Robert McNeeley], the White House photographer, the head of photographers who hired you, what did he see in your work that attracted him to you?
Speaker 2: He said he could feel it, he could see the action in it and he could know it was mine before he read the photo credit, that's about a best as compliment any photographer could get that they know the photo is yours before they read the credit.  That's the only thing that sets us all apart, that last shot is as good as you are, and if you're pictures in the paper your peers are looking at you've done.  People who aspire to be photographers are looking at what you've done, but the greatest sense of pride to me always was that my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] and father [George Thomas Farmer] could see my name in the paper from having shot these photos and that their bassoonist who had now become a photographer was gon' make a way in this world anyway.  My mother and father's position was always you should have a job that gives you a pension and health insurance, and you stay there and you work.  My parents did their jobs more than thirty years apiece in their fields and they loved their job.  I love mine too and now I've been in my field more than thirty years.  Photographers don't always have the luxury of retiring now.  We'll work till we drop because every day brings about a new.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Photograph that just feeds that energy.
Speaker 1: [HM] Ernest Withers did in Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: I love Ernest Withers!
Speaker 1: He shot pictures until, until he couldn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: God who knew, he's a bad boy, we use to bring 'em up to [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 1: He's the brother in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: You know who I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: One shot, [Charles] Teenie Harris.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Teenie Harris.
Speaker 2: Teenie Harris.
Speaker 1: One shot.
Speaker 2: Man.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you know more about black men doing photography than you know black women.  Jeanne Moutoussamy [Moutoussamy-Ashe], the widow of Arthur Ashe did a book.
Speaker 1: Yeah Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, right.
Speaker 2: Un-hun did a book years ago called 'Black Women Photographers' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] and at the time the people she knew is who she had in the book, had some great pictures in there.  Some of these folk are still working very, very hard today, but they're still not on the tip of everybody's tongues like the guys are and the artwork and, and things that are in control.  Women are still looking for parity.  I won't call it a glass ceiling, I'm gon' call opaque and that you still don't have women in charge of communications, things are slowly but surely changing, but look at the parity on the dollar.  If a woman's only making sixty-five cent of every dollar a man makes, then we have a long way to go still even in positioning so we still have to talk about equal take home pay, change is not finished.
Speaker 1: I think Deborah Wallis has tried to recap the history of black women.
Speaker 2: She's done a great job.
Speaker 1: Of photographers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: 'Cause no one was really doing it yeah, Deb Wallis.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There was a series of black books that came out earlier than that called 'The Black Photographer's Annual' [Joe Crawford] that two guys did out in New York [New York] and the first time I appeared in one of those I remember my chest just being poked out with pride that I had made the cut, because you submit your stuff blindly, you don't know what's going to happen, if you're gonna appear, and when you do get accepted and published it's, it's a great feather in your cap for that being the art part of you that is beginning to emerge.  Same thing with Deb Willis, I submitted stuff I didn't know if anything was gonna be a pick, but it did for her first book on black photographers, so this is of a very fulfilling field, personally.  Number two you have control over your images getting out and to who, plus you serve your community who can't get what it needs in terms of photo journalism to get things done.  So that's why I say I'm still a community photographer because some folks still need help in getting their message out and they do good work so it's easy to work for nice people.
Story_ID: 128745
Speaker 1: Okay, so well back to the White House here now, so you would show up every day, get assignments and, and you knew you had to cover either the First Lady or the President or what--do you have a, is there a, a favorite assignment that you had that?
Speaker 2: Naw' I liked all of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One 'cause to get paid to take pictures?  And you like to do that, yeah I'm pinching myself, number two all these other fabulous photographers who work for magazines and publications you know their by-line.  You've never seen their face before and now you see the people behind these, these names of this great photo work.  It's just inspirational to do a better job, plus you're working for the President of the United States, not no CEO, head of a corporation, not the director of the glee club, not the school teacher and they're all still important, but all those things got me ready to shoot this guy and his wife and his staff, trying to make these changes that were for the better for us so, [President William Jefferson] Clinton's personality was a big help, hers too, because he'd light up a room no matter when he'd walk in, gregarious.
Speaker 1: That's what people say that he had a, that he has still has like a certain amount of charisma and (unclear).
Speaker 2: He has charisma.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean I watched people fall out left and right and the next thing you know you can watch the magnetism of the room shift.  I did the Little Rock [Arkansas] reunion last fall and he hadn't come into the place, the atrium yet where they're gonna hold the reception at.  Everybody's scattered out evenly across everything.  He came in, schoop, you know because he can tell, he can hold an audience, he likes talking, he likes to see what you're interested in.  I remember we're ready to go, get on the plane and he's talking to some guy who disagrees with him and he's trying to understand why the guy disagrees with him, so I watched him go over all their points again and had given a few points, taken a few points--those discussions happen.  Secret Service is like this, everybody else is like this, when we gon' get on the plane and go, and he is fully engaged with talking to this guy we just met and would stay there.  I can't tell you how many times they put barriers up so he wouldn't go over there so we could away sooner--he stepped across 'em.  So if he goes across photographer goes too because you're taking, you're recording history, documenting history.  You're trying to be an artistic photographer and the point of it, plus you have a privileged spot, you're closer to him than anybody else is gonna be whose come along with you this trip and you're mission is to show what's going on so, that's different than what the news is doing.  We're talking about a guy's job, every day and how he does it.  Newspapers are reporting what they see and what they think they heard.  What was funny to me sometimes was to read the paper and they say "unnamed source says so and so" and I'm like, I know who said it (laughter) and, and then you'd watch how it's all cast and you go, that ain't what happened, it didn't happen like that all, so who's spinning this tale?  So photographers knew first and we had our lips zipped tighter than anybody because we knew what a privileged position it was and that even the video guys and gals who covered the President didn't get to hang around him as much as we did because that's how things worked.  Cameras don't have microphones and photographers are not gon' repeat what they've seen or heard, it's all visual for us 'cause that's what we're about documenting history.
Story_ID: 128746
Speaker 1: Okay now you, you referred earlier to the visit of Nelson Mandela.  Now that had a big impact on you so tell us a little bit about that, now this is 1992, '93 [1993]?
Speaker 2: We went to South Africa, Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton and [Albert Arnold] Al Gore [Jr.] headed up the U.S. delegation to go to the inauguration for Nelson Mandela and I'm in the office sitting down--we have these proof sheets that come in everyday before we shot.
Speaker 1: For an inauguration this has got to be '95 [1995] then right [Nelson Mandela was inaugurated on May 10, 1994]?
Speaker 2: Whenever he got.
Speaker 1: I think it was '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994]?
Speaker 1: 'Cause I--that's after they had the official election, now.
Speaker 2: Whenever he got.
Speaker 1: Now did he come to the White House after he was released from prison?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know he came.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't come to the White House till after he was officially the President, this is.
Speaker 1: Now I think he was officially President in '95 [1995] 'cause they had the election.
Speaker 2: Well in '94 [1994], then the election was in '94 [1994] then.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And as a matter-of-fact when I look on that sheet we'll see what year he signed there, but I would go over them with them so I got to--first time in Africa I'm just like "excuse me" and all of these white folk and black folk together in South Africa, you would've never, it looked better integrated than any part of America that I'd ever seen, and the flag was so beautiful and it was hot out there and people were just bursting with pride and I'm just like white people talk about being bursting with pride and you go from the inauguration to the luncheon off on another part and you can see that the old guard from Pretoria is mad 'cause even the wife of the guy at the time, I got this shot she's looking like "I do not wanna be here, but I am here", and in the background you see Nelson making his speech but he's like, she's like "I don't wanna be here."
Speaker 1: Is [Pieter Willem "P.W."] Botha's wife?
Speaker 2: Yeah Botha's wife, oh boy!  So, that was a great experience so I got a nice shot of him being sworn in by this guy with this wig on, I'm like two inaugurations, oh boy!
Story_ID: 128747
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a--was there, is there a difficult time, is there like a really a bad story in these many stories that you took?
Speaker 2: Yeah, some people refused to believe you're the President's photographer and try to pull you out from doing what you're trying to do.  The security of another country, New Zealand, I remember being especially crazy, nobody there.
Speaker 1: So they just didn't believe that you were the photographer?
Speaker 2: Right, France tried to be crazy and [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton walked up to the guy going "that's my photographer, don't touch her thank you" and then walked back to what he was doing (laughter).  He had to come save my butt a couple of times.  One time we were, the second time he was campaigning and I'm in Missouri, Missouri?  Montana?  Butte, Montana and I'm up on the balcony getting ready to shoot pictures going down and the guy, police officer or sheriff is telling me I can't be up there, and I'm like "yeah I can."  See I got this little pin that says I can go anywhere I want.  He said "I don't recognize that pin."  I said if you look down there you'll see certain people with the same pin on, which means we can go anywhere we want.  He's talking trash; I'm not moving fast enough for him.  He puts his hand on his gun butt, and I'm like "hey white people" all the secret service looks up, said "ya'll better do something about him."  Three of 'em got there so fast and they said "she works for the President, she can go anywhere she wants to," and meanwhile I'm just trying to do my work and be cool and you can't cuss people out, but I did yell down there "hey white people" (laughter), 'cause we could have these other frank discussions among some of us about what it is, about what it is.  Oh they'll say "yeah we see you getting a hard way to go", or I wouldn't stop moving somewhere and I'm getting surrounded at Baker, Baker's Field, California because I'm like gotta go get this stuff as he gets off the plane and my plane lands first 'cause I'm with the Press group and you have to be out there before the other photographer gets off the plane, 'cause by the time he works his way to the back and come off the plane it's too late, the President's already on the way down the steps and the cops are telling me where I can't go and the staff is going "she can go anywhere she wants", next thing I know I got two cop cars speeding together just trying to block me off.  I'm about tired of all that stuff; that was about the worse stuff that can happen to anybody, if you wanna remember who you are, police will let you know faster than anybody I know.  Now the saving grace is that there are some intelligent police.  Yes some of 'em happened to be Secret Service, so what?  I work with 'em, I know them too, they know me.  So you gotta work with people you know, and I always tried to make friends wherever I go because you never know who you're gonna see again, and that's fun too about being a photographer, you never know who you gon' see again.
Story_ID: 128748
Speaker 1: Now there is a, that reminded me when you said that for some reason it reminded me of the picture of President [William Jefferson] Clinton with Monica Lewinsky that one photographer shot that surfaced again after he, they had, the scandal showed up, where's he just got his arm around her in a crowd you know greeting her like he greeted so many other people.
Speaker 2: Clinton greeted everybody.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but then it pops up.
Speaker 2: That was part of his charm and plus remember everybody's not about the same thing, some people are about just making money, some people are about recording history the way they wanna see it.  I know I record history the way I wanna see it.  I know I wanna make sure people get included, 'cause a lot of people don't get included in history, so I make a point that people are included in history.  I use to invite people to the White House all the time.  I'd say come tour your White House, you wanna see your White House they got tourists tonight--get you in here.  They'd go to Oval, go to the radio address.  Clinton had so many radio addresses, he would, you could invite your family and friends in and especially in the last few years you know, we know we're winding down, we know we got a year left in office after seven years.  All, everyone for a long time was just thick with people unless it was just some media crisis going on we knew we couldn't stay, 'cause you're meet and greet and take pictures with everybody after the radio address, and the topic is always whatever's going on in Congress that week.  Either they passed your bill and see the point of it or they not gon' pass your bill and this is why.  So you talk about all those things.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you have any favorite people in the Clinton White House or in administration or?
Speaker 2: I tell you, the favorite ones were the ones who worked hard and no BS-ing, and, and people could BS you one or another depending on what they wanted so those people who told me the truth and did what they said they were gonna do when they did it, those are my favorite people.  My office manager, Marilyn Gicannon [ph] had been there way before me and wasn't use to somebody quite like me, but we became friends as time went on.  One 'cause I wasn't biting my tongue, two I wear colorful clothing sometimes, I like to wear Afrocentric, there's enough people dressed up in dark suits and, and I'm not wearing heels, hell no.  Photographer, that's a death knell for a woman photographer 'cause if you trip on something you can't get that leg back, you can't get knee back.  That ankle twisted once too bad like that and by now I've heard enough horror stories from the other ladies.  One year I did the Black Political convention, Congressional Caucus at the Hilton, and we were riding up the escalator after everything is over except for a couple of receptions and somebody had a little bit too much or got too loose on the--he fell backwards.  Next thing I know there's ten of us falling backwards on the escalator at the Hilton.  When I got down to the bottom of the steps, one heel was gone, my good pumps honey, and I had protected my cameras, but I remember my head was hurting me.  I remember covering my cameras 'cause I didn't want nothing busted up and the parties I did after that I'm one-leg Pete walking around taking my pictures.  I probably should have kicked off the shoes and just dealt with the bare stuff, but you know pride (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, the black staff in the White House in those days was, consisted of, well his, his appointees, [HM] Alexis Herman and.
Speaker 2: [HM] Bob Nash was the Personnel Director, Thurgood Marshall, Jr. worked in Intergovernmental Affairs.
Speaker 1: [HM the Honorable] Hazel O'Leary.
Speaker 2: Hazel O'Leary was wonderful, you had Flo McAfee who was part of Intergovernmental Affairs.  You begin to figure out who can work to--'cause those same people went to dinner together too on the road trips so.
Speaker 1: Did you work a lot with [HM] Betty Currie the Secretary?
Speaker 2: Yeah I saw her every day.  Betty is a wonderful person, you see her every day.  That was who you saw before you went into his office or you'd see her last going out or the, or the Director of the Oval Office (unclear), but Betty was--she was bad, just a--she could get things done and then the cat loved her (unclear) Socks.  So Socks spent a lot of time at her desk.
Speaker 1: She's still got the Cat, she's got the cat (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: She's still got the Cat, Socks still (unclear) he's thriving, yeah.
Speaker 1: In Hollywood and she's yeah (unclear).  She's out in Maryland.
Speaker 2: So you've been down there too?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right on.
Story_ID: 128749
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now were you shooting digital when, when you shot for [President William Jefferson] Clinton?
Speaker 2: We started shooting digital the last few years we were in office and those cameras were very heavy, very big and they were so complicated and cumbersome that all we did was shoot with them.  We make the photo editors come take the stuff and download it off the, the disk because we didn't have time.  Mrs. [Hilary Rodham] Clinton stayed as busy as he did and [Albert Arnold] Al Gore [Jr.] was even more busy, so we had to cover a lot of bases.  Now Al had two photographers, but somebody would get sick.  We had to loan 'em one of ours so it was just very intense pressure, plus we had a lab that had twenty-four people in it and all they did was turn out the photos that we ordered in whatever size, whatever kind of border.  Generally a signature border 'cause he signed a lot.  Some machines, some things he didn't sign so the machine would do it, but if he personally knew you it wasn't no machine he'd do it.
Speaker 1: So a photographer you're talking about we got four staff photographers for Clinton, then you got photographers for Gore and for.
Speaker 2: Two for Gore.
Speaker 1: Two for.
Speaker 2: Two for the vice president and four for the president, so that's six altogether.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then you got a lab of about twenty-four people.
Speaker 2: Twenty-four people, I don't think most people realize you know the extent of you know, of what's, of what that.
Speaker 1: It's your government at work and it's documented thoroughly, I mean all the meetings.  Everybody he ever met with, we pretty much saw everything.  Some things we did not, we knew it was like it say "closed" which means like don't come to that meeting so we wouldn't show up, but if it didn't say "closed" we were there and plus because we were there and the press wasn't we had to take outstanding pictures in case they decided they wanted to release it to the news, and the last thing on earth you wanna do is release a paper to the news that doesn't look right or doesn't have impact, or looks like somebody from the fifth grade took it.  That was not gon' fly because those people who waited in the Press Area 'cause you were taking the picture that they wanted to take, were gon' let you know what they thought so that also keep things very competitive being able to talk about the photos, plus we put photos up on the wall so you could see whatever the last event was we were doing, where we'd been.  So even if you took a tour and nobody was there, you get the gist of what we were about, it was a great time.
Speaker 2: Now, the last couple of years when you were the Director of Photography did you enjoy those more than the other, the years or?
Speaker 1: Um, yeah 'cause I could run a better show.  After you've seen a show run and you know that ain't the way it out to go I'm like the inmate from the insane asylum, "you put me in charge at last" for a good reason 'cause I know where all the knucklehead stuff is that shouldn't be happening, or if people have been treated mis-fairly, I knew first.  Photographers see everything first because things happen and you can't do anything but what you know then, but when you can you can fix stuff and you do it kinda quietly, you don't shove it in anybody's face, you just say I'm gon' make a small change, hope you agree with me.  If you don't agree me give me your feedback later, put it in a note and make me a couple of copies so we can pass it around and talk about it.  I try to be more inclusionary and we had a staff meeting everybody talked and if you didn't talk, I'm asking you what you think.  I started making lab come up and meet with us once a month because we need the dialogue and then toward the end because we were converting everything from film to digital, we started, we had to figure out how to save everything digitally because this was the wave of the future to come so I had to devote a great portion of my time trying to find someone who could help us transfer our files from film to disc and have the disc not go away.  The first bad batch of discs we got, just like I couldn't believe it.  It just killed like six months worth of work because the discs weren't right.  So I'll never forget that, so it became a race between getting everything he had up on digital and in discs along with the film and get it shipped to the archives before time was up, so that became paramount.  I began to go on less trips toward the end.  Could not make the time which means some people had to go out to and three days a week, but we had to get the stuff done.  I could--wasn't in a position to hire anybody else, but I could take the military people who worked in my lab to help me cover some things when people were off doing other things.  So that's the first time the military had been so included, so you have great guys and gals doing wonderful work.  You can't be in the lab all the time, part of the thing about being a photographer is being able to shoot too.  I knew they were frustrated; it's like "hey you wanna work? Come on."

Speaker 1: Now tell me this I've always wondered when, when the President has a meeting and a lot of people around and, and--who actually poses the President?  Does, does he know to do that or?
Speaker 2: Ain't no posing.
Speaker 1: Say, say there's a--well I've seen these shots of you've got four or five people standing with President in the middle, did--do you say, "Okay."
Speaker 2: Oh, standing in the middle.
Speaker 1: "President get in the middle," or?
Speaker 2: Naw' he kinda knows.
Speaker 1: Do--how, how.
Speaker 2: And the people kinda.
Speaker 1: So he just.
Speaker 2: He just kinda, he'll tell 'em where to stand, he's very engaged.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'll say "come over here, you stand there, you do that--can't see you back here," and he'll go, "you ready?"  He'll look at me like "are you ready?"  It's like, "I can't see somebody," and I'll tell him and he'll wait, he's very patient.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's better to have a great string of great photos especially if he's gon' sign these things.  You do not want somebody not to be seen.  You don't want them to come or go "you got a better shot than this?"  Oh, no you wanna do the best you can.  I remember when he [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] played golf with Michael Jordan out in Las Vegas and I'm running with the press guys, so I'm with a 300 millimeter, I've turned it into a 600 millimeter with a 2X Converter on it, 'cause I really want some good strong shots.  My boss is doing the body stuff.  When we get back to D.C. and the pictures go upstairs to the President, he ain't got no pictures of him golfing.  All is he has is him and Michael joking, talking, being up close.  No pictures of golf ball, gold stick anywhere.  I had that, so President "you'll got that done (ph)?  Yes, sir but it won't be ready to Monday.  "Okay I just want some--so when I come up with some other stuff I say to the--to my boss, I'm like "Bob [Robert McNeely] I have some stuff now".  "Oh, no, no he doesn't need that".  "Bob, the guy called".  "Oh I guess you'd better give it to him them".  Okay, so I took my job very seriously and I never helped him find his ball when he golfed.  I just stayed the heck away from everybody and just take pictures, 'cause that's what my job is, not find your ball (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now do you have a philosophy of photography, you know how, you know I mean in terms of the stuff you shoot, I mean what do you aim for when you shoot--shoot?
Speaker 2: Excellence, you're only as good as your last picture.  If you don't have any film in the camera you're blown up, you're back to square one and you.
Speaker 1: So you got to be organized first
Speaker 2: You got to be organized and you gotta be pliable, you gotta be like a fish who doesn't mind following one stream or another 'cause things change.  It's like watching the mood in the room.  You know what you discuss, you know how serious it is and then somebody comes in there with something even more serious and then all of a sudden the moods gets funky.  You can feel the, the stuff in the room.  Well how do you show that?  That's when you really get quiet and you wait on your pictures and if you're at a bad angle, that's why you have a choice of lenses, so you can pull stuff out to work whatever angle you got to so you don't disturb the people gettin' very, very serious about the crisis that's happening.  I'll never forget Madeleine Albright and the Generals at the Pentagon didn't wanna intervene in Bosnia and yet she understood what was going on over there, so she had some stuff that was very compelling and the guys would try to pooh, pooh it.  Madeleine Albright's like, "no, no, no we will deal with this won't we Mr. President.  He's like Madeleine I didn't know, okay.  I mean it's just like you get to see history unfold based on what they know and you didn't know.  So you watched the pressures how they do, like when [Newton Leroy]Newt Gingrich comes in and tells the President what he wants, and the President says, "naw we gon' do horse trading better than that," and they get down to brass tacks about the budget.  I thought that process of the budget alone was worth a lesson.  How people negotiate in politics, if you knew how politics really worked you would vote each and every time.  You have to have a nickel and a quarter and when you do not vote, you're basically allowing those who do get elected to do anything they want and you got to hope they do the right thing.  It shouldn't be like, you have to make sure they do the right thing.  Politics have always been about making sure and somehow we've gotten away from the process of making sure because we're not engaged, we're not part of our community political groups, we're not part of what makes things better.  It's not enough to go to work and go to church and think it's all gon' be okay.  It is not.
Story_ID: 128751
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American Community today?
Speaker 2: I'm concerned that people don't read like they use to.  I'm concerned that the history of what we've been through is getting away from them because it's now being repackaged to seem like we were angry during the Civil Rights [Movement] when all we were doing was asking for civil rights and parity and we had earned it.  I mean anytime you help build a country up, you too should be allowed to drink from the same water fountain of hopes and dreams, so the consumerism of all our things and stuff bothers me because we should be saving our money for the hard days and bad times yet to still come.  They're starting to come now, they think gas is ridiculous now, I'm not gon' be surprised if its five dollars by next summer, let alone this year and because no one's putting pressure to bear on our government prices continue to rise when they sit on huge oil reserves and why on earth would they spend $120.00 a barrel, we need to get off oil.  We haven't done it yet.  The people who control our lives are lobbyists.  People do not know that, maybe you should aspire to be a lobbyist as opposed to a lawyer or a senator.  Maybe you should be a lobbyist 'cause lobbyists influence so much in so many ways, but it's all about money and consumerism and not about philosophies.  What Paul Robeson did by "bucking the establishment" to do his art his way demanding that the audiences be integrated was a good thang and if he hadn't of done that, how many more years would it have been till we had integrated audiences.  I'm proud to know that Marian Anderson decided "I'm singing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial since D.A.R. [Daughters of the American Revolution] is closed to me."  Back in those days all those black folk got together on a regular basis trying to make their own communities work because they were shut outta so many.  I can remember when you couldn't try on hats at Garfinckel's [department store] and my mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] wouldn't go in there because of the way they treated black customers.  It's, it's--there's a lot that we all take for granted that we shouldn't and maybe when a apple starts to cost two dollars an apple, people will get what's going on here has--now the commodities issues have moved on from stocks to now your food, your clothing, your shelter, everything costs--ridiculous that are basics.  They treat you (unclear).  So I'm hoping that the community organizations begin to get together sooner or longer. I hope with the digital age coming next year, the idea you can move everybody off of analog and you better go to digital or you lose TV, lose the television.  How many infomercials are you gon' pay for?  It's time to get back to reading again, going to your community meetings, asking how Ms. Sarah [ph.] is down the street and did somebody help her get her groceries?  We have seniors that ain't been outta their house in two weeks because they can't get out, because they don't have family looking out for them.  Our whole social fabric about what we do with people and health care issues--we got a lot of stuff to do.
Story_ID: 128752
Speaker 1: Do you have a, I didn't ask you this for some reason, but do you have a favorite photographer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do Roland Freeman and Ricardo Thomas, because they set me on understanding where I had to aim at, see you can have a lot of photographers and everybody's aiming in a different direction, aiming different quality, different levels of excellent.  These two guys were so about business and the excellence along with Maurice Sorrell that use to shoot for Jet and Ebony magazine 'cause that's the quality they were going after and they weren't letting anything get in their way, I mean so much so Ricardo before he'd go do a job he'd go see the room first and take light readings to see what he could expect.  He taught me how to do the same thing too.  You go to, you go to where you're gonna do this job at so there are no surprises so you can see what to expect.  Aw it was like you knew which way to point that engine in, 'cause of them, so those two and then Roy DeCarava because 'The Sweet Flypaper of Life' [Roy DeCarava, Langston Hughes] had hit me early with the collaboration he did with Langston Hughes and the idea you could turn an idea about how we live into a meaningful, creative book that still stands the passage of time, it, it's just great, it's just absolutely fabulous so, yeah those are my role models and there's a woman named [HM]Bernice Johnson Reagon, the founder of Sweet Honey [in the Rock] asking me why I wasn't working for myself, and then watching her struggle with the Smithsonian as she became the curator of putting our black life into the museum and the voices of the Civil Rights Movement and then the voices of the gospel people who made the music, the real roots of some history that's been left out of our, our books and exhibitions and watching her fight those battles, and of course my parents [Winifred Lancaster Farmer and George Thomas Farmer].  Yeah you had to be excellent.
Speaker 1: So we've gone from favorite photographers to your heroes, but that's all right, but that, that's what--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know photographers that's, that's about it, and then anybody who's got a good disposition and doesn't get plucked.  So many times it just takes one photographer to get mad and a group of photographers trying to get stuff done and the next thing you know they're stirring trouble, they're making bad vibes between you and your subjects and, and you and the event and things that are going on because they never learned manners or they don't have something.  So every photographer who never got mad, I love 'em because it was about the work, get the work first.  You want to get mad, take that outside someplace 'cause you're holding the rest of us up, and being mad never took care of no business, unless it made you do the business better, so.
Story_ID: 128753
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major, any major thing that you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: No. I just think that I don't wanna call it fate, but I'll say that the company I kept was good and I never stopped keeping good company and I knew that bad company was bad for me and I didn't mind listening to people who knew more than me and I didn't mind asking people who were older what they thought about stuff 'cause something about that wisdom.  I think the more questions you ask the more answers you get whether you're looking for 'em or not, even in how they're answered so, no I wouldn't do anything different, not a thing.  'Cause part of that made me feisty, the other part of that gave me the perseverance even in being told "no" about what I could and what I couldn't do, that just makes you stronger, yeah.  It's been a good life.
Story_ID: 128754
Speaker 1: Okay, once again when you look back over everything that you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Encouraging, encouragement to everybody, people who say I can't do it, don't wanna do it, don't see the point in doing it, I can give you all kinds of reasons because the work has to get done.  We are not finished on this planet and it's so many things not correct with the planet and that we brought a culture to this planet that has never seen it.  I'll never forget being in China on a bus and hearing James Brown, we're just riding to a reception and the Chinese guy thought we were like James Brown.  I did love it and everybody else on the bus was going "thank you" and he's says, "he's my favorite singer," wow, okay and this guy could even speak a little bit of English so--how people dress as I see blue jeans all around the world and I see the black vernacular about how some things are said and done.  When I was in Indonesia it was hot, we waiting outside for the next round to get started.  So I'm sitting outside and an Indonesian guy walks over to me he goes "hi."  I said "hi, how you doing, what's up."  "Yeah, yeah what's up, what's up?"  I looked at him, I said, "well, you all for one."  "Yeah you all," next thing I know I got twenty-five of them sitting around me going "talk, talk, talk."  They wanna listen to me talk, but I wanna listen to them talk.  So we had exchanged ideas, I remember that very well and anywhere in Africa, anywhere.
Story_ID: 128755
Speaker 1: So did you accompany the Clintons [William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton] to Africa?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, first time with Mrs. Clinton 'cause of the [Nelson] Mandela Inaugural.
Speaker 1: Yeah, South Africa.
Speaker 2: Second time she did a tour, she decided she wanted go visit plus women were having issues and she was beginning to take up women's issues in her litany of things that she was interested in.  So we always would meet up with a group of women and we'd ask 'em "how are things in your country?  What are you all doing" and we hear the good stuff and the bad stuff that the guys would never deal with and it has to do with family and education and health care.  So pressing but yet so put on the back burner and she'd go back to her, her guy and say this is what I know, this is what needs to happen and that would encourage him to get his act together what hap-hap.  I mean the Family Leave Act is 'cause of her, it ain't 'cause of him.  She's the one that say "women need this" and he'd say "Yes Hillary you are right," so, so it happened.
Speaker 1: So she was a tremendous influence.
Speaker 2: Yes she was and we would have had health care if they hadn't spent all those billions of dollars.  When they say to you they only spent what $12 million dollars to kill that they lie!  They spent a lot of money to stop health care for going through for everybody.  It just reminds me so badly so of they were gonna do health care universal back in the [Harry S.]Truman days, and the doctors got mad saying that means you have to integrate the hospitals. They didn't want integration in the hospitals, so it didn't go through.
Story_ID: 128756
Speaker 1: So they used race as a reason for.
Speaker 2: Race has been used for reasons for lots of things unbeknownst to a lot of us, but the more you read Dr. Ben [HM Yosef Ben-Jochannan], the more you read stuff that folks read who lived that life, you cannot repeat your stuff if you know where the pitfalls lie.  That's why reading is so important and every time I realize less and less us is reading this is not good.  I know where it's not coming from, it ain't gon' come off TV what we need to know about so.  YouTube's important 'cause it gives you this other fabric, I like YouTube because I can look up Sister Rosetta Tharpe and watch her play the guitar and sing and go, just be fascinated that she's not better and more well known.  To go back and see ole' Ella Fitzgerald and now 'cause I'm into the base clarinet I get to see Eric Dolphy playing in Sweden with Charles Mingus and be inspired to go, pull out my base clarinet and see what I can do.
Speaker 1: Do you still play professional, I mean did you?
Speaker 2: I play for fun.
Speaker 1: For fun, okay.
Speaker 2: I had a pick-up band for about four years in between the--still working at The [Washington] Post, matter-of-fact everybody was in media, people either were photographers at The Post or Bob Heaney was KYS Radio announcer, somebody else was a court clerk for the system.  My roommate's an artist.  We had a band called "The Tuesday Night Blues Band" and every Tuesday we'd get together at my house and we would eat and drink and be merry starting at six o'clock and we'd go, carry on till about ten.  Tuesday was the only night nobody had to worry about where to be but for a few years that band lasted.  We did a song called "The Girls are Playing Football".  We'd do songs like "Leave My Mayor Alone" when they was messing with [HM] Marion Barry, you know we, we were a mess.
Speaker 1: It sounds like it (laughter).
Speaker 2: It was fun.
Story_ID: 128757
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, now, oh tell us about your family, now, now your parents [Winifred Lancaster Farmer and George Thomas Farmer]  still living?
Speaker 2: I wish, I lost my mom in 2005 and I lost my dad in 2001 in December and, yeah I miss 'em every day, every day. So they were finally satisfied that you had a decent job I guess when they (unclear)? They were very proud of me, I had no idea how proud they were.  My mother started to put together scrapbooks of stuff, said nice things.  She'd write 'em out in some of the cards, we just had no idea.  "We knew you were special, but we just had no idea how special".  'Cause they use to talk to people when I was even little, my brother [Jonathan Lancaster Farmer] would not shake hands and look people in the eye when we were little and I always did.  I'd go "nice to meet you" and I'd say "what's your name again" 'cause I misunderstood.  I was a little precocious 'cause my dad was like "make sure you can be heard" and he'd kind of give me a little nudge to make sure I wouldn't be shy about what I said, and mom too so we were--I could talk, my brother was not as much interested in talking.  He changed as time went on 'cause Sharon's being accolated for having spoke to people she never met before and you were back in the corner not wanting to deal, so he changed.
Speaker 1: So do you have any children or ever been married?
Speaker 2: No, came close but you know, you're looking for the man like your father, likes to do stuff, very understanding, no muss, no fuss.  He and my mother never had a mumbling word with each other and if they did it was behind closed doors.  We never heard 'em.  My parents didn't even say "damn" so when I had a button that I used for my campaign at Ohio State that said "Give a Shit" I guess my mother decided I ought to go somewhere, so she took it off and threw it in the trash can, so but it meant something to me, but didn't mean that to her and then I had another button that says "Mean people suck" that I wore for all of two days and she says, "no, no this is not how we do things Sharon".  "What's the matter"?  "Please take that button off".  Oh, my mother said "please" that means take it off (laughter).  So I took it off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I miss 'em, they had a wonderful--they traveled together, they were so scared I'd never leave the country.  They took me with them in '81 [1981] on a trip some place.  We went to Portugal, Spain and Morocco for twelve days because they were so afraid I wouldn't go anywhere.  I didn't want to go anywhere, so but I travel more than them now at this point it's just like unbelievable.  I've been about everywhere but Greenland and the Arctic.
Story_ID: 128758
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything that I have not asked that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?  Well I thought of one more thing.  What, what advice would you give young photographers now who--I mean young, aspiring photographers I guess, people that wanna get involved in photography?
Speaker 2: You gotta do it at least three times a week 'cause you want to and not because it's a job.  You have to say "I'm gonna go out and go shoot this and see if I can improve myself" at least three times a week.  You assign yourself something and explore it to the max and then go look for critiques and criticism 'cause then you're gonna grow as a photographer more rapidly and once you begin to get a thick skin about how people look at you or your work, the sooner you cannot be flustered by those small things that throw us all off track.  Hang around positive people, read as much as you can, but to me the key in photography is the more you shoot, the better you get.  Now if you don't have the equipment and don't have a way to learn, there's always computers at the Public Library, they still have books the old fashioned way that describe how "shutter speed" and "aperture" fit together, all those books are still there and if you can get a mentor, if you become part of a photo organization that takes the time to do field trips and to discuss and do art, photography is art, do exhibitions, put it up on the wall for critiques and criticisms, it improves your lot like crazy.  I watched my little, almost thirty year old group now go from being positive image to now the exposure group and.
Speaker 1: And that's the group that includes.
Speaker 2: [HM]Jason Miccolo Johnson, and, and Milton Williams, but we have sixty members now and ten of 'em are from out of state because we begun to have influence about you know we have to make sure that this business and the way we see things continue, that the [HM]Ernest Withers are not forgotten, that Maurice Sorrell is not forgotten as they pass on.  To know that the Ebony, Jet photographers are unheralded and people need to know more about them, so we're about history too.  We feted [HM]Gordon Parks a few years ago when he turned ninety.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And then we took this big huge shoot out there in Harlem [New York, New York], so to honor the people who made the way and to keep the way going for the next group coming behind us because I'm scared already, look at what computers are doing with images.  What is the future hold?  Remember the Jetsons we thought it was outrageous then, ain't so outrageous now, anything's possible.
Speaker 1: Oh and since this is for history, what equipment are you using now, or what are you shooting with?
Speaker 2: Cannon Eos Digital Cameras, I have four or five different lenses from a 35, a 14 to 35 zoom, a 35 to 70 zoom, a 70 to 200 and a 300 millimeter I can turn into a one four or two X, so and a choice of flashes. I got big heavy studio equipment, Speedotron.  I, I can do any job be it table lighting, people lighting, event lighting.  I'm your "jack of all trade" photographer.
Story_ID: 128759
Speaker 1: All right. Now the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I never quit and I always learned something.
Story_ID: 128760
Speaker 1: This is a picture I took of my father [George Thomas Farmer] and mother [Winifred Lancaster Farmer] meeting Patricia Roberts Harris at a reception that the Deltas hosted for her. At the time the lady in the middle right here, that's [HM] Thelma Daley and Thelma was President, National President of the Deltas and that's Frances Flippen over her shoulder who was Executive Director [sic, Midwest Regional Director, Delta Sigma Theta].  That's my mom and dad proudly meeting Pat [Patricia] Roberts Harris.
Speaker 2: They're together (unclear) your father.
Speaker 1: Un-hun and my mother right next to him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: It'd be the '80s [1980], it would be the '80s [1980] early '80s [1980].
Speaker 1: That's me at my first Easter or second Easter right below my mother who's standing next to my dad and then that's my grandma Ruth, who's my father's mother coming to visit us while she was living in West Virginia.  So that's at my mother's grandmother's house down there in Maryland, in Chapel Hill, and this is a picture that my Uncle shot, Uncle Junior who was the original photographer for the family.
Speaker 2: Album cover that I ever shot, it was kinda changed my life about what I thought I really want to do.  This is "Sweet Honey in the Rock's" second album that they hired me to shoot, so I did all the pictures for everything they had going on so I'm very proud of what this album ended up being, and this was in 1978.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think I bought my album at the concert.  It was at the Shrine, at the.
Speaker 2: 'The Daughter by Freedom.' They were doing a play about freedom in South Africa as part of the Inauguration Program for [Nelson] Mandela being sworn into office.  So Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton came on stage at the as they sang a song.
Speaker 1: And then, so that's how I know what year that was but he came to visit the White House after he had been inaugurated.
Speaker 2: Oh so this was like my second inauguration, first being [President William Jefferson] Clinton and then Mandela being my second.
Speaker 1: This is in '94 [1994] (unclear) on it.
Speaker 2: This, this depicts "One America" the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama] that President Clinton and his wife did with some other people during a reenactment the last year before we got out of office.  So I always try to find that one shot that says what the day is about so some of do believe there can be "One America", we're just still waiting on it.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's Dexter [Scott] King, President Clinton and Coretta Scott King at one of the celebrations of the Life of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  While we were still in office we flew down to Atlanta to pay tribute during the month of King's birth.
Speaker 2: Was that at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, GA]?
Speaker 1: This is when Kissimmee, Florida was hit by the hurricane and I had never seen things smashed up so small up before in my life.  So the President saw that helicopter flying over and I'm on another helicopter with the Press shooting him watching the stuff down below.
Speaker 2: Kissimmee, Florida I think (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's the funeral of Mother Theresa; we flew to India, Calcutta for the funeral, so lots of Heads of States came and Mrs. Clinton came representing the United States.
Speaker 2: But that's--police officers needed some more help with gear and things they had to have to make cities safer.  So he helped sponsor initiative getting more money to the police officers instead of all the money being eaten up by perks for government folks.  So he tried to designate special money to be spent the way our law officials thought they should be spent.
Speaker 1: $100,000 in cops (unclear).
Speaker 2: There you go.  Here we're trying to get a, trying to get a peace agreement and Sharm El Sheikh Egypt. So you have Mubarak and all the other folk trying to make it happen and as you know it still hasn't happened.
Speaker 1: That's the President and Socks together after a long jog.  We're sitting on the back of the South Lawn and the President's just taking a pause before he goes in and Socks has come up to him.  Socks is always tethered outside so you see the rope and then he sat down close enough for Socks to crawl up on him.
Speaker 2: Socks didn't jog with him?
Speaker 1: No, Socks didn't jog with anybody.
Speaker 2: Very few cats.
Speaker 1: Women's Music on the Road, that's--I'm on the bottom left hand side and we called ourselves "Roadwork" and we put music on the road, had women's music on the road, and we sponsored people and get 'em gigs and send 'em out and I take pictures and I sat on the board for almost ten years.
Speaker 2: I'm about maybe three or two years old and my brother's fourteen months younger than me.  I'm on the left, he's on the right.
Speaker 1: Oh this is the chess club we had when I was in the eighth or ninth grade , '65 [1965] so I'd be fourteen, thirteen going on fourteen, so I was in the eighth grade getting ready to go into the ninth grade, and I'm third from the bottom right.
Speaker 2: And then that was when I first got out of college, this is like '74 [1974] or '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: And what we do for everybody Christmas time take pictures, somebody took our picture for Christmas at the White House, and on the far right hand side is the artist Joyce Wellman.
Speaker 2: That's my mom and dad just after they were married sitting in my grandmother's house and my uncle shot that.
Speaker 1: Aboard Air Force One, and Madeline Albright along with the Chairman of the Joint Center Chief of Staff and that's [Samuel Richard] Sandy Berger, the National Security Advisor, and they're trying to make a decision about what to do as we fly.  We're on a foreign trip.
Speaker 2: Did you go to Bosnia (unclear) at that time?
Speaker 1: I think that's the Bosnia trip.
Speaker 2: Were you in that (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No you know people get tired.  This is at the United Nations up in New York.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry (unclear).
Speaker 1: Un-hun, this [Nelson] Mandela, Kofi Annan and you should say it since you're on the mic.
Speaker 2: Oh yes Mandela in the middle, Kofi Annan, President Clinton and on the far left hand side is a guy from Turkey.
Speaker 1: This after, this is during a party at the White House, State Dinner matter-of-fact. I think it's the night we did the "Soul Train" line too, President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and Eunice Schreiber.
Speaker 2: The Clintons did the soul train line?
Speaker 1: Yep, Clinton had a putting thing put out back for him so he goes out and putts in between and Chelsea [Clinton], well she was doing ballet at the time.  So she was practicing her moves.  Clinton's favorite sport is golf.
