Speaker 1: Now what does N stands for?
Speaker 2: Nathaniel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there any significance to the first name of Darwin?
Speaker 2: That's funny you should ask that because my mother [Marrietta Todd Davis] dreamed my name.  Just the other day we were talking about this.  My mother is ninety-two and we were talking about this and she told me that she dreamed my name and my grandmother [Corine McDowell Todd] told her well listen if it's a boy, name him that because that that will just be good luck.  And she dreamed it.  She said she had never known a Darwin.  She didn't know about Charles Darwin.  She didn't know any Darwin, she just dreamed the name.  She has no idea how she came up with that name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I thought it might be significant because of the connotation with Charles Darwin (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right right.  Many people think that.
Speaker 1: A lot of controversy I guess around the time you were (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: It's just that usually black people tend to fall on the fundamentalist Christian side of it you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  You know she just dreamed it, she said she had never heard of the name before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right do you have any other names, any nicknames or?
Speaker 2: No.  Dar (laughter).  In the corporate world I think everybody shortens your name and they called me Dar.  And some of my old, old friends call me Big Daddy (laughter) but that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Four, ten, thirty-two. April 10, 1932, Flint, Michigan.

Story_ID: 260851
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, sir do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food?  Yes, I do.  I have several favorite foods.  You can see I, I have been a food favorite a long time.  Favorite food, I love greens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, spring and summer because I'm a golfer and I love to play golf.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Not a single favorite.  I mean I have.  There are several places that I find, you know that I really like.  I love Jamaica.  I love the Carolinas [North Carolina and South Carolina], playing golf there.  I like the East Coast, Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  And so, I've.  For that reason I have never bought a home in another place because I don't want to be stuck to go to one place
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question in this set is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I probably do not.  I don't think I do.  I just.  I probably, if I had a favorite or think of, I hadn't thought of it like that, but, I believe in really treating people fairly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it would be like the golden rule.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That would be something I've tried to live by.
Story_ID: 260852
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history.  I want to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Abner Davis] side.  Let's start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's full name is Marrietta M-A-R-R-I-E-T-T-A, Marrietta Woodson Davis.  Well Todd was her, her maiden name was Todd, T-O-D-D.

Speaker 1: A-Y-S-H-I-R-E, okay.  All right, now where is that at in Indiana?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I've been there when I was a youngster.  It's down by Paducah [Kentucky], where Paducah comes down.
Speaker 1: Okay, where the Ohio River meets the Kentucky River [sic. Tennessee River] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They lived in Indiana and Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what do you know about your ancestors on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: I know quite a bit.  I knew my, great-grandfather [James Edward Todd] and my grandfather [Edward Allen Todd].  My great-grandfather, was a minister in Ayrshire, Indiana and we call him Papa Tide.  And I remember visiting him, I remember very vividly visiting him when I was a little boy, and he had the goats that would talk.  And he would say "Annie, our relatives are here from Michigan, say hi to them."  The old goats would say "hi" (laughter) it was quite, quite.  I really remember that.  And my grandfather, who, I was very close to, and only lived a few doors from us in Flint, Michigan and I knew him very well and my grandmother [Corine McDowell Todd] who died July 24, 1945.  She was only fifty-one years old.  And my mother's the oldest of ten kids, five boys and five girls.  I'm the oldest grandchild of seventy grand, great grand, and great great grandchildren.  We've had, we've had family reunions for over sixty years.  Every two years we have a family reunion, and I know a lot about that family.  Many cousins and like probably two hundred people come.
Speaker 1: As I understand the name Todd, any history associated with the name Todd?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know that far back.  But Todd was the family name, is the family name.
Speaker 1: You know [President Abraham] Lincoln's wife [Mary Todd Lincoln] was a Todd.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Speaker 1: From Kentucky with a - they owned slaves from Kentucky actually.
Speaker 2: Right, right and I don't know if there's any connection there or not.
Story_ID: 260853
Speaker 1: Any stories passed down in that, from that side of the family about life down there in Ayrshire [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  My family, my mother's [Marrietta Todd Davis] family were, they owned coal mines.  Now, that, I say that they own coal mines, this is not to say they were big business people, everybody owned a little coal mine where you lived and you, my mother would tell us stories about how they would shoot coal.  In other words they would light the dynamite and then run and have a place a designated place to run and hide.  The kids would always be, "It's my turn, my turn to light the wick."  And I mean it was, I know many stories of that family of were being raised there.  Aunts and uncles who I have never met but I know stories about them.
Speaker 1: Now they would light the dynamite and like blow the, I mean to collect the coal that was in the mine?
Speaker 2: Yes.  (Unclear) They were just collecting coal for themselves.  This was not a commercial venture.  But they owned land and on that land they owned coal mines.  And they would shoot coal and then collect it for their own use.
Speaker 1: That was (unclear) for a coal at a premium in those days in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes, right.
Speaker 1: If you had access to free coal.
Speaker 2: And that's what they did.  My great-grandfather [James Edward Todd] died in a coal mine.  The coal, he went in to collect the coal and it, the wall caved in and killed him.  But he died in the coal mines in Ayrshire, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what other stories about some of your other relatives.  You said you heard a lot of stories coming up.  Any specific stories that would kind of tell a picture of what life was like down there in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My family was.  This is my mother's side of the family we're talking about.  Was a large family as I said.  They, they did a lot of work and farming and, and they, as I said, there were ten kids and those kids all had to had to had to work round there.  My mother tells stories about how when the kids where born.  She's the oldest one.  And to how the kids were born would say the stork,  they would have to leave the house because the stork would bring the baby in (laughter) and the next day they would could come back and the stork had delivered the baby.  And we laughed even today about this, about how they did this.  On my mother's ninetieth birthday, we had a big party for her in Flint, Michigan and we were talking about how she and her girlfriend threw the switch on a train track and set up on the hill and watch the train run off the track.  I mean they, they didn't think, they were little kids and they didn't think there some harm.  I mean they didn't kill anybody or anything because the train was going real, real slow, it just ran off the track.  But, stories like that.  And other families I knew stories about them and you know we were, they were a very close family.  They came to Michigan from there, some of them stopped in Chicago [Illinois], and so our family got started in Flint, Michigan.
Story_ID: 260854
Speaker 1: Now why would they leave Ayrshire [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Because the automobile factories.  My grandfather [Edward Allen Todd] worked for Chevrolet motor company.  And my grandfather was the head of the garage where all the executives' cars were parked.  Every day, every Chevrolet executive, his car was washed and gassed up.  It was amazing.  That's in the days you know, they just did a lot of things.  But every day, and my grandfather ran that garage.  And when I was in college, I brought all of my [Alpha Phi Alpha] Fraternity brothers, I brought thirty of them one summer to Flint, Michigan.  My grandfather got all of them jobs and they made lots and lots of money.  Some of them never went back to Arkansas.  I went to college at University of Arkansas [at] Pine Bluff, which was then called AM&N College [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  And they, some of them never came back because they said why am I going to back and make $4100 a year teaching school and I make $4100 a month and I make $4100 in a couple of months here.  And they never went back, they never went back to school some of them didn't.  But most of them did, probably 80 percent of them did and many of them came back to Michigan and live in Michigan now.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, so was your grandfather the first one to go up to Flint and get involved in the auto industry?
Speaker 2: Of our family, yes.
Speaker 1: And then he brought up the rest of the
Speaker 2: But the people next door, who lived next door to us, the Wickware [ph.] family, was friends,  they were family friends in Ayrshire, Indiana and you know one family moves up and then they tell the other family and then they come and they my - the migration was very, very direct and very planned.
Speaker 1: So the migration kind of corresponded to the development of the auto industry?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Up there in Michigan?
Speaker 2: They all came and worked in automobile factories in Flint, Michigan.
Story_ID: 260855
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Marrietta Todd Davis] grow up in Flint [Michigan] or did she--?
Speaker 2: My mother, my mother, when she was eighteen years old, she went to Chicago [Illinois] and lived with my mother's, my grandmother's [Corine McDowell Todd] sister with her aunts, two aunts who were there.  She lived there with them and she worked in the Murray hair product factory [Murray's Superior Products Company, Chicago, Illinois].  The guy [C.D. Murray] who owned Murray's hair grease was--lived in the building where my aunts and them lived and he gave my mother a job and she worked there in that factory for about a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Yeah Murray's greaseless hair pomade - at least that's name of it anyway.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Seems like it's got grease in it to me but.
Speaker 2: Yes it does (laughter).
Speaker 1: In that orange can.
Speaker 2: In that orange can - that's right.
Speaker 1: Every black family is familiar with.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Well my mother worked there when she was eighteen years old.  And then she went.  Well the family now moved to Flint and got a home and everything, she then went to Flint and she went to Flint really to visit.  She was gonna stay just a little while and as my father [Abner Davis] tells it, she met him and was never to leave again.  And my mother and father starting dating and consequently they were married in Flint, Michigan, and they stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that was about 19-- and when was it when they meet in?
Speaker 2: In 1930.
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty [1930].  Okay.  All right, now did your mother talk about going to school and growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother and father went to the same high school I went to.  They went to Flint Central High School [Flint, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I went to that school, too.
Story_ID: 260856
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Abner Payne Davis. P-A-Y-N-E.  Abner Payne Davis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 13, 1912 in Opelousas, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: O-P-A-L-U-S-I-S [sic.] I think.  No that's not right.  Franklin, Louisiana.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Oh, Franklin.
Speaker 2: He lived in Franklin, Louisiana.  Easier to spell too.  But that is where he was born, he was born in Franklin, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now what do you know about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not as much, but I do know some.  My father came to Michigan, Flint, Michigan when he was three years old.  So he didn't really know a lot about living in Louisiana.  His family had migrated there also to work in automobile factories.  He was one of two children.  He and his sister my Aunt Ethel [ph.] and (phone ringing) you want to stop?
Speaker 1: You want to pause?  Now a days (laughter).  Okay we were talking about your father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father and they, he was one of two children.  My father's, my grandfather on my father's side died of, I guess Pleurisy they called it, I think.  Probably a month or two before my father was born.  And, so I never knew my grandfather.  But I knew my grandmother very well.  Because when we, when my father and mother got married, they lived with my grandmother in Flint, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we lived in a small house and my father's sister and her four children and my father and his wife [Marrietta Todd Davis] and our three children.  We all lived in the same house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are any of these stories about your father's side of the family.  Any, are there stories as to why they left Louisiana?
Speaker 2: They left Louisiana simply to work in the factories.  I mean there was better work opportunities.
Speaker 1: So the word was out.  Basically.
Speaker 2: The word was out. That's right.  Now I have subsequently gone back to Louisiana.  My brother, who deceased at age fifty-two, he was three years younger than me, did a family history after Alex Haley did the thing where my brother then did that and we  had eight hundred, I'm sorry.  Yes, eight hundred people on this sheet, went around the room.  Now we were told my brother and I that we were the last Davis and if we didn't have any sons, the Davis would die out.  And come to find out, that we were not the last Davis at all.  This white per--, guy in Louisiana had taken a whole family which had like twelve or fourteen kids name Davis and changed their name to Hills.  And some of them were in their teenagers when they did this.  This was not something that happened back in slavery days.  This is something that happened in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] yes.  And so my brother found out all of this, and we started having family reunions.  My brother created a family reunion in the Davis/Hills family.
Speaker 1: Now why did, how did this happen that they would change their names?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  We never found out.
Story_ID: 260857
Speaker 1: Were they [Davis' paternal family] trying to get away from something in Louisiana or something?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I have no idea what it was.  But they didn't want to change their name, but he made them change their names.  But I mean, we had interesting things happen.  The last, four years ago we had a family reunion in Louisiana and the oldest sugar refining plantation in the United States is still running in Louisiana, and we had it there.  We had the family reunion there, we had a meeting there.
Speaker 1: Is it associated with the family in some way?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you that so.  The guy who owns it is my age.  But his family has owned it a long, long, long before him.  And he said look, I know that there's a great relationship between this family and my family.  And I don't really know what it is.  He said, but I know it's family relationship here.  And I want you to know that for now own, when you have family reunions, you can have them all right here.  And then one of the cousins said, so you knw Earlene [ph.] over there, I know Earlene is related to me and Earlene told us a story that the first time she knew, had any idea what had happened.  That when she went to college, she wasn't going to college, they couldn't afford it.  Then one day her father went home and said you're leaving tonight for college to Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College] in [Baton Rouge] Louisiana.  And she said daddy, you know we don't have the money.  You got the money and you're going to college.  She went to college for four years, graduated with honors and never got a bill, never knew who paid the money.  But the man who owned that sugar plantation paid the money and we think he might have been her father, but we don't know that.  But you know, he paid the money.  I mean it was and his son who now runs it, runs the sugar place, says that he knows that Earlene is his relative but he doesn't know what relative.  And Earlene didn't know.  That was very strange thing.  It was like, you read stories about stuff like this.  But this happened to us only about four or five years ago, when we were in Louisiana.  And he took us on this tour and.
Speaker 1: Well you know it's not as odd as you think.  I mean I've heard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I know that it's odd when it happens to you, you know.  I know it happens all the time but when it happens to you it's odd because you're wondering, "Wow! What is this?"
Speaker 1: Race relations in the South in the United States are historically, just all over the place.
Speaker 2: Yes they are.
Speaker 1: And we know about the discrimination and all that, but there are other stories where people are actually.  It's not, some people don't recognize their relatives if they create and some do.
Speaker 2: Right and this guy was.  He and I are the same age.  And he was very forthright and said look, I don't know the whole story. 'Cause you know, he said they didn't talk to us, they didn't tell their kids about it.  But I know there is a relationship and, and, so that was a very.  That family is a very well educated.  I was supposedly the first person in my family to graduate from college, but when I went down south [to Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], I was not the first one and there were a lot of relatives that had gown to college and graduated from college.  But in, in, in, on my mother's [Marrietta Todd Davis] side, I was the first to get a college degree.  But as we went south, many of my cousins had gone to college and graduated.  As a matter of fact, in Jeanerette, Louisiana the principal of the school there was my, the biggest school there, integrated school, was my cousin.  Who, we had another cousin who was superintendent of the school, assistant superintendent of the schools, and these were integrated schools.  We had another cousins who were teachers and things who had, you know, done very well.
Story_ID: 260858
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about growing up.  Do you have a--or what's your first childhood memory.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Probably one of the earliest is the story I told you about I went to see my grandfath-- great-grandfather [James Edward Todd] in [Ayrshire] Indiana and the goats.  I remember that so well.  I remember him standing at the top of that hill.  And the goats where down below and the houses on top of this hill.  And he would talk to the goats and that was one of my earliest memories was that.
Speaker 1: You tell them to say hi and they would all go "baa."
Speaker 2: Yeah right.  And say, "Annie, our relatives are here from Michigan and say hi to them," and the goats would talk to us.  It was fascinating.  I went back to school.  I remember telling about that and everybody went, "Aw, come on."
Story_ID: 260859
Speaker 1: Growing up in Flint [Michigan], I mean, what was it like?  What was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I had a wonderful childhood.  I had a--I was very fortunate.  I had great parents.  My father was the greatest man I had ever met and he died at age forty-seven.  I was twenty-seven.  But my father was such a tremendous guy.  He was a man who was committed to his family.  He was understanding.  He tried to do everything for his kids and things he couldn't do he tried to it any way.  I mean he just was such a good man.  I remember my sister graduating from high school.  She wanted a Kimberly knit dress.  And he couldn't afford to buy that.  He worked for the [U.S.] Post Office and I'd tell you that story.  But he would-and so he took his shot gun because my father is a great pheasant hunter and that was, the sport he liked was pheasant hunting.  He took it and pawned it.  When he came out of the pawn shop, some of the people he worked for were walking by there and saw him.  It was one of the most devastating things of his life.  They would see him pawning his shotgun.  He was just was a proud man who but he wanted my sister to have that dress and so he did it.  But, my father worked in a post office.  He had worked in the automobile factory.  But my father said that automobile factory was not the place to go.  And my father worked as a janitor in the post office in Flint, Michigan and he, as janitors always had a little office, a little cubby hole, and he picked up a scheme, you know the short, clerk that sort the mail, it's called a scheme.  And he took some soda pop cases and put up, labeled them and learned to throw the scheme.  And he learned to throw the scheme and one day he said to the supervisor at the post office, "You know one day I would like to try to be a clerk."  And they laughed like it was a big joke.  His name was Abner [Davis] and they called him Ab.  And they said "When you want to do it?" and he said "Right now."  They said "What? Right now?  You got to study."  And he said "Well, I can do it."  And the whole post office stopped working.  They stopped, it was a big joke.  They were going to make fun of him.  They thought he didn't understand.  And he threw this thing and he made, I think three mistakes, and you can make twenty mistakes.  You are allowed twenty mistakes, and so they were stunned.  They didn't know what to do.  And so they said "Well you know this doesn't count, you know we were just having fun.  You have not passed the test because you have to apply and do all of this."  He said, "Okay."  Well the postmaster's name was Oz Kelly [William Osmund Kelly] and I remember this so well, and I don't know why I remember but I remember it so well.  The postmaster found out about this, and he called my father and he said, "Ab, I heard that you threw the scheme (unclear)."  So my father told him said, "Well you know I got a hold to a book and I studied it and I practiced.  I set up a case of some of pop, soda-pop cases, and I learned to do it."  He said, "Ab, you take it, make the application and pass this test and you're gonna be, you're gonna be the first black postal clerk in Flint, Michigan."  And my father did that and in fact he made one mistake when he did this the next time.  And became the first black postal clerk in Flint, Michigan.  He was, he died, he worked there for twenty-some years and he was working there when he died at age forty-seven.  He was in charge of all the money in the post office.  The stamps and all the stuff that money was all getting.  He was the head of what was called the register room.  And he was a very prominent guy.  And when he died, you would thought it was some big politician or something.  People, black and white people came from all over to his funeral.  He was some man. And people came up to my, sister and brother and I and said listen, your father.  I borrowed twenty-two dollars from your father and I never got a chance to pay him back and I'd like to give it to you.  And one lady told us that my father had given her husband twelve dollars because she had to go to the hospital and our lights were cut off because my father was supposed to pay the light bill with that.
Story_ID: 260860
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Darwin N.] Davis [Sr.] can you tell us the light story again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father [Abner Davis] was a very giving person who believed in helping his fellow man.  And he died, this man, this woman came up and told us that her husband had told her that she had to go to the hospital and my father had it was twenty-some dollars.  Or something like that.  I've forgotten what amount of money it was, and he had given it to her and they cut off our lights.
Speaker 1: Your father gave the money to the man for his wife.
Speaker 2: For his wife to go to the hospital.  And my mother [Marrietta Todd Davis] said, I thought you paid the bill.  He said well he needed that money for his wife.  And we can do without lights but he couldn't do without that.  So it was not gonna hurt us to be without lights for a few days, for a week.  And we had no lights for a week.  And I mean, he just did things to help people.  You know, he was that kind of a person.  And, and, and at his funeral, after the funeral, people came up and told us all kinds of stories about things he had done to help them.  It was weird.  I was twenty-seven years old, my sister was twenty-five, and my brother was twenty-four when that happened.  My father died.  He raised himself since he was about twelve years old and he worked and everything and smoked cigarettes and because everybody smoked in those days and he died of lung cancer.  Yeah, so it was really bad.  But he was, he was that kind of guy and he really, when I was in college [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], every year he came to homecoming to watch me play football.  Never missed one time.  Drive, get in his car and drive to Arkansas.  He and my mother.  And then my last college football game was in Texas.  And he drove to Arkansas by himself and the coach [Leroy Moore] let him get on the bus with us and go to Texas and watch my last college game.  And I scored two touchdowns in that game.  So he was really, oh man, he was, he was like, you'd a thought I became president of the United States!  He was just so proud!  He told me that he would buy me a suit when we got home for Christmas.  But he was that kind of guy.  He was just a very special man, very special.
Story_ID: 260861
Speaker 1: I want to go back to when you were a little kid.  I was asking you about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Or what the neighborhood was like?
Speaker 2: We lived in a, we lived in a, in a, in a nice neighborhood.  My mother [Marrietta Todd Davis] still lives in the same house.  She lived in that house for sixty-four years.  She lives in the house, she just moved out of the house because she moved with my sister.  She's ninety-two so we moved her with my sister.  My sister and I built an addition to my sister's house.  A separate entrance, and separate bathroom, separate bedroom, separate sitting room.  Everything for my mother.  And we did it three years ago and she just now moved into it.  She wouldn't move.  But, they bought this house, they paid $2500 for it.  And three bedroom house, $2500, sixty, sixty/sixty-five years ago, and we lived in this nice neighborhood in Flint, Michigan.  And I went to Flint Central High School [Flint, Michigan].  There were 690 people in my high school class.  It was a big huge class, big huge school and only seven blacks.  And so we had.  It was a.  Not without problems, but it was a wholesome school.  I remember I was the first.  You know how when you graduate the most popular this and the different titles, I was voted the best liked.  I think I was the first black ever voted anything.  And I am now a member of the history of that school.  They had voted people, you know that had done well.  I have been voted into the annals of that school.  But I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what was the name of that?
Speaker 2: Flint Central High School.
Speaker 1: Flint Central High School.  Now what was the name of the grade school you went to?
Speaker 2: I went to Elm Park Elementary School [Flint, Michigan].  Went to Clark Elementary School [Flint, Michigan].  Whittier Junior High School [Flint, Michigan].  Whittier.  And Flint Central High School.  My Clark School is still there.  It's been closed for years. It's got a big for sale sign there.  My kids tease me, they say dad that's the only way you got out of that school, was that they sold the school, that they closed the school and that's the only way you got out.  It' a big raggedy building.  It still sits there.  With a big for sale sign on it so my kids, still even now they tease me.  And they're grown.  And they tease me, dad, there's your school over there.  But I had a good--

Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: I liked history.  I liked math.  I had, I had some good experiences.  To tell you one, remember when we studying American history and this is in junior high school [Whittier Junior High School, Flint, Michigan].  Studying American history and we were talking about slavery.  Which was, was you know was taught in a way very, you were made to feel very uncomfortable if you were black in this room with 92/94 percent white kids.  You were made to feel very bad about, inferior almost about it and we were talking about Nate [sic. Nat] Turner's Rebellion where he rebelled and killed some white people and got some, led some slaves to do that.  And the teacher was talking about what a maniac he was and how ridiculous he was and all she just went on and on and on.  And then she asked people in the room what do they think about that.  Oh I wasn't about to volunteer any thoughts about that.  She said then, "Well [HistoryMaker] Darwin [N. Davis, Sr.] what do you think about that?"  And I said, "Well I think that more slaves would have been like him, they would of been better and better off."  I mean, I couldn't understand how they let people do that, do all those things to them.  And she was appalled.  She was upset and angry.  She kicked me out of the school.  Kicked me out of the room and sent to the principal's office and I was not allowed to come back to school unless my parents [Marrietta Todd Davis and Abner Davis] came.  Well I went home and told my father about this and he said, "Well what happened?  What did you do?" And I told him what happened and he said, "That's all you did, you didn't mouth off or anything did you?"  And I said, "No dad, I didn't I just, she asked me a question and I answered her."  So he went to the school the next morning with me and the principal said that you know he started.  He said, "Wait before we do this, let's get the teacher here too because I want to hear what everybody says about this."  Teacher came and my father said, "Now what happened?"  And she said, "Well you know he just upset the class, he started real trouble, he was very ill-mannered."  And so, "Well what did he do?"  And so, he asked her and she said, "Well, he can tell ya" so I said exactly what happened and he said, "So is that what happened?"  She said, "Yes."  He say, "Now the way I hear this, you asked him a question, he answered you, very manneredly, and you didn't like the answer so you kicked him out."  And she said, "Well that kind of thinking is just not acceptable."  "No but you did ask him a question and he did answer you and he was not ugly about it and I don't understand why you kicked him out."  And I, I, he told the principal, he said, "And I think something should be done about this.  She kicked him out of school because he answered the question and she didn't like the answer."  Well I was so proud of my father man because, I was already made to feel very bad.  This whole thing about slavery in junior high school was just denigrating.  I mean you are made to feel less than a person.  The way that this teacher taught it she was just really bad.  And I always remember that about my father.  How proud I was he stood up for me.  Because I hadn't done anything wrong and I knew I hadn't done anything wrong.  Well, you know, that, nobody bothered me in that school again.  But I had a wonderful schooling.  Schools were good.  They were tough and I had a good life in junior high and high school [Flint Central High School, Flint, Michigan] and elementary school.  We walked of course.  There were no busing.  We walked through snow up to your knees.  You walked to school, nobody bothered you.  You know, it was very different in those days.  The '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].

Speaker 1: We mentioned a mutual friend of ours in Chicago [Illinois], Dr. Herbert Odom.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You grew up with him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: So can you tell us about, his father ran the Golden Gloves you say?
Speaker 2: Yes.  His father was a head of the Golden Gloves - he was a boxing coach for the Golden Gloves.  And Herb Odom and I, we went to different high schools.  He went to the competing school, Flint Northern High School [Flint, Michigan].  I went to Flint Central High School [Flint, Michigan].  But Herb Odom's father was the head of it and head of the Golden Gloves and he, Herb's brothers boxed and his father was Young Odom, is what his name was, Young Odom.  And Herb was a champion boxer.  (unclear) on the Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] I think he won NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association], won All-American, he was undefeated in all four years of college I think.  And he was just a fabulous guy.  And he went on to dental school and became a dentist.  He went to Meharry Medical Sch-College [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and became a dentist.  And moved to Chicago [Illinois] and opened up a practice and had a very large and successful practice in Chicago.  But we were good friends through all those years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was a dentist that was famous for the turnaround of Ralph Metcalfe.  I mean he was brutalized by the police in Chicago.  And it turned Ralph, I think Ralph Metcalfe voted against something [Mayor Richard J.] Daley wanted him to after.  That's a famous story they tell in Chicago now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is that right?  I didn't know that story.
Speaker 1: And Odom is also famous for his integrity and his persona.  He has such an impeccable persona.
Speaker 2: Yes he does.
Speaker 1: I mean he could walk into a room and people would be cursing and they would stop because Doc Odom was there.  You know.
Speaker 2: That's what they called him Doc Odom.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  An interesting person.  Okay.  Now you were in - did you box any when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: No.  I never did.
Story_ID: 260864
Speaker 1: So you played football basically?
Speaker 2: I played football in high school.  I played baseball in high school.  And basketball in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All three sports then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What percentage of black students where at your school.
Speaker 2: At Flint Central High School [Flint, Michigan].  Well as I said, in my class there were 690 and only seven blacks.  I mean it was a very low percentage of blacks in the school.
Speaker 1: Yeah just slightly over 10 percent.
Speaker 2: Now that school is predominantly black probably.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where there any teachers that you remember throughout school that were like mentors to you or really you know helped you?
Speaker 2: The principal's name was Phillip Verko [ph.].  I remember him very well.  And Ms. Verdell [ph.], who I remember very well.  And I had a teacher named Mr. Lowell [ph.], who was very, very, very he used to talk to me all the time.  He kind of singled me out to kind of mentor me to kind of talk to me.  There were no black teachers.  I never had a black teacher in my life until I went to college.  Which is one of the reasons I went to Arkansas [Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] to college.  My father [Abner Davis] wanted me to go to a black college for one year.  In my hometown there were no black teachers.  One black police officer.  Two black lawyers, probably two black dentists, two black physicians and that was it.  There were no role models really in business or anything like except maybe real estate or something like that.  But no.  So my father wanted me to go.
Speaker 1: In school now.  Where you a good student in high school?
Speaker 2: I was a good a student.  I wasn't superior.  But I was a good student.  But you had to be good to live in my father's house.  You better be good.  But I never got in trouble.  I was a good student.  But that's all, I wasn't exceptional.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you involved in, other than sports, were you involved in any other high school activities, any of the clubs or social activities?
Speaker 2: No.  I can't think of any.  No I wasn't.  I played three sports, and I worked.  I always worked.  I mean I worked at a, funny be-- because I went by.  I worked at a place called Abbott's Meat Market [Flint, Michigan] and you know [James] Abbott, the baseball pitcher that had one hand.  I mean I knew him when he was born.
Speaker 1: Oh, the famous pitcher that had the one arm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's his family from Flint, Michigan. He's from Flint, Michigan.  And I knew that whole family.  I worked with that family.  I was a delivery boy at the meat market.  When I was in high school and I worked on Saturdays at Abbott's Meat Market.  I delivered newspapers.  I always had a job.  I always made my money.  And so I didn't have a lot of time to get involved with other school things other than the sports.
Speaker 1: How generally was the race relations in Flint?  Yeah, it was small kind of tiny black population but was it?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't a tiny black population in Flint, but over where I lived it was.  It wasn't a small black population.  And we didn't live in any kind of exclusive area or anything, it was just, that's just what it was.  The race relation.  You know, you know.  There were a lot of problems, I know that.  But I never was involved because my father protected us from them--
Story_ID: 260865
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Flint Central High School, Flint, Michigan], towards your senior year, what were your career aspirations?  Did you think you were going to college then, or did you know you were going to college?  And did you know what you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: That's a very interesting question because my birthday is April 10th, I was graduating in June.  On my eighteenth birthday, I was through school every morning at eleven o'clock because I had taken a lot of classes and I was through at eleven o'clock every morning.  So I went out to the automobile factory and got a job working the factory in the afternoons from three to eleven.  And I worked until eleven every night and I came home and went to bed and went to high school.  I saved money and making money.  I always worked.  I've always been very ambitious about working and making money and doing all this stuff.  So I was making money, man.  I was doing it.  You know and on Saturdays I could work double shifts and Sundays worked double shifts for double time.  I was just making more money than I ever thought.  Making way more money than my father [Abner Davis].  And I remember telling my father, "Listen, dad, this is really great. I'm gonna, tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm going to stay out of college.  I'm not going to go to college for the first year.  I'm going to stay out of college.  I'm not going to go to college for the first year.  I'm gonna save all of my money and buy all of my clothes and buy a car.  Buy all of this and then I'm going to go to college."  He said "That's good, you thought this out."  I said "Yeah, I really have thought this out."  He said "That's fine, where are you going to live?"  I said "Well I'm going to stay at home."  He said "No, you can't stay here."  And I said "What do you mean?"  He said "I'm not raising factory workers and if you work in the factory then your brother and sister are going to go and work in the factory.  And I don't want y'all to do that.  I quit the factory," he said.  "And you all are not going to work in the factory."  Now all of my relatives work in the factory.  He wasn't denigrating the factory but he knew that once you got in the factory, you start making money, you don't get out.  And I said, "Well, I'll just come by, I'll get a place to stay and come by here and pay momma [Marrietta Todd Davis] to do my clothes and have my food here."  He said, "No.  You can't do that.  You're going to live here or not live here.  You're going to go to college or you are not going to college.  You can't live here if you don't go to college."  And I was so hurt.  I was.  My mother was just oh goodness, tears in her eyes when he said it and he was adamant.  And so he said I want you to go to a college, a black college [HBCU] for at least one year.  And then you can go wherever you want to.  Well most of my friends are going to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] and so that's where I was and I was a football player and I had the scholarship there and he didn't care about that.  He said.  (Background noise) And I had a scholarship at Arkansas [Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] and so I went to Arkansas.
Story_ID: 260866
Speaker 1: Now why University of Arkansas [at] Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]?  I mean how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because a guy there named John [A.] Russell who worked for the [Charles Stewart] Mott Foundation.  John Russell had coached at Arkansas. He now was working for the Mott Foundation, and he told my father [Abner Davis] about it.  Said look, your son.  I was a good football player, but I was probably one of the best kickers in the country out of high school.  And he said your son, we can definitely get him a full ride scholarship at Arkansas.  He called and I went to Arkansas two weeks after practices started.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you graduated from high school [Flint Central High School, Flint, Michigan] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950], okay.  And so you started in 1950 at the University of Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh!
Speaker 1: Then called the University of Arkansas AMA right?
Speaker 2: It was called A&M College.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now it's the University of Arkansas of Pine Bluff.  Okay.  Now tell us about you know, how did you like it?  You go up there on a football scholarship and you get there two weeks after practices has started.  Right?
Speaker 2: Two weeks after practice started.  So I'm really behind.  I was eighteen years old man, I was in shape, you know.  I didn't dissipate.  I didn't do anything.  I didn't smoke.  I was in shape and got there and the first day the coach [Roland K. Bernard].  'Cause they were taking me strictly on this man's word and coach said.  As soon as I got in the field, he said, "Okay, [HistoryMaker Darwin N.] Davis [Sr.] we want to see you kick."  And he wanted to see what he had bought, he bought a pick in a poke and he didn't know what I could do.  And I boomed some 40 or 50 yard kicks out.  And he said all man, all the guys were clapping and it was a wonderful feeling 'cause they were all clapping and they were, all right, all right, all right.  And they were excited about it and I made the team.  The traveling squad that day which they were in colleges.  It's a big thing.  As a freshman especially.  And it was a great thing.  I was.  I could always remember the first week there.  Even today, one of my life's worse experiences was we rode the bus to the practice field down the highway, down highway 65 [U.S. Route 65].  As we rode past there, we rode past this cotton field and all these people out there picking cotton and I said, "Oh look, look, look at all them people out there picking cotton, look at them."  I said, "Look those people."  Now all those kids had picked cotton.  All those guys on that team had picked cotton.  And I didn't realize and they were insulted that I was making fun of them and that day at practice, let me tell you, they tore my butt up.  I mean, they blocked, man I tell you every time I got the ball.  I looked up I was getting blasted and the coach, one of the coaches, called me inside to tell me that did you get the message today?  And I said no.  He said it was that remark that you made on the bus.  I said, oh my god.  So that day in the locker room, I said, "Okay everybody give me your attention," I said, "look, I apologize."  I said, "That what I said I didn't mean it like that.  I had never seen a cotton field.  I never seen people picking cotton.  I never seen cotton grow and I just really want to apologize.  I didn't mean any harm by it.  I was just surprised to see it.  And I mean I've seen it in movies, I seen it in books and stuff and I want to apologize to you right now."  And I said, "By the way, you cats can't tackle very hard any way.  That didn't hurt me at all."  And they all laughed.  And they forgave me instantly.  They forgave me instantly.
Speaker 1: So you were a back too?  You were a kicker but you were a back too?
Speaker 2: I was an end.
Speaker 1: End, okay.
Speaker 2: But see, I was there.  They figured I could do everything since I could kick so good.  He tried me out at fullback and he tried me out, you know.  And that day I was trying out, he had me at fullback.  Cause I had only been there a week.  And they tore me up man.  They tore me up!  And the guys didn't block for me, they just kind of stood up.  So I learned a lesson but I was a--.  Probably one of my most embarrassing moments when I did that because I realized that that was a, they took it, that I was making fun of them, but I wasn't, I was just surprised.  But you know, I had a wonderful experience in college.  I went there and I saw all those beautiful black women.  I had never seen that many black women in one place before.  I mean because I told you my high school had only, my graduating class had seven blacks in it and I think three of those were women.  And I thought, this is the greatest place.  I just loved that school.  I never left, I never thought about leaving.  I stayed the whole four years.  I've been very involved and am still very involved in the university.

Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: Business.  My major was business and I graduated in 1954 with a degree in business administration.
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the teachers and personalities at the school [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] when you were there, that you remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh boy!  Harding B. Young, I mean lives in Atlanta [Georgia] today, he and his wife.  He married Sadye Applebee who was a home economics teacher.  And we're good friends today.  I mean.  And Butler Henderson [ph.] who is now deceased.  Guy Darnell [ph.].  These were people who taught me and really mentored me in college, you know.  There were.  I remember many of the teachers that were really.  That school.  Teachers took interest in you.  I knew they were interested in me in being successful.  They motivated me.  The encouraged me.  They--it was just a wonderful thing.  I mean it was a wonderful place to go to school.  The teachers were fantastic.
Story_ID: 260471
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about one of your classmates, well two of your classmates you went to school--your roommate was [HistoryMaker] Malcom Hemphill [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And well your neighbor over there was [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So tell us about these guys (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So these guys, they were very good friends of mine.  And Malcom, today is one of my best friends.  I mean our kids are good friends now.  My, you know, his daughter lives here now and he married Jesse Owens' daughter and Gina [Hemphill-Strachan] who is the daughter, who is Malcom's daughter, Malcolm and Gloria's [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] daughter, lives here, in this area and we see her all the time, but our kids became very good friends and we became very good friends.  We've stayed very good friends.  Our wives are good friends.  And we've traveled together, we visited each other.  We've done a lot of things together.  And I subsequently, became the president of The Jesse Owens Foundation as a result of my relationship with Malcom and the Hemphill family and the Owens family.  But and Jeff, I didn't see Jeff but a few times after we got out of college and talked to him several times and I knew a lot about what he was doing.  Had FESTAC ['77; Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture] in [Lagos] Nigeria.  He had that big art gala there and but, we were good friends.  They were Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and I'm an Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity] and we used to always laugh and tease each other about that.  And, but we stayed good friends all those years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All those years yeah.
Speaker 1: I know, Jeff Donaldson died last year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he just died.
Speaker 1: Just a year ago.  Pretty much to the day almost.
Speaker 2: Jeff and I had the same girlfriend for a little while.  And I don't think she liked either one of us that much really (laughter), but he always teased me that I took her away from him.  But that wasn't true, he just said that.  I don't think she liked either one of us really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other people from University of Arkansas [at] Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] that we would know.  [HistoryMaker] Danny [K.] Davis, he wasn't there then was he?
Speaker 2: Danny was ahead of us.
Speaker 1: He was ahead of you.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Danny Davis was ahead of us.
Speaker 1: He's now a congressman from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, but there was some very famous people there.  Samuel [L.] Kountz the renowned surgeon that downstate medical school [State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, New York, New York].  The surgery school [sic. transplant unit] at the downstate medical school in Brooklyn [New York, New York] is named after him.  Samuel Kountz, K-O-U-N-T-Z, he's dead now, but he was the world's leading authority in kidney transplant, transplants.  And--
Speaker 1: This is a black guy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh yeah, he went to Arkansas with us.
Speaker 1: There must be a story behind that name because that's like a typical kind of a Jewish name.  Kountz (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, German, Jewish name right.  And Samuel, I used to call him Mein Herr Kountz because he was very guttural and he could speak German, and he took German.  He was very guttural and--
Speaker 1: Was he aware of some kind of a German heritage?
Speaker 2: Not that I know about.  He was from Lexa, Arkansas.  Such a great story.  Samuel died many years ago.  He went to South Africa to deliver a paper, came back went into a coma and was in a coma for six, seven years and he died.
Speaker 1: So he was the world's specialist on kidney transplant.
Speaker 2: He had done more kidney transplants than everybody else in the world put together.
Speaker 1: Wow, so you had quite a group at University of Arkansas?
Speaker 2: We sure did.  We sure did.
Speaker 1: University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff.  Little school but a lot of (simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: Anything else happened when you were there [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] that you want to relate to us?  Now, you came out in '54 [1954]?
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember in '52 [1952] or '3 [sic. 1946] and I can't--I don't remember the date, they passed the law [Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 1946].  The [U.S.] Supreme Court did I guess it was.  It said that if you, you could not segregate in bus transportation.  If a bus is going from one or a train is going from one state to another state.  Within the state you could do it.  And I remember I was one of the first people that rode a bus, I was going from Pine Bluff, Arkansas to Memphis, Tennessee and I had read this in the paper and we talked about it in the class.  So when I got on the bus, I got right in the second or third seat.  Bus driver said, "Boy, get back there."  I said, "I'm not going any place."  I was so young and foolish (laughter).  And he said, I said, "I can sit up here.  You are going to another state and I can sit anywhere I want to sit." And he said, "You can read too huh?"  I didn't say nothing, but I did.  That was my rebellious thing, and this was in '52 [1952] or something like that.  Long before sit-ins and all these things started.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well did he mess with you?
Speaker 2: No, no they didn't do anything.  No.  They didn't do anything.  I was just lucky.  I was lucky.  Too dumb and you know, they could have taken me out on a highway and thrown me out of there and nobody ever found me, but it didn't happen.  Nothing happened.
Speaker 1: I guess you took 'em by surprise sort of?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  He was surprised that I even knew it first of all.  And second he was surprised that I did it.  I was surprised too.  But I had a, we had to sit in the balconies of the movie theaters; go downtown to the movies, we had to sit in the balcony.  And I didn't think much of that stuff.  You know, I was, first of all, we never left the campus for anything hardly except to come downtown, go to movies, or to go to church.  And so the segregated South didn't have a lot of impact on me although I was in Arkansas because I didn't leave the campus that much and the campus was, you know, it was a wonderful place to be.
Story_ID: 260473
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned church, I didn't ask you about that at all, but was church a big part of growing up and part of your life?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was baptized in the Baptist church.  Mt. Olive [Missionary] Baptist Church [Flint, Michigan] when I was twelve years old.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Mt. Olive.
Speaker 1: Mt. Olive.
Speaker 2: Mt. Olive Baptist Church in Flint, Michigan.  It's still there.  My family still goes there.  Still attends that church.  And I went to Sunday school.  BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union] and I was raised, you know, to go to church.

Speaker 1: Now 1954, the year you graduated [from Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] was the year that the Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision was handed down.  Was that handed down when you were in school or had you graduated?
Speaker 2: I was in school.  I was--it was just.  Well I don't know the date it was handed down, but I remember, I knew about it because we followed it on the radio.  A couple of things we followed on the radio.  The McCarthur hearings-- [Army-]McCarthy hearings and the Board of Education, Brown versus the Board of Education.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they were going on in '54 [1954] too--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --the McCarthy hearings.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And we--and I used to listen to them on the radio.  I didn't have a TV, but I had a radio.  I listened to them.  The - I graduated in May of 1954.  I came home with a degree in business administration.  I had done very well in college and was excited about coming home and I went to work--went to General Motors' [General Motors Company] offices because Flint's [Flint, Michigan] a General Motors town.  With my degree and told them, you know, I wanted to apply for work and they were very nice but very firm.  Told me that we don't give applications to Negros for these kind of jobs.  But we can give you a great job on the assembly line.  I said I worked on the assembly line every summer.
Speaker 1: That was before you went to college.
Speaker 2: Before I went to college and that's what I did.  Then he said, well that's the only jobs we have.  And they were very nice.  They were not nasty.  They were not--but they were very nice but very firm and would not even give me an application to turn in, and I so I had to go into the [U.S.] Army anyways.  So I went to the Army and while in the Army, I went to college at night.  I was in a missile program a very top secret missile program at White Sands Proving Ground [sic. New Mexico Joint Guided Missile Test Range; White Sands Missile Range], New Mexico.  And I went to college at night at the University of New Mexico--New Mexico A&M College [New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico] and went to college and took classes and got my teacher's certificate.  So when I got out, I became a mathematics teacher in the Detroit [Michigan] school system and I taught for ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you went into the Army and was that the same year, '54 [1954] that you graduated?
Speaker 2: I went in in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1955 and you were stationed in New Mexico?
Speaker 2: White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico.
Speaker 1: Now White Sands, that's a picturesque place from what I understand (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Well, it was a top secret base.  Everybody had a college education.  It was quite a place to be.
Story_ID: 260475
Speaker 1: So you were in the [U.S.] Army for what, two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a little less than two years.  I got out a little early to go back to grad [graduate] school.  I think I got out about two or three months early.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there until '56 [1956] at least right?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], okay.
Speaker 2: I got out in '57 [1957].  But early.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so.
Speaker 2: I was supposed to get out in August and I got out in May, so I could go to school.
Speaker 1: So you were in like a teacher's--did you get a graduate degree or did you just?
Speaker 2: I got a graduate degree from Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan].  I got my master's [degree] in mathematics education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started in New Mexico [at New Mexico A&M College; New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico] and then finished up at Wayne?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Pause) So you taught in the--did you teach in Flint [Michigan] or Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Detroit.
Speaker 1: Detroit, okay.
Speaker 2: Went to Detroit.  Taught school in Detroit school system.
Speaker 1: That's ten years.  Now, what schools did you teach in?
Speaker 2: I taught first in the school--I taught was Duffield [Elementary] School [Detroit, Michigan], Duffield Elementary School, D-U-F-F-I-E-L-D.  And then I taught at Jones Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was that experience like?  Had you envisioned yourself as being, becoming a teacher prior to--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had not, I had not but I loved teaching school.  Teaching school was a wonderful thing for me and I loved the kids and I taught in the toughest, poorest neighborhood and it was just fine.  I just would, you know.  I was a math teacher and the first week, I'd tell the kids put your books under your seats.  We don't need any books, we don't need any pencils, we don't need any paper.  All we're gonna do is talk.  And let's find out.  Is this stuff, is this important, do we have this math stuff and know all this stuff.  And I would talk about discount, if you're gonna get a 33 percent discount, how do you know what you're getting.  How much change you supposed to get back.  You getting discounts on clothes and things like that.  And we talked about that and they came to the conclusion, hey this is important, we need to know this.  And kids.  I was a wonderful teacher, I have to give myself credit.  That's the only thing I'll tell you I was wonderful at doing was in teaching school.  I was great school teacher.  And then when they burned down Detroit and burned down Los Angeles [California] and they opened up the corporate world, I went to Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] and applied and they took me and I became.  I went into the business world.
Speaker 1: So, it was after.  Detroit had a couple of riots but you're talking about after the riot of 1968 or?
Speaker 2: No '64 [1964], '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I joined in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after the riot of.  Now what was the cause of the riot of '64 [1964] do you remember?
Speaker 2: Gosh, you know I don't even remember it.  That's amazing I don't remember it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because I know that during that time period, there were some riots.
Speaker 2: Because I remember--listen, I remember it was just, the city was just under smoke and all these things were happening.  I couldn't figure out what was going on.  And then, I found out what it was and I just was shocked.  And got my kids and kept them in the house and didn't want to go out, didn't go out because I didn't want something to happen to them.
Speaker 1: Now where did you live in Detroit?
Speaker 2: I lived on the West Side of Detroit.  I lived on Lawton Street, during that time.  We had a apartment. We call it two-family flat on Lawton.  One family lived downstairs, and we lived upstairs.  It was two separate houses.
Story_ID: 260476
Speaker 1: Now you didn't tell us how you met your wife [Velmarie Davis].  You want to tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I met my wife when I was in high school [Flint Central High School, Flint, Michigan].  But my wife was the only black cheerleader in the Saginaw Valley Conference [Saginaw Valley League].  And I didn't meet her, but I saw her.  I would see her, you know, running on and off the field and she'd be out there cheering.  And I said boy, she's kind of cute, you know.  But that was all, I didn't think much about it.  That summer that I went to college a girl I went to high school with named Joan Johnson [ph.] told me that I have a girlfriend who--Joan went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  My wife went to Fisk, and she said, "I have a girlfriend who lives in Pontiac, Michigan.  I want you to meet her.  She's a cute girl, you might like her, and I'm gonna have a party and I'm gonna invite her down here."  She came down and we met.  Nothing happened, you know we just met each other and hey went to parties together and you know laughed and talked.  Went on a couple of dates but that was all.  Didn't call each other or anything during the school year.  Didn't communicate, she went back to Fisk and I went on back to Arkansas [Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  And then, the next summer, we went out a few times.  Nothing, nothing hot and heavy.  You know.  And then didn't see each for ten, eleven years.  And one night I was at a party and this guy says, "A girl over here who knows, says she knows you."  And I go over there and it was her.  And we started laughing and talking and you know.  Hadn't seen each other in a long time and so we started dating again.  And got married (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  She was the only black cheerleader in the whole conference (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was the only one, yeah.  Yep, when we met, she said, "You know, I've seen you," and I said, "I've seen you too, but where--."  And we figured out that's where it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you get married?
Speaker 2: In 1965, I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you hadn't been married that long before you started working for--
Speaker 2: Been married eleven months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eleven months.
Story_ID: 260477
Speaker 1: --What really caused the transition?  Now you were teaching in the schools.  You liked being a teacher.
Speaker 2: Yes, I loved it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But I wasn't ever gonna ever make the money there that I would've wanted to make.  And the guy, Al Carlton [Jr.], who I played golf with, came down to.  A guy named Freddie Fenton [ph.], worked for Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] in St. Louis [Missouri] and he was there.  They had a big meeting there and he's the one asked me, "I know that there's a guy here named Al Carlton with our company, and I'd like to meet him."  I said, "Oh he's a good friend of mine, I play golf with him."  And so we met him and then they start talking to me about coming into the insurance business.  And I said, "Oh come on drop that you guys."  And they said, I said, "Okay, I'll come down talk to you tomorrow."  The next day, I went down and talked to them about it and I went to school and quit my job and went into the insurance business.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they made you a pretty attractive offer upfront I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know what, I was just.  I told you I got a degree in business.  I always wanted to go into business.  And my wife [Velmarie Davis] and I agreed that if it was half as good as he said, and we didn't really believe all that he said, but if it was half as good it was still gonna be better than what I was doing.  So we said hey, my wife was a nurse and she's working.  And we said hey, let's do it, let's go for it.  So we did.
Story_ID: 260478
Speaker 1: I went into the insurance business in Detroit, Michigan in 1966, '65 [1965], '66 [1966], '66 [1966] and as a salesman.  In October 1st and I did real well even with those three months, I really did well.  And I loved it, I was fascinated with this business.  That first of all you could do a lot to help people and make money at the same time.  And I'd been, this whole thing about helping people had been handed down to me through my father [Abner Davis], as I told you about.  And I always wanted to do something to help people.  I like, that's why I liked teaching school I could help people.  I would see kids.  In math teaching--math you could see the change.  In reading it takes years to see the change but in math, sometimes you can see it in two weeks.  And I was very in love with the insurance business because I grew to know that because of me, I could pass a school with--there'd be thirty kids in that school, I knew were going to get an education because their parents had talked to me.  I was going to be the one who provided the information and the financial prowess that they would be able to get an education, go to school, and I was very proud of this.  I was proud of what I did and proud of what the result would be.  I clearly understood the insurance business from the very beginning.  That people looked at the insurance business says well you know you pay some money and when you die somebody get some money.  I looked at all the living benefits and I, my whole presentation would be about the living benefits of insurance and how you could take care of your family.  You could pay a mortgage off early by buying a policy and taking the cash values and dividends and pay off the house ten years early.  And I was just was fascinated by that.  And I was very successful at it from the very beginning.  And I then became a district manager.  And Al Carlton [Jr.] and I, he was the district manager and I was the assistant district manager.  We built the number one district in the United States in the Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] system.  Al became an agency manager in Chicago [Illinois] and I took over the Detroit office.  We grew that office into the top three of the whole United States.  And it was a powerful financially, rich organization that did very, very well.  As a result of that, the Equitable, I won two President's Trophies in two years, which most people don't do.
Speaker 2: So what did you do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) President's Trophies the highest honor you can win as a branch manager.  It's a test of you as a business person.  They test you in eight areas.  But the whole idea is production growth through manpower development with expense control.  In other words, you had to grow the business but it had to be--grow it financially profitable.  And with expense control.  And I did that and at that time I guess I became agency manager in four and a half years and I don't think anybody ever done that much quicker than that.  And then I became vice president, they moved me to New York [New York] in 1974.
Story_ID: 260479
Speaker 1: They moved me to New York [New York] as a vice president, the head of manpower development in New York.  And I moved to Connecticut.
Speaker 2: That--so that was 1974?
Speaker 1: I was.  I moved here to move to New Canaan, Connecticut because that's where all the Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] people lived.  All the Equitable officers, president, CEO, they all lived in New Canaan but New Canaan had about four black kids in the whole school.  And my kids, I had three kids in high school and my son was only like eighteen months old and so I wouldn't move there because there was just no black kids there.  And I moved to Stamford, Connecticut because they had more black kids.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  All right so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so I was there and I had an interesting life in New York.  I'd get off that train in the morning and the time I got to Grand Central Station [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York], my feet weren't even hitting the ground I was so hyped up and so pumped up about getting to work and getting involved in this thing.  And at first I had real trepidation cause I was wondering, could I make it in New York.  These guys in New York seemed so smart and these guys seemed so bright.  They would come to Detroit [Michigan], but then I found out afterwards they had all these people back there giving them information and giving them all the answers and (laughter) I enjoyed that very much.  It was a wonderful experience I had.  I then became the first black regional president and I had everything from Pennsylvania to Maine.
Speaker 2: So what year was that?
Speaker 1: In 1975.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's pretty quick.  Okay, '75 [1975] all right.
Speaker 1: And then, we became a senior vice president of the company, the first black, no I was the second black senior vice president.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: In nineteen wow, when was that '89 [sic. 1983] I guess it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's something.  Now when did you retire?
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998].
Story_ID: 260480
Speaker 1: What would you consider as the highlight of your career with Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial]?
Speaker 2: I think there are many highlights.  Very honestly.  The things that I remember most is winning the President's Trophy.  My brother was a fabulous Equitable guy and at one time, the [HistoryMaker] Darwin [N.] Davis [Sr.] agency in Detroit, Michigan was in--one of the top three agencies in the United States and the top two district managers in the whole United States out of nine hundred district managers where my brother and another guy named Lee Neal who remembers the Darwin Davis agency.  We built a big, big very rich organization in Detroit.  And it was so well done that the Equitable broke it--kind of broke it up and sent me to New York [New York], sent my brother to Detroit, sent Lee Neal to Los Angeles [California] and sent Lee to Los Angeles.  And that organization--the leadership cross the country for people in the Equitable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a great experience.  I had a great life in corporate America that I enjoyed very much.  Because it was an opportunity to really make a difference in people.  And to help a lot of black people get jobs.  I controlled a lot of that and I could do that in a way that was profitable to them and to the company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So everybody won.
Story_ID: 260481
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about some of the oppositions.  There's got to be some corporate opposition to the rise of the first black individual in a number of different capacities at which you served so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was the first black line officer who was there.  We had had other--a couple of other vice presidents who was there, but then I was the first line officer.
Speaker 1: Now you know when you say, you were the first in a number of different areas.  And I think a lot of people don't understand what that really means.  That means you kind of take the brunt of a lot of things that other people don't behind you.
Speaker 2: Yes, because.  Yes, because you're bottom line person.  I mean the United States is divided into six parts and I ran one of those parts.  The company [Equitable Life Insurance Society of America; AXA Financial] couldn't have a great year, because I ran the East Coast, which was the most populous, the most profitable part.  And, you know, if I had a failing year, the whole company would have a major negative impact on the company.  So but it was very good.  We did good.  And but there were people who were very--who were not--I remember sitting once--we were in St. Louis [Missouri] at a meeting and the guy says, "[HistoryMaker] Darwin [N. Davis, Sr.] you know you really, you'd done good, you're smart."  And I said, "Oh, thank you why do you say that."  He said, "Well you've taken advantage of this affirmative action stuff and you know, you're--."  I said, "What are you saying?"  He said, "Well, you know, you've taken advantage of it and this affirmative action has really been good to you."  I said, "Oh I see, well let me ask you a question - do you think I've been good for the business or what are you saying?"  Well he was saying, that you know, that I really didn't deserve all of this, that because of affirmative action, I did all this.  And that was true, but the result was--affirmative action got me in there, but the result of it was not the affirmative action.  I had the same goals and same assigned things that everybody else had.  And I met them all and passed them.  And I was very disheartened that he said this to me and told him so.  I said you know, we're in a hotel, and I said, you know if these windows were opened I would probably push you out of one of them.  He looked at me, you know, I was just running my mouth talking.  But I remember that very well.  I remember that very well the guy, I remember him do this and said it.  It was, you know, very, very disturbing thing to me but you had a lot of people who even then and even now.  People, if when you're black, people discount your education, and they discount your things that you do.  They don't really give you the full credit.  If you went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], they discounted, they discounted you're going to Harvard.  They say well you probably went on affirmative action.  He got in there, you know.  I mean it still happens even today and but I tell young people, don't go, don't worry about that, just go ahead and do it, become better than everybody else.  And that takes care of all of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of reverse of what reality is.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I guess they see because you're black, you've been like, slid along (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Without having to do anything, when you know that it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You have to do twice as much.
Story_ID: 260482
Speaker 1: I had many Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] people work on my staff (laughter) and I'm from little ole Arkansas [Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  Well I don't think that matters at all, but it mattered to them more than it did me.  And I've had--I remember, we were skiing and a guy in Pennsylvania said to me, "You know [HistoryMaker] Darwin [N. Davis, Sr.],"; we were sitting at the top of the mountain.  Leaned over to me and said, "Darwin you know something," he said, "I really respect you," he said, "you know, I don't even notice that you're black."  Now he meant that as a compliment to me.  And I said, "Well what do you mean by that?"  He said, "You know, I just never think about whether you're black or not or white or whatever you are, because you just, you do good--you're here, you're my boss and you're really getting the job done and I respect that."  And I said, "Well thank you."  I said, "But you know, I am black, and there can be not much mistake of that because I'm big and I'm black and I'm, you know, here."  And he said, "Yeah I know, but I never think about you that way."  Well he meant that as a real compliment and I took it that way.  But I think that it's, you know we've got to get past, even worrying about that I think we got to get past, and he was past it I think.  He really was accepting me.  You know, one of the things I found, when I was a regional guy, head of the region, I had thirty organizations, thirty agencies that I had to visit and travel to.  One of the biggest things that you have problems with is people don't want their--when you're in a sales organization like I was, golf was a big thing and so that I played golf so they would always take me to their golf club, as they would the people who were before me.  Well taking me to their country club, presented a little bit of a problem to them because, some of them, only some, did not want to tell people they worked for a black guy.  I mean they just didn't want to do that.  And I could always tell because they would introduce me, this is my associate from New York City [New York, New York], this is my, this is a guy with our company [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial], this guy he's with the company in New York [New York] and you know, something like that.  And I would never say anything, it would be fine.  But I would always, you know I would always find a way. I'd say later on after we, you know, the lunch or whatever it was, I'd say you know, "We George [ph.] is a great guy and we really are expecting big things from him.  We're looking for big things from him.  He's doing a great job."  And they'd say, "Oh, well are you his boss?"  I'd say, "Oh no George doesn't have a boss he's just, you know, we don't need to talk about bosses."  Well they knew then I was his boss.  They would say, (laughter) "Oh George you didn't say this is your boss," (laughter).  You know and I would just laugh.  I would just, you know.  But and also, they didn't want their in-laws to know they worked for a black.  It was amazing to me and I observed this many, many times.  Their in-laws, they didn't want their in-laws to know they worked for a black guy.  It was just one of those funny things.  And they would try very hard not to reveal that.  But you know, these are things that never bothered me that much, because hey I was there.  I wasn't going any place and I was the one who had the responsibility to produce the desired result and consequently, I didn't worry a lot about it.
Story_ID: 260483
Speaker 1: But there were many, many things that happened that you know you think about it.  A lot of times you think about it afterwards.  What did so-and-so mean by that, what was that about?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's kind of a social, a social waters that are untested and--
Speaker 1: You see, I always found that when you, in the beginning--blacks in the beginning, the biggest problem is that you don't get the same information that everybody gets.  And you don't get it when they get it.  And there is no one for you to go and sit and talk to.  You got to figure it out for yourself.  In the beginning, in the beginning.  And I think that there's mistakes we made with our kids.  We told them look, we've done all the head bumping and all the stuff you got to get an education now.  There's blacks doing everything in all these big corporations and all you got to do is go and get a good education and you'll get a good job.  Well that wasn't quite true.  I mean the same thing is happening as companies have had to recede back and tighten up.  I mean the same thing has happened to young people that happened to us a long time ago for different reasons maybe, but they're still happening.  And consequently it's still very difficult for jobs for black people who are highly qualified.  Highly because you see in a corporation, you come there, you get the education, you go to the right schools, you do all the things you're supposed to do and you get a job and you work there ten years, something's supposed to happen. You're supposed to move up.  But you find that blacks were not moving up.  And blacks were very discontented.  They were very sour on corporate America because they had done all the things they're supposed to do, and they were not being moved up through the corporation as they should have been.  This created real problems.
Story_ID: 260484
Speaker 1: Do you remember when the first black women were hired at Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial]?
Speaker 2: I sure do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I sure do.  Dorothy Orr, was the first black woman vice president at the Equitable.  And she was a, she lives in Westchester [Connecticut] here and she was a very dynamic woman who had worked for, I think, the governor, and our CEO had met her before and she came to work there and she was very, very good.  But, I remember the first black women very well.  Black women did very well there.  Women period did very well there.  As a matter of fact, much of the movement in America was the women's movement, surpassed the movement that blacks had.
Story_ID: 260485
Speaker 1: Still do, even today, work very hard to getting more blacks in corporate America.  I'm on the board of Pepsi-Cola [PepsiCo].  The African American Advisory Board of Pepsi-Cola and one of the big things we talk about is getting good people, getting the best people at Pepsi to do the different jobs we have there and I find it very invigorating, find them to be a very advanced company who is (yawning) solidly committed to bringing in the best people they can find to do those jobs.  I'm very involved in that.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what other boards are you involved with.  I know you have a lot of volunteering activities too.
Speaker 1: The Albert [G.] Oliver Program [Oliver Scholars Program, New York, New York], which is a program when I retired from the Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America], my, I had this big dinner and people paid to come to it and we raised $135,000 for the Albert G. Oliver Program.  We've sent over seven hundred black and Hispanic kids to the best private schools, private high schools, in this part, in the East Coast.  The very best schools, you name them [Phillips] Exeter [Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire] all of them.  We've sent over seven hundred kids to those school.  We've done a good job with that.  And, I just really, you know, I've been very involved in the [National] Minority Golf Foundation, the Bill Dickey Golf Foundation [Bill Dickey Scholarship Foundation], these are helping young black and Hispanic kids get college educations.  The Jackie Robinson Foundation, I've been very involved in that for a long time.  The Executive Leadership Council which just honored me this year, with sort of a lifetime achievement award.  The Alvaro L. Martins [Heritage Award], lifetime achievement award and something that I am very proud of having.
Speaker 2: You said earlier, you were the president of the Jesse Owens Foundation--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --for a while, too.
Story_ID: 260486
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I have several.  I hope that the day will come and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] said it, you know, I'll just--listen to me try to say it better than he said it, that the day will come when people are recognized by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.  You know it's a devastating thing to be.  When you're black, all your life, there's a built in thing that says, I wonder if my color is going to have anything to do with this?  When you go apply for a job or for anything, you always wonder, I wonder if my being black's going to have anything to do with this, whether I get it or not.  And you just have that question you ask.  You know, you can't let it get to be so bad that it destroy you (clearing throat).  You can't let it destroy you, but you've got, you still wonder.  You wonder, I wonder is that going to be a thing.  But my hopes and aspirations are that young people will have an opportunity, I worry about the young people.  I worry about the opportunities they're gonna have.  I worry about whether they are going to be able to get into the colleges and get out of them.  I wonder if they are going to be able to go into a business.  I wonder if they are going to be hired by corporations and have the ability and the opportunity to move up in those corporations.  I wonder about that.  I worry about that as a matter of fact.  But, but, I'm encouraged.  I feel, I feel good that what's gonna happen in America.  I feel that it's gonna happen.  I think people are going to do well.  Our people.  And I think that they really have an opportunity and I do worry about it because it's so important for the financial wellbeing of black families in America.  Black families are hurting.  And black families need to have opportunity.  Opportunity is the one thing that we've got to make sure that people have.  And I do everything I can every day to see if I can get people opportunities to do bigger things than what they're doing.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done this far, thus far, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: You know the only thing, and I've said this many times.  The only thing I'd do differently, I would get--I would have gotten a law degree.  Not to practice law, but just to have it to have a better understanding of the law.  As bad as it seems, we're not a lawless society even though sometimes it seems we are.  But I think if you have a law degree, you really get a chance to have a better understanding of how things work and how they're put together and how you can take them apart or do whatever you need to do.  And that's one thing I would definitely do.  If I had a chance to do it over, I would definitely get a law degree.  But that's about all I can think that I would really you know, want to do differently.

Speaker 1: Did your father [Abner Davis] get a chance to?  Well, you were a teacher in school, I guess, when your father died, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father died, I was teaching school.  He never got a chance to see all these things that happened to me.  You know, I won all the awards.  You can see all the things up here that I've won and done.  And I always, you know, let me tell you, regrets, my biggest regret is probably my kids didn't know my father.  My kids never knew my father.  My oldest daughter was like just a few months old when he died and my other kids, they didn't know him at all.  They don't know anything about him, except what we've told them.  But you know, my wife [Velmarie Davis] didn't know him.  I mean I wished they all would have because, he was just one heck of a guy.  I mean I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think you told us this story off camera about him driving to Texas to see you, I mean driving to Arkansas and then taking a bus to Texas just to see you play ball [football] that one last time.
Speaker 2: That's correct, he was very supportive of everything I did.  That all of us did.  He went to homecoming every year, watched me play football.  And my last college football game [at Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], he drove to Arkansas by himself, just him, and then the coach [Leroy Moore] let him ride the bus with us to Texas, so he could see the game.  I mean he just was, man he was just with us.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would hope that people will see me, and I think they do, as a guy who cared and a guy who wanted to help people.  All people, but especially black people.  To help them and their families have a bigger, better, more wonderful opportunity in life.  I've worked hard at that.  It's important to me.  And I have tried to improve that in people's lives.  All people's lives.

Speaker 1: Your mother's [Marrietta Todd Davis] still alive, she's ninety-one you say?
Speaker 2: Ninety-two.
Speaker 1: Ninety-two, okay.
Speaker 2: She's ninety-two, she lives in Flint, Michigan in fact I just left seeing her last week.  I'm gonna see her again next week.  I try to see her once a month, if I can, and I'm not always able to do that, but I try.
Speaker 1: She's had a chance to see the bigger success I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh she's been everywhere with me.  She's been all over the world with me.  And, she just loves it.  She loves it.  She's a very proud mother.  Very proud (laughter).
Speaker 1: So she's glad you didn't stay in Flint and work in the factory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She's very, very proud of me.  She, all you got to be around is a couple of minutes and you'll know that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sometimes she embarrasses me.  I say okay mom, that's good, that's good.
Story_ID: 260491
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd liked to be remember as the guy, as I said, who really cared about people all people and especially black people.  I really--that's important to me.  I've done a lot of things.  Well my wife [Velmarie Davis] was the same way.  We've done all kinds of things to help people.  We've taken people in our home and let them live for a while.  We've loaned people money who we knew weren't going to get it back.  But we knew they needed it.  And we've been stupid in a couple of things, but that's okay, you know that all goes with it.  But, it's important to be help with it.  I think the price we pay for the space we occupy on earth is that we have the obligation to help when there's an opportunity.  And, we always have an opportunity to help, and we are really involved in trying to do that.  My wife is very involved in several charitable organizations and I am too.  And we feel very good about that.

Speaker 2: That is a centerfold spread of Newsweek magazine.  Book ['The Rage of a Privileged Class,' Ellis Cose], it was written by [HistoryMaker] Ellis Cose and I was one of the features of that.  Of that magazine talking about the rage of the privileged.  That's when I was telling you earlier that blacks were disenchanted, and they went to the right schools, they got the right degrees, they did all the things they were supposed to do and ten years later, something's supposed to happen and it wasn't happening.  And as it says there, there was a lot of frustration among young black managers.  Not as it was thirty years ago because they feel disenfranchised.  That's Newsweek magazine.

Felix is--became a lawyer and a treasury agent.  He died just two years ago.  But he was a tremendous football player and we were co-captains of that team.  This was given to me as a result of a nice little contribution that I made to my school and they sent me this and I thought it was just wonderful they did
