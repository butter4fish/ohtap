Story_ID: 616566
Speaker 1: Let's start by talking about your, your family--your family history.  Tell me your mother's name, tell me where she was born and when she was born, if you know, and tell me about her.
Speaker 2: Okay, so my mother's name is Mary Princess Howard Edmonson [Mary Howard Edmonson].  And she was born April 25, 1929 in Dallas, Texas.  But she came here with my grandmother [Jessie Howard] when she was six months old to Denver, Colorado.  So we're just about to celebrate--we celebrate her seventy-ninth birthday.  So probably by all basic means, she is a Denverite, she's a second generation Denverite.  And so as I say, she raised in Denver.  She played the piano, she was very talented piano player.  And she's got these beautiful long hands and they would tell me how, "Your mama was playing piano for the junior choir when she was eight or nine years old."  And it's funny because people used to tell me, "You look just like your mama."  I can never see it.  And I would even have her picture up in the mirror (gesture) and I'm like no, unh-uh.  And then one day I was washing dishes and I was washing my table, and I looked at my hands, I'm like, my mama's hands.  I got my mother's hands.  And then when I saw it in her hands, I saw it in her face, 'cause she's got these long fingers just like I do, such that she could play.  I wanted to play the piano, but I just couldn't click up fast enough, you know.  It was like when I started she was already--she was a child prodigy, a musical prodigy.  And she played in the Baptist church choir, like I said, when she was eight years old for the senior choir and then through high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado].  And she went to Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University] in Tuskegee, Alabama.  And she wanted to pursue music.  But in those days, you know, that was the late '40s [1940s] I guess, it was really designed for women to be more practical, you know.  So my grandmother insisted that she did home economics and--or that women would be nurses or that they would be schoolteachers.  And you know, my grandmother thought that the only life that she could live as a musician would be one that would be buck wild, you know.  So she's like no, you can't do that.  So it's kind of interesting how you squash somebody's dream.  So she did three years in home economics and she, she came home after her junior year, you know, with my brother.  He was, he was her graduation gift (laughter).  His name is Dempsey Alexander Pugh, Jr. [Dempsey Pugh, Jr.].  And so she came back to Denver, you know, she got married, she had my brother and she wanted to complete this, this one year or even, I don't know, maybe it was one semester that she had left so that she could continue her education.  And she applied to like University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], University of Colorado, and do you know that they--you know, any time you transfer from one university to another that there is that question of getting your credits.  They would not give her one credit, not one college credit because it was a historically black college [HBCU].  Now you would think a person gone three and a half years that they would at least get one credit for showing up, you know.  So--I mean it completely zeroed out the meter.  So she was very dis- dis- discouraged by that, and, and so she went into public service and she worked for the Lowry Air Force finance center [at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado] and, and retired through working in military pay.
Story_ID: 616567
Speaker 1: And she still played piano for the church, you know.  And then she had two more children, myself and my younger brother [Lloyd Pugh].  So she ended up having three children: two born on Halloween, my brother and myself, and--my younger brother and myself, and my first born brother [Dempsey Pugh, Jr.] was born on the 4th of July.  So, he's a firecracker too.  So she's, she's still--she's alive and very vibrant and very creative.  She loves water aerobics, as long as she keeps moving, you know, I'm, I'm encouraged.  You know, I have no excuse for not moving my body.  My whole family actually loves water aerobics, and--as a way of, of staying fit, you know.  The same way with my Aunt Lizzie Mae [ph.], my aunt, she's the same way.  She's in Dallas [Texas].  And you know, I woke up this morning, my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson] was going to the water aerobics, but I was trying to get ready for this interview, but I just appreciate her consistency in that way.  And she's just a very creative cook, a very creative spirit.  I always think that if she had chosen music--you know, and I think many of our mothers coming from that period had that creative space that they had to find alternative ways to express their, their creativities.  I think it's Alice Walker who has a essay about in our mother's garden ['In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens'], and to say in those posse of creative women who, you know, could've painted the pictures and done the spoken word or played the music end up having to bring their creativity into their family and dressing a fine table and, and, and doing a beautiful garden as a way of expressing your creativity and I think that's where she stood too, yeah.
Story_ID: 616568
Speaker 1: You also speak about your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: So my mother's mother is named Jessie Naomi Howard [Jessie Howard] and she is from Dallas, Texas.  And there's this controversy about when she was born, but somewhere between 1909 and 1911.  And you know, in those days they didn't really have a clear grip on the exact day it was.  But--and she was born on May 15th; she was a Taurus.  And she, she raised up in Dallas, Texas.  She was an only child, and, and, and it's interesting to see how our family grows.  So my mother [Mary Howard Edmonson]--so my grandmother was an only child and then she had two children: my mother and my uncle.  Then each of them had three children.  And my oldest brother [Dempsey Pugh, Jr.] has five.  I don't have any children, but he made up for me, (laughter) that's what I say.  But she--her education probably went to the elementary school, like seventh or eighth grade.  And she had an injury.  She had an experience of having a gunshot wound to her leg when she was twelve years old.  And she was hospitalized for two years and then she wore a brace from her ankle up to her hip for the rest of her life.  And--but the way she moved with it, you know, at least until her older days you would've never even noticed that she had a brace on and it was never really an issue for her in terms of the way she got around.  We used to think as kids, we could out run her, it was like unh-uh, don't even think about it.  She was very resourceful, very--that's another creative spirit, very resourceful spirit.  She left Dallas when she was like twenty years old and she did not look back.  It was like, hm, it was almost fifty years--well no, she went back when my mother turned eighteen.  They were driving through Dallas to take my mother to, to Tuskegee, Alabama [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University].  And then the next time it was fifty years, you know.  So, there was something about her--like when she left, you know, some--she said that's all she wrote, the pencil's broke (laughter).  When she left Dallas she was done.
Story_ID: 616569
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she share any stories about her growing up or about her parents?
Speaker 2: Not as many.  That was a cr- that was a curiosity for us.  Like her, she was an only child and her mother had three brothers.  So there was Uncle Clint [ph.] and Uncle Prince [ph.], and I got a sense about her mother.  In those days they talk about passing, who could ac- she could actually pass for white, my [maternal] great-grandmother, her name is Mary.  Something about the naming tradition is interesting, like I'm Opalanga Donna Jessie [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh] and my mother is Mary [Mary Howard Edmonson].  Her mother is Jessie Naomi Howard [Jessie Howard] and my great-grandmother is Mary.  And they say there's another Jessie back there.  So we've been doing this Jessie, Mary, Jessie, Mary thing, which is kind of interesting flow in terms of the women whose shoulders I stand.  But my great-grandmother, Mary, she, she worked as a domestic for white families.  Her creativity was sewing.  And my grandmother would just tell the stories how, you know, Mama could--she'd go shopping with the rich white folk and she'd see what they got in there--in their--in the stores and she'd come back and she'd sew it up, you know, that she was a fashion plate.  And, and particularly that she was wearing this brace, you know, it was an extra special way of being that she had the latest fashions, you know, and that my great-grandmother was able to be creative in the way she sewed and that she didn't miss a beat with that.  And then eventually she moved to Arizona and she stayed here a short time.  I, I, I knew her up until I was eight years old, you know, before she died.  But she was, and this is Mary Mitchell [ph.], my great-grandmother.  She was probably the one for me who, who in our family really held the love, really had big heart, had big compassion, had a way of touching your, your spirit and, and comforting in a way that my grandmother was not able to be.
Story_ID: 616570
Speaker 1: She was more of a warrior, you know, and she was--you know, she'll protect you.  They say that, you know, it's wiser for you to challenge the dogs that guard the gate of hell then to mess with Jessie gr- Jessie Howard's grandchildren, you know.  So she brought the fire and she brought that protection.  But she wasn't too much about, "Come on up here and give me a hug," you know.  I remember one time I said, "Well Mama do you love me?"  And she's like, "Psh, do I love you?  (Makes sound) You got shoes on your feet, you know, you got clothes on your back, you ain't never miss a meal, what you talking that jack lady crazy stuff, I mean, what--?"  You know, so it was like that.  But I said well maybe I should've just asked for a hug, you know (laughter), just straight up.  But my [maternal] grandmother, Jessie, she married a man who was twenty years older than her, and his name was Ernest Howard [ph.].  When she moved to Denver [Colorado] she met him.  He was twenty years older than her.  He owned a hardware store on Five Points and Welton [Street] here in Denver.  And she would always say, "You know, it's so much better to be an old man's sweetheart then a young man's fool."  And she, she had a good life, you know.  She, she was the only child and then she married a man who was twenty years older than her who, who pampered her, and you know, so she was kind of used to, to having her way.  And when he died, he left her with a big house on 2076 Ogden Street in Denver, and it was the biggest house on the block and it had three stories.  And so we stayed on the ground floor and we rented out the second and the third floor.  So she was like the landlord, she was the landlady, you know, and she knew how to make a way out of no way.  You know and so do we.  My two brothers [Dempsey Pugh, Jr. and Lloyd Pugh] and I were raised, you know, at least until I was in high school [East High School, Denver, Colorado] in her care, and we had to be resourceful.  So I mean by the time I was eight, ten, eleven years old, I mean, I knew how to paint, I knew how to steam wallpaper off of a wall.  I knew how to pull linoleum up off the floor so when the renters moved out and you know, the next ones moved in, we knew what, what to do.  She loved to fish, we would fish every day in the summer.  We'd catch night crawlers at night, you know, to help assist that process.  And she was also a foster parent for the State of Colorado.  So, we always had--she started off like having--caretaking babies, you know.  And during that time, it was just so many babies of mixed heritage, you know, it was just amazing how we would just throw away our children, you know, in such a way.  Because the lines were drawn racially, you know, so, so tight.  So there were a lot of white girls who were with black boys whose parents was like not having it and you're not having this child.  And so we caretaked and you know, took care of a lot of children of mixed heritage.  And so I had a lot of parenting and nurturing experience growing up too, almost I think beyond my age.  My grandmother was probably, probably the first male chauvinist that I ever met.  (Laughter) She believed that the women's work was in the house and the men's work was outside, and you know, you should be chopping wood and the women should be in the house.  So like, you know, we--like I say we were in 2076 Ogden which is very inner city and there was no wood to be chopped, but there was plenty of work in that house and you know, plus taking care of those children.  We like--, "What you want for Christmas?"  I'm like I wanna sister you know (laughter).  I want some back up in here, a white flag, you know.  But I mean, she--again we would fish every day in the summer.  I remember her buying twenty-five live chickens at one time and dressing those chickens.  I mean it--and she would just either swing them around, you know, (gesture) (makes sound) pop their neck or put them down for the broomstick and pull their feet and you know, they'd be running all around the yard splaying blood everywhere.  And that part was--(laughter) we'd always be running, I mean it be funny now, I'm laughing, but it was kind of like scary then.  But we had to pick and pluck a lot of chickens.  We had to clean a lot of fish.  I remember my brother and I carrying this cooler down the alley selling carp and crappie and catfish, you know, fifty cent a piece, you know, for a fish.  And so we were resourceful, I mean she de- designed us to be, you know, resourceful and responsible.  We would sell night crawlers for god's sake, you know.  So it was an interesting--and then like I said, my grandpa owned this hardware store, so that repair it yourself, make it, fix it, paint it, you know, handle it was kind of a working family that I came out of, you know.  It was like, you know, you're responsible, you're self reliant.  You know, we weren't raised to depend on anybody else.
Story_ID: 616571
Speaker 1: Now during this time, you were living with your [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard], what was your mother [Mary Howard Edmonson] doing? What type of work was your mother doing?
Speaker 2: So she was--she was in the city and she'd started, I think, working at Fitzsimons Army Hospital [Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, Aurora, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So most of her work has been in--in public service working for the government.  She ended up in military pay, but at that time she was working and, and I think because it started out because she was working kind of weird hours and--in the dietician, nutrition, you know, she tried to get her--go back to school, but they didn't take any of her credits from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and she was in this home economic program.  So she was trying to get the dietician, nutrition piece, and she ended working at the hospital.  And I remember her telling me stories working at that hospital, how--and even in Tuskegee, part of that Tuskegee experiment of working with men who had gonorrhea and that was that experiment to see how it progressed unchecked.  And she had a lot of stories about her experience there, and then even coming here to Denver [Colorado] working in the hospitals.  You know, just working with men who came from the war [World War II, WWII] or had, you know, diseases that we didn't think of like consumption or what they call bad blood, and she was--had a lot of exposure.  You know, I remember stories that she would tell like that.
Speaker 1: Did she speak specifically about anything that happened during the Tuskegee experiment?  And I think that was syphilis [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]--
Speaker 2: It--yeah, yeah, it wasn't gonorrhea, it was syphilis (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was syphilis.
Speaker 2: Right.  Just--there was a sadness, you know, about, you know, how they call it bad blood.  And how they had touched--they had cycles of, of when they would care for these people and they had them on a specific ward, you know.  And how their rotation would come, you know, periodically, how everybody had to serve on that ward.  And then also, you know, she was just saying how the families were like so dependent on whatever small compensation they were given the families while their husbands were actually going through this untreated experience.  And, and she was saying how it began to--how--have their limbs to deteriorate and their extremities, their, their fingers and their lips, and, and how they had to be so careful in washing them and taking care of them, and, and it was pretty graphic and, and, and painful is what I remember of some of her stories, you know, to be.  And I don't think she got the full impact of what that was until many years, I--many people didn't, you know, get it.  But to get, oh my god, that's what happened and I was there and a part of that, you know.  So on retrospect it, it was a big oh, wow, you know, it's amazing.
Story_ID: 616572
Speaker 1: You also spoke about your grandmother--[maternal] great-grandmother, Mary Mitchell [ph.], that she could pass.  Do you know about her lineage going beyond that--your--like your great-great-great parents--grandparents (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So she had some Native American in her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know what distinct tribe, I think most black people joke and say we got from the Blackfeet (laughter).  The--, "Yeah, she's Blackfoot."  But, it was on a reservation where this, this accident that caused my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] to have this wound in her leg.  And the story was like her uncle was cleaning a gun that dislodged, the shotgun had dislodged in an accident, she was shot in the--in her leg--in her left leg and they were on a reservation.  And there was another piece how not having the adequate care, you know, and then finally getting to a hospital and you know, I think she did have some good, if like it had been cared for sooner or more adequately or something--but something about on a reservation.  So I know that there is some Native American in the lineage.  But I also judge that there must be some European for her to be able to pass, you know, and she had very soft hair, and she was--she was very light complected.  She would--but they said if she put her hat on then she, she could go into the stores where most black people couldn't go at that time, you known, they had the little paper sack test or whatever.  But she, she, she--they thought she just was this nice little white lady, you know, but then you saw her hair, you know, her hair was like it was soft, but it was sure enough soul sister number one.
Story_ID: 616573
Speaker 1: Well let me just ask you, with all of these strong women in your, in your history and your genealogy, what characteristics do you think that you've gotten from each one of them?
Speaker 2: Hm, well that's a good one.  My [maternal] great-grandmother, Mary Mitchell [ph.], I would like to think that there's a piece of her compassion, a piece of her tender love that--that I carry and that I thirst for.  And I think that would be her gift.  Her daughter Jessie [Jessie Howard], my grandmother, like I said she carried a lot of warrior energy.  And I think I'm still learning--actually I kind of pull away from warrior energy 'cause hers was really big.  But now I get to see the value of it, you know, 'cause warrior energy is really just about learning how to set boundaries, you know.  So now she's on the other side.  When she was alive I was just kind of like, whoo too much fire, you know.  But now I--I find myself calling on her energy to show me how to be more warrior like in terms of being able to set boundaries.  To set boundaries in my life, you know, with other people, you know.  I'm mean 'cause sometimes I'm--I, I just--I want to be everywhere and do everything for everybody and it's just like not humanly possible.  And I'm at a stage in my life where physically my body is like, no baby girl this not gonna work.  So I'm learning how to say no.  I mean how many ways can you say no?  "No, you know, I really like to, but no thank you."  You know, "Yeah it sounds like a good idea, but not today," you know.  So I'm trying to develop a vocabulary so bring some of that compassion from my Great-grandmother Mary and sprinkle on that fire energy, you know, from my Grandmother Jessie, and even how to set boundaries, you know, with myself, you know in terms of living with more rigorous spiritual daily disciplines, you know.  So that's, that's the warrior energy too.  'Cause when she set her mind on something, it was on, you know.  So she--she kind of brought that warrior energy.  My mother Mary [Mary Howard Edmonson], so my Great-grandmother Mary, my Grandmother Jessie, my mother Mary, she is--she's kind of like that, you know, the tortoise and the hair, she's kind of like that tortoise, she just keep going and going and going and going, and almost to the point where I'm like Mom you gotta relax 'cause I'm, you know, trying to learn how to slow it down but if I, I, I need a little more few models to show what that looks like, you know, in terms of self care.  But she's, she's kind of got that no matter what energy that just keeps going, you know, whatever needs to happen you just do the next thing, you just do the next thing that needs to happen, just do the next thing.  So she's kind of got that stick to it kind of energy that I think is, is a gift.  That I'm, you know, having to shape--you know, you have to shape it, you know, so that it fits for your--each personality that it fits for me like medicine.
Story_ID: 616574
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about your father.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me his name, where and when he was born?
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this is gonna be interesting split 'cause I got two dads.  My birth father, his name is John Harris and he was born I think in 1929 in Caldwell, Kansas.  And he, he was the second graduate from the University of Colorado School of Pharmacy.  And so he had that experience of being the Negro first and also one of the first to have his own pharmacy here in Denver [Colorado] on 34th Avenue, which is Bruce Randolph [Avenue] now.  And then also he had--well he worked there first and then he owned his own pharmacy on 20th [Avenue] and Grant Street in Denver.  And that was a, a major thing in that time, you know, being a part of the Rexall drug pharmacy system.  And so he did--he did very well in that regard.  He and my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson] never married and I actually didn't meet him 'til I was like sixteen years old.  But I met his family and eventually we came--in fact his family, you know, his sister who I knew as Ms. Florene [Florene Harris] and, and her son Jay [ph.] lived in my [maternal] grandmother's [Jessie Howard] house as one of our renter--our roomers upstairs.  And they lived there for about, maybe six years.  And it wasn't until some years later that I found out that Ms. Florene and her son Jay was like Aunt Florene and my cousin Jay, you know.  So you know how that rolls with black families, but we came together and I got a chance to meet him.  I have an adopted brother and you know, I got to really meet the extended part of the family and I don't know them all, you know, very well, but enough to, to know, you know, where my roots come from.  And his--he has another sister who graduated from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], so there's a lot of Tuskegee energy.  Her name is Josephine Harris [ph.], my Aunt Josephine, and she was the one who had the gap tooth.  When I saw that gap tooth, I'm like that's the one, because in my family's lore, they say that a person with a gap in their tooth is a sign of being a great liar.  So you can't imagine how that cost my self esteem, 'cause I very seldom smile openly or when I laugh I cover my mouth and you know, you could see pictures like after my kindergarten class, class picture, I had very few pictures smiling openly to show my gap.  And, and it was kind of interesting because my mother had a gap and when she left Tuskegee her graduating present to herself was to have her, her gap closed.  My grandmother had a gap and but when I met her she had pyria and she'd already had false teeth.  So well they were talking to me like they never had the gap.  I know you're lying with that gap up in your mouth, you know.  Yeah, so then I had the chance to go to Nigeria in West Africa, and there they say the person with a gap brings good luck, that they're the ones most likely to be the healers, the one most likely to bear twins and that they're very central, had plenty of sugar down there.  So I ask you, you know, being a choice of being of a liar or bringing the sugar, which line would you get in?  There it is.
Story_ID: 616575
Speaker 1: So tell me about your--you--we talked about your birth father [John Harris], so tell me about your stepfather, what was his name?
Speaker 2: So my stepfather's name is, is Thomas Henry Edmonson [Thomas Edmonson].  And he was born I think in 1925 in Gloster, Louisiana.  And he and my mother [Mary Howard Edmonson] are--will be celeb- they just celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary on October 4th, 2008.  And he came from a family of ten children and he grew up in Gloster and then they ultimately moved to Joplin, Missouri.  But he's got wonderful stories I think about growing up in the South.  And then just a resourcefulness of a family of ten children, you know.
Speaker 1: Share some of the stories he might have told you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Both, well both of my grandmothers are named Jessie, so his mother's name--my mother's mother's named Jessie [Jessie Howard] and his mother's mother's named Jessie [Jessie Edmonson], Mama Jessie.  And he would tell stories about how resourceful Mama Jessie was.  First of all, Mama Jessie eloped with his dad [Marlin Edmonson] and she's about three inches taller than his dad and, and just how fiery he was and she was engaged with someone else, and you know, how he just like sweet talked her out to elope with him and they end up having ten children.  And he was like a, a circuit preacher.  And I--this, this is my grandfather on my father's side, and they said every time he'd make his circuit and come back, you know, she'd get pregnant again.  And they began to say, you know, you might need another profession (laughter) after the ten kids.  But they had such creative ways of sustaining and taking care of themselves.  Like Mama Jessie was--she worked for the extension service and she taught other people how to can g- how to do canning.  She did quilting, she made butter, she, she would crochet in the winter and then sell in the summer.  And then my grandfather, he trained dogs for hunting.  And so people would bring their dogs down and he would teach them, you know, the, the setters how they would sit and you know, point out the birds and, and how they farmed and, and rotated the way that they farmed, and they would plant down in, in the riverbed and now at the end of the season, you know, the river would, would go down and they would plant and they, and they wouldn't even have to water all the vegetables that they grew because they would grow naturally and they'd have them late into the season.
Story_ID: 616576
Speaker 1: And then the quiet acts of resistance in a time of Jim Crow.  So, as in many black families, the minister often was the one who could read the most or who was the community activist or could represent people.  And often they would come to my grandfather just on even small things like do go--going to the store to buy a suit because they wouldn't allow them into the store or at least, you know, some of them were shy about negotiating for a suit.  So he would go in and maybe a suit at that time cost like twenty dollars or something.  And he would go in and, and they would say how--the salesperson would say, "Well what do you want boy?"  And he'd say, "The name is Edmonson."  And then he'd say, "Well what do you want."  He said, "I want a suit."  He said, "Well how much you wanna pay."  He said, "Well how much does it cost."  And he said, "Well look boy--."  And he'd tell him, "The name is Edmonson."  And they would go back and forth until he was able to negotiate this suit for a li- say instead of twenty dollars, fifteen, and then he would bring it back out to the person who sent him and then he'd give him a dollar or two dollars for that exchange.  And how he was able to actually make money on the side just by representing.  But the thing of how do you hold your pride in the face of, of that Jim Crow.  Just the small acts, you know, he wasn't like, "Look, man my name--I ain't no boy," you know?  He's like, "The name is Edmonson."  How he just began to teach people, you know, how to treat us.  And the message that--that would come out of our family is like we teach people how to treat us.  And that there're people who'll call you by a lot of names, but who you answer to will tell more about who you are.  And so, you know, he has a lot of stories that help us look at that dynamic.  And then, you know, just so many characters of, you know, the, the uncle who was the one who castrated hogs and sharpened the scissors and rode a, a French bike up and down the dusty roads in Gloster, Louisiana.  You know, just different characters.  He--he's, he's in the face of that shadow of resistance, you know.  He--and he tells the joke and I don't know if it's a joke or if it really happened, he was coming back from the war [World War II, WWII].  You go to the war and then come back in eight- in 1940s and having fought for America, but then returning and not even be able to use public transportation and being on a train in the South and the police on the train telling him that he need to give up his seat for a white person and him refusing.  And then they wanting to, to, to put him off the train or to interrogate him or to intimidate him.  And he said, "Look, I got--," he said, "I got a mother in heaven, I got a father in hell, and I got a sister in Dallas [Texas], and I'm gonna see somebody tonight," you know (laughter).  And you can choose 'cause, you know, this is where it stops.  So just meaning--you know, what that means to have some backbone, you know, in--in a period that was very oppressive for our people.
Speaker 2: What was your grandfather's name, was it Thomas also?
Speaker 1: He, he was Marlin G. Edmonson [Pugh's paternal step-grandfather, Marlin Edmonson].  And I don't know what that G was for, but the Reverend Marlin G.
Story_ID: 616577
Speaker 1: Did you spend time with them at all, your grandparents while they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have better memory of, of Mama Jessie [Pugh's paternal step-grandmother, Jessie Edmonson] in Joplin [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, and she--and what I appreciated about her, she had very Native American features.  Her hair was down the middle of her back and you know, she kind of had that profile, that Native American profile and she was a full bodied woman.  And I'm six foot, you know, and so she was just like oh man just--the most tallest beautiful woman, you know, I, I could have a memory of.  And she had this big bosom too, you know, so she was just like tons of fun.  And she always had great things to eat, you know.  She, she cooked for ten children so by the time the grandchildren came, we would, you know, be coming in from Colorado.  She made homemade rolls, the best, something called monkey bread.  And she--it was just like Chicken Licken, you know.  So that's what I remember the most about her.  And then her quilting, she was a quilter.
Speaker 1: Did she share any information about her growing up at all, do you know anything about how she grew up and what was her education like?
Speaker 2: I got a chance to go to our family reunion in Gloster, Louisiana where she grew up, and, and many of the--many of the family still own the, the land and they're still on the land and they have some oil thing going on where, you know, they'll get a little something in the mail, you know, from time to time.  And it was a very--it sounds like a sharecropping kind of background where they, they worked the earth, you know.  And, and on their land they also grew sugarcane and they had this machine where they could process the sugarcane to molasses.  And so they had this kind of thing where they had the mule to take it around like a grinder and they would stick the cane in there and it would squeeze it down and it would go from one thing to the next to make juice and then they would cook it and you know, until it bubbled up and then they bottle it.  They had this whole production where--in addition to the things that they grew to feed themselves.  But--and so either they would sell or barter for the things that they needed.  And, and Mama Jessie was the only girl and she had, I think, maybe five brothers, there was a whole slew of brothers and only one girl.  And so she, you know, they doted on her a lot, but as I said, you know, she, she also eloped to, to be with my grandfather [Marlin Edmonson].  And, and that was another in--in our mother's gardens 'cause she was very creative.  She used her creativity right where she was, you know, doing the quilting.  But she always wanted to go to school and she--and I think that was a sadness for her 'cause she didn't get to finish school.  And then even as an adult woman, she started to, you know, go back and take classes, but in the meantime she was teaching through the extension service, teaching women how to can and how to cook, and you know, how to crochet.  And--but I, I get it that she was one of those women who didn't get to finish her education in a way that--that her soul was calling her to be because she was married to a man who was a minister and you know, she was always, you know, juggling and she had ten kids.  So her creativity was her garden, was her quilting, was her food and you know, that's how it expressed.  But I get that there was a piece of her song that she didn't get to sing, you know.  And that might be just my judgment, but there's my story.
Speaker 1: What did you take away from her as far as a, a trade or a characteristic?
Speaker 2: She, she was a great juggler, you know.  She was a great juggler and she had a good balance I think of strength and grace, you know.  So on one hand, she you know, she had to be creative in terms of balancing all those children and you know, helping them.  But she was committed to education, you know.  And I, and I think what really drove her was her, her wanting to get the education that wasn't available to her, but she really pushed those children that she had to, to, to get their education.  So hers is a gift of balance, of strength, and grace, and a thirst for education.  That was the gift of Mama Jessie.
Story_ID: 616578
Speaker 1: So now your father [Pugh's stepfather, Thomas Edmonson] is one of the ten children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell me about his education, let's talk more about your dad?
Speaker 2: So he, he had it tough, he was the first born out of the ten and I think he might have did the sixth grade or the seventh grade.  And so he's got stories about plowing, you know, plowing the fields and mules farting in his face (laughter) and, and how he, he left, you know, he had to work for the family, you know, to help the family survive.  And then he had an opportunity to go to Houston, Texas and to be with his uncle who--he worked with his uncle and, and his uncle--and he went to school from there, you know.  So he did get a chance to do some schooling.  But he went into the [U.S.] military.  He didn't, he didn't graduate from high school, he went into the military and he did some time there, I don't know how long he was in the military before he came to Denver [Colorado] and then he met my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson].  He was fresh out of military when he met my mom and they got married.  So this has been like fifty years ago.  He worked most of his life, Pepper Packing Company [Denver, Colorado].  He was a butcher in a packinghouse.  And then when he retired from that job or they were downsized or the company closed down, he cooked, he was a chef for Sky Chef [Sky Chefs Inc.] that serves American Airlines.  So and that's how he finished that--that was his second career.  Now he's retired and they're benefitting from that, able to travel.  My mom loves to travel and they have done twenty-five cruises at least, you know, they love to cruise.  And, and it's really been a help, you know, for them to be able to travel at reduced rates across the country, so he's really glad he put that time in.  And he got his GED [General Educational Development] at age like sixty-nine or seventy, I think he was seventy years old.  He went back to school and he studied and he got his GED and he was like so proud, and we were so proud of him that he can actually sit down and read a book.  You know, I mean he's always been able to count money and sign his name, but you know, he had that drive.  So he fulfilled that piece and I still think that was Mama Jessie [Pugh's paternal step-grandmother, Jessie Edmonson] kind of pushing him, "Okay come on, baby boy, I don't care how old you are, you need to get your paper."  And he did, he did.
Story_ID: 616579
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Mary Howard Edmonson] and father [Pugh's stepfather, Thomas Edmonson] met?  How they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know that story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll have to ask.
Speaker 1: Now, you have how many siblings?
Speaker 2: I have two siblings.
Speaker 1: Tell me about them and tell me where you fall in line.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And tell me their names and just a little bit about who they are?
Speaker 2: My first brother, his name is Dempsey Alexander Pugh [Dempsey Pugh, Jr.].  And he's born 4th of July, 1949, and unfortunately he, he, he's deceased on November 4th, 2004.  So he's been--he made his transition four years ago.  But, you know, I still feel his presence with me now.  And him being the first born, he was kind of like the--he was the funny one.  He was--of the three of us, we all had our--I was--he was the funny one, I was like the serious one, and my baby brother was like the cute one, you know (laughter), in, in terms of how we showed up to, you know, I guess have our needs met.  And so him being the first born, he, he, he has longer memory of being with my, my [maternal] grandpa [Ernest Howard (ph.)] who owned the hardware store [in Denver, Colorado] and they have all these stories about how he started talking.  They say he started talking on the day he was born and he didn't shut up until (laughter) until it was over.  So he's like, if he came in here now, he was just like really outgoing, very endearing and you know, very big sense of humor, you know.  And almost so much humor where sometimes I felt like that, that statement that they say that black women raise their daughters and love their sons.  I remember we were having an argument, you know, 'cause I felt like sometimes he didn't take on his first born responsibility and like it fell on me, like I was all serious and like I had to be serious so that he could continue to go on and do it, it's your lazy brother ain't gonna do it, go on and do that, your brother's not gonna do--you do that, you know.  And I remember we had this argument and I'm like, "You took my laughter," you know.  And he's like, "What?"  (Gesture) "Have it back, baby," (laughter).  But sometimes I felt like, you know, because he had that ability to be, you know, gregarious and outgoing that he could actually slide through, you know, doing the homework and, and, and doing the chores and that, you know, it fell on me a lot.  And, and then I took it on too, I don't know, like that was--that was the way I had my needs met being the dutiful daughter, the obedient child, and responsible one.  And then my younger brother, his name is Lloyd Ernest Pugh [Lloyd Pugh], he's three years younger than me.  So we're all three years apart.  We have three children, three years apart, one on the 4th of July, and two on Halloween.  And my youngest brother, Lloyd, we always laugh about well who's a trick, who's a treat, and you know, (laughter) he's said, "Well you got here first."  But he's, he's, he's a responsible guy, he's a loving guy.  He works for United States Post Office [U.S. Postal Service], and he's real active in union politics.  He was the--probably the youngest president of the postal workers union in Colorado.  And he was the first black president of the postal workers union.  And he was--he's always work at the post office, you know, and so he's been there over I guess it's twenty-five years or so.  He's married, he has two children.  And he did some time in the [U.S.] Navy, that's, that's when he left.  Most of my brothers they stayed kind of close to the home front, you know, they did--.  My older brother he was in the service too for a short amount of time.  So I guess they both did about maybe three or four years in service and then they came back to Denver [Colorado].  I think I'm the only one who just, you know, just went around the world, just you know, got up out--and when I lived in Alaska I knew if I called on Sunday, particularly when the Broncos [Denver Broncos] were playing, called my mom's I could find both my brothers, their family, their children, they're at my mom's house, you know, 'cause they all love football, they're Bronco maniacs.  All of them, you know Bronco maniacs.  So I knew I could find, you know, I could find that hook up there, 'cause they just kind of rolled like that.  And he's very supportive, you know.  And I miss my older brother, you know, I really--I do--I, I call on him for, you know, if I were to say a gift, you know, just in the trend of the way you're asking I think is a sense of humor, you know.  Because there's something that's spiritual about humor 'cause you have to get it on a different level to see the funny in it, you know.  I mean there is a connection.  So he had a way of being able to tweak a situation that was like we thought was just like gravely serious and be able to get the lightness out of it.  And that--that's a gift, you know.  And, and I, I wish I had more of that.  Sometimes I think I could be terminally serious, you know (laughter).  I mean I like get my laugh on, but sometimes it, it gets kind of heavy, you know, 'cause I wanna know well what is the, you know, social redeeming quality behind it.  You know, my friends are like, "Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh] it's just a movie," you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 616580
Speaker 1: Let's go on now to talk about your childhood and growing up in Denver [Colorado].  Can you tell me your earliest childhood memory?  I'd say between--you know, from whenever you can remember?
Speaker 2: It's funny 'cause you know, the first thing that came to my mind was being in kindergarten [at Ebert Elementary School; Polaris Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] and being taller than my kindergarten teacher.  And it was like, "Wow, she's taller than Ms. Olka [ph.]."  Now, Ms. Olka was like an--Asian, you know, and I--they come in pint sizes, you know what I'm saying (laughter).  But what I got was like, "Wow she's taller than Ms. Olka."  And my birthday comes at the end of October so I was actually the youngest in the class, you know, 'cause I barely made that cut off, you know.  So I was always young--the youngest in the class and the tallest in the class.  And I think I just remember that, that--the embarrassment of that distinction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 616581
Speaker 1: Now tell me what school you attended?
Speaker 2: I attended Ebert Elementary School [Polaris Elementary School] in Denver [Colorado] on 23rd [23rd Street; Park Avenue] and Tremont [Place].  And I think it was probably an equal mix of Hispanic and African American, and maybe 20 percent white, but a lot of Hispanic and blacks.  And another memory that comes up is like, I remember I was so proud to become, what do they call--oh they call them color guards where you get this little stripe belt that you wear across your--and you put the flag up in the morning, you take down, and then you get to stand there when the lights change so that the people can cross the street safely.  And I remember coming back telling my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard], "I got--I'm on the color guard."  She said, "Oh they got colored cards?  That's so nice," (laughter) oh god.
Speaker 1: Was there a, a teacher in your elementary school--went from kindergarten to sixth grade, is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was there a teacher that might have been encouraging or someone that stands out in your mind in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you know, and that was a wonderful time to have black teachers in the--in the neighborhood, you know.  I think there's a double edge to integration.  'Cause one of the things about segregation you get to know the leadership in your community 'cause they were there.  And I guess one of the losses of integration is that they kind of moved out and you know, integrated was hard to find role models.  But I remember one was Ms. Sims [ph.], who was the librarian.  And to this day I remember how to be with a new book, you know, how to open it up and how to smooth down the pages on both sides so that you can actually be with a new book.  And, and the kind of the joy that she had like, you know, she held books like they were like her babies, you know.  And--but it left me with a respect for books and an appreciation for reading.  And then I remember Mr. Williams [ph.] and he was another African American, he was our music teacher.  And I remember him teaching us like the families in the orchestra, you know, the family of instruments and, and how they came to be.  And, and the first time of us doing this school trip of going to the, the symphony orchestra and being in, in the play festival.  But I remember being in--and, and how we had pack a lunch and I had this baloney sandwich and you know, kind of of greasy spots on the brown paper bag, you know, but we were just like going to the, the, the philharmonic, you know, symphony orchestra [Denver Philharmonic Orchestra], you know, it was such a big deal.  And then the other teacher was Ms. Jean Mingle [ph.] and two things about her.  She was the gym teacher, but she also got us into the play festivals.  They had festivals for all the stu- all the schools who participated that had different, maybe they'd have a theme like 'The Nutcracker' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky].  And then different schools would bring--they would do different dances, but they all came together on this one evening and it was a whole festival where it was just like this beautiful evening of color and music and dance, and--and different schools would put on different plays.  And I remember that I was too big, I wanted to be, you know, that "Nutcracker Suite" ["The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a"] and the sugarcane--the fairies.  I wanted to be a fairy, but they didn't have an outfit that was big enough for me.  And I don't remember how that worked, but I ended up being like an elephant.  And I don't remem- I remember she said, "Put your hands in front of your head and go like this," (gesture), you know, and I don't even think they had a role in there for an elephant, you know.  But I was conscious of like being oversized, you know, even at that young age.  And my family is tall, and when I'm with my family it doesn't feel like, it just feels like normal life, you know.  'Cause my dad [John Harris] was 6'2", my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson] is 5'10", 5'11".  My brother, my oldest brother [Dempsey Pugh, Jr.] he was a little bit short, he was 5'10", you know, which was considered short, 'cause my, my youngest brother [Lloyd Pugh] is like 6'3".  I have an uncle who is 6'7", you know, so were all pretty tall people.  My grandmother took sick and we went to the hospital to visit her one time and by the time the third person in our family came, they were just like (gesture), "Okay, yeah, room sixty-three."  (Laughter) You know they knew we were related.  So that was, that was the elementary school, you know, just the memories of some of the teachers there.
Story_ID: 616582
Speaker 1: And what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I, I loved school.  I, (pause) I was a very dedicated student because there was a lot of work at home, you know, and my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson]--my grandma [Jessie Howard] had all these babies and you know, it was like--I was like let me hurry up and get to school, you know.  So I did my homework, I made good grades.  And it was interesting 'cause I didn't find out until much later that I have ADD [attention deficit disorder], you know.  But I had this kind of memory where I could remember, you know, what it was--what, what the work was and then you know, pass the test without actually having developed good study habits.  But I had a quick mind and I could process information.  And so I brought home the A's, you know, I brought home the blue ribbons, you know.  I--you know, that was the place where I could shine.  And, and I did, I did pretty well with that method of learning, I mean until I got to, to college, you know, which is another story I can tell you about later, but I shined.
Speaker 1: Did you belong to any other organizations at school [Ebert Elementary School; Polaris Elementary School, Denver, Colorado]?  I mean was there the chorus or you, you talk about instruments, did you play an instrument at all?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't.  It was--that, that part of my life was pretty austere in terms of it was, you know, bring wood, carry water, you know, I mean it was really--I was kind of raised in a pretty strict household so when school was out it was like you come home.
Story_ID: 616583
Speaker 1: Tell me your earliest memory about your family, about family life?  What is your earliest memory about family life?
Speaker 2: Well I see Mama [Pugh's maternal grandmother, Jessie Howard] bringing them twenty-five chickens home and we processing them (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I see us fishing a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, going fishing a lot.  And, and we had, we had delightful Christmases I think and Thanksgivings.  The holidays were nice, you know.  I could smell, you know, the turkey cooking and bacon and the, and the dressing, and you know, that traditional fair.  The mashed potatoes and macaroni and cranberries, and always called on my Aunt Lizzie Mae [ph.] to get this recipe for eggnog and we've done that for like fifty years.  You'd think at some point, somebody would know the recipe.  But it's really just about connecting to Dallas [Texas] you know on that holiday, you know, just making that connection, you know.  'Cause it's really not about the recipe.  I finally got that, and I'm like, should I write that down?  And then also Sundays, you know, we get up in the morning and we'd always have Sunday clothes.  You know, you have Sunday clothes and then you have school clothes, and then you have everyday clothes, you know.  So we get to wear Sunday clothes, you know, on Sundays.  And my grandmother was a deacon in the church--a deaconess.  And you know, they wear white on that first Sunday, sit on that front row with them purple slashes and we was--my brothers [Dempsey Pugh, Jr. and Lloyd Pugh] and I we'd be sitting in the front, the front row and they're sitting in the second row.  And we went to Zion Baptist Church, which is one of the oldest, the oldest black Baptist church west of the Mississippi [Mississippi River] here in Denver [Colorado].  And you know, we would be waiting for the people to shout.  And I remember we'd be laughing, you know, kind of waiting (laughter) for them to shout and you know, always and they just started giving the--, "And now we'll have the announcements," you know.  (Unclear) like, whoa, you know, throwing the fan up in the, you know, and my grandma's just like (gesture) thump, thump, thump, thump us on--(laughter).  Yeah, that's it (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 616584
Speaker 1: One of the questions that I wanted to ask you was about your early years, the sounds, sights and smells of your home.  Now you've already told us without me even asking about the smell of the food cooking and the sights and sounds.  Tell me what takes you back to that time?
Speaker 2: I smell cornbread right away.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] would get up on Sunday morning and she'd put her greens to cooking before she'd go to church [Zion Baptist Church, Denver, Colorado].  Girl, them greens cooked the whole time.  I was eighteen before I realized that greens were green and not brown you know (laughter).  But that was part of--part of the ritual.  And then I hear the gospel music, I so love that gospel music, you know, it's just something.  It's like medicine in our spirit, I think that--that really is a medicine for me personally and just working in the culture I really get it that there is a place for music where words don't fit, but you need to make a sound.  And I think that's, that's the beauty of, of that gospel.  And I was just trying to think what, what song that my--I hear my grandmother singing.  (Pause) A song that you--I know God would not bring me this far to leave me.  And another one she liked was, "His eye was on the sparrow, and I know He's watching me" ['His Eye Is on the Sparrow'].  And I hear my, my mother [Mary Howard Edmonson], she, she just did beautiful piano music.  She didn't sing a lot.  She, you know, she let the choir sing.  And I wasn't really good in the choir.  They're just like, "Move your mouth honey, don't, don't speak up too loud," (gesture).  (Laughter) So I didn't really get into the song too much.  Now I try to sing more with my stories, but at that time I was in the choir.  But I remember the choir director saying, "You know what, it's okay honey," she said, "even God loves the sound of the crow."  I mean the crow is like (makes sound) (laughter).  So you know, I was a little suppressed, you know, at that time.  And then you know, being adolescent it was like that's the time of suppression I think, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What--
Story_ID: 616585
Speaker 1: What sights take you to that time?
Speaker 2: What sights take me to that time?  Leaves burning, you know 'cause I was telling you I love the fall of the year.  I mean we would just rake up these leaves and you know, I see smoke going up.  I still see these chickens running around.  I see this Chrysler that my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] used to drive.  It had the three humps on it.  I see the Garden of the Gods.  We had wonderful times in the mountains and we would get up early on Saturday mornings and, and go up in the mountains.  And I loved smelling bacon frying 'cause they would have the griddles and do flapjacks and frying bacon, and you--we'd usually camp somewhere along the stream.  And I had this propensity--I was very awkward.  I would always fall in the water.  I mean even when I would try not to.  There was something.  I think my body grew quickly more than I could control.  'Cause I think, you know, when I got to college, I started taking dance classes so I could get more rhythm with my body.  But before I was like--my mother [Mary Howard Edmonson] said, "Well I ain't seen nobody fall up the stairs," you know.  I would always fall in the water.  But there was something about being in the, the crisp Rocky Mountains, you know, along the stream, smelling that bacon frying and you know, having flapjacks for breakfast was just--.  And then there was this lodge called Winks Lodge [Lincoln Hills, Colorado] that a number of African Americans had gone together and bought, and there were cabins there and that was also a weekend kind of place that we would go.  So I re- I remember seeing that, you know, and smelling that.  And the Rockies, that always gives me peace.  You know, when my soul is angst, if I can walk up in the mountains, you know, if I could put my foot on a trail, there's something that is like soul settling and I--and I judge it's coming having that experience as a child.  'Cause I really do feel connected.  When I travel in the world, people say, "You from the Colorado Rockies, you're from Denver [Colorado]?"  It's like, "Any black people there?"  I'm like, "Yeah, me and the mayor," you know (laughter).  Mayor Wellington Webb [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb], you know.  But I really get it that, you know, I love being from the Rockies, yeah.
Story_ID: 616586
Speaker 1: You had begun to tell us about church.  So tell me what was your earliest memory of the church [Zion Baptist Church, Denver, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: I remember my baptism.  My [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] preparing me for baptism.  And I remember she said, "You wanna bring the Lord in your life to be your savior."  And we were in the back and they were changing clothes and putting on these white robes and she said, "This is a big day for you."  And I must've been about nine or ten.  And she said, "Now Reverend Lucas [ph.], he's gonna say, 'In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son--,' then you hold your breath," she said, "'cause you're going down," (laughter).  And that's just how they did it, the Father, the Son, whoosh, Holy Ghost, you know.  And I remember just, you know, putting that--that swimming cap on 'cause you know at that time, you know, you had your hair fried and you know, laid to the side and all pin curled and Shirley Temple curled up and we didn't want the hair to go back.  I always wondered where it went back to.  But I remember that baptism; that was like a growing up day, you know.  And of course, you know, I've walked a lot of different spiritual places from there.  But that was--that was a strong memory.  My grandmother was like the--she did a lot of church service so she was often the chairman of the pastor's anniversary.  So I remember us doing a lot of helping her around that event.  And the national Baptist conventions.  We would open our house, 'cause I told you we had that rooming house where people would come, delegates 'cause--and that was the time where--when there wasn't the freedom to be in hotels downtown like they think of now.  But you know, we would clean up the house and we'd have delegates from the convention.  And she would go and pick them up and cook big food, you know, for them and you know, the church ladies with their big hats, you know, all (unclear) down to the side and you know.  It was just a nice.  I can see how we had our own political activity in the context of, you know, Baptist Training Unions, Baptist organizations like that.  So meeting people coming from different places was wonderful, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other activities at the church that the church sponsored?
Speaker 2: I was a junior rosebud missionary.  I was an usher on the junior usher board.  I was on the choir.  I don't know why I was in the choir 'cause I was just like (gesture) I was in the choir (laughter).  But you know, my grandmother when she would go--I mean it was almost like every day and then I was the only girl.  The boys [Pugh's brothers, Dempsey Pugh, Jr. and Lloyd Pugh] could stay home, but I think there was another thing where she didn't want to leave me as the only girl at home.  You know, their friends would come, you know, so she's like, "You're coming with me."  So I would be there every night when she would go, you know.  I remember on Wednesday night they have the prayer meeting, you know, and they would be doing those hundred meter (humming), and you know, they'd just be rolling back and forth.  It's like (singing), "I love the Lord, He heard my prayer.  I--," and they could stretch that all the way and (singing), "Ooh," when they said a hundred meters, about that long, they said that same one line (laughter).  And I remember my grandmother just--you know, they would pray and she'd be telling all our business.  "Oh Lord, you know, I just wanna speak on my grandson Lord. He's a good boy Lord. He didn't mean to get in there with them bad kids and steal that Chicken Delight truck."  And people on their knees would be like, hm (laughter).  "Yeah, Lord he, he, he had a good heart Lord.  I know that they took that truck and then they, they just ate up all the chicken and then they went on and parked it Lord.  But you know, they got them down at the juvenile detention center Lord."  And then people are like, hm, I'm like, "Grandma, don't tell all our business," (laughter).  But that was the place, you know.  And, and you know, it was--it was a time, a community though, you know, where people supported and, and you know, somebody died or somebody had a need, or you know, you know like I said the pastor's anniversary, or you know, all these Baptist Training Unions that there was a sense of community, you know.  There was a sense of a place where I could go as a young person and, and find a young people's group, you know.  It was a place where people who had political aspirations could, could bring that to bear, you know.  And they had social needs, you know, people who needed food or, or help, you know, that there was a sense of community there that I think is, is, is not the same here today.  But I was glad to, you know, be alive in that time.

Speaker 1: So when you get ready to leave elementary school [Ebert Elementary School; Polaris Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] and go--did you go to junior high school or did you go straight to high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to junior high school.  I went to--
Speaker 1: You did.  So now we're in the early '60s [1960s] and civil rights is really starting to heat up.  What was going on in Denver [Colorado], what was the climate here like?  Can you remember?
Speaker 2: Not as much junior high, but probably more high school.  Junior high school for me was--I, I didn't had think I had the social consciousness, you know, to really be aware of the, the national dynamics or even the local dynamics that was happening publically.  I mean it was a very awkward time in my growth and development, and you know, I was long and skinny, and you know big butterfly glasses and just trying to hold my own.  And then I didn't even wear a bra until I was in the tenth grade.  I mean I was just like skinny and just, you know, just like that.  And I think it was when I came into high school, 'cause I graduated in 1970 so it was about like 1967--'68 [1968], you know, when things began to heat up.  And then coming into high school I think I became more politically conscious and aware of what was happening, you know, in the community and in the world.  And here in Denver, there was a lot of ex- pressure around the integration of the schools.  And that's when the famous Noel Resolution [Resolution 1490], Ms. Rachel Noel [HistoryMaker Rachel Noel] submitted--and she was the first African American on our, our school board [Denver Board of Education] along with Omar Blair [Omar D. Blair] who the--our library is named after [Blair Caldwell African American Research Library, Denver, Colorado].  But she came on the school board and she submitted what became the famous Noel Resolution which required the Denver Public Schools to integrate.  And actually there was resistance, there was a push back and this went all the way to the United States Supreme Court [Keyes v. School District No. 1, 1973], right.  And when they got there, you know, they said no you must do that and then twenty years later they're like, you know what, that was whack, we had no business sending our babies out to south Denver, you know, we could stay here and just, just, you know, improve the schools, give them some computers.  You don't have to send them south to, to, to be next to a white person to be able to educate themselves.  But anyway, we were in that space of voluntary integration.  We had these buttons that said "We tried it first," right.  So we're at East High School in Denver.
Story_ID: 616588
Speaker 1: And the way East High School [Denver, Colorado] is set up, it--there has this--what we called the esplanade, which is this grassy area that, that pours right into this Denver City Park [City Park, Denver, Colorado].  So it actually kind of extended the, the high school campus into the park to make it almost feel like a college campus.  'Cause we, you know, we had that more extended way--and it was a time of great political and social unrest.  You know, well one was agitation around the schools and integration of schools, but also integration to the community.  I mean I'm living on Race Street.  This was like the dividing line, you know, for people moving further east into what--the area we call Park Hill [Denver, Colorado].  There was like redlining going on where, you know, people who were selling property, you know, they would like scare the white people, "The black people are coming, the black people are coming."  So they would sell their houses cheap and they would move out into the suburbs, you know, as we began encroaching.  And then it was kind of like we went further and further, and then now they're moving back in the inner city so you know there is that, that loop.  But at that time they called it redlining.  And there was unrest, the Vietnam War was happening.  And, and on our campus in high school, there were organizations, you know, we had the black students union that--we had a strong influence of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, you know.  So there was a lot of political awareness for me going on.  There was the SDS, the students of democratic society [Students for a Democratic Society].  There were the flower children, you know, they wanted to have, you know, drugs and sex, and you know, whatever they were agitating for.  But, but the sum total of it was a season of a lot of dynamic interaction, thought provoking conversation, it was just an incredible time to be alive.  And for me personally, I think it was coming into--that Black Power movement is where I began to develop a sense of self, a sense of my place in the world, a sense of purpose.  A sense of beauty that, you know, at that time, you know, so I could be Sister Love, I could be the African queen, you know, there's a place for my big full lips and for my full hips and for my, my wide nose that I didn't get as an appreciation before then.  So I kind of latched on to that culture arts movement and I've pretty much been there the rest of my life.  I mean it was an incredible piece because it gave me a sense of purpose.  And so I was part of the black students alliance and you know, we had this whole newspaper and we were agitating for--to, to get black studies in our s- in our class and in our schools.  And then I also had a cousin who was active in the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.  And they were around the community and we were doing children's free breakfast programs [Free Breakfast for School Children Program] and you know, we're doing a lot of social action programs and they had a ten point platform.  You know, they wanted everybody to have a job and have reasonable house.  And then they got to the part where they wanted all political prisoners to be released from prisons.  People are like, "Ooh," (laughter), "you're sure you want Pookie [ph.] out?"  You know (laughter), you know.  But--and my mother [Mary Howard Edmonson] was just like oh my god what is wrong with her, she's done lost her mind, you know.  My vision was if I could just graduate from high school, move to Oakland, California and just join the Black Panther Party and you know, be with Eldridge Cleaver and Kathleen Cleaver, and you know, that my life would be sweet, you know, and she's like, "No baby, I don't think so."  So it didn't, it didn't work out that way.
Story_ID: 616589
Speaker 1: But I remember the day that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and I was a junior in high school.  And, and it was a sad day.  And I remember, you know, we had this school assembly in East High School [Denver, Colorado] and they had called us all into assembly and I remember the principal, Mr. Colwell [Robert Colwell].  He, he called us all in and, and you know, people were just crying, it was such a blow.  And he was saying that Dr. Martin Luther King wanted us to be peaceful, that he was about nonviolence, and you know, that we should keep our focus and you know, 'cause riots was breaking off, you know, Watts [Los Angeles, California] was burning and you know, it was all across the country.  It was like (makes sound) just jumping off.  And then I remember this brother named Michael Dehue [ph.] he was from Oakland, California, he was in the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense [Black Panther Party], and also another brother named Lauren Watson who was a local person here.  He's another person that should be interviewed on this HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers].  So they came in, they had their black leather jackets, had their black tams, and then they just like rolled up into the high school, you know right on through the auditorium, up on the stage and took the microphone from the principal.  Talking about, "All power to the people."  And we're like (gesture), "Power!"  You know he said, "Power to the people," we said, "Power!"  He said, "They have killed our black shining king.  The dream is dead."  He said, "Why are you sitting here?  You should be back in your community."  And then there's like that moment of silence, you know, people was just like deciding on what to do.  It's like--.  And then I could hear (claps hands) boom, it was like one of the seats--hit the back of the chair 'cause somebody had got up, then another one, and then another one and another one, and people started getting up, you know.  And I got up and we were going down the hallway and we were trying to head to this community.  Manual High School [Denver, Colorado] is like one block from where I live right now.  That was--you know, this is the heart of the black community where I'm at.  East High School is like--was on the edge of black and white 'cause we had integrated.  So we were making a, a trail down here to go to Five Points [Denver, Colorado] back into the center of the black community.  But on the way out, there was--then you could feel that anger coming up, you know, and then black kids was like beating white kids head.  I mean I remember this one white girl was in a--that's when they had phone booths that, you know, you could close the door and--I remember this guy just like kicked the door open, just pulled her out, ho, ho, I was like oh my--then I remember I stopped him, like, "No this is not--I don't think Martin wanted this," you know.  And they were just running across--it was just pandemonium, running across the football field.  And so then we finally gathered in the park and then formed a parade down to, to Manual.  And again, the music was such a part of our, our movement and this is awesome, again back to music is medicine.  I mean that's how our, our slave ancestors I think made it through dark nights would be able to call those songs that could warm the soul.  And so we were doing all these revolutionary songs: (singing), "Revolution has come.  Off the pig!  It's time to pick up your gun.  Off the pig!  No more pigs in our community.  Off the pigs!  What we need is black unity."  And you know, we were singing and chanting, you know, and coming down to Manual.  But when we got to Manual, which is an all-black school, their principal had like locked the doors, I mean put the chain lock on the doors and they were up in the second floor and they were waving down at us.  We're like, "Come out, come out," you know, but they wouldn't--they wouldn't come out.  So we just kept going down to Five Points and we were singing, you know, the revolutionary songs and you know, once in a while they throw in 'We Shall Overcome,' you know, that, that--.  And what were some of the other songs that they were signing?  (Singing), "Power to the people, power to the people."  You always do call and response.  (Singing), "Stone people's power, stone people's power, power to the people, power to the people, said power, power.  Free Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton]," so we'd just go run through all the political prisoners.
Story_ID: 616590
Speaker 1: And so I remember getting down to the Points.  Now in the meantime, it was all on the radio and the radio saying you know, "Parents you need to go find your children and you know, meet them down at Five Points [Denver, Colorado], take them home, this is not how we wanna be."  I mean people were like, you know, trying to get some voice of reasoning, 'cause a lot of people had turned out.  And then I remember down there and they were calling back and forth about what are we gonna do that the king [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is dead, that the dream is dead, you know.  And then there were other people who were trying to bring more of a quiet voice of reason, like, you know, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and then I felt this thumping on my shoulder and I turned around, it was my mama [Mary Howard Edmonson], then tried to pull my neck of my shirt (laughter).  She's like, "What do you think you are doing and why aren't you in school?  And Kathy [ph.] what you doing," that was my girlfriend, "what you doing--your mama--get in this car--get in this car--get in this car."  I was like oh great, here's my great moment of freedom (laughter) and I get snagged in the collar by my mama, you know.  So that was--so we--so our dinner table was always heated, it was always heated, you know, it was like oh man, you know.  But it was like having a place to share the dyn- the, the dynamics, you know.  And I think that my mom and dad [Pugh's stepfather, Thomas Edmonson] they were fearful for me, so they was like, "You need to stop this brothers, this sister, this culture stuff, it ain't gonna get you nowhere."  Because they--I think they were afraid and, and the era that they grew up, you know, they were like squashed, you know.  And it wasn't, you know, you could lose your life for saying the wrong thing.  You know, Gloster, Louisiana, you know, at a certain time in our history.  So now I, I understand it; then I just felt rebellious.
Story_ID: 616591
Speaker 1: We jumped a little bit ahead because we just left out all of your junior high school years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So if, if you can, just talk to me about that and also your memory of your neighborhood 'cause I wanna understand who lived in your community, what was the social status of your family. Just give me a tour, say a square block of where you lived?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the people--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then about junior high school, and about teachers and influences at that time?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So we lived in the middle of the block on 2076 Ogden [Street] and then right on the corner was Granberry Mortuary [Denver, Colorado] and those people, you know, they pretty much buried, you know, you had one or two black funeral homes and they were one of the most prominent at that time.  And so they had a lot of respect in the community.  Next door to us was Ms. Briggs [ph.] who was an elder woman and her family was related though to [HistoryMaker] Rachel Noel who was the one who submitted the famous Noel Resolution [Resolution 1490] and I knew, you know, that she had children's children.  I think it was her grandmother or her mother, but you know, they had kids who would come and visit the grandmother that lived there who were in the same age group as me.  And then next to her Mr. Banks, Mr. and Mrs. Banks [ph.], and, and we loved their name 'cause every time they would--and they would stroll down we, we would get them mostly going up and down the alley or even up and down the front.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] would always say, "I see Mr. Banks is watering his yard today. You all need to go and get some night crawlers tonight," (laughter) you know, 'cause when you water your yard the night crawlers come up on to the surface of the ground and you--I don't know if you've ever been night crawler picking, but that's, that's (laughter)--that was the piece.  But he would always give us money.  We said, "oh their name is Banks because they always--they got a lot of money, you know."  They would be very generous with us.  And then next to them was the Mallards, and they had five children and of their five children, three of them, myself and my two brothers [Dempsey Pugh, Jr. and Lloyd Pugh] had people in the same age group.  So their sister and myself, Stenella, and my brother and Sanford [ph.] and so we were all friends.  We went to school together, we walked together.  She was my best friend, Stenella Mallard [ph.].  And she died too, it's hard, you know, your siblings, my siblings are, you know, age group cohorts are, are beginning to check out, you know.  And I kind of look around, you know, it makes me really feel like I'm going into elder hood.  But it was--it was the kind of neighborhood where, you know, people respected to each other--respected each other.  I knew that if I was caught doing something wrong or if I was out too late when we were playing, we had to be home when the lights came on, you know.  And we'd be playing, playing games.  I just saw Kool-Aid with that pound of sugar and a little pack of red Kool-Aid and dill pickles.  And so you know, we'd always have watchful eyes in the, in the neighborhood.  So Ms.--you know, Ms. Briggs or Mr. Banks or the Mallards or any of them could tell 'em--tell on me and--if I was doing something wrong that I could get caught.
Story_ID: 616592
Speaker 1: Oh, how I got my bra, that's when I got--I was in the ninth grade, from my ninth grade to the tenth grade [at East High School, Denver, Colorado].  And I was just hanging out with the boys, I mean it was in the summer and I remember it was just like so hot they wanted to, you know, we were playing rolling tires down, down the alley.  That was, that was like our, our playing: rolling these tires, car tires down the alley.  And, and I remember it was so hot and then Mr. Banks [ph.] had water on his yard so we were running--then we would run through the water.  And then the boys ran through the water and I ran through the water, and they were soaking wet and so they just pulled off their shirts and just put them down.  I pulled off my shirt too and then we also collected pop bottles for money, you could get two cents deposit back and at that time penny candy was actually a penny, you know.  So we were all going to Ray's grocery store [ph.] at the end of the block 'cause there was a grocery store, then my dad [John Harris] he worked as the pharmacist.  And at that time I didn't even know he was my dad.  But that was interesting because we could go to the Ray's grocery store and get whatever we want, you know, milk, bread, sugar, mom [Mary Howard Edmonson] said put it on the bill.  He'd put it on the bill, I never had to do some money, bring it home.  There was a barbershop there and then there was also a pharmacy, never had to pay money for the pharmacy, but it didn't mean, you know, it was the same way with the grocery store so I didn't think of--anything of it, I didn't realize that was my dad, you know, who was paying for all of our pharmacy too.  But I remember we went into, you know, taking these bottles to cash them into Ray's grocery store and I was coming out with the dill pickle and the Kool-Aid and you know, whatever, bubble gums and Butterfingers, and you know, our little snacky wacky stuff.  And then I remember there was this woman across the street who saw me.  And I just had just little walnuts, you know, just little baby something.  And she came flying across the street, "What are you thinking?"  And she has this towel and it's flying in the air, you know, she was like (gesture) and then she just wraps it around me.  "My goodness, how are you out here without a top on? What is wrong with you?  Where is your mom?  You going home."  So she just like hunched me up and just like marched me back to my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] like, "She was around the corner with no blouse on.  What do--is going on with her?"  And I'm like, "What?  What?"  (Laughter) You know, "What?"  And I didn't, you know, I didn't get it like that was a--that was a developmental thing that was the first part of my development into, into female hood and, and to separate from the tomboy, you know, multiple brothers [Dempsey Pugh, Jr. and Lloyd Pugh], you know, I was just like that tomboy kind of piece of somebody, you know.  And so then I began to get it, like okay, you know, there's a different thing called a woman's way, you know.  And then you get your moon, you have to wear a bra, you know, you get the cramps, you get more work.  You know, to me it was just highly overrated (laughter).  It was like I want my money back (laughter).  So you get to be a female you get more work, okay I got it, you know.  So yeah it actually took me a while to really come into appreciate my full femininity.  But at that time as, you know, the body is transforming I felt like my body had actually betrayed me.
Story_ID: 616593
Speaker 1: We were talking about junior high school, what was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: I first went to Morey Junior High [Morey Junior High School; Morey Middle School, Denver, Colorado] and then my last year I went to Cole Junior High [Cole Junior High School; Cole Middle School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Morey, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: M-O-R-E-Y.  It's on 14th [Street] and Ogden [Avenue], and then Cole was down on 32nd [Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard] and what is it?  High [sic.] I think.
Speaker 1: So did you continue to be a good student?
Speaker 2: You know, that was my little claim to fame.  I think I found my little niche and I even tried to be active in student government.  I remember I ran for the secretary of student council.  And I had this little poem--and that was before they had rap, but I remember I, I had this little--my speech and it was something like: "If you vote for me I will do my best to change most things and improve the rest.  The office of secretary is my goal, so don't forget me at the poll," you know (laughter).  I lost miserably, but (laughter) but that's funny I still remember that little speech, you know.  But I--it probably worked out 'cause I was still in that mode of, you know, school is out at 3:20, 3:30 I needed to be home, you know, 'cause I still had a lot of you know, responsibilities on the home front.  And you know, really wasn't a lot of space for after school activities at that time.
Story_ID: 616594
Speaker 1: Did you have any aspirations about who you would become later on or what you would do?
Speaker 2: I--at that time--well early on I thought I would, I would be a nurse.  My, my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] had a lot of health issues and I was always in this dutiful daughter--bring her medicines and you know, take care of children in that way, so I thought nursing.  I mean I did my reports on Clara Barton and the Red Cross [American Red Cross] and Florence Nightingale and you know, so I was really at that time attracted to nursing.  And then I think it began to shift into education, you know.  Just to see how, you know, for our, our culture how that was you know supposedly like the ticket to, you know, a better life, a wholesome life of, you know, making a contribution to our community would be through being a teacher.  So I thought that would be where I was heading.
Story_ID: 616595
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers--you, you spoke about your teachers in elementary school [Ebert Elementary School; Polaris Elementary School, Denver, Colorado], but in junior high school was there someone who inspired or en- or encouraged you?
Speaker 2: There was Mr. Sabb [ph.].  He was, I think, he might have been a very short Jewish man.  And he had my brother [Dempsey Pugh, Jr.] before me and like I said, my brother his thing was to be funny, mine was to be serious.  And you know, he said, "Okay you're the second Pugh coming through. How you gonna show up," you know, he didn't know how it was gonna be.  And I showed him a pretty decent student.  But he'd taught me like not to fear math.  He was a math teacher and he had a math club and, and I tried to join the math club, but that didn't work as consistently as I would've liked.  But his gift to me was to reduce the fear as a, as a woman or as a girl around math.  And that's probably the most memorable teacher I can think of in middle school, in junior high.
Story_ID: 616596
Speaker 1: And we talked about your high school years, and was it in junior high school or high school [East High School, Denver, Colorado] that you knew that you would go to college or was it always a given, what were your thoughts about college at that time?
Speaker 2: I knew that to make a difference in our community and in high school was when I was really just caught on fire with, you know, cultural consciousness, with social awareness, with you know, political points of view that it became clear that the college campus was the next venue, actually to continue the social activities and the--and the political activities because I had this vision of, of going to Oakland College [sic. Merritt College] in Oakland, California that I could really just immerse myself in the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense and just be in the heart of, you know, that, that Black Power movement and, and just feel the--you know, Malcolm X.  We had a lot of leaders at that time, you know, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] and you know, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, you know, the whole Black Panther--Eldridge Cleaver and Kathleen Cleaver, and then when I became, you know, so, you know, enrolled by the enthusiasm around the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, I thought I would change my major from education to communication so that I could work on the newspaper [The Black Panther Community News Service; The Black Panther Intercommunal News Service].  I wanted to be working with the newspaper, I wanted to work with Eldridge Cleaver and for--and be on his team for the Black Panther Party newspaper.
Story_ID: 616597
Speaker 1: So how did it all play out for you to go to college?
Speaker 2: Not (laughter).  Well actually it played out for me to go to college.  I didn't get to Oakland [California], you know, but I did get a partial scholarship to go to University of Colorado in Boulder [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  And so that's where I started my, my college career, and I graduated, graduated in June of 1970.  And--
Speaker 1: From high school [East High School, Denver, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: From high school.  The last semester of my high school year was very provocative in terms of how it influenced my, my world.  We experienced this--experience in education called the senior seminar.  And it was an experience between the Denver Public Schools and Colorado Outward Bound School [Denver, Colorado], which is an outdoor experiential education program.  So they wanted to see if we could actually learn more in the field then actually in a traditional classroom setting.  So they selected a hundred students that were, you know, cross racially, cross financial lines, cross socially, and, and then we broke us up into small--smaller groups like maybe twenty-five or something.  And we took that whole last semester, from January to June 1970 of my senior year.  And so instead of studying sociology we would actually attend a drug seminar in the community.  Instead of studying migrant farm laborers, we actually went to the San Luis Valley [Colorado] and we picked vegetables with the migrant farm laborers.  And, and I remember picking okra and picked so much okra, I mean I can still feel the itching in my, my hands, you know, because they have those fine spores on it that, you know, make you really itch.  It just gave me a sense of what these people's experience might be.  If not to mention the kind of chemicals they use on a lot of the food.  And then the first month we actually went to Mexico and we stayed on the beach for like four weeks.  You know, got up in the morning at six o'clock, run for a mile, jump in the water.  We climbed mountains, we did kayaking and rock climbing and mountain climbing, and we had a three day solo where you had to stay three days, you know, with yourself and you had maybe a canteen of water, you had a journal to write with, a sleeping bag, and pretty much that was it.  And we were in sound distance, but we couldn't see each other.  And it was--those people who stayed on their solo in my group were the ones who actually went on and actually completed college.  Those people who broke their solos and came back to camp were the ones who had a different--and, and we found this when we had our ten year reunion, and our twenty year reunion, and--but it was a telling part, you know.  We climbed thirteen thousand foot peak mountains.  And you know, it just stretched me in ways that I hadn't been stretched before.  During the time when people would have their senior prom, I was on the green in Yampa River on a two week canoe trip going down the river for two weeks in a canoe, you know--I mean on a raft; we were on a rafting trip.  And it stretched me in ways that I hadn't imagined before.  But I think that it gave me a, a spirit of, of expansion, an opportunity to test myself in ways that we don't normally have to go to the edge of our being.  And had me to take risks that I probably normally would not have taken.  To be on a thirteen thousand foot mountain peak and then to be rappelling down the side and as far as you could see is, you know, just this deep gully, canyon.  It gave me an opportunity to see that I had a lot more capacity than I was using and that it was possible.  So I think it kind of charged my sense of curiosity, travel, risk taking and an increased capacity for learning.  So that was a gift, I think, from the senior seminar.

Speaker 1: I graduated [from East High School, Denver, Colorado] like on the 1st of June.  On the 15th of June I was moving in (laughter)--I was moving in college on--University of Colorado, the campuses in Boulder [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  And you know, I started school younger, so I was in college for like six months before I turned eighteen.  And everybody was going to the 3.2 clubs and trying to get in.  And you know, I was trying to follow my roommates and I got carded and they're like, "Yeah, 5'2", right," you know, "get out of here," you know.  So I was just so excited to turn eighteen so that I could go to the clubs, "Now let's go," and then everybody's like, "Nah we already been there, you know, it's no fun," (laughter).  But I always tended to be like the, the, the youngest and the, the tallest in my circles.  And then also kind of like the bedrock. I think a lot of people brought a lot of issues to me and I held--I held energy even then for a lot of people's concerns.
Speaker 2: How many schools did you apply to and who helped you to de- to decide which schools to apply to?
Speaker 1: I tried to get as far away from Colorado as I could, (laughter).  So I applied to, to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], to Oakland [Merritt College, Oakland, California] against my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson]--my mom was like, "You know what?  You're gonna apply, don't even--don't even apply, you're not going--not possible."  'Cause she was really concerned, she's very protective and it probably was a good thing, I don't know how it would've played out.  'Cause I had a cousin who was also of the same mindset and she got pregnant before she even got to college you know.  So it wasn't, you know, wasn't just a baby, it was the people's baby, you know.  She's like well let the people take care of him then too (laughter).  But so I applied to a lot of eastern colleges, Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], I applied to Boston, Howard, CU, CSU [Colorado State University] in Fort Collins [Colorado].  And the decision was a collective decision as far as where to go 'cause it was really based on financial--my financial need and the scholarship that was available.  And so it ended up being University of Colorado in Boulder; it's about thirty miles from, from home, which was fine.  You know, I got to be on my--you know, get out of my mama's house, you could stay out all night and your mama don't know, you know (laughter).  Come back on Wednesday and wash your clothes and have something to eat, you know.  I'd get on the bus and come home to wash my clothes. I couldn't believe it and then when I was--you know, but I'm grown I'll take care of myself.
Story_ID: 616599
Speaker 1: So education or communication is what you went after as a major?
Speaker 2: So I changed--and so because of that influence of the Black Panther Party I chose communication as my major.  And I ended up going to a different university every year of my college career.  So it was an opportunity for me to travel and to experience the world, and have some place to stay at the same time.  So, after my first year, I made--I made the dean's list, but I wanted to travel, you know, I wanted to, you know, explore and experience the world, so I dropped out my second year in college [at University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  And a friend of mine had gone to California and then she invited me to join her.  'Cause I, I wanted to have a apartment and a home, and you know, clothes and I got one year of college, I can do that (laughter).  And I ended up getting a job at the telephone company which is kind of like the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], always work at the telephone company.  And she went to California and she called me and said, "You know what, I met these brothers, they're going to California," no, "they're going to Boston, Massachusetts.  Olatunji [Babatunde Olatunji] has a cultural arts center there, you know, we can go there."  I'm like oh yeah, you know, there's better days ahead.  And so I quit my job at, you know, at the telephone company.  When they came back to Denver [Colorado] I joined them and we went--and we were going to Boston, and one of them lived in Dayton, Ohio.  And the day before we were to leave, the car broke down and they totaled it--oh he had an accident and totaled out the car.  And so, so here me and my roommate, Debbie [ph.], we were roommates in college, they were like, "Well it's been lovely to meet you all, we're gonna take a plane and head on to Boston," you know; see you, don't wanna be you.  So we were stuck in Dayton, Ohio.  We were just like--.  So we made a life there for about six months, you know, and you know.  And so all this complaining I have been doing about you know, having to work so much, you know, with the property and my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] having these apartment homes, that's how we made our money to, to take care of our apartment.  We were in a apartment building and I got a job working with the maintenance to--I was painting apartments during the daytime, you know, to offset our rent and she went, she's like, "I ain't feeling no painting. I don't wanna get it under my fingernails," but she went to a restaurant and worked.  When I saw her I, I, I couldn't do that work, 'cause, you know, it was very intense, you gotta keep moving, you know, it's like unh-uh, I'd rather be in an apartment, turn on the radio, you know, it's just me, it's cool.  So anyway, we did that for about six months and then it was obvious like, you know what, it's time to come home.
Story_ID: 616600
Speaker 1: So I called my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson], I was like, "Mom, I wanna come home."  And my mom was like, "Okay so what you gonna do?  You gonna get job, you're gonna get back in school, what you gonna do?"  I'm like, "Ugh," she said, "Well you let me know and call me back," (makes sound) you know.  Like oh my goodness (laughter).  So then I, I called her back, I made a plan, you know.  She sent me the money.  And so when I got back in school I had a different focus.  I had--I was more committed and so I did University of Colorado in Denver [University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado] and worked part time.  And then I applied to the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee [University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and I was accepted there for my third year.  And because they had a study abroad program, I was able to do my senior year at the University of Lagos in Nigeria [Lagos, Nigeria], West Africa.  And that's when I finished.
Speaker 2: Was that something that you had thought about before?  Going to Africa (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From the time I found out I was African and, and you know, from the time that Black Power movement touched me, I knew I had to go to Africa.  I knew I had to go home.  I knew I had to go back to the cradle of civilization.  I knew I had to go back to the place of first man and first woman's birthplace.  So yeah, that was like I'm coming home.
Story_ID: 616601
Speaker 1: I got to the--do the exchange program [through the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and it was late--so I applied for like my visa in January and school started in September, and by September the Nigerian embassy had not released my, my visa.  And I'm like, you know what, I'm going if I have to swim.  So I just like went; I didn't have a visa, you know I had my passport, and you know, the people from the university [University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria] was gonna meet me when I got to the airport.  (Laughter) It was funny, okay on the plane it's like all these--all these sisters--all these black women they got their hair dressed up, you know, with their African dress and you know, the--just like what I'm dressed on, you know.  And they're like, "I'm leaving America, I'm going to Nigeria, I'm gonna be with my man, later for America, I'm done."  I'm like, "I hear you," you know.  Then when we landed there's all these sisters standing there at the airport, you know.  They got their bags right there, like hurry up and land 'cause I'm going home (laughter).  So they just kind of switched places, you know.  But when I got out I didn't have a visa.  They took me in this room and they interrogated.  I remember it was so hot and so humid like I could swallow my air.  And I remember they, they put me in this small room and they're like, "Why are you here and you don't have a visa?"  And they were interrogating me like, you know, like I was, you know, I had done something wrong.  I just didn't have the paper.  They interrogated me and then they leave, then they come back and interrogate me again.  And I remember I was just so hot, all I could think to do was just take off my pantyhose while they were gone (laughter).  And it was one of the students whose--who was a boyfriend who had been on the exchange program the year before, she had written him and he came.  His name was Johnny Cool Obadosea [ph.].  He had come to the airport.  There was nobody from the university, there were no officials.  I mean, and, and he had to bribe my way in.  I mean I'm sure that--that he da- you know, there's this thing called dash where, "You have something for me?  Some small, small something?"  You know, so I don't know what kind of small, small something that he gave him, but I was like wow I had to dash my way back home to get, get back to Mother Africa (laughter).  So I remember we were leaving the airport and going back to university and I was just like, all these black people.  There was like 80 million Africans, and Nigeria has the largest black population on the face of this earth, bar none.  And I just wanted to meet and greet every one of them.  I was like hey, I'm back, hey, you know, it was just like so excited.  And, and, and they were just like (makes sound) look, we got 80 million looking just like you, what you so excited about, you know.  But it was a totally different experience.  I mean, I didn't know what an urban African experience would be like, you know, 'cause I had all these visions of, you know, Mali and Songhai, and you know, those ancient--Timbuktu [Mali].  And you know, I had so many, you know, notions you know that I had packed in that bag, more than just must my clothes, you know.  So it was a rude awakening really in a lot of ways to--particularly Nigeria.  Nigeria is pretty rough first--for first time visit to Africa.  I mean I would really, if somebody asked me, I would say, you know, you might try someplace like Ghana or Togo or you know, Benin, Senegal, Gambia (laughter) before Nigeria.  Nigeria is like intense.  But it was--I think that there're things about big cities like Lagos [Nigeria].  There's--big cities have something more in common than, than that cuts through culture.  'Cause this could've been New York [New York], Chicago [Illinois], Tokyo [Japan], Sao Paulo [Brazil], you know, any major city that just like doesn't sleep, you know.  It's like slick rap, quick hustle, getting over, you know, that kind of intensity, you know, movement and colors on the street, honking and blowing, you know, it was just like so intense.
Story_ID: 616602
Speaker 1: I remember coming to the university [University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria] though and I was part of a UNESCO project [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization], the communications department was part of UNESCO project.  So they had instructors from all over Africa and many from Europe.  And it was a totally different education system.  And it was like every--everything was very formal.  There was not a lot of, you know, interaction between you know the professors and the students.  It was kind of like they were mini gods.  And they would lecture and, and you would write down every single thing that dropped out of their, their mouth and even they would say, "Full stop," like that's the period that you put and, and then you do the next one, you know.  Sometimes the lights would go out, you know, and, and it's like everybody's used to it, you just get closer to your paper and you just keep writing.  And their system, it was a British system.  You have five classes, you take--you start in September and you take those si- same five classes all the way to June.  In June, you have a comprehensive essay exam, you know.  It's not true/false, fill in the blank, you know, it's serious.  And education is so serious there because that was what determined if you become the--a house boy or the head of state, you know.  And the only distinction would be your education.  Unlike here, and, and up until this day, until this moment I could never say that we had the option of a black person becoming the head of our state until today, you know, being in the role of seeing Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], you know, being a serious contender for our presidency.  But there--so that's when I got to see that I had a quick wit and I could remember stuff, but I didn't have good study habits.  And to be able to carry all that way from September to June, you really needed to be able to pace yourself.  And, and because the competition was so intense, I mean there's a whole card industry, you know, because testing is so important.  Third grade, sixth grade, ninth grade, you're tested and weeded out because they didn't have enough schools for everybody.  So it's like you're not cutting the mustard, then you go to a secretarial or technical school, or you go ahead and be a house boy and house girl 'cause you know what, there's fifteen hundred people that want that seat that you're sitting there right there, you know.  So, so the competition was greater.  And then around exam periods, test anxiety.  You know, cases of hypertension, attempted suicide, you know, nausea.  I mean you could hear them at night down at the, the lagoon praying (singing), "Oh Lord help us pass our exam."  I was getting scared, you know, I was like whoo.  Seven o'clock in the morning going to breakfast and the line is in front of the library, already fifty people, you know.  There's a whole card industry: "Our prayers are with you as you prepare for your exam."  "Congratulations on the successful completion of your exam." "Our deepest sympathies," you know, (laughter).  And I failed my research methods exam.  I failed my research methods exam.  I had never failed before.  From high school [East High School, Denver, Colorado] I was number 101 out of a class of 735 people, you know, and I thought that was pretty good.  Here, when they give your test results here and, you know, in America when they give your test results they use your social security for it.  There they use your name, you know.  So as much as I practiced for this--this research methods I just could not get it together.  So when they gave the exam, Ezinwanne [ph.] pass, you know, Adebanjo [ph.] pass, Pugh, (makes sound).  Oh my god, the word went out just like, "The American failed, the American failed."  Like, I didn't fail just for Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh], I failed for the whole United States of America.  The word was out: "The American failed, the American failed."  They're beating the drum in the village (makes sounds), "The American failed," (laughter).  And it was like whoa, so humbling.  I hadn't experienced that kind of failure before, you know.  I, I didn't, I didn't really have a vocabulary place to put that, you know.  So I really--and so you have a chance to study and you retake in August.  And you can f- so if you fail two then you can retake in August, but if you fail three you have to repeat the entire year.  So that is very intense 'cause some people had to save up, you know, for that year and then they had to drop out and save up and do another year.  So it was very, very intense.  So I studied, I studied, and I retook it in August and I was so glad that I passed, but look, there wasn't no posse to celebrate me.  "The American passed, the American passed."  It was like, psh, you know, I didn't get no posse (laughter).  But it was a deep life lesson for me.
Story_ID: 616603
Speaker 1: So what year are we in?
Speaker 2: So we're in 1973, '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And who paid for you to, to go to college this time?
Speaker 2: So I took a lot of loans and it was actually less expensive to travel to the University of Lagos in Nigeria [Lagos, Nigeria], the travel, the room and board, my books, my tuition was less expensive than being an out of state student at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  So I was pretty much responsible for my school fees and I had loans, and my parents [Mary Howard Edmonson and Pugh's stepfather, Thomas Edmonson] helped me out a bit.  But it--I, I paid on loans a long time after I graduated.  And that was my senior year.
Speaker 1: Well what were some of your other experiences, I mean this is the first time that you're in a foreign country and it's not exactly what you had in your mind.  What were some of the other experiences that you had?
Speaker 2: Well, that's where I really came to appreciate story telling.  'Cause this is a culture that paid attention to the individual, like, like they believe that story telling is probably the most basic condition of human learning and growth.  And so sometimes I would ask a question and instead of giving me an answer, they'd tell me a proverb, you know, or they'd tell me a story.  What you see is not really what you see.  What you hear is not really what you hear.  I'm like well is it yes or no, you know.  Because I carried, you know, more--although physically I looked more Nigerian then American, the way I walk, the way I talk, my choice of food, the way I dress.  My notions are--of things like time and cleanliness were distinctively American, which was--which my disappointment I thought I had more, you know, African roots.  But--so I began to appreciate the power of the metaphor and the power of, of the question.  'Cause you know, we hold it like, you know, in foreign countries where they see us like, you know, America is like God's own country.  You know, like God born here, you know, and that we got all of the creature comforts, we wake up in the morning and, and we just push a button and then our bed will ease us into a tub of hot sudsy water, you know.  And we just lay down and just, you know, put the water on us and push another button, and bacon and eggs begin to fry.  You know, we, we hold it like that.  And during that time in the '70s [1970s], you know, '73 [1973] and '4 [1974] and '5 [1975]; that was during the time during the time of the blaxploitation films, you know.  And it was kind of, kind of the post-Civil Rights Movement and so there was a lot of like Foxy Brown, they wanted me to be Pamela Grier [Pam Grier], Foxy Brown, you know, and 'cause I was tall and slim like her.  But you know, they had this, this thing like, you know, black women were like easy and you know, we carried our birth control pills in our back pocket and (laughter) you know, so it was the education process, you know.  Just to show okay this is who I am, I don't know where you've been or what you've been watching, but you know, I don't roll like that.
Story_ID: 616604
Speaker 1: So we were talking about how you were living in, in Nigeria and what the people there, their perception of American women were and you had to kind of set them straight.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Who did you begin to listen, listen to; who told you stories that sparked your interest in becoming a storyteller?  And, and why a storyteller, because at first you said that you wanted to write newspaper with Eldridge Cleaver.  So tell me about what changed your mindset?
Speaker 2: Well, I really came to be--to appreciate the African oral tradition to see how it played out in the culture as a nonthreatening way of teaching without preaching.  And how it actually passed all the way through their whole life cycle, like even from the time like a child is born, like the naming of a child is--so much attention was given to that because they believe that a person and their name are spiritually connected.  And name means like the nature of.  And you know, I could see that even in the Christian church they say that in the beginning was the Word and it was through the Word that God created all manifestation, you know, and not like hammers and mortars and nail, but actually through the Word and it was so.  So I began to listen, you know, more and, and as I went to the ceremonies, the baby naming ceremonies, the weddings, the, the rites of passage.  They always had, you know, someone who's speaking and tell the story, but then there was the, the, the babalawo.  So if there was like a minister, I guess here in American concept, the minister would speak.  They would have the interpreter who would speak his words out loud or they'd say that the storyteller makes the king's words sweet.  So they didn't have like a microphone so, you know, you would say, "This is what the baby's name is," and then the storyteller would say, "The baby's name is--," you know, he would bring it--bring it up so that people could really pay attention.  They were also musicians.  My name, Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh], was actually given to me when I lived in Nigeria and I had a roommate, Ewemade [ph.]. I stayed with her over the summer, they call the holidays, and I would go back and forth with her, and there was an elder in her compound and he would always holler, "Opalanga, Opalanga," but I didn't understand his language; he didn't speak English.  And then finally one day I just said you're just gonna have to sit with me and, and, and let me have a dialogue with this man.  And he told me that Opalanga, the word is a derivative of ope igi, which means the palm tree.  And it's a name that's given to someone who's tall and thin, and it has no gender in that they would give a--they would call a tall and thin man Opalanga as well.  And it speaks to the qualities of strength and grace.  So the proverb that is associated with Opalanga says that Opalanga can fall on a mortar and break it.  And you know a mortar would--you'd see them pounding a pestle and a mortar.  The heavy wooden bottom part is the mortar.  They say Opalanga can fall on a mortar and break it showing strength, but she can fall on a plate and it will not shatter, showing grace.  And that was like very moving to me and, and I thanked him.  I'm like oh yes, I, I accept this name.  And as I'm leaving he tells her in, in Yoruba, well tell her to bring me something back in a brown bottle when she comes back.  You know, so that was like their beer you know (laughter).  I'm like no problem.  But it has been to carry this name Opalanga just a vibration that's placed on the air is a challenge to learn how to walk with strength and grace.  You know, how to move with harmony and balance with the events of my life.  They say know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run (laughter), same-same.  So that was a tremendous gift that was tied into the, the Yoruba culture as the proverb, you know.  That was a gift to me.
Story_ID: 616605
Speaker 1: The way that their language is shaped is so personal.  I get to see English, most of our language is based on nouns, you know, on, on things, you know, it's like, "Denise can you give me that pen?"  The way the Yoruba language is shaped, it would say, "Denise would you come bringing the pen with you?"  So it's a different shift, you can see how it's more like toward the heart, and more people focused, you know.  And so being in Nigeria I had to slow down even the way that I communicate with people because there is a great protocol on honoring the individual.  The language, you know, they have fifty different greetings on just how to greet a person, you know, not only good morning, good afternoon, good evening, you know, (Yoruba phrase).  I--if you were like working, I would greet you (Yoruba phrase), I greet you as you work, you know.  You're packing to go to your next event, I would greet you, (Yoruba phrase); I greet you as you pack.  And so it's, it's such--it's more personal.  I mean if you're older or younger, you know, there's a greeting for you.  And I like the, the work greeting, because there's special greetings like the people who do services for us, who are cutting the grass or you know, or you know, in the bank who are washing the bathrooms and we're running through the airport, you know, who, you know, who do these menial things that make our lives sweet.  But to have a special greeting for them, (Yoruba phrase), I mean I greet you, thank you for washing out this sink that I can come in here and it's clean, you know what I'm saying.  So sometimes we just come in and we just like, psh, you know whatever, you know, she's holding up the bathroom so I can--you know, whatever we think or whatever we do.  But there is much more of a graciousness I think that I learned, you know, from--and it had to be with slowing it down enough to get underneath how the stories just value people more.
Story_ID: 616606
Speaker 1: When I graduated, I, I worked for the FESTAC, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture [Lagos, Nigeria].  And I was a journalist for them.  And I did, you know, interviews in, in French and I mean I had an interpreter who'd do French and, and also English, and so I was writing programs.  But what I found is that writing didn't come that easy for me.  And actually was a challenge and it was very difficult for me.  And, and I kind of began to lose that luster, that expectation I was gonna be this, this Pulitzer Prize winning, you know, journalist.  But I was able to keep my job, but it did--you know that I enjoyed meeting the people, but then going back and writing it up was very much of a challenge.  I'd be up all night and all day, and you know, balls of paper all over the floor and you know, skipping meals.  I mean it was, it was hard for me.  I mean it just felt like squeezing out a pound of blood every time I had to write something.  And later, you know, I mean much later like, like four years from now (laughter), I found out I had attention deficit disorder.  And I'm telling you that was like whew that's what that was, you know.  It was kind of like Roberta Flack's song 'Killing Me Softly' ['Killing Me Softly with His Song'], "Found my letters and read each one out loud."  I began to see the patterns.  So that's kind of what was going on, but I didn't know.  But I didn't start telling stories in Nigeria; I just appreciated the impact, you know, of it.  And it wasn't until I came back to the states that I actually began to tell, and then ultimately work as a teller, and it's, it's been my profession for the last twenty-two years.  But I came to appreciate story as a, a tool for education, as a vehicle for personal development and a force for social change.  You know, that right now we're in a space of change in our story, you know.  So I think that's, you know, was the biggest gift, you know.  And, and, and living in Nigeria was, was another storyteller, Fela Ransome Kuti [Fela Kuti].  He was a musician and he use- and I can see how we use the cultural arts, you know, as a political tool.  So he was a musician there and he got this thing called Afro funk [sic. Afrobeat] and most of his music was political.  He had stories mainly about the military government and we were in a military regime.  I was there for two coup d'etats, you know.  But he had one called 'Zombie' and the zombie, he talked about the Ni- Nigerian military.  He said, "Zombie no go talk unless you tell them to talk.  Zombie no go think unless you tell them to think."  You know, so he had this criticize and then they would storm his place and burn it down or whatever, and he'd build another place and he'd keep his music going.  And I could see, you know, also cultural activism, you know.  'Go Slow,' that was another song.  Oh the traffic in Nigeria was just so intense, my goodness.  So I guess I felt like going through two coup d'etats, I mean and then just all the ups and downs of, you know, African urban living, particularly the coup d'etats, the go slows.  There were times I couldn't get money, you know, from home.  And being broke in Lagos [Nigeria] is not like being broke in Omaha [Nebraska], you know (laughter).  So I mean sometimes we couldn't get mail through, couldn't get a phone call through, couldn't get an interbank transfer.  I mean there were, there were some difficult times.  And I felt like, like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, how they'd take a new product and they'd just bash it out and whack it out and dip it in the water, and you know, whatever they need to do and just try to take it through as many intense challenges they could before they (gesture) give that Good Housekeeping seal of approval, that's how I felt like.  I--my experience of being in Lagos was that my spirit had been challenged.  My physical body had been challenged.  My ability to socially adapt had been challenged.  And there's no place on the planet that I cannot go right now, I know there's no place I can't go and survive.  You know, so that was another gift, you know, that I knew I could survive.  So there was another stretch for an increasing capacity.

Speaker 1: And so you were only in Nigeria for how long?
Speaker 2: So I went to school there [University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria] for a year and then I worked for a year [for the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria], and then I played for a few months, so about two and a half years, two and a half, three years.  And I got this telegram and it said, "We don't know if Mama's gonna make it; can you come home right away?"  And I--how was that--(pause) that was the second time.  Okay, the first time I just came home to visit then I went back.  And then I got it that it was really, you know, it's time to leave.  But I got this telegram and so I had just dropped everything and just, you know, threw stuff in my bag and I just took a plane to Helsinki, Finland, then to New York [New York], and then back to Denver [Colorado], rushed to the hospital.  And then I got there and my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard] was sitting up in the--in the bed, she's like (makes sound), "What took you so long?"  She said, "I could've been dead by the time you got back."  And this--we, we're talking like maybe forty-eight hours, seventy-two hours (laughter) she's--I'm like, okay I guess you're gonna be all right, you know.  And so then I went back and she got sick again, but this time I was like okay it might be time for me to go anyway.  And I remember we had a--when I had--I met the love of my life, you know, at that time he was the love of my life, until he wasn't the love of my life.  But we had this big party and I cooked cornbread, I cooked cornbread, girl, they was coming out the woods, they was coming from the villages to get some of that cornbread.  And then there were people there who worked for Motown [Motown Records] and they had these films of Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5, they were real hot at that time, The Brothers Johnson, and, and at that time they had on 16mm film.  So that was a precursor to MTV [Music Television; MTV].  So they were up in one room showing those films and you know, we had food laid out, the music was kicking, and, and almost all the people that I had met during that time that I was there that were close to my heart were there at that party.  And I already had my clothes packed and in the car.  And I didn't stop and say okay goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, I just like, you know, we just had a sweat down Soul Train Line, we did the Soul Train Line, and I just went on and got in the car and slipped out, you know.  And, and that's how I left Lagos [Nigeria].  And you know, my boyfriend knew what was going on, but for the rest of them, I knew there was a point, they was like, "Where's Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh]," you know.  I was gone, you know, I was gone.
Story_ID: 616608
Speaker 1: Came back to the states and you know, my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Howard], she was up and down, you know.  And so I came back and this same friend of mine who I went to Dayton, Ohio, Debbie [ph.], who was my roommate here she come again: "Girl, I'm working on the Trans Alaska Pipeline [Trans Alaska Pipeline System].  There's better days ahead," (laughter).  "Girl I'm making more money than we ever made."  When she go through talking to me, I was just seeing dollar signs, ching-ching, right?  So here we go.  This is like 1976, December.  And so we're making plans.  So we're have--so she's home on R and R [rest and relaxation], you know, and, and she's talking to me about coming out.  So the January I decide I'm going to go to Cali- to Fairbanks, Alaska and get a job on the Trans Alaska Pipeline.  So I had stayed, you know, here in Denver [Colorado] for maybe about six to eight weeks from Africa before I went to Fairbanks, Alaska.  And I remember going to Fairbanks, it was like the 28th of December--no the 28th of January, 1977.  Twenty-eight degrees below zero, Fairbanks, Alaska.  Girl, it was so cold and out of all the places on the planet not to have the plane connected to the terminal.  You had to walk down the steps through this path of snow to get into the terminal.  I was freezing.  So I got to the door and I was just like whoo, then I start backing back up and then we let more people out, and then I come back to the door I was like whoo, you know, I back back up and finally they're like, "Ma'am, you know, you'll just have to deplane."  I'm like, "Okay I'm coming, just a minute, just a minute I'm coming, I'm coming."  And in--so I finally deplaned and it was--me and my girlfriend Debbie and, and we had some friends from Denver who were there and we lived at three quarter mile, Bradway Road, which was in the area called North Pole [Alaska] outside of Fairbanks, and the most happening thing there was Santa's workshop [Santa Claus House].  And you go and they have the little elves and they were sewing, you know, sawing and, you know, we had to walk that three quarter miles to get back to this apartment and it was stacked.  I mean there were like, it was a two bedroom apartment and it was like seven adults and like three kids.  I mean it was like ridiculous.  And everybody, we had this dream of getting on the pipeline 'cause you could make this big money.  But you had to have residency, you know, card.  And you had to have--there're certain expectations that you had to meet.  And so we were--we struggled for probably about six weeks before I actually got on the line, you know.  And, but we were going to the Salvation Army, we're trying to get food stamps and they're like, "You go see Captain Emory [ph.], you know, he's got--he can give you some, some food basket."  I'm like oh I'm not to take any food handouts, please.  You know, Salvation Army, unh-uh.  So we went back again and it's like oh your papers got hung up in Juneau [Alaska] and more red tape and more red tape.  It's like you can to Salvation--I'm like no, unh-uh, no.  And then the third time they say you might--I'm like who's this Sergeant Emory, let me go--.  And went and he gave us a box of like moo- moose meat, and you know, there were other vegetables.  I'm like well, you know, I'm vegetarian, but my girlfriend Debbie, she, she, she worked that moose meat and barbequed it up girl, it was Chicken Licken.  And so I'm like okay I'm in.
Story_ID: 616609
Speaker 1: And it just happened that I had a third class FCC license from the federal communication commission [Federal Communications Commission] to get a job on the pipeline [Trans Alaska Pipeline System] as communication center operator.  So there go my communication skills, you know, it did serve me to have that license.  And I was the air ground communications operator.  So these camps were spread--there were thirty-three camps spread the whole length of Alaska, from Valdez [Alaska] all the way up to Prudhoe Bay [Alaska], which is like north of the Arctic Circle.  And in every camp and some of them were so isolated they couldn't even pick up radio or television signals.  So they would record on tape news, two or three hours of programing and then they would drop it by air, bring it by air to each of these camps.  So I would receive it and rebroadcast the, the television.  I had air ground communication, you know, with the helicopters, the medics, the security.  I had four channel based radios, CB radio [citizens band radio], "Breaker, breaker 1-9, you got that brown sugar here, come on," you know (laughter).  And so I talked for twelve hours a day, seven days a week, nine weeks on, two weeks off.  And, and I was a relief operator initially.  So that means--and there were only two people with my job description in--in the camp.  So we had twelve hour shifts.  So if one of them had to go on R and R [rest and relaxation], one of them got sick, they had to fly someone in right away.  So I was a relief, so I got to work up and down the ca- the coast until I got my own camp, which was called Five Mile Camp [Five Mile, Alaska].  It was five miles north of the Arctic Circle.  And that's where I had life there, you know, for almost a year.  And it was pretty cool.  I mean just to get the extremity of, of living in an isolated place, but also the extreme beauty of nature.  And, and you know whenever I did all these little tricks like, you know, when you come about what that's like to live in such an extreme environment, so they'd take a cup of coffee and just throw it up in the air and then just like, you know, the atmosphere just like sucks it up and just little sprinkles of brown on the snow, but that--that was it, you know.  And you know, you don't wanna have nothing cold and put your hand on metal, you know, that kind of thing.  And then when we would take R and R and go into Fairbanks [Alaska], they would have--the way they would compete, the clubs would compete would be not who had the best entertainment, but who had these electrical hitching posts in their parking lot so that you could plug your car up and it would keep the radiator hot--warm while you go in and party.  Otherwise, ever hour, hour and a half you gotta put on your coat, your gloves, and everything, come back, start your car up so that the block doesn't freeze, you know.  It was just, just funny just, just living there.  They had a little 7-Eleven.  You know, in the summer everybody runs for the ice cream man, like the children run for the ice cream man in the summer.  In the winter, the adults run for the ice cream man, 'cause the ice cream man got cigarettes, bread, you know, newspapers, whatever you want.  So they, they, they did it that way.  So I worked up there for about an hour--I made more money than I ever had had in my life.  I was like, you know, I'm like, you know, my late twenties then.  So I don't know now it probably was like thirty-five thousand dollars for the year, which at that time was an exorbitant amount of money, you know, and that's when the na- the safari jackets were out, having all of those pockets.  When I came home for R and R, I had hundred dollar bills in every pocket, you know.  And I gave everybody in my family hundred dollar bills for Christmas.  And you know, I wrapped them in funny paper, put it in the box, put in the box, put in the box, put in the box like that.  I bought a car new, I bought my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson] an organ, cash.  And she was just--she had this surgery and she had this ganglion on her hand.  She needed exercise, they gave her a ball.  But she, she played the piano so she wanted to try the organ.  So she was trying this one and trying that one, I'm like, "Which one do you want?"  She, "Oh I think I like this one."  I'm like, "Okay we'll take this one."  "Well ma'am we can put you on a payment plan and--," I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no, cash," you know.  And my mom was like, "Ooh," (gesture).  I'm like, "Come on let's be cool, let's be cool," you know.  I was just starting to stick my tongue out--stick my chest out, you know, like I had the opportunity to do that.
Story_ID: 616610
Speaker 1: But it was sweet, it was sweet (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you also said in Alaska is where you did have an opportunity to meet Eldridge Cleaver, is that right?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So, so the flip was, so that was like '77 [1977].  So then I flipped back to Alaska for a little bit--I mean I flipped back to Africa, and then I came back again to Alaska and that was 1980.  So we can just fast forward to 1980.  And then I was living in Anchorage [Alaska].  So I'm off the pipeline [Trans Alaska Pipeline System], I'm actually living in community.  I'm working in a group home for teenage girls [Salvation Army Booth Memorial Home, Anchorage, Alaska].  And Eldridge Cleaver came during that time, 1980s, and he had gone through his experience in Algiers [Algeria] and, and now had came back as very patriotic and they had invited the audience, said that Mr. Cleaver felt like that for the most part American audiences are not patriotic, he preferred that we say the Pledge of Allegiance before he speaks.  And I was just like oh, I was just incensed, I--I'm like wait a minute I can't believe this.  So I sat down, you know, I didn't even get up when they said the Pledge of Allegiance, you know.  And then he came and he told his story about his appreciation for America and what having to be on the run how that impacted his world and how, you know, the Black Panther Party was challenging like this no knock law that the police could come and not knock on your door and just like break in if they suspect that you have anything without even having a warrant, and how a lot of his time was resisting that and writing about that in the papers.  But he said when they went to--when he went to Algiers, they didn't even have a no knock law, they didn't even need a law because they would just come and roll down your house with a steamroller.  You know, they just roll down the whole side of your house, you know, and that there weren't the kind of rules to protect, you know--.  So what he had challenged before, he saw in a larger perspective.  And then he talked about how then he ran to Paris [France] and he was having this breakdown moment where he wanted to, to commit suicide and he was looking at the moon, he saw Chairman Mao Zedong and we always quoted from the red book about Mao Zedong ['Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung'] and then he said he saw images of Buddha and then ultimately he saw the image of Jesus.  And this image of Jesus told him that it wasn't worth him taking his own life, you know.  And then he started, you know, talking about his transformation.  And then, you know, we were taking questions from the floor and, and I couldn't, it was just like my, my hero had collapsed right in front of my face, you know.  I'm like wait a minute, what happened, you know.  And then he challenged me from the, from the floor.  He's at the podium.  He says, "Well I noticed that you didn't even stand up," excuse me, "when we said the Pledge of Allegiance."  And I'm like, "You're the one who taught me that that flag was a rag, and now you switched up," you know.  It was like I couldn't even get--I was just like--it really messed up my core.  And then he gave me a--what was hard talk at that time, but ultimately was a gift to say well look, you know what, I'm on my own path, you go on your path, don't let me be your mentor 'cause I'm having to do what fits for me at this time.  And I honor being honest over being consistent.  So if you need to take that--a lesson from that and do the same for yourself.  I mean he just like (makes sounds) cut me up.  And I felt like emotionally wounded.  How much I had, you know, given of my energy and, and my worldview and my conversation, and you know, it was just like he pulled the rug right out from under me.  And it actually took me a while to recover and it--but it was so much more freedom, you know.  I mean he really gave me--it was a hard lesson, but he really gave me a gift of freedom.  A freedom of really being--to be honest over being consistent.  And I've seen that pattern play out in my life, where there's times where I've had to back up and say, hey, wait a minute, you know, is this what I'm feeling or you know, you know is this really  serving me or am I trying to please another.  You know, is this, you know, serving my highest and best good or am I doing this 'cause I want you to like me.  You know, so he's giving me opportunity, but that was a hard piece of lesson 'cause so much of my life was driven by, you know, the icon.  Then, then he started making pants, girl, that had three legs.  I was like okay I'm done (laughter).
Story_ID: 616611
Speaker 1: So now, you're living in Anchorage [Alaska] and you're working in a group home you said?
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A girls group home?  And you have traveled back and forth to Africa--
Speaker 2: Couple of times.
Speaker 1: --a couple of times now.  And you talk about that's when you listened to be able to understand what it was to tell stories, but when did you actually start telling stories?
Speaker 2: In that group home for teenage girls.  And you know, the--the smallest kernel of story is metaphor.  And so this is a long term residential therapeutic community.  And these girls were twelve to eighteen years old.  And this place locally was called--it was the Salvation Army Booth Memorial Home [Anchorage, Alaska], but locally it was called last stop hotel, meaning that this is the last stop before long term incarceration.  So they, you know, were presented--we had a mother-infant program, some of them were pregnant trying to make decisions about their baby.  Some of them had been picked up for car theft, check writing, prostitution, drug pushing.  So they were pretty hardcore.  So to be able to get through this girl's defenses I had to use metaphors to compare this girl to a rose for example, that had the potential to bloom, but also had thorns in terms of those negative behaviors that could keep her going in circles.  Or had weeds and rocks, or, or, you know, I'm like, so Raina [ph.], if this plant is wilting how much makeup can we put on, how many new pairs of jeans, you know, can we put--or maybe we need to water the roots, you know.  So they were a lot more responsive to that line of reasoning than you did the crime so pay the time.  So then I began to look for stories that dealt with self esteem and decision making, and coping skills and conflict resolution.  So I can use stories like--a very traditional story in the African American community is the signifying monkey.  And signifying monkey, you know, plays hey lets you and him fight, you know.  The monkey and the lion they got to talking one day.  And the monkey said, "Lion I hear you're the king in every way," but he said, "I know somebody who don't think that's true.  He said he can whoop the living daylights out of you."  The lion said, "Who?"  So then it goes on to see how he began to play, let's you and him fight.  So then I could use that to say well how many of you have ever known anyone who played that game: let's you and him fight.  I'm glad you're being so honest.  How many of you have ever been that signifying monkey?  Yeah.  So then, what could you do differently?  So then I can en- engage into that conversation.
Story_ID: 616612
Speaker 1: You were speaking about, about the group home [Salvation Army Booth Memorial Home, Anchorage, Alaska] and how you found your, your voice, I guess, to be able to use metaphor to, to help the young women.  And com- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --complete that story because I know we had to stop on the end of the other tape?
Speaker 2: Well I was just giving you a flavor of how the signifying monkey works as--and that was probably one of the first stories that I learned, but the signifying monkey was used as an example of conflict resolution.  So I began to look for other stories for that population around self esteem, around decision making.  And I was working with Anglo, with Eskimo, preferably--pretty much Inupiat, with Indians [Native American] and they have a strong oral tradition so it was easy to bring in questions or bring in proverbs or bring in stories that they could begin to reflect on how can they make different choices.  So it's about choice, really.  And being in that community I also began--started working with a Kwanzaa celebration in the African American community.  We started an organization the Ujima--no, the Kuumba Artist [ph.].  So began to call artists in the--in the area together who were visual artists, performing artists, and we did things like Juneteenth celebration, we did Kwanzaa celebrations, and so began in to develop, you know, a cultural voice in the community.  I pledged Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] during the time and you know, part of their graduate chapter.  And the basic lesson I think of just being in that time was--the counseling piece was, was good and just being with our young people and just, just seeing how important it is, you know, for them to, to have support and, and guidance at critical times in, in their lives.  So I was able to make a difference hopefully, you know, in that arena.
Story_ID: 616613
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty [1980], I came back, again my [maternal] grandma [Jessie Howard] got sick and that was interesting 'cause I really had a job in Puerto Rico, but I stopped in Denver [Colorado] to check on my grandma and she just had an appointment to go to the doctor and they end up taking her to the hospital and then ultimately she went to a nursing home.  She never came back to her house from that doctor's appointment.  And I decided to stay in Denver.  And from--so from 1980 I've pretty much been here as my base.  I worked at Adams County public library as a media, public, public affairs person.  So I was still, still writing and press releases and in charge of the audiovisual collections for Adams County public library.  And it was a thirty hour job.  So I began to pick up storytelling on the side, you know.  But I was also producing storytelling hours working with the children's librarians.  Producing storytelling hours for cable television, also producing adult public affairs programming.  That I won an award for a program I did on literacy in Colorado.  And I interviewed Famous Amos [Wally Amos], the cookie magnate, who was the spokesman for Literacy Volunteers of America.  And so that--that was very meaningful.  So that was another form of storytelling, but it was through video, through the movement.  And but I was beginning to pick up so much work storytelling that I had like thirty hours of storytelling and thirty hours at Adams County public library which like was a sixty hour week.  So I knew I had to make a decision.  And so when I decided to go I started saving my money and you know, getting my dental work done 'cause I was getting ready to break camp.  And, and it was 1983 in March where there's a National Storytelling Conference held here in Denver.  And at the end of the conference they have a place, you know, for a story swap, or new people to bring their story forward.  And I brought Sojourner Truth.  And she was probably the first historical character who came through me.  Excuse me.  And I say through me because she was six foot tall and so am I.  And I just kind of feel her speaking in my ear.  And I came forward and I did the speech called Ain't I a Woman?  And it was a speech that she, she gave at a Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio in 1855 [sic. 1851].  And they were afraid for her to speak because they thought that the women's--the issue of women's rights be con- be confused with colored folk's rights.  But she just took the stage anyway.  And she said, "Well children, why there so much racket?  It seems to me there's something out of kilter.  Now I think between the white women in the North and, and the women in the South all working for our rights, the white man be in a heck of a fix pretty soon."  So she went on to, to speak her truth, you know.  And it was so well received that--at this conference there were a lot of librarians and teachers and they became probably my first line of support to invite me into the schools, do school assemblies, to be in the library programs.  And so it's beg- it's just kind of developed from there, you know.  I've joined the National Association of Black Storytellers.  I was at their first gathering and we're celebrating twenty-five years now.  Nineteen eighty-six [1986], you know, I've been telling as full time storytelling as an independent way of making my life and my livelihood since 1986.  You know, paying my car, and paying my mortgage and so it's, it's been a journey.  It's been quite a journey.
Story_ID: 616614
Speaker 1: How do you develop the stories?
Speaker 2: Well I work--I probably work right now, I work probably about 40 percent, 40/50 percent education in schools and universities, and maybe 40 percent around mental health, you know, working with youth and detention, working with battered women, working with you know, mental health kind of community pieces.  And then probably another 20 percent, 25 in corporate settings.  So it kind of depends on, you know, what audience I'm developing, you know, my material for.  But some stories I hear, some stories I research.  Some stories are passed on to me.  It, it just kind of varies.
Speaker 1: Well Columbine, the shooting at the Columbine High School [Columbine, Colorado].  You worked with those students after that tragedy, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I--and I worked with the teachers first--I worked with the teachers over a period of time before they invited me to, to, to speak to their children which is kind of interesting.  And, and the question that they had for me is like why Columbine, which I thought was pretty ironic to me is like, my question to you is like why not Columbine?  You know do you think because you're in a suburban ring or you're because affluent that, you know, the sense of isolation that our children feel, you know, is not felt there and, and, and what happens when that goes unchecked, you know, would not cause violence.  I mean--and so I--so again the metaphor was, you know, mining is very historical in Colorado.  And one of the things they would use these canaries, you know, in a cage, the miners and they would take them down, you know, into the shafts with them.  And then if they look up and see that, that the, you know, canary's feet is up, you know, bottoms up, you know, they would suspect that there's some noxious gas that has been released and it's time to get outta there.  And so I just said our children of color have been those canaries for a long time.  But now the miners are dying.  So now it's time to pay attention.  So and I talked to them about the role of the elders, you know, like, you know, after Columbine jumped off, you know, they were all over the country, you know, these school shootings, this violence was happening.  And I'm like there's not an instruction manual for school shootings.  But what I do know is a role of elder is that you have an experience such that you're able to condense that experience into a lesson such that you can offer it back as some wisdom.  So what can you--what voice can you be for these other schools that are jumping off across this country?
Story_ID: 616615
Speaker 1: And then--and this is (playing mbira) I think a story I may have told them, just in a concept of having them look at--.  There were--and this was the teachers [at Columbine High School, Columbine, Colorado], you know.  And then I came to them also like a year after and they were still very, they didn't want the press to be there, so it was very secretive.  It's like call this Thursday night and we'll tell you where we're at Friday morning, you know, and they were holed up in some hotel, you know, in Golden [Colorado], outside the city.  It was a hard time for them.  So once upon a time, a man and his son went on a long journey.  The road was long, it was hot, it was hard.  Sometimes the rocks would hurt their feet.  Sometimes they thirsted for water.  Sometimes they could barely identify the road, but it was always there.  And then as they approached the village of their destination, they went to sit down under the shade of the baobab tree.  And then just as they sat down, then the father saw an elder couple coming down the road and he jumped up and he went to them and said, "Ah!  Asante sana, asante sana, (unclear); thank you, thank you elder for your assistance on our journey today."  And the old man smiled and the old woman nodded, (playing mbira) and they went down the dusty road.  So then the father went and sat down next to the son and the son said, "Ah, ah, baba," he said, "why do you thank that old man, that old woman, eh?"  He said, "Today our journey has been long, it's been hot, it's been hard, and that old man and that old woman, they didn't help us.  Why do you thank them?"  And the father said, "Yes son, it's true," he said, "me too, I felt the rocks, I felt the heat, I thirsted for water," he said, "but did you notice child at times we could barely identify the road, it was always there?"  And the son said, "Yes baba."  He said, "It was the feet of that man, the feet of that woman and those like them and those who came before them who created such a path," he says, "so remember my child, and hold it in your heart very dear: it is those who came before us who made it possible for us to be here."  So it's part about using a metaphor I think that people can relate to, 'cause stories help us see ourselves in a nonthreatening way.  And that's the way it teaches I think without preaching, they say if the shoe fits, you know, to wear it.
Story_ID: 616616
Speaker 1: And there's this thing called fable singing that--I've heard the term the first time in the Caribbean.  Then I've heard it a few times in West Africa.  I, I go back to the Gambia now, that's where my cultural base is, where the traditions that I stand in.  And had my DNA tested that takes me back to the--to Guinea, which is the same tradition that I was standing in before I even found out about the DNA, you know, of, of the Mandinka people who are also from Guinea.  And this idea of fable singing, this is, once a griot, a djeli, a storyteller, grows into the depth of their craft, they develop this skill called fable singing and it's like not actually singing, but telling a story in a rhythmic cadence such that the person hearing that story becomes not hypnotized, but becomes involved and begin to experience themselves as the hero in that story such that on the completion that they also feel a shift.  And there are specific kinds of tales, you know, there's the healing tale where they feel when they come out that there's something, some message there.  Something that they can do or some way that healing is coming or some opening that they have.  There is the, the teaching tale where you pass on, you know, the wisdom from one generation to the other.  And there is the tale for the newborn that is spoken not to the mother but to the unborn child to encourage him to have a safe place.  And then the only one that you can't change is the deathing tale.  But the one telling the tale and the one who has--is in transition will hear sign posts along the way.  And, and I think this instrument has been a tool for me in (playing mbira) in that ritual work in that ceremony.  When I say ritual I think of simply making sacred.  And so I've been called to do a lot of work around life cycles, the weddings, the births, the deaths in that way.
Story_ID: 616617
Speaker 1: My sister friend, Diane Ferlatte, shared this rap with me that I use a lot.  I do broom jumping ceremonies at weddings.  And then I sit with them before the ceremony to speak, you know, what's, what's soul for them and what their commitments are and you know, just to know how to be with them in ritual space.  But will say: "Jumping the broom is one of the ways for gotten married in the slavery days.  The two stood upon the land, the elder held the broomstick in his hand.  Jump high, jump low.  The elder gave the signal for them to go, and they jumped oh, they jumped oh, and when the wedding was almost through, the bride picked up the broom, she had work to do.  If you don't believe me check your history 'cause that's the way the story is told to me, told to me, told to me."  So I create an experience so that the people in that arena can also take a leap in consciousness.  So when this couple jumps, you know, I want you to take a leap.  Where in your world are you doing something that you know is making your life smaller?  And, and where in your world are you doing something or you would like to do something that makes your life bigger?  Jump from that place into this one.  So when they jump, you take a leap in consciousness.  So everybody gets the movement that we can hold the space for this couple to come through.
Story_ID: 616618
Speaker 1: So I do a lot of work around life cycles, you know.  So a lot of my work is, you know, I'm telling the stories, but I'm getting a lot more calls these days for ritual and ceremonies.
Speaker 2: For what I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Ritual and ceremonies.  I do white bird releases at funerals.
Speaker 2: What does that signify?
Speaker 1: So I work for this business called White Birds Unlimited [Arvada, Colorado].  So we talk about the, the symbol of the dove as being one that is loyal, they, they mate for life, they represent love.  God so loved the dove that he sent a dove on the day that Jesus was baptized.  And in Psalm 55:5 [sic. Psalm 55:6] they say, "Yea though I can fly on the wings of a dove and find peace."  We talk--I talk about how when you watch these birds take off and I have different ceremonies, one's a three bird, a twelve bird, a twenty-one bird salute for retired military.  When you watch these birds take off, notice the exuberance that they, that they fly, but at some point they're gonna move outside of your sight.  That doesn't mean that they no longer exist; that means that they exist outside of our sight.  Such is the same with your loved one.  Yes, this person has experienced this thing called death, but our faith teaches us that there is everlasting life, that these birds are simply an escort for her final flight or his final flight.  And so then I let the twelve birds go, or the three birds, or what and I always hold one back to represent the deceased.  Are there any prayers that you wanna offer for this, this one to take to the other side?  So the others are flying and then I let this one go and there's always some incredible divination in the sky, you know.  And, and the family, they make up whatever, you know, works for them, you know.  They'll hold their breath until this one catches up with the group and they'll click up and then they'll fly together or sometimes they don't, they just wanna fly the other way.  And they say, "Oh she always was like that; she always been a loner," you know.  But it, it kind of gives people a release.  And, and really what they're doing, they're homing pigeons, so they go back to the loft.  And when they come out, they're making these grand circle, okay here's the mountains, here's the Denver [Colorado] skyline, home is this way, you know.  But it gives people a release, you know.
Story_ID: 616619
Speaker 1: This is a mbira (playing mbira). It's an African thumb piano.  It's a gourd (makes sound) like a pumpkin or a squash, and all my instruments that I play are gourds.  And I play small percussion, I play shakere, I play the balafon.  I'll play a little bit of harmonica and then I'll play this mbira.  And what I've got is that this is considered a healing instrument in Zimbabwe where these instruments come from.  They have, what they call, mbira ceremonies.  And it's a healing ceremony.  And people will come on the foot paths from all over the country into a particular compound and they will have the mbira players there.  There may be a dozen of them.  And they will play nonstop.  I mean some will come, some will go, but the music continues, nonstop, three or four days at a time, because they get the vibration of sound has the ability to penetrate and to move mass, you know, body mass like a tumorous mass, the vibration of it will, will shake it such that it becomes maybe a softer gelatinous solution that when you drink water will wash away.  That--and made me see that--there used to be this commercial on television where they were celebrating, "Is it live or is it Memorex?"  And, and they had Ella Fitzgerald singing this high note and it cracked the glass, you know, and then they put it on the tape.  So you can see that music, that sound has a vibration, it can actually move mass.  So I have been not just playing, but praying the mbira.  And it has been a tool for people when I'm--particularly who are making transition.  Our city councilman you, you saw on the video he died of prostate cancer, but in his last days, you know, I would come and be with him and talk with him, and, and really play the music.  And the music was the thing that allowed him to, to really settle down.  So first I would give him a pattern--you--like, like just a scale and maybe an affirmation, you know.  These are tuned differently.  (Playing mbira)  So I'd give him an affirmation (singing), "I am healing my divine self.  My divine self is healing me."  So he--sometimes he would sing that with me, but I would just incorporate it in the music.  And then there came a time when Hiawatha [Hiawatha Davis, Jr.] couldn't, he couldn't say the words, but he just moved his mouth.  And sometimes he couldn't move his mouth, he could just hear the sound.  But every time he would hear that scale, he would know.  And then when he actually died, he was a city councilman here [Denver, Colorado] for whoa, sixteen or twenty years, and you know, he laid in state, the people could come.  And they had me to go to radio station and put my music down and they played it as a loop when people came.  And you know, we're used to 'Precious Lord, Take My Hand' ['Take My Hand, Precious Lord'], 'Amazing Grace.'  I mean, you know, we got our national black funeral anthems, you know, 'His Eye's on the Sparrow' ['His Eye Is on the Sparrow'].  And, and it's like we're programmed 'cause we be--I could go down the street past the, the mortuary and you could just hear that music (makes sounds).  "What's the matter?"  "I don't know who died it's just that music," you know (laughter).  I shouldn't be laughing.  But then we put this on a CD [compact disc] and when people came in, they were just like, "Ooh that's different."  And then I could just see them, you know, just relax and it's like okay, yeah, you know, we can do this, we can do this.
Story_ID: 616620
Speaker 1: I've done a lot of transitions, you know.  I've seen a lot of people die.  And I've seen a lot of people get married.  And, and then the babies, you know, welcoming new spirits.  The naming of a child is so important.  So I do a lot of baby naming ceremonies 'cause that's when their presence is recognized, their place in the circle is when they're given their name.  And so it's a belief that every child should have an adult to champion them in addition to their parents.  And most parents, you know, godparents they don't know what to do.  They driving around, God forbid, hoping that the parents don't have a wreck so that the child don't come to them.  And most time the child doesn't 'cause they haven't been in their life, they don't know what their jobs are.  So I will sit with, with couples and, and I'm like, you know, have a parent or a godparents, or the last group was a god family, you know.  She has some girlfriends, he has some boyfriends, they had also a married couple.  And talk about, why do you choose these people in your world and how do you want them to show up for your child?  And how willing are you for them to do that, you know.  When you're talking about, don't get in my business, you know.  Let's define this and how do you wanna play.  You know, are you a, you know, weekend, weekend person, are you gonna show up on Christmas or you know, what does that look like for you, you know.  And help them to define their relationship.  And so the sister was like, "Sister, I love the way you travel.  I want you to teach my child what that's like, expose her to the world," you know.  "Brother you work for the bank, teach my child about money," you know, "just do that."  You know, "Brother, you know you are my brother."  He said, "You are my brother, mom and dad died when I was ten, you were the keeper of the family story, teach my child about our family."  So when they got specific assignments then they tend to show up more in it.  Now I've got a baby who is sixteen and I did their--their ceremony and it was just like on like popcorn, you know.  And to see their family is still together.  And then I also have them create Godparents Day.  I'm, I'm working on creating a national holiday, the Friday after Thanksgiving, that's the day when the children honor the godparents.  'Cause see we don't usually hook that up too.
Story_ID: 616621
Speaker 1: Gratitude is a big thing though, we--our children, this generation, just learning gratitude, just something.  I mean I have nieces, a nephew.  I, I bought my nephew a jacket, a Bronco [Denver Broncos] jacket, and I--I dropped a good little piece of money.  I gave it to him, he said, "All right."  All right (laughter)?  "Wait a minute, you roll back up in here.  I thought we went through this already.  Look you need to--don't leave this house without please in one pocket and thank you in another," you know.  We had--so we had to teach him back some basics, you know.  But you know, the baby naming, the deathing, the birthing, and now I'm getting youth requests.  You know, my nephew, he started driving, you know, and, and they bought his car at an auction.  And it wasn't a car, it was a big old 4x4 Bronco [Ford Bronco] sixteen passenger or something, I don't know, I'm like, "You could kill somebody in that, you know.  I think we need to, you know, you show up at Mom's next Sunday and I want you to write out who you're willing to be in the matter about safety with this car.  What are you planning to do, what's your plan?  Meet me at Mom's at three."  So in the meantime, the family shows up.  We meet him on Sunday and I've got petals from the Petal Shop [Denver, Colorado], you know, just after they trim their flowers and I circled the whole car.  And then we had, we opened the doors, opened the hood and I got--his mom and his dad, who's my brother and sister-in-law, my mom [Mary Howard Edmonson] and my dad [Pugh's stepfather, Thomas Edmonson].  And then you know, I just got a smudge stick of sage that's burning and they're just passing it back and forth and they're just blessing this car, you know, and you know, that it might work right, that he might have good common sense that, you know.  And then I'm asking him, "What is your commitment?"  He said, "Well I won't ride with more than three people, no, two--one in the car at a time.  I won't drink and drive.  I'll observe the, the rules of the road, you know.  I'll keep the--honest on the speed limit, you know."  Whatever commitment, "I'm working part time, I'll help pay for my insurance," you know, what is your commitment.  So then we put him in the circle, okay.  And then all the family offered him a bead and a blessing, you know.  So my, my father gave him a bead of a little truck, he said, you know, "I'll just remind you that, you know, my first car was a mule," (laughter) you know, "so you need to be grateful."  So he strung those beads up, he hung it on his rearview mirror and he remembered that day, you know.  And well, if you're wrapping up I'll just, say it was well done.
Story_ID: 616622
Speaker 1: So continue talking about, about your work and the different rituals that you perform?
Speaker 2: So I was talking about the youth.  And I've been called to do what I'm calling roots and wings ceremonies.  And what that looks like are young people going to college who are about to take their own step and take their own wings into their world, and what that's like to separate from their parents and from their family.  And to create an opportunity for blessing them.  Because you always want your children to, to show up with the highest and the best and to make good decisions, and it's like we can't always be there to make the decision.  And look, we're living in a time where, you know, you can have sex, you can have a child, you can keep that child, you can give it away, you can have an abortion, you can marry your mate, you cannot marry your mate, you can--you're making me the same sex, or you know, and all of that is all right, you know.  It's like well, you can't decide for them but I think it's important to encourage them to be good decision makers.  And what the roots and wings looks like, at least it looks different for every family.  But the fact that people are looking for something to acknowledge.  Like I did one for a single parent, a mother and daughter, daughter is going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And they were just kind of like enmeshed in their relationship and they knew it, that there, there was some boundaries that they weren't really honoring.  I mean even, in fact the mom used her email address of her daughter's name and a lot of the things that she was--kind of like living her life through her daughter's accomplishment and you know, just really--.  So I'm like--and the daughter is like ready to go, you know, 'cause she's really feeling smothered.  And so just to have a conversation with them, to invite the family and to invite her to gift this child and, and let her know that she's gonna be all right.  'Cause that was the thing, the daughter was concerned that mom is gonna fall apart because she's kind of holding mom's emotional energy.  But for mom to give this child a blessing and a releasing, and, and realize that she's already given her the tools that she needs to live life.  And that's what she did.  She used the seven principles of Kwanzaa and she gave her a gift for each of the days that we celebrate Kwanzaa.  Something for unity, for self determination, for collective work and responsibility, for cooperative economics, creativity, purpose and faith.  And she gave her gifts that represent each of those principles that she wanted her to live in her life.  And it was very moving, it was very touching.  And then I used a, a clothesline, a cotton clothesline wire and wrapped it around mom's waist and around baby girl's waist and had maybe six feet between them.  And just talked about when they separated the first time, the umbilical cord, that they didn't die, but she gave her permission to come physically into the world.  And now we're at another cutting of the cord, for her to be able to fly emotionally and spiritually into the world.  And so they both had support.  So baby girl had her brother who I had him tie a ribbon and mom had her sister who tied a ribbon on the cord so that they didn't bleed out.  And then I gave them two dull knives and had them to cut this cord.  And mom was kind of like oh man this thing is so dull, what you give me a dull--you know.  Baby girl, she was just like (makes sounds) (laughter) (makes sound) you know, freedom, you know.  And it was like, I've got letters from her from Howard and mom has come back through, and you know, they just say that just creating that sacred space gave them a chance to zero out their meter and to have a conversation on another level.
Story_ID: 616623
Speaker 1: And I think that, you know, if there's anything that I want to be remembered for would be hopefully holding space for that kind of, of ritual.  There's just so much more need.  The more technology that we have growing, I think more people are pulling away from that direct connection of, of ritual, of ceremony of, you know, individual things.  And I also do it in, in community, you know.  There was a terrible car wreck on Colorado Boulevard [Denver, Colorado] and one of our members of our community's daughter lost her husband, and four year old child was in the car.  And so, you know, I went back to that site, you know, and you could see the, the torn up branches and the trees are scarred and there's glass all over and you know, I just found a little mirror that the baby had, you know, to give that back to the mother.  And also to call the drummer to go with me and to somehow relieve the energy of that site, you know, to engage that husband to say don't worry, your wife, your child is gonna be okay, you know.  To do whatever you need to do on the other side, they're gonna be okay, we're gonna support them, you know.  You did what you did, you gave them life, you know, you did the best you could in this life that you lived.  But somehow to release that charge, you know, in the community setting.  So there're just different places, you know, I--I judge that spirit has called me to, to do that work.  And I, I--and I really do feel it as, as a calling.  And as an honor, you know, to be able to, to hold that space, which is a way the traditional African griot is.  The griot is the one who helps resolve conflicts in the community; the one who remembers the ancestral genealogy, the one who passes down the stories and the wisdom; and the one who, you know, challenges the misuse of power and the lack of responsibility.  And I see myself in this 20th century way of being like the griots of old, they would travel by road or by foot, you know, by horse or by donkey, I don't know, I gotta, I gotta, you know, pretty beat up 2000 Subaru that gets me where I'm going.  But as an opportunity to kind of work in, in that similar way.  And I think that it's critical, it's critical to use the cultural arts.  And, and it's an opportunity for me to stand in my mission, and my mission at this point is, is to use the cultural arts for the healing, the empowerment and the celebration of the human spirit.  And my work personally, as my own personal mission, is to raise the veil, to claim my gifts, to speak my truth, and to nurture myself s- that I can nurture others.
Story_ID: 616624
Speaker 1: What has happened in this past year is it's, it's shown like a two way street.  In February I had an opportunity for a Fulbright Scholarship to go to Taiwan and to present at the University of Taiwan [National Taiwan University] in Taipei [Taiwan].  And the same day I signed the contract and went to get my shots updated for my passport, I found out that the, the bone marrow cancer that had been in remission for four years was actively back.  I was like oh man, not now, I just need a few more weeks, you know (laughter).  So I got a second opinion, I got a third opinion, and it showed up like I needed to do some work.  And I'm a very natural, grassroots, raw food, wheat grass, acupuncture, yoga, you know, candle burning, earth shoe walking, you know, natural hair wearing piece of somebody (laughter).  So the idea of being faced with the possibility of chemotherapy was not a path that ever thought that I would--I ever thought that I would have to go down.  And I had a naturopath who said, "Well Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh], this is the deal. The state of your cancer at this point is very aggressive."  She said, "Consider the state of your disease being like Charlie Manson [Charles Manson] coming at you with a hatchet.  To use natural intervention alone would be tantamount to dropping on your knees and praying to God that somehow Charlie will get his foot caught in the carpet and go down.  But to use traditional method, in this case, chemotherapy would be like having a hand gun," (gesture), "(makes sound), then take him out."  She said, "But don't stop praying because, you know, the--we find people who have the best support are those who walk both paths so that you can do this work they give you time now and the opportunity to come back to a natural path."  And so for--that was a major shift for me.  And I have been she who walks both paths.  But also in the community, you know, that they've shown up and they said well, you know, traditionally--you know, 'cause here I have no health, no medical, no sick pay, no workman or workwoman's compensation and I feel like I just failed self preservation 101.  And what showed up was this, this impetus in the community to come forward and to do a fundraiser for me such that it took the pressure off of, you know, keeping my mortgage going and keeping it out of foreclosure and, and just to see how my community shows up on my behalf was, was awesome.  And then the many ways that, that, that has happened.  So that's--that's a gratitude.  And so we had this fundraiser and it was kind of like surreal, because it's like the people that I met at all different walks of my life, you know, the red women's association was there, the Fante tribe, the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], the elders seniors group, the, the marching band, the, you know, and they're like, "You remember Pookie [ph.]?  You did his baby naming ceremony. Now he fourteen and he's six foot tall," you know.  It's like wow, you know, it was really like going to my funeral without having to die.  So that was cool.
Story_ID: 616625
Speaker 1: I'm six weeks out now from the chemo [chemotherapy].  And I'm in a pla- and I had a birthday on Friday and I'm in a grateful place, you know, to, to be clear at this point from the disease, and in a space of gratitude.  I mean on my birthday I, you know, everybody said, "Come--go and come--," I really just stayed home.  I made a fire in the backyard and wrote a hundred gratitudes down, you know.  Because I think that what sickness gives us an opportunity is to, to listen to the spirit, maybe there's another song that I need to sing.  Maybe there's a--it's an opportunity for me to look at how I've been living my life in such a way that there are new lessons that are trying to come through.  Bone marrow cancer, you know, when I think of the bone, what is the metaphor of the bone.  African shaman Malidoma Some [Malidoma Patrice Some] says that the bones are the stones of the mother earth.  That they hold the deep memory.  That the bones are what supports our structure and the structure of the universe.  And so my question to myself, well what is it that I need to remember, you know, or what is it I need to forget, you know, and how do I need to shift the structure.  And you know, I think the structure has to do with self care, and self care has not been my highest forte, but I think the opportunity that spirit has given me now is to learn how to take care of myself in ways that count.  And learn how to stand in a place of self acceptance, you know, self care, self discipline and just remember who I am and whose I am.  You know, I'm a ray of the sun, never disconnected from the source.  And so to be able to use the cultural arts in that space like--and ask the questions.  The elders in Africa say when you find yourself faced on the carpet and spread too thin, or when you find yourself snapping at people you know you love, how do you call your spirit back?  And they said the best way is inquiry.  I went to Ghana in 2000 with the national Association of Black Psychologists.  And we had a chance to sit with some of the elders.  And they said, "Inquiry, asking the question, is a powerful place to stand, even more than the answer."  He said, "In America you all think you God's own country, you got all the answers."  He said, "And there's specific questions."  You know, when you're stuck, like when did I stop singing, you know, the question like when did I stop singing.  And, and not just singing the song, but when did I stop speaking my truth, you know, where--.  And, and, you know, when things get rough or I get emotionally charged or there's something I need to say that I can't get out, I can feel it in my throat, you know.  And we all have those moments, you know, where, you know, somebody might give you a soul scrape or shut you down and you didn't say nothing.  It's like, you go home and you be in the mirror, "And another thing," (laughter), you know, or you just let me get something to eat, that's all right, you know, we'll stuff it down, it's not what we're eating.
Story_ID: 616626
Speaker 1: What is it that you have not done that you, that you want to do?
Speaker 2: Hm, I think right now answer those questions for myself, really use the cultural arts as a healing balm.  I think where spirit has me right now is bring water, carry wood.  Like the most powerful stage for me in my life is my daily world of affairs.  Can I just develop a pattern, new ways of living and new habits of working that support a life flow that's connected to spirit?  I mean I wanna be able to get up in the morning and do my meditation, take a bath, you know, have a rigorous spiritual daily discipline.  Like not leave my house without meditating, like I don't leave my house without brushing my teeth, you know.  To, to honor the food that I bring in my body in--in a way that I'm more conscious and more intentional.  And honor, you know, what I take in period.  The, the things in my ears, the relationships, you know.  I'm just kind of like--if I had a t-shirt that'd say rethink everything.  That's everybody need to reapply.  So what would I need to do in my life, like really tell Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh] what I'm doing right now, what you're giving me the opportunity to do right now.  I think the story I came to tell has not been told.  And it has to do with me telling my own story.  I've been telling other people's stories for over twenty years. This is like my twenty-third year.  And you know I do have a few personal stories in there, but for the most, not.  And I've been listening to other people's stories and I've been telling other people's stories, but I think the spirit has brought me to this space, to this place, sitting in front of you to speak my truth.  And that there's no accident, you know, that you're here at this time.  And, and I've been seeing it, you know.  I just had a archives at the Library of Congress [American Folklife Center, Washington, D.C.], you know, two, two months ago.  And then there was a book that came out of the Black American West Museum [Black American West Museum and Heritage Center, Denver, Colorado] about black leaders in the West, and I was included.  So there's like this--this, seems like this surge of, of, of documenting a legacy, you know, that I'm deeply gratified about.  And so one part of me is just like this is awesome, I could just lay this down and it'd give me freedom to do other things.  And I think that's really what it is.  But there's another piece that says well, you know, maybe spirit is getting ready to pull the shift up in here, you know, maybe (laughter)--.  Well none of us getting out of here alive, you know what I'm saying.  But at least I want my story, you know, to be told and that's an opportunity that is--that has been presented (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well you, you talk about--
Story_ID: 616627
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You talk about what you want to be remembered for, but what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well I think memory and legacy is kind of close together, it's--how would--you're making like a distinction?  Help me get the distinction.
Speaker 1: What you wanna leave behind that people will--that it was just--it was you--it was when people hear it or know it that that's something that Opalanga [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh] left for us, you know.  Not only, you know, "I remember her as a nice person."
Speaker 2: Oh okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the legacy is--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, what is it that you want to leave?
Speaker 2: Okay, so when that child is born, you know, we can name ourselves.  I mean, we celebrate Kwanzaa.  You know, the second principle is kujichagulia, self determination.  It says we can name ourselves, speak for ourselves and create for ourselves, instead of being named, spoken or created for by others.  So when that baby is born, be conscious of what name you give that child, you know.  'Cause we can give our children some names.  I'm like stop, or if you go and you give a name that is like just so off the chain, give a definition of that name too.  Do not have these children walking on this planet talking about, "I don't know," you know.  If I hear one more child got a name off another planet and they're clueless as to what it means, our job--we can name ourselves, but I want them to feel like okay Opalanaga would know, 'cause I'll meet them in--in--in the--in the grocery store, "What's your baby name?"  "She's Monqueta [ph.]."  "Oh that's a beautiful name. What does it mean?"  "I don't know."  "Okay your job is not done.  Don't let this child's birthday pass without you giving a meaning to that name."  I want them to be able to slow down their program such that they can pass on the stories so this child will know where he's from.  So when I'm standing in front of these second graders and I ask them well what are your root stories?  How many of you know the story of how your mom and dad met or how your grandparents met, or you know, who is the storyteller in your family?  You know, that they can, can call that name.  That they are being willing to, to document their stories and pass it on.  That they will use Thanksgiving more than just coming together and eating some turkey that they'll back up, you know, "Stand away from the food.  Here's the candle, I'm gonna light this candle and I want everybody to say what your gratitude is before we eat.  I am so grateful to be here and to have this experience today," pass it on.  I want them to take on more responsibility for honoring who we are and whose we are, and telling the story and remembering our names.  And, and, and doing it with some sense of ceremony and grace, and honoring our elders, and encouraging and challenging our youth.  And honoring the ancestors whose shoulders we stand on.  So that, you know, this kid come to me, he said, "You know this guy Malcolm the tenth," he said, "I think he really has some interesting ideas."  I'm like, "Malcolm the tenth?"  And he saw that X and the baby hadn't heard anything about Malcolm X but he--he's had at least enough curiosity, you know.  I want them to under- to learn so they think that Opalanga--I want my boys to come in their head and say you know what, we need to take this another step.  My baby think that Malcolm, Malcolm X is Malcolm the tenth, I need to sit down with him, I need to go to the library with him.  I need to take him to this Kwanzaa celebration.  I need to be--with Juneteenth with him.  I need to slow this down and, and I wanna be able to stand.  I want them to know like if you were arrested and charged with being African American would there be enough evidence to hold you.  I want them to say yes (laughter), I want them to say yes, you know.  So the legacy that I wanna leave is for people to have a heightened awareness and a heightened appreciation of the culture and the role that it plays in healing and holy.  And take it--you know, everybody take their own personal responsibility to, to keep that in place.  Say, "Yeah, Opalanga would be proud, she--yeah, you know, we did that."  Like that.  So, that's, that's the legacy.

Speaker 1: If you could--of course this is gonna be shown generations from now, what, what one message would you send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would--(unclear), I'm, I'm really a stan in the culture, right.  So the word (unclear), I think, came from a Cameroonian language, it means culture.  To, to get that if you find yourself off balance, if you can't seem to find your footing, if you came back to the cultural arts as a healing balm that you can find your center.  And the way to do that is to ask yourself--be more astute in the questions that you ask.  You know, when we get stuck in the tar baby and you know we find we're on fire, the first thing we wanna say is why me?  Why me ain't gonna buy you nothing.  Bam.  You're it, now what?  A more fruitful question might be: Lord what am I to learn from this?  And while I'm having this experience and this lesson, who do I need to share that with in my world?  Ask the questions, when did I stop singing?  Like telling your story, you know, or you know, speaking your truth.  When did I stop dancing?  As long as you can stay in touch with your--your body with your--'cause where I stopped dancing is where I lose touch with my body.  And when I lose touch with my body, I lose touch with that instrument through which the divine expresses.  Because we live on a physical plane, but the only way the divine can come through is through us.  So if, you know, if love is a divine quality somebody's gotta manifest it and give you the hug or we just talking about it, you know.  So you know, when did I stop dancing?  To be in touch with our bodies, with our fore bones, our back bones, so now we have to stand flat footed and speak courageously and feel the breeze with our funny bone, which is my lesson.  Some time we can't take this thing too seriously, to find your sense of humor and let it, let it come forward.  You just--I mean laughter is like the music of God.  With your wishbone, are you living the dream that you came here to live.  If not, you need to re-dream or you know, like I said, rethink everything, yeah reapply.  And, and with those tiny hollow bones that come through our fingers and through our toes, where just, just the mystery of the divine goes through to trust that, you know, they--we--we're not gonna be able to organize everything, it's not gonna look like how we think it is.  There is a mystery for the divine.  So to hold a space for the mystery to, to run through.  So when did I stop singing, when did I stop dancing, when did I stop appreciating stories?  Ask ourselves that question, especially my own.  'Cause sometimes we keep telling the same story and we look up and we somebody else.  So to periodically reauthorize a story that's--live in us, which is what I'm up to.  Reauthorizing the story that live in me.  And then the last one, say when to ask yourself when did I become uncomfortable with that sweet territory of silence.  Every faith tradition has a place for the, the reflective, the contemplative.  You know, they talking about going in your closet and be still.  We live with such (gesture) chatter, with just such movement.  If we can find that quiet center and listen to she who whispers, he who whispers, that there is power there.  So my message to the future generations is be more astute in the questions that you ask and when you find yourself, you know, confused and off base, the way you call your spirit back is stand in a place of intelligent inquiry beginning with: when did I stop singing, when did I stop dancing, when did I stop appreciating stories, especially my own, and when did I become uncomfortable with that sweet territory of silence, and there we will find our center.  So that's the medicine I'm using.
Story_ID: 616629
Speaker 1: I wanna just tell you thank you for taking the time to tell your story because it's going to be, as it already is, but I--I'm speaking about the future generations, that it will be an inspiration to so many other people.  So thank you for taking the time.
Speaker 2: Well thank you, HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers], for making this piece of history.  Blessings on your work and just being willing to hold the space.  It's a profound gift to be heard.  And as a storyteller, I mean, it's like without the listeners, it's like it ain't even happening.  That's just like I think I'm a leader and I'm leading somebody, I look behind me and there nobody there, look I'm just taking a walk. I ain't--(laughter).
