Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 29th, 1946.  My family was living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I was actually born in the suburbs, 'cause that's where the county general hospital was, Wauwatosa.
Speaker 1: So you were born in Wauwatosa?
Speaker 2: Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: W-A-W-A?
Speaker 2: I think it's, W-A-U-W-A-T-O-S-A.  Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, at what was then Milwaukee County General Hospital, and now it's Froedtert hospital [Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin], F-R-O-E-D-E-R-T [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Right now, I'm a contributing editor at The Washington Post.  Before that, I was senior editor at The Washington Post.  Before that, I was deputy managing editor at The Washington Post.  Before that, I was assistant managing editor of the metropolitan news at The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 23rd, I believe, of May.  Does that sound right?
Speaker 1: That's right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --except for the year (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, 2013.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we at the present time?  And you don't have to give your address, but.
Speaker 2: We're at my home in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 640461
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer.  The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of offhand.
Story_ID: 640462
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  All right.  Well, I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [James Coleman] side, and then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother was Justine Malone, J-U-S-T-I-N-E; last name, Malone, M, Michael, A, Anderson, L, Leon, O, only, N, Nellie, E, Edward; Justine Malone [Justine Malone Coleman].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 12th, 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what are the stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Well, my maternal grandfather was Silas Malone.  He went by the nickname of Pinney, P-I-N-N-E-Y.  And family lore had it that he, he grew up in Athens, Georgia, and left home when he was in his teens, because either he said the wrong thing to or looked the wrong way at a white woman, and so he left in a huff, and said goodbye to his sister outside, they had an apple tree, I think they were on a farm.  That's what I was told.  And the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] came looking for him that night, I was told, and his father went out to the porch with his shotgun and the Klan apparently said, "Where's your boy," and his father said, "He's not here."  And that was it.  My grandfather then went to, he went to Chicago [Illinois].  I don't know if he went there directly, but he went to Chicago and got a job in the steel mill catching steel, which apparently was the most dangerous work at steel mills, 'cause you had these tongs and the sheets of steel came off.  So he worked there, and then he worked in Gary, Indiana, doing the same thing, and then he came to Milwaukee.  And that's where he met my grandmother on my mother's side, who was a German woman named Mary Raasch, R, double A-S-C-H [Mary Raasch Malone].  And they were married, and they had one child, my mother, Justine Malone.  And according to my mother, her--my mother's mother's family disowned my mother's mother because she married this black man.  And it wasn't until after my mother's mother had passed that my mother made contact again with that family.  But that was the history of my mother's side of the family.  And my dad, my grandfather, rather, died during my second year in college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I believe.  That would have been 1964, 1965.  And his widow died shortly after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it he would have been born around the turn of the century, you think?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I don't know offhand (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 640463
Speaker 1: Now what about your [maternal] grandfather's father?  Any other stories about him?  He seemed to be quite a (unclear) man (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My--
Speaker 1: Your grandfather's father, the one who had the shotgun out.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I just remember that when I was in my second or third year in college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], my mother [Justine Malone Coleman] and I went south to Chattanooga, Tennessee, because the sister of my--the sister of my mother's father [Silas Malone] and my mother had finally gotten in touch with one another, because my grandfather apparently said he had no family.  But my mother discovered letters written to him from members of his family.  So we went south to Chattanooga, Tennessee, to see the youngest of his sisters, who was affectionately called Big Mama, which was ironic because she was very small, she was very tiny (laughter).  And we went there to visit them.  That was the first time I had been south in my life.  And it was really important for me because I am, I learned that when you go south at that time, all these older black women, all of them fry chicken, and every one of them's recipe is different.  And if you don't eat their fried chicken, they upset with you.  So I ate lots of fried chicken (laughter).  And it was all different.  We visited a couple of aunts, and Big Mama was really interesting because she had an electric range that her daughter had bought for her that she never used.  And she said--I say, "So, why?"  And she said, "'Cause you cook something on that stove, and you can't smell it."  So she always cooked on a wood burning stove, you know, for all of her life.  And I never learned anything else much less about my mother's father.
Speaker 1: So Big Mama told the story about him leaving, about your father leaving--
Speaker 2: My grandfather.  My mother told me that story.  So many of the stories that I got were from my mother.  She was like the oral historian of our family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But this story had been told to her by your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I don't know who told her the story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, but that was--that was the family lore that she passed down to me, that he had been in Athens, Georgia, and had this encounter with this white woman, and then he came up to Chicago [Illinois], and went from Chicago to Gary [Indiana] and Gary to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: The whole idea that he said goodbye to his sister under an apple tree, it sounds so poetic, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it really, really was.  And I don't know whether--I don't know whether she heard that from Big Mama or from my grandfather, from whom; I just don't know.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering if Big Mama was the sister he said goodbye to.
Speaker 2: Yes.  From my understanding, it was Big Mama.  It was--her name was Rosie [Rosie Malone (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So your mother grew up in Milwaukee.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now was there--her mother [Mary Raasch Malone], had she, I mean, did she speak German or was she just a second generation German (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know--I--'cause, my maternal grandmother was not terribly talkative.  She sort of stuck to herself, even though she lived with us for a while.  She may have been born in Germany, she may not have been born in Germany.  All I had heard about her was that she spoke low German, which I've since learned was--is from, I think, the southern part of Germany.  I'm not sure.  I took German in college, but never spoke to my maternal grandmother in German.  She knew of--she would speak a few phrases, but I think she probably had stopped speaking it for some time.  And the German I knew was schoolbook German as opposed to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Natural, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Milwaukee is quite a German town.
Speaker 2: We got lots of--lots of Germans.  Lots of Germans, because when I was growing up in Milwaukee, all breweries were there: Schlitz [Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company], Pabst [Pabst Brewing Company], Blatz [Valentin Blatz Brewing Company], Gettelman [A. Gettelman Brewing Company], Miller [Miller Brewing Company]--
Speaker 1: Hamm's [Theodore Hamm's Brewing Company].
Speaker 2: Hamm's.  Wow, you just showed your age.  Hamm's, from the land of sky blue waters.
Story_ID: 640464
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well what did your mother [Justine Malone Coleman] say about growing up in Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?  What were things like for her?  Did she live in a black community or--?
Speaker 2: My mother--my mother grew up within blocks of where I grew up.  My first recollection, when she lived on Vliet Street, V-L-E-I-T [sic.], between 6th [Street] and 7th [Street].  And that's where she lived there with her two parents [Mary Raasch Malone and Silas Malone].  She went to the same high school I went to, Lincoln High School [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And she pretty much lived in that area for most of her life.  That was mostly a black area, but two or three blocks north of there was Walnut Sreet, which was like the main drag of black Milwaukee.  And my mother lived most of her life there.  That was essentially a black community.  There were very few whites.  When I was born, we lived on 6th and Walnut Street upstairs over a drugstore.  We then moved up socially, because into public housing, and that was a step up, to be public housing at that time.  And I was in public housing until I was in the eleventh grade, and went to public schools; and it was pretty much a black community, you know.  Oh, Lincoln High School had a larger white population at the time my mother went there than when I went there.  But even when I went there, it was--Lincoln was probably the most diverse school, high school of the twelve in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, because we were mostly black, we had some Puerto Ricans, some Mexicans, a significant number of Italians, a handful of Jews, and some Polish people; we were very diverse, except the basketball team was nearly all black.  And a hell of a basketball team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a dynasty.
Speaker 1: All right.  I'm going to ask you about that a little later (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: --get there, but just--now, did your mother have a chance to go college?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My mother graduated from high school, and as best as I understand now, was married shortly thereafter.  She was married in 1945.  She would have--
Speaker 1: This was to, to your father [James Coleman]?
Speaker 2: To my father.  It was my father's second marriage, yes.
Story_ID: 640465
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your father's side, then I'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father was James Thomas Coleman [James Coleman], born February 29th, 1920, in Roe, R-O-E, Arkansas.  He was the--he was the oldest, first born child to the marriage of Sarah McDuffey, D-U-F-F-E-Y [Sarah McDuffey Coleman], and William Coleman.  William Coleman worked for the railroad.  Shortly after my dad was born, they moved to El Dorado, Arkansas, and then when my dad was--well, at some point, they then moved to Minneapolis-St. Paul [Minnesota], because William Coleman worked for the railroad.  And when my dad was six and his younger brother Willard [Willard Coleman] was three or four, they moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  My dad spent the next eighty-seven years of his life in Milwaukee.  He died April 15th of this year at the age of ninety-three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sarah Coleman did all kinds of different work.  William Coleman apparently died of tuberculosis when he was in Milwaukee.  My dad graduated from Lincoln High School [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] as well and served in the [U.S.] Army in 1945--1944 and 1945.  He was a laborer by profession, which is the title given to black men of his generation who just did whatever work they could find.  You know, he worked on asphalt paving crews, he did some construction work, he painted signs, he shined shoes in a barbershop, he served at parties; for a period of time, he worked at the American Motors plant [American Motors Corporation] in Milwaukee, and he was married three times.  My mother [Justine Malone Coleman] was his second wife, and they had three children; my brother Jerome [Jerome Coleman], who was born in 1942 and died in 2007; my sister Sharon [Sharon Coleman] who was born two years later in 1944 and is still alive; and I was born in 1946.  My dad had two children by his previous marriage; Vickey Jean Dennis [Vickey Coleman Dennis] is her married name, she's still alive, was born in 1940 and--no, no, '38 [1938], '38 [1938] Vickie was born in '38 [1938], 'cause Erskine [Erskine Coleman], her brother, was born was born in 1940, and then Jerome in '42 [1942]; Sharon '44 [1944], and me in '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he didn't have any children by his third marriage.
Speaker 2: No.  no.
Speaker 1: And were your parents together the entire time that you were growing up or did they split up?
Speaker 2: My parents were married until my junior year--my third year of college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I was in college for five years.  But my dad was not around that often, not much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just as a general rule, when you were growing up he wasn't around that much?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know how they met.
Speaker 1: They lived in the same neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--I think they probably met in high school, 'cause they both went to Lincoln High School as I did, but no one talked about that when we were young.
Story_ID: 640466
Speaker 1: And when you, when you think about their personalities, their dispositions, how they looked, how they walked, talked, their habits, their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I got something from both of them.  My mother [Justine Malone Coleman] was a greater influence on me, and I have learned that, since my mother died, I have come to realize that so many of my fundamental beliefs and character traits I got from my mother and then transferred them to my personal and professional life.  You know, my mother was a good solid person.  She was--she was well read for someone who never went to college, she had very strong faith and beliefs, even though she rarely went to church.  I think she got those from her father [Silas Malone], because by both her example and by her words, my mother always--she raised her children to believe that if you look around and you see that you are blessed to be doing other than--better than other people are doing, then your job is to help other people do better.  And that was my mama's belief.  And that sort of propelled me through life.  My mother was also in her own way a leader, you know. She would aspire to becoming a spokeswoman, like when she was living in senior citizen housing, she became a spokesperson for the residents.  She would, when the grocery stores would offer free food to senior citizens and somebody picked them up, my mother would take a shopping cart and go down to the grocery store and get it, because she was younger than all the other people.  My mother went into the senior citizen public housing when she was fifty-five.  That was the minimum you could go in there.  And she would do that.  She was on TV a couple of times speaking up about problems in the community.  She worked for nearly her entire life.  She was the one introduced me to the poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar, which I enjoyed.  And my mother was a fighter.  She really was.  When, five or six years before she died, she had a stroke.  And the doctors gave her up for dead and summoned us to come together and, you know, say goodbye.  We came together, and she had a second stroke and she survived.  She fought back, you know, and enjoyed another five or six years of life.  And so I got, I got an awful lot from my mother.
Story_ID: 640467
Speaker 1: I got a lot from my dad in different ways, because on the one hand, my dad, not being around when I was growing up, I grew up saying that I wanted to be just the opposite to my son.  And so one of the photographs I'm most proud of is in my son's high school yearbook where it has a picture of the two of us, because he was a gifted distance runner, and the best distance runner of his class of that year.  And there's this picture in the Gonzaga [Gonzaga College High School, Washington, D.C.], a high school yearbook, of me with my arm around Sekou [Sekou Coleman] after he'd come in second in a meet, and you know, I was just consoling him.  And it said under there, and I was so proud, it said, that his father never missed a single track or cross country meet that he ran in.  And I took great pride in that.  The other thing I learned from my dad was, my dad was tough, you know.  I wrote his obituary for his funeral last month, and I used the phrase, he was street smart and alley tough, you know, and he feared no one.  He had been raised to take care of his--to look after his younger brother [Willard Coleman] 'cause my dad's dad died, William Coleman, died when James Coleman was eleven years old.  And so my dad had to become, in many ways, the man of the house.  And he was tough.  I mean, he was--he was--you didn't mess with James Coleman, you know.  And my mother [Justine Malone Coleman] tells the story, which I've told a few other times, of how at one point my dad and my mother had gone to a lounge, a bar in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], a couple of blocks from where we lived, and a guy came in, accused my dad of cheating him during a card game, which my dad probably did, and pulled out a gun.  And, according to my mother, my father looked at that man and said, and I quote in James Coleman language, "Motherfucker, if you don't get that gun out of my face, I'll kill you."  The man put the gun down.  The man put the gun down.  My mother said at that point, she spun around and got ready to run out of the bar, and my dad grabbed her by the arm, and again, in James Coleman language, and I quote, according to my mother, my dad told my mother, "Come back here, you silly willy bitch and walk out of here like you got some sense."  They turned their backs and walked out and lived to tell about it, you know.  And when--and when I was growing up, I mean I was not a streetwise kind of guy.  I was--people would've called me a nerd now, but it was clear that if anybody ever tried to do harm to me, "Tell them you're James Coleman's son, and you'll be okay."  You know.  And later on as I got into life, I mean I--whenever I was afraid of something, I would say, "I'm James Coleman's son," you know, and he was afraid of nothing, you know.  So determination was what I got from my dad.  I got the hard side from my dad and the soft side from my mom.
Story_ID: 640468
Speaker 1: Okay, and now you named your siblings.  So you all grew up together in the same household when your--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --parents [Justine Malone Coleman and James Coleman] were married.
Speaker 2: The three of us.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) three.  And did any other relatives live with you?  You said your grandmother lived with you for a while?
Speaker 2: At--in my third or fourth year of college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], my mother's mother [Mary Raasch Malone]--my mother's mother moved in with us shortly after her father [Silas Malone] died.  So that would have been about the third or fourth year that I was in college, which would have been around 1966 or 1967.  And--
Speaker 1: Which means you grew--you know, the nuclear family was basically--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in (unclear).  Okay.  You described where you grew up basically, and--now you were at the place over the store for how many years until you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --on Walnut?
Speaker 2: --602 West Walnut Street doesn't exist as a building anymore, and we moved to the projects, I think I was maybe four or five, but maybe older, because I seemed to think that that housing project was opened in 1954.  I seem to recall that, which means I would have been eight years old at the time--no, no, four.  Yeah, I would have been eight years old.  But I have memories from before that I think I--anyway.
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the project?
Speaker 2: Hillside Terrace [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hillside Terrace.  It's still--it still exists, though the building we lived in has been torn down.
Story_ID: 640469
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Hillside Terrace [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], this is a new federal housing project.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And kind of explain--today, the people hear housing project, they think, oh, rats and roaches, you know, decay, and all the gangs.  And that was not true in 1954.
Speaker 2:  	No.  No.  Because my understanding is that public housing was built after World War II [WWII], and it was built as temporary for housing for people.  And so at the time when we moved into Hillside Terrace, that was a step up.  You know, if you had--if you had a bad history, they would not let you in.  And the houses--the housing was really solidly built.  We had--the walls were--I think they called it poured concrete.  It wasn't wallboard.  Wallboard, I think was very little around there.  And we lived in a building where there--it was a two story walkup, and there were many people who would later become famous who lived in that same housing project.  Among them, Howard Fuller, who became the Milwaukee [Wisconsin] school superintendent.  He lived around--about a block from us, same housing project.  A guy named Harvey Scales, who was a singer, but who also won a gold record 'cause he wrote 'Disco Lady' for Johnnie Taylor.  Upstairs over me lived the Green [ph.] family, and one of the Green sisters married Gilbert Moorer, M-O-O-R-E-R, who--Gilbert and Alvis Moorer were two of the singers of The Esquires, who sang (singing), "Get on up, get up on, get up on" ['Get On Up'], you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.  Yeah, I remember that.
Speaker 2:  	And then not far from us, also a student at Lincoln High School [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], was Al Jarreau, the singer, who was inspired by the same high school band director [Ronald DeVillers] who was a mentor to me.  And a lot of interesting people came out of that--
Speaker 1: That was the same age of you?
Speaker 2:  	Al Jarreau was actually my brother's [Jerome Coleman] contemporary.  Al was my--I think Al Jarreau graduated in '58 [1958].  I graduated in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But a lot of very interesting people at that time, you know, and it was a good place to be in the projects.  You behaved yourself otherwise, you get kicked out.  The family would get kicked out, and --
Speaker 1: They had inspections of the projects, from what I understand.  From Chicago [Illinois] and other places, they actually--somebody would come around, the housing authority, and inspect people's gardens and make sure their grass was cut.
Speaker 2:  	People looked out for that.  We were fortunate in that we had a, we probably had the first black manager of a public housing project in Milwaukee, a guy named Calvin Beckett, B-E-C-K-E double T.  Calvin W. Beckett, I think I remember, who actually--he lived in the housing projects with us.  He lived there, he and his family.  But yeah, it was a big deal to be in public housing.
Speaker 1: He would be the--he was the resident manager for--
Speaker 2:  	I guess that's what they were calling him, yeah, the resident manager.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  For--I guess, would it be MHA in those days?
Speaker 2:  	It was the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2:  	Which it still is.  The Housing, Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee.
Story_ID: 640470
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2:  	The earliest childhood memory I have, I have two early childhood memories: one was being on my tricycle in the courtyard of the public housing projects [Hillside Terrace, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and that was before I went to elementary school.  I just remember being on my tricycle riding around.  And then the other one--memory I have is when I was in kindergarten at Fourth Street elementary school [Fourth Street School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], which was two blocks from my house and is now Golda Meir elementary school [Golda Meir School].  I remember it snowed and when it snowed you could make an ice slide.  If you turned sideways--if you ran and turned sideways and slid across the snow, it would turn to ice.  And I remember we made an ice slide, and I got on that ice slide and I fell, and that's when I cut--I got this scar over here from that.  I have that memory.  And then I have another--the other memory I have was which my mother [Justine Malone Coleman] used to always kid me about was, at one point, we were playing in the--back behind the house, in the public housing projects, and for some reason I threw a brick up in the air, closed my eyes, put my hands over my head, took them off and the brick came down and hit me, and that's why I have a scar up here (laughter), you know.  And so, yeah, I have those memories, yeah.  Beyond that, they are--things are sort of vague.  But being on a tricycle in front of our building at 16 West Court Street is the first memory I have of life.  And there may have been some other memories earlier than that, but in my mind they are confused, because after we moved out of 602 West Walnut Street, my dad's younger brother [Willard Coleman] and his family moved into 602 West Walnut Street, and I don't know if the memories I have of that particular dwelling come from the time when I was living there, or from visiting my cousins there.
Story_ID: 640471
Speaker 1: We always ask people to do this: can you describe some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2:  	Well, the sounds, I guess the sound that sticks up mostly in my mind from my younger years is the music that my mother [Justine Malone Coleman] and father [James Coleman] listened to.  It was Earl Bostic and Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis on 78 records [78 rpm record], you know.  And one of those two, or maybe it was Tiny Bradshaw, made a song called 'Soft,' and we listened to that, and I remember those songs very clearly.  And then when I went to high school [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], of course, that was when R and B was coming into its own, and it was James Brown and The Miracles and the earliest years of Temptations [The Temptations], you know.  I remember those sounds.  I don't know that I remember any smells.  The sights, I mean, I just remember that whole scene, because, you know, one of the real ironies was that my dad, who lived eighty-seven years in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and lived most of his life within a half square mile, I mean, I was born at 602 Walnut Street.  When my dad died, he lived two blocks away.  And so I remember the scene on Walnut Street, 'cause it was kind of like U Street is in Washington [D.C.] and kind of like 125th Street in Harlem [New York, New York].  It was the main drag of black Washington [sic.].  I mean, you could find everything within a half mile on Walnut Street, all the way from the home of the alderman, who was actually an alderwoman who represented that area on the Milwaukee common council [Common Council of Milwaukee], to funeral parlors, a thrift store, a couple of churches, a junior high school, a hardware store, ice cream shop.  It was all there, you know.  And I can remember that now.  You know, I remember my mother got her first job as a grocery clerk working at a place called the V and V supermarket [sic. V and J Foods, Inc.].  And I remember that when [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron was signed by the Milwaukee Braves [Atlanta Braves].  He used to come in the V and V supermarket, 'cause he couldn't live in the white neighborhoods.  And one of the interesting things for me was, Hank Aaron was my high school--my childhood hero, you know.  I tried to run like Hank Aaron, hit like Hank Aaron, everything.  And so here it is many, many years later, I'm working for The Washington Post covering the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] meeting in New York [New York], and I get in the elevator and there's nobody in the elevator but me and Hank Aaron (laughter), you know, and I'm saying, am I going to ask this guy for his autograph?  I think I didn't.  But, boy, it took me a while to not do that, 'cause he's my hero, you know.  And I knew that street very well, 'cause also when I was in junior high school [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I think it was, I actually had a paper route that took me up and down Walnut Street delivering papers after school.  And that was when I was--it must have been when I was in grade school, 'cause I would have had to come too far to be there after school.  So, yeah.  And I just knew all--I knew all of the sights of Walnut Street.  Fourth Street School [Gold Meir School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was right across the street from the Schlitz brewery [Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company], and I remember when they were brewing the beer, this sort of foam would sort of come out through the smokestacks or whatever.  I don't know what it was, but it sort of floated down onto the playground.  I remember playing baseball all around town and basketball when I was in high school.  I remember playing football.  I remember we used to have--the department of recreation used to be on--they used to have the traveling theater in the summer, and they would always come there and do whatever the play of the year was.  They had a mobile theater.  The girls would jump double dutch.  Oh, yeah I have great memories of that time, those times.

Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2:  	No.  No, it wasn't.  We--my mother [Justine Malone Coleman] was not a churchgoing woman, and my dad [James Coleman] certainly was not.  My mother would dispatch us to church every now and then.  We went to--I don't remember of the church that we went to--oh, yes, I do.  It was--it was St. Matthew C.M.E. [St. Matthew C.M.E. Church, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], 'cause the Reverend W.J.G. McLin, M-C-L-I-N, was the pastor, and I remember (laughter) that once--that one sermon he gave where he talked about, you know, growing old, but not really being old, and he said, "There may be frost on my window, but there's fire in the pot."  (Laughter) I thought that was good.  And later, St. Matthew moved from--I think it used be on 6th [Street] and Walnut [Street].  It moved a little farther uptown.  I then went there my first year, my earliest in high school [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I often would go to church more often than my brother [Jerome Coleman] and sister, in part, in a funny kind of way--I mean, you know, there was--we would go sometimes to Blessed Martin, because Martin had not yet been made a saint, and it was Martin de Porres [Blessed Martin de Porres Church, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I think.  And Blessed Martin was sort of kiddy corner from the housing project [Hillside Terrace, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and we would go there because of two things: number one, you're supposed to have a little religion in you, so we'd go there; and number two, it was a Catholic service, so it was short, you know.  And I remember going there, and the other thing we would do is, the Catholic service at that time you had to--there were certain times you had stand up and certain times you had to sit down, and we would always stand up, and stand on the balls of our feet, 'cause if you stand on the balls of your feet, you would--later on in life you'd be able to jump higher.  And we always did that.  And--but, no, church was not a really big part of it.  When I got into high school, I went to church more often, because my sister at that point was going to church more often--my sister, Sharon [Sharon Coleman].  And so, quite honestly, I had met this younger lady (laughter), who went to church, and I was interested in her more so than I was interested in the Lord, to tell you the truth.
Speaker 1: So you were saying earlier that you got most of your moral foundation from your mother.
Speaker 2:  	I think so.  Yeah.  And my mother's father was a pretty moral soul, you know.  And he had this thing about--he taught himself how to read, and he was very proud of that.  And, in fact, on the book shelf behind me is a book that he had that he sort of cherished called the, book of personal magnetism ['Instantaneous Personal Magnetism,' Edmund Shaftesbury], and it was--it was a self-improvement book.  But he loved that book.  And when he passed, I kept that book, and I still have it.  And it's still part of my collection.  He was very much into self-improvement, and people have told me that I'm very much into self-improvement.  So I got that from my mother's father, Pinney Long [Silas Malone].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It seems as though, and I don't know, I'm just observing from the outside, but the Chicago [Illinois]-Milwaukee [Wisconsin] area seems to really focus on that, I mean that black communities, self-improvement books and read--what's the guy, Stone [W. Clement Stone], with the moustache, and Dale Carnegie.  I mean, in the--right in the community.  I mean, I'm just throwing this out, but it seems like a cultural trait of those cities.

Speaker 1:  	Have you read Isabel Wilkerson's book ['The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration']?
Speaker 2: No, I have not.  But I've heard about it.  I mean, I feel like I don't--I shouldn't feel this way, but I shouldn't--I can't really even talk about it.
Speaker 1:  	She does a profile of a family that moved from the South up to Chicago [Illinois], and she talks about that a lot.  It's a really good--she takes three families that's part of the Great Migration and talks about them.  And actually, it's been very influential on me in terms of understanding my dad [James Coleman] and understanding my mother [Justine Malone Coleman], who a part of that in many ways.
Speaker 2: Does that have anything--I mean, does she make some reference to the place your father was from in terms of coming to Chicago?
Speaker 1: No.  But my understanding is that so many black people who moved to Chicago came from Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi.  Unlike people over here on the East Coast, who came up from Georgia and Alabama, 'cause, you know you get here in Washington [D.C.], and somebody who acts to use the word we used to say, countrified, you say they're a 'Bama, cause they're from Alabama.  If in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], they say, "He from 'Ssippi," you know.  So I think that was the migration thing.  And just having going back to Milwaukee to bury my dad, I was stunned to find how many people I ran into who were all from Arkansas, some from the same towns.  In fact, I ran into one lady who worked at--works at the cemetery where my mother, my dad, and my brother [Jerome Coleman] are buried, and her last name is Duffy [ph.].  She says her family is from El Dorado, Arkansas.   My dad's family spent time in El Dorado, Arkansas.  So she's now checking to see whether they know each, you know. It's a very small town, but also very customary in migrant families, 'cause if you spend time in Latino communities around here, you find out so many people are from El Salvador, and they're all--not all of them, but 85 percent of them, come from three distinct provinces of El Salvador, especially two of them La Union, and the other one's name skips me right now.  And they all knew each other.  They all came up together.  And so I think that's--that is a customary thing about immigrants.  In fact, many of the Vietnamese I know, 'cause my wife [Faye Edwards Coleman] and I have Vietnamese nail technicians.  They know each other and I ask them, "So why did you move where you moved?"  They said, "'Cause somebody I knew lived here--lived there."  And so that's it.  San Miguel and La Union are the two provinces in El Salvador.  Most of the Salvadorians here come from San Miguel and La Union.  They call--we had to call them departmentals, but they're really like provinces.  They're not quite states, but they're more like provinces in El Salvador (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they're also--I mean, I know lots of people in Chicago that have a relative in Milwaukee.
Story_ID: 640474
Speaker 1:  	Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's like the northern terminus of the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.  Because if you come up the Mississippi [Mississippi River], you get to Chicago [Illinois], and then you can swing around to Gary [Indiana] and maybe go from Gary up to Detroit [Michigan].  If you keep going north, Kenosha, Wisconsin, is forty-three miles from Chicago, and then thirteen miles from Kenosha is Racine [Wisconsin], and thirty miles from Racine is Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And then you get to Milwaukee, and that's it.  You run out of black folks.  The next--the nearest black community is Madison [Wisconsin], which is off to the west about an hour and a half, or you go way up to Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And when I worked in Minneapolis, I asked one of the guys to, I said, "Tell me something that's going to help understand Minneapolis."  He said, "Minneapolis is on the way to nowhere."  And I said, "What do you mean by that?"  He said, "Well, if you look, people who come to Minneapolis, come here because they want to come to Minneapolis.  It's not the next stop.  It's Minneapolis."  And Milwaukee, you're right, was the northern terminus of the industrial jobs, you know, of the Great Migration.  You would come there, and you could get a job, you could be somebody, you know.  And, 'cause, my dad [James Coleman] always told me, "You gonna do better if you get a job where you get paid to use your mind and not your back," 'cause his generation mostly used their back.  And I remember when I got--when I was made assistant managing editor at The Washington Post in charge of local news, you know, my parents never understood what I did in the newsroom (laughter).  Most people don't anyway.  And so, my dad asked me a couple of questions.  He said, "How many people are going to work for you in this job?"  And I said, "About 130."  He said, "How many of them are white?"  I said, "70, 75 percent."  My dad said, "That's a good job."  End of story.  End of story.  You know, and that's what life was like.
Story_ID: 640475
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about school now.  Fourth Street elementary school [Fourth Street School; Golda Meir School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was right in the neighborhood.  This is where you started school.  Now--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you go to elementary school fulltime there?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  I started in kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And I went to Fourth Street through sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what was--did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  I liked school an awful lot.  And a good thing about school then was there were good teachers, but also in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] they had this thing called Social Center.  And what it was, it was an after school program.  So that school ended at, I think at 3:00 or 3:15, and then in the basement of the school and on the first floor, it was a recreation center.  And they had a game room, they had tumbling, they had sports, they had a woodshop.  And Social Center went until, I think, five o'clock.  So you could stay after school in this after school program.  And then there was nighttime Social Center, which was from 6:30 until 9.  And they also had basketball and tumbling and dancing and all that.  So you were just enveloped in a program of social activity, which kept a lot of us out of trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2:  	'Cause we had something to do.
Speaker 1: So, you could go back to school at night?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And play ball or do something else?
Speaker 2:  	You go back.  You had to be--you had to be at least thirteen or fourteen, I think, to go to night Social Center, 'cause it was at night.  But you could stay after school.  And I played in soft- I played in after school softball leagues, 'cause baseball was all I thought about at that time.  Oh, yeah, I really liked school.  I was a safety cadet for a while.  I learned to run projectors, because we did that.  Oh, yeah.  I enjoyed school.
Speaker 1: So you were a safety cadet.  That's like a traffic boy in some towns.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: We had--did you have a flag in the belt and everything?
Speaker 2:  	I had the white belt and we had arm badges, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is a position of responsibility.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's running up record project, you know (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, 'cause you would get out of class to run the projector for different things, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So were you a good student?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.  I was a good student.  I was skipped a grade in elementary school, if I remember correctly.  I was--yes, I was skipped a grade in elementary school, and then I went to summer school one summer in high school [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: So did you graduate ahead of your class?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.  I graduated when I--I was sixteen when I graduated from high school.  I started college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] in--I was skipped a grade in elementary school, and in high school you could go up a half a grade if you went to summer school.  And I went to summer school, because I was in junior high school [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and I wanted to be on the basketball team.  And we had midterm graduation in Wisconsin and in Milwaukee, and I was--the way I was set up, I would have graduated in midseason.  And so you had a choice.  If you didn't want to do that, you either went to summer school to make up a half grade or you purposely failed and got put back a half grade.  And so I said, I'm not going to be failing, because I had good grades.  So I went to summer school.  As a result of that, I graduated when I was sixteen, and by the time I reached my senior year, I didn't play basketball at all, you know, anyway.
Story_ID: 640476
Speaker 1: So were you tall as a youth?
Speaker 2:  	I was--I was 6'2" by my senior year [at Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], but I was skinny, 'cause I think I weighed, like, 165 pounds.  But the basketball team I was on was a short team.  I mean, I was no good.  I mean, I was like twelfth man on a twelve man squad.  But I was 6'2" at the time, and I as listed as a forward and center, 'cause we had no height, you know.  And we just--we would full court on defense, fast break on offense, play the 1-2-2 offense, 'cause it was closer to playground basketball, and kick your ass in a minute.  State champions in '59 [1959], '61 [1961], '62 [1962].  And then they got height after that.  And then they were really a dynasty, and the person who best came out of that played for the Seattle SuperSonics, Downtown Freddie Brown [Fred Brown].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	Freddie grew up in the public--same public housing project I grew up in [Hillside Terrace, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I played with--I went to school with three of his older brothers.  We used to send Freddie out to get sodas while we were playing basketball (laughter), and then--
Speaker 1: Would he give any indication of being able to shoot like that?  I mean, he was--he had a phenomenal long distance shot.
Speaker 2:  	I know.
Speaker 1: And he shot in the days before they had three point.
Speaker 2:  	I know.  I know.  If they'd had three point games when Freddie was playing, he'd have all kinds of points.  Now, Freddie--Freddie--the team that Freddie was on, they got height, you know.  Our center was, like, 6'1" and 6'2", Dan Davis.  And they had a center who was, like, 6'5" or 6'6".  And so they didn't play defense.  They just--they would go out and bomb you to death, and I remember one time looking in the paper and--I mean, this is high school basketball, eight minute quarters--every one of the starting five scored twenty points.  They would go over a hundred just about every time, 'cause they just--they just went out and shoot you.  And they all--and they all went on to college, you know, which not a whole lot of guys who were on the team when I was there, they just didn't get a chance to go to college.  Black guys were not recruited then the same way they are now.
Story_ID: 640477
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there any special teachers in, at Fourth Street [Fourth Street School; Golda Meir School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] when you were there, or any mentors or such that you remember?
Speaker 2:  	Grant Gordon, who subsequently became a principal.  G-R-A-N-T, last name, G-O-R-D-O-N, Grant Gordon.  He was my fifth grade teacher.  And then there was a first grade teacher whose name I can't remember.  I somehow think it was Mrs. Steuben [ph.].  And then, I think my sixth grade teacher was Mr. Bowen.  I don't remember his--somehow I think it was Carl Bowen [ph.], but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Is he an African American teacher?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  Both of them, Grant Gordon--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--and Carl Bowen were both African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Mrs. Steuben, whatever, she was white.  She was--I can't remember her name for sure.  I know where her office was--classroom was.  I don't remember her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your favorite subject in school?  What did you focus on?
Speaker 2:  	I liked English and math.  You're talking about in grade school, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  I think I liked English and math.
Story_ID: 640478
Speaker 1: And when you were growing up, were you influenced to any extent by popular culture, TV or radio, movies, that stuff?
Speaker 2:  	Not disproportionately, I don't think so.  No.  No.  I mean, I listened to the radio, watched regular TV.  I don't think I was that overly influenced by either, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you like the news?  I mean--
Speaker 2:  	Did I like--?
Speaker 1: The news?
Speaker 2:  	No.  No.  I didn't get into the news until I got to college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And I hardly ever read Milwaukee [Wisconsin] newspapers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother [Justine Malone Coleman] subscribe to magazines and that kind of thing around the house?  Was there reading material around the house?
Speaker 2:  	My sister and I were very avid readers.  My sister maintains that I could read at three.  But we had a lot of storybooks around the house.  In fact, Sharon [Sharon Coleman] and I would get into trouble with one another because one of us would act up.  My mom or dad [James Coleman] would tell us to go stand in the corner, and the other would then bring the one in the corner a book to read and get busted, and I have to go to the other corner.  And Sharon was my first editor, because in some kind of way, we put out what we called the newspaper when we were in elementary school [Fourth Street School; Golda Meir School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  So I always say that Sharon was my first editor.  And actually, continues to be a good sort of editor 'cause she's edited the, when I wrote the obituaries of my mother and of my brother, who died six months apart and Sharon edited them, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did pay attention on some level to create a paper.  I mean, did you pattern it after (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  (Simultaneous) I can't remember.  I just don't remember.  You know, I don't even remember the name of it, but I guess we wrote little articles.  I don't know what name of it.  You know, I trust Sharon.  Whatever Sharon says, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was her idea?
Speaker 2:  	I think so, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I followed Sharon a lot 'cause Sharon was the bookworm of the family.  My brother, Jerome [Jerome Coleman], was by far the most talented, just natural talent, creative.  And I always say that Jerome had the most natural talent and worked the least.  Sharon had the least natural talent and worked the hardest.  And I kind of came in between.
Story_ID: 640479
Speaker 1: (Unclear) what kind of talents did your brother Jerome [Jerome Coleman] have?
Speaker 2:  	Artistic.  Very much artistic.  He could draw, he could sing, he could dance, and he was industrious in the sense that, you know--the building we lived in had a really nice basement in it, you know, 'cause the building had twelve families in it.  And so there was--and everybody had their own locker, and it was a big, big--two big sinks in the basement where you could wash your clothes, you know, with those wringer machines.  And so, just about anybody who was somebody who went on to sing who came out of there [Hillside Terrace, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], at some point, they sang in our basement.  And my brother probably did their process, 'cause he did processes, you now.  And some of the toughest guys in the neighborhood would come there to get their process done, and that lye in their hair would burn the shit out of them (laughter), you know.  But when my brother was in high school, he decided he wanted to have a suit like no one else had.  So he designed it, bought the material and sewed it himself without a pattern, you know.  He was incredibly talented.
Speaker 1: I'd say so.  And this is a suit that he could wear in public and people didn't ridicule him?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, no.  And people said, "Wow, that's a heck of a suit.  Where did you get that at?"  And he said, I (unclear).  Jerome used to have this thing when anybody would be bragging about what somebody could do this, somebody could do that, Jerome's saying was, "I can do that."  And he could.  He really could.
Story_ID: 640480
Speaker 1: I guess you had a middle school or a junior high school?
Speaker 2:  	I went str- Lincoln was a junior/senior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So I started there in seventh grade.  And it was seventh through twelfth.
Speaker 1: Oka.  So Lincoln High School [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  So (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:   	(Simultaneous) It was (unclear) senior/junior high school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So you played basketball early on, you said?
Speaker 2:  	No.  Earliest on, I as a baseball fanatic, you know.  I would listen to the Brave games, the Milwaukee Braves [Atlanta Braves] games on the radio.  My dad [James Coleman] actually got me some tickets to go to the World Series.
Speaker 1: Now, what year was that when the Braves were in the World Series?  That's--I can vaguely remember that.
Speaker 2:  	I think it--it was the mid-'50s [1950s].  It was the mid-'50s [1950s].  They played--they played the Yankees [New York Yankees] and they won.
Speaker 1: That's when they had Warren Spahn.
Speaker 2:  	Right, Warren Spahn.  I mean, I can give you the whole, Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette were the major pitchers; Joe Adcock played first base; Del Crandall behind the plate; Red Schoendienst at second; John Logan [Johnny Logan] at short; Eddie Mathews at third; [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron in the outfield along with Billy Bruton, and later Wes Covington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I mean, I can do that.  I can also tell you the Green Bay Packers.
Speaker 1: That was the years of--
Speaker 2:  	That was years of the Lombardi [Vince Lombardi] years.
Speaker 1: That's from 1960 to, I guess, through the '60s [1960s], I guess.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Green Bay Packers were the--
Speaker 2:  	That's right.  That's right.  They were the-
Speaker 1: The best team in football.
Speaker 2:  	There was no doubt about it, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you have a particular favorite on the Packers?
Speaker 2:  	I sort of modeled myself to a certain degree after Paul Hornung, who had played quarterback at Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana].  But then when he came to the Packers, he was a running back, because Bart Starr was the quarterback, and Jim Taylor from LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was the fullback.  And there were very few black players on the Packers at that point.  I think Willie Wood came and--Davis, Davis--the tight end--
Speaker 1: Willie Davis [HistoryMaker Willie D. Davis].
Speaker 2:  	Willie Davis.  And Herb Adderley (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know all the Packers, but I can't think of hardly any of them.
Speaker 2:  	And somebody named Aldridge [Lionel Aldridge] were--also were there.  And Willie Wood was the first one to be a captain.  I think he was a defensive captain at one point.  But, oh, yeah, those were the great Packer years.  And in those days, the packers always played at least one preseason game and one or two home games in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], at County Stadium.  And actually, it was only, like, four years that I--the first time I went to a game at Lambeau Field in Green Bay [Wisconsin], 'cause my son [Sekou Coleman] and I had started going to games at different venues, and so we picked Lambeau field and went to see a game.  Other than that, I'd not gone to Lambeau Field, but I've gone to many Packer games at County Stadium, cause you could--you--those were the days when you could go out on the day of the game, buy a ticket, you know, and sit in the--the cheap seats were in the right field bleachers.  And I know at one point, I just missed touching an extra point, 'cause that was before they put the nets up, you know.  So they kicked an extra point and you got the ball, that's yours, baby.  You know, I just missed one.  And the one thing I was so glad to confirm is that I had memories that one year the Packers switched their colors to green and white; they took the yellow out.  And I kept saying, I'm pretty certain I remember that.  And so when I went--when we went to the Packers game in Lambeau Field, they have a wonderful program, and sure enough, they talked about the colors were green and white when Scooter McLean [Ray "Scooter" McLean] was the coach.  I remember that.  Yeah, so, I was a--I was a big Packers fan.  Big Packers fan.
Story_ID: 640481
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they were the best team in football.  So [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron is, was one of the major superstars along with Willie Mays and Frank Robinson and guys like that.
Speaker 2:  	Hank came along and then Willie Mays was different because he was--he had a lot of flair to him, you know.  He had this thing of catching the ball down here instead of up here.  And then the controversy about Willie Mays is that, he played center and had such a great arm that he wouldn't throw to the relay man.  If you tagged and started to come home from third, Willie Mays would throw straight to the catcher and probably get you out, you know.  He was the Say Hey Kid.  I even had a sun- Willie May sunglasses, Say Hey, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a thing on Aaron, from what I remember, is that he made everything look so easy that people--looked like he wasn't doing anything, you know.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: Even when he hit homeruns, he just kind of flicked it.  He wasn't that big.
Speaker 2:  	No, he wasn't that big.  He was a wrist hitter, which I think meant that he, at the last moment he sort of twisted his wrist, 'cause now--I mean, I know you can do a lot of things with that, with tennis, which I play now, but you can do that.  And then--and he had this long stride that people said made him look like was wearing snowshoes all the time.  They used to call him Snowshoe, you know.  But he was really, really good, you know.  And he was a fixture in the community.  He really was.
Speaker 1: So he's somebody who--you said your mother [Justine Malone Coleman] waited on him at the V and V supermarket [sic. V and J Foods, Inc.].
Speaker 2:  	The V and V, yep.
Speaker 1: So he's someone that lived in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  They couldn't live anywhere else.
Speaker 1: And that's really changed these days.  I think--I don't think you ever see athletes in the hood anymore.
Speaker 2:  	No, you don't.  You don't, 'cause they made far less money then than they do now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	But also it was different.  It was more segregated.
Story_ID: 640482
Speaker 1: Okay.  In high school [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], did you have any--were there any particular teachers or role models (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  In high school, the first person was the band director, Ronald DeVillers.  Capital D-E-, capital V as in Victor; I, idiot; L, Leon; L, Leon; E, Edward; R, Robert; S, Sam; Ronald J. DeVillers, who was truly a mentor.  I mean, when I graduated from high school, I wanted to be a band director like Mr. DeVillers.  And also there was an English teacher named Dale Hagan [ph.], H-A-G-A-N, who was a natty dresser and had a distinctive style of handwriting, which I still--I write a lot like Mr. Hagan wrote; my printing is that way.  And then there was a brother, Obbie Sartin, Jr., O-B-B-I-E, last name S, Sam; A, Anderson; R, Robert; T, Tom; I, idiot; N, Nellie.  Obbie Sartin, Jr., who coached the football team.  He was the wide receivers coach.  And he also coached the cross country team a couple of years.  And I was never a runner very much in high school.  I was on the track team for about three weeks, and my career came to an end.  But when I was on the varsity football team, Mr. Sartin was the coach, and he also coached cross country team.  And the interesting thing is, he never ran cross country.  And I think he never played wide receiver.  But he learned to coach by reading books.  And that was very influential on me later on and 'cause I learned some things by reading books.  And also, you know, I remember when I was wide receiver on the varsity football team, Mr. Sartin used to always say, "Your hands, baby.  Use your hands.  Catch the ball with your hands."  And to always have your thumbs together.  The more you had your thumbs together, the more likely you were going to be able to hold onto the ball.  So if you could, instead of catch it like that; no, catch it like that, you know.  Don't let it bounce, use your hands, don't use your body, you know.  And he coached the cross country team with some of my classmates on it, and they won the city championship.  And most of those brothers had never run cross country, you know.  So he was good.  And then there was--the other influential people besides the DeVillers, Hagan; of course, the varsity basketball coach, Richard Wadewitz, W-A-D-E-W-I-T-Z, was influential on all of us who were on the basketball team.  You know, he also coached the freshman/sophomore football team.  In my sophomore year, I was just starting quarterback on the fresh/soph football team.  And Wadewitz was a really, really good coach, you know, and a good, sort of a mentor to all of us who were on the team.  And then he was replaced by a black guy, James Smollens [ph.], who coached the freshman/sophomore basketball the year I was on the freshman/sophomore basketball team, and then replaced Wadewitz as coach of the varsity, 'cause when I was still going to college after we won the--after we won the championship in 1962, the third time in four years we won the championship.  And Smollens was also really very good.
Story_ID: 640483
Speaker 1: And then the other, the other person who was really influential on us was a guy named Tom Cheeks, Thomas, I think his middle initial was C, Cheeks, plural, who, I later found out was the first black high school teacher in Milwaukee Public Schools.  He came from Indiana, I believe.  And I later read that the reason that they picked him to be the first black teacher is because he was fair-skinned, and there was a question as to whether he was even black.  But he was so influential on all of us, just as a--not so much a mentor, but he was a very avuncular figure, you know.  And he had this habit of sort of picking on students, and he'd have you stand up and he'd talk about you (laughter).  And probably people would now say, wow, why did he do that.  But everybody would laugh, you know.  And he'd--when--I remember when he got on my case.  He told me to stand up, and he said, "I think you're going to be a preacher."  I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah, you're going to be the pastor of the True Vine Holy Roller Baptist Church."  And everybody just laughed a while, you know.  But Mr. Cheeks, if you came to class late, he'd make you walk in and out of that door five or six times, then he'd have you stand up and then he'd talk about you, make you feel bad.  Tell the girls, "Y'all don't know how to cook."  And the girls would say, "I know how to cook."  And Mr. Cheeks would say, "You don't even know how to fry water."  And she said, "Yes, I do."  And he said, "Okay.  Tell me how you fry water."  (Laughter) Then he had you.  And if guys came in with their hat on, 'cause you know, brothers like to wear hats, Cheeks would say, "What's wrong with you? You come from a hat wearing culture?"  (Laughter) You know.  And every year, every year, Mr. Cheeks took--he taught history and civics [at Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and he would take his classes to the museum of science and technology [Museum of Science and Industry] in Chicago [Illinois].  And that would be a big deal.  And there was one guy, who shall remain nameless, who was senior for like three years, and took Mr. Cheeks' history class, I think, every year.  And so when it came time for the trip to Chicago, Mr. Cheeks said, "Well, you know, I think I'm not even going to go this year.  I'm just going to have him lead the trip, because he's been down there as many times as I can," [sic] you know.  And when this guy graduated, he finally graduated with my class, even though he had been in my sister's class.  You know, Sharon's [Sharon Coleman] class was two years ahead of mine.  And I remember when he walked across the stage, and you know how you move your tassel from one side to the other?  The whole senior class stood up and applauded (laughter) 'cause he finally had made it, you know.
Story_ID: 640484
Speaker 1: And the other person who was really an important person in my life at that time was a brother named Albert Jackson.  Albert was the--Albert, at the time, was the greatest athlete in the history of Lincoln High School [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] because he was the point guard on the basketball team, he was the quarterback on the football team, and the leading pitcher on the baseball team.  And he subsequently married my cousin, Joyce [ph.].  And Albert came to Lincoln High School from Roosevelt Junior High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], played on the second state championship team, and by that point had exhausted his eligibility, because he was behind in classes.  And so, my junior year, I was on the basketball team, the varsity, and twelfth man on a twelve man squad, but Albert would act like a coach during the week with us.  And then on weekends--on the weekends we played the games.  Albert would sit at the end of the bench, in street clothes, because was still no longer eligible.  And I used to sit next to Albert at the end of the bench.  And Albert Jackson taught me to understand basketball better than I could ever play, you know.  We would be sitting there and Albert would say--you know, our team would bring the ball down, and Albert would say, "What defense are they playing?"  And I'd say, "2-1-2.  It's like a 2-1-2."  He'd say, "No, it's not."  "What is it Albert?"  "It's a 1-3-1."  "Why does it look that way?"  "'Cause So and So's doing this.  You can always tell by keeping your eye on that guy what they're going to do."  Or I'd say, "They had a 2-1-2."  He'd say, "No, it's box and one."  "How you know it's a box and one?"  "'Cause So and So stays on Max [ph.] all the time.  He's always on Max, the rest of them are going to do two."  And I learned so much from that, that my senior year I had been on the team my junior year.  My senior I didn't go out for the basketball team, you know, 'cause I wanted to concentrate on studying.  But I became the principal scout, and so I would go out and scout the team that they were going to play next for Mr. Smollens [James Smollens (ph.)].  And I would do all that based on the stuff that Albert had taught me.  And later on, for me it was--it began a situation where as a journalist I could teach writing better than I could ever write, 'cause I could understand something I couldn't do, you know.  And I give credit to Albert for that, you know, for teaching me that.  And even now I can understand tennis much better than I can play it.  I can really, really understand it.  And I was--that was a lesson in life.  So those are the important people in, in high school.
Story_ID: 640485
Speaker 1: All right.  So when you were a senior in high--I mean, did you run for class office?  Or were you a member of any clubs or any of that sort of thing in high school?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  I was the student council president in my junior and senior year.  I was--I was the student--every year, we had a variety show in high school called the Follies.  And for the last three years, my sophomore, junior and senior years, I was the student musical director of the Follies, because I had--my freshman year, I think it was my freshman year, one of the skits in the variety show was a beatnik scene, and I learned to play bongo drums from my brother [Jerome Coleman], you know.  And so they needed somebody to be in this beatnik scene who would bang on some bongos, okay.  So I banged on some bongos and I was in the beatnik scene.  But then Mr. DeVillers [Ronald DeVillers], the high school band director, said, "Well, why don't you just play bongos with the band, with the show band, you know."  So I did that.  And then the drummer with the show band got sick and we were supposed to do an appearance on TV.  And so DeVillers said, "Do you know how to play drums?"  I said, "I never played drums in my life."  He said, "Well, sit down, see what you can do."  So I did it.  And so from then on, I was the drummer in the show band and the jazz band.  And I had been fortunate while living in the projects [Hillside Terrace, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] in that a guy there had a drum and bugle corps.  And I learned to play bugle when I was, like, eleven or so, and marched in this little bitty drum and bugle corps.  And so by the time I got to seventh grade, I already knew how to play trumpet.  I had a trumpet.  And so I played--I started out playing trumpet and then I played drums in the show band, and then Mr. DeVillers started using me in whatever way he wanted.  So one year I played baritone, 'cause the baritone has the same thing as a trumpet.  And in my senior year, I played French horn, 'cause he didn't have enough French horn players.  He said, "You're going to learn to play French horn."  And by that time, I was also thinking about majoring in music, so I took theory and composition and learned a little bit of piano.  So I did all of these things.  And now I've forgot how, I guess, and started talking about music (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a big part of high school, really.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.  It was a huge part of high school.  And then, also, in my senior year, I went to Badger Boy State, which is this thing that I think the American Legion ran it, but a Boys State links to Boys Nation, but Boys State is this sort of civil program.   And I ran--I actually ran for governor of Badger Boys State.  I lost.  I had hoped to become the second person from Lincoln High School [Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] to become governor of Badger Boys State, because Al Jarreau was the first.  He had gone to Badger Boys State.  And, and those--I think those were the leadership things that I did when I was in high school.
Story_ID: 640486
Speaker 1: When you graduated [from Lincoln Junior-Senior High School; Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], did you graduate with any special honors or anything?
Speaker 2:  	I received--every year they gave out a leadership award, the George Beamer trophy, I think it was.  B-E-A-M-E-R, which was given to the top leader in the senior class.  And I received that award.  And so it's time to go to college.  I had pinned my hopes on getting a football scholarship as a place kicker.  You know, I had learned--I had learned to place kick.  I taught myself to place kick by reading books like Mr. Sartin [Obbie Sartin, Jr.] always said, reading books.  And I--so I--and I practice all through the summer and got in my--and sure enough, I was the kicker.  And then in the third game of an eight game season, I screwed up my knee, you know.  And so that sort of went down the drain.  And so I didn't even--I didn't know what I was going to do.  So at that time, there were twelve public high schools in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, to which my high school band director [Ronald DeVillers] had gone when it was Milwaukee State Teachers College, gave a free tuition only scholarship for one year to the top two graduates of every one of these twelve public high schools.  I was fifth in my class.  The one guy who was ahead of me decided to go into the [U.S.] military instead.  And the two women came from families that didn't believe women should go to college.  So I moved up from fifth to second.  Got a scholarship for $128 a semester go to University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And that made the difference--that was what allowed me to go to college.
Story_ID: 640487
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  This is UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Now, were you familiar with UWM at the time?
Speaker 2:  	No.  I don't, I think had never been to the campus.  And it had only become the UWM a few years earlier, and my recollection is that when I started there, the colors were still cardinal and white, 'cause I--
Speaker 1: That's the university (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) University of Wisconsin.  The fight song was 'On, Wisconsin.'  And the alma mater was something like by Cuyahoga's waters or whatever.  And because one of my most cherished pieces of memorabilia, which I since have lost, was, I was on the basketball team at UWM for like three weeks, and I had my old UWM jersey, which was cardinal and white, you know.  And it wasn't until, I think, my fourth year at UWM, my third or fourth year at UWM that they decided to change the school's nickname, 'cause I think it was the Cardinals, and then we had a--there was a vote to pick new colors and a new mascot.  And this was, I think, my fourth year at UWM.  And we picked Panthers, because the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] were around then.  And also the colors were black and gold, and I'm an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], so I voted for black and gold, you know, and they became the school's colors.  But I knew nothing about UWM at the time.  But the band director said you could get a good education there, and I believed that, you know.  And it was college.
Speaker 1: So UWM, I take it, was fairly new then.  It was a branch of the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] before.
Speaker 2:  	It was Milwaukee State Teachers College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And there was--it became UW-Milwaukee and there was a UW-Parkside [University of Wisconsin-Parkside], which was in Racine, either Racine or Kenosha; I think Racine [sic. Kenosha, Wisconsin].  But it had just become--and that was a big deal for it to become a UW dash school, because at the time, what are now the other UW dash schools were state colleges.  There was Platteville state college [Wisconsin State College and Institute of Technology at Platteville; University of Wisconsin-Platteville, Platteville, Wisconsin]; Whitewater State College [University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, Whitewater, Wisconsin], you know; Green Bay state college [University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Green Bay, Wisconsin], you know.  There was just state colleges. They're now all--University of Wisconsin, acquired University of Wisconsin, Platteville University of Wisconsin, Whitewater, Stevens Point [University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Stevens Point, Wisconsin].  That, the whole state system changed.  So, I mean, I knew hardly anything at all about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I had you--I know, being in involved in sports. Had you seen yourself as more of a sports, I guess, school with more sports notoriety?
Speaker 2:  	No.  I went to college--I started out wanting to be a high school band director like Mr. DeVillers [Ronald DeVillers], you know, and I was able to get in as a percussion major, because at that point I'd pretty much stopped playing trumpet and I played French horn my senior year.  But I continued to take drum lessons.  So got in as a percussion major, and--
Speaker 1: This is 1958, fall of '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2:  	No, no.  This is--I graduated in--this is the fall of '63 [1963].  I graduated in June of '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  You said (unclear).  June '63 [1963].
Speaker 2:  	So I start out as a percussion major in--hoping to--percussion was my major instrument.  I would want to go into music education, okay.  And so I started out, I played percussion in the wind ensemble, and in the marching band, 'cause, you know, freshman and sophomores had to be in the marching band.  That's when UWM had a football team.  Ain't got that no more.  But I started out that.  I took--since I started as a music education major, I had to take piano, and clarinet, and flute as a music education major.
Story_ID: 640488
Speaker 1: And then I met this musicology teacher named Edith Marie Borroff, B-O double R-O double F.  Edith M. Borroff, who taught music history and literature.  And she was one of the most influential people of my life when I was in college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], Edith Borroff.
Speaker 2: Why?  What did she do?
Speaker 1:  	She taught me how to think.  She--she taught me that if you study music history or any kind of history, it's important to understand not only what happened before this and what happened after this thing you're looking at, but also what happened at the same time that this was going on.  That was one thing that she taught me.  The other thing I learned from Edith Borroff is, she used to give listening tests in her music history classes where she would put on--she would play some music, and she would ask you to identify the music, who was the composer, what era was it from, and why did you--what is it that you heard that made you think of the answer that you subsequently gave?  And on one of these--on any one of these--Edith Borroff's tests, you could get the answer absolutely wrong.  But if you gave a good rationale for why you gave that answer, you got an A, because she wanted you to believe in what you heard and associate what you heard with the right facts.  And sometimes she would put on stuff that was a 20th century imitation of an 18th century piece.  And so, and she wanted to make sure that you really understood that.  And that was important to me, because I remember when I became a metro writer at The Post [The Washington Post] and the question was, what would be my relationship to the overnight editor who worked for me.  And using Edith Borroff's thinking, I would tell the overnight editor to look, and unless it's a major, major thing, don't call me.  Now, I go home at night, they deliver the paper to me at 10:30, I like to be in bed by midnight.  Don't call me.  Do what you think is right.  And then I come in the next day and I'd ask, "So why did you do that?"  And they would say, "Well, I thought so and so and so and so."  And I'd say, "You know what? I would not have done that, but you did the right thing."  You know, and I learned that from Edith Borroff.  And she also was just a wonderful person, you know.  Just a real nice person.
Story_ID: 640489
Speaker 1: And when I--once I met her, and also that was the time when--that was after the March on Washington, and after the school boycott in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, those are the two things that happened the summer before you started school [at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], right?
Speaker 1:  	The March on Washington was the summer before I--was the summer before I started school, and the school boycott was 1964.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	'Cause I was a freshman, and I remember teaching in a Freedom School on Walnut Street, Greater Galilee Baptist Church [Greater Galilee Missionary Baptist Church, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).  Did the school boycott start the second semester of your of your freshman year?
Speaker 1:  	I think so.
Speaker 2: It would be beginning the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1:  	I think so.
Speaker 2: Did you have any--did you know anybody that--did you go to the march or did you see it on TV?
Speaker 1:  	No.  I did not go to the march.  I did not go to the march.  I was--that summer I was in a drum and bugle corps, so I didn't go to the march.  My wife [Faye Edwards Coleman] went to the march, but I didn't.  My soon to be wife.  Ultimately to be wife.
Story_ID: 640490
Speaker 1: But I taught--I taught in the school boycott because I had--around that time, I think after the boycott was when music came along, the Milwaukee United School Integration Committee.  And it was run by a guy named Lloyd Barbee [Lloyd A. Barbee], B-A-R-B-E-E, who was like the leading civil rights lawyer in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And I remember teaching in this Freedom School.  And then I switched my interest in music to ethnomusicology.  I discovered ethnomusicology.  There was a guy in the anthropology department named Robert Black, a professor, and who was an ethnomusicologist, and he got me interested in ethnomusicology and African survivals, because there was this guy, Melville Herskovits [Melville J. Herskovits], who had written this book, 'The Myth of the Negro Past,' about all the African survivals in black Americans.  And so I decided that I wanted to be an ethnomusicologist specializing in African American music, you know.  And so the rule to this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Herskovits for whom the African studies department at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]--
Speaker 1:  	At Northwestern, that's right.  That's right.  And so I switched majors and there were two ways you could major in--two ways you could become an ethnomusicologist. Either you got an undergraduate degree in music history literature or an undergraduate degree in anthropology, and I decided I would get my music history in literature.  UWM did not have a program in music history or literature at the time.  They were just starting one.  Edith Borroff assured me that by 1967 or 1968 at the latest the degree would be approved.  And it was.  So I may have been the first graduate in music history and literature from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And meanwhile, I took as many anthropology courses as I could and got involved in the black student movement--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at UWM.
Story_ID: 640491
Speaker 1: Now, what was the--was there a name for the black organization yet?  This is the 19 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) It was initially ABS, the Alliance of Black Students.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in nineteen sixty what?
Speaker 2:  	This would have been in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know that a lot of people were still calling themselves Negroes in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2:  	I'm going to take a sip of water.
Speaker 1: Students--okay.
Speaker 2:  	Well, what had happened in between--in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] was the riot in 1966 [sic.] or something I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And a couple of things had happened in between that time.  Number one, we had--we had started with--started a chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] on campus, Epsilon Tau Chapter, which became a campus organization in 1965; maybe late 1964.  I know I went over on August 8th, 1964, and shortly after that, we became a recognized campus organization. And also around that same time, the Methodist council on campus opened a place called Soul Place, right across the street from the UWM campus [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And there were--after the riots in Watts [Los Angeles, California], the NAAC- the Milwaukee chapter of the NAACP Youth Council had become very active, because they were being criticized 'cause they had--they were passing out buttons that said, "Burn Baby Burn" (laughter), you know, which, of course, was the Watts riot thing that a disc jockey made famous, the Magnificent Montiscue [sic. Magnificent Montague].  And then there were open housing marches in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] led by the NAACP Youth Council and Father James Groppi from St. Boniface Church [St. Boniface Roman Catholic Church, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] on 12th [sic. 11th Street] and Center [sic. Clarke Street].
Speaker 1: James Groppi.  We interviewed the lady who became a judge in Milwaukee who was involved in that too, really involved, and I can't think of her name, now [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips].  But everybody seems to know her in Milwaukee.  She's in her nineties now.
Speaker 2:  	Mary Ellen Shadd [Mary Ellen Shadd Strong]? Or--no, I know who you're talking about.  I can't--it may have been Mary Ellen Shadd.
Speaker 1: And Father Groppi was (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Groppi, yeah.  And the community organization movement was hitting Milwaukee at the time from Chicago [Illinois].  And a number of us worked in summer jobs, because they had the Office of Economic Opportunity, which would give out grants after the Watts riots, which we used to all jokingly call keep cool money.  Say, you keep cool in the summer, you get one of these jobs.  And so, we worked out of--my first summer job in community organization was through the boys club of Milwaukee, and the second one was through Northcott Neighborhood House [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], which was, at the time, run by Lucius Walker [Lucius Walker, Jr.], who subsequently became director of the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization.  Lou Walker.  And so once the A Phi A chapter came on campus, it became a sort of a catchall for black campus activities, 'cause I remember the first time I ever got arrested was on an open housing march, and the Alphas and the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] 'cause the AKAs also became a recognized chapter on campus, we went to one of these marches, 'cause I remember very clearly us being on the playground at St. Boniface and being told that you could not march.  And we had to dissemble, and we refused to dissemble, and the cops came over and kicked a little rear end, you know.  First time I ever got hit with a billy club, lying on top of an AKA so she wouldn't get hit.  But so there was agitation on campus.  And then in '67 [1967], Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] came to speak on campus, and I think Ron Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga] came, too.  And so we began organizing, and we put together this group called the Alliance of Black Students, ABS, to demand a black studies program, which we made a mistake of calling--of saying we wanted a black student union.  And everybody thought we wanted a student union that was black as opposed to an organization of the program and all that.  And I remember we went down and talked to people from Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], 'cause Jim Turner [James Turner] was, at the time, at Northwestern.  He had led the demonstrations at Northwestern.  And then we agitated and fi- and that's what led to the black studies program at UWM.
Story_ID: 640492
Speaker 1: Were the students allowed to participate in the, the choosing a director or faculty over the black studies program, or did they have any input into what it would entail?
Speaker 2:  	We had some input into it.  I--we agitated for it, and finally the faculty agreed to do it, but I don't know that we had very much input after that, because that didn't come around until, I think, 1969, and by that time I had turned down a scholarship offer to go to school in New York, to stay in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], because I had been promised a graduate assistantship at UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee], and that assistantship offer was later withdrawn.  And so I started graduate school.  I was in graduate school for about five weeks and dropped out and started driving a cab.  But I don't know--I can't recall exactly what student involvement there was, but there was some involvement from people who had been a part of the student movement at UWM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So during this time, you in the music history and, let's see.  Had you done any writing at all or a paper, a campus publication?  Was it (unclear) or was it (unclear) on your mind at that point?
Speaker 2:  	No.  No.  Because I was a music history and literature major, and because in music school there are a lot of recitals and concerts, the writing I was doing was mostly program notes.  I drew program notes for the band concerts, program notes for orchestra concerts, program notes for student recitals.  And so at one point, at one point, I'm trying to get a date with this woman who works at one of the black newspapers, okay.  And so I asked her what's she's doing on the weekend, and she says, 'cause I said. "I'd like to take you out Saturday night."  She said, "I'd love to go out with you, but the paper I work at has given me these tickets to the [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis concert and they want me to write a review of the Ramsey Lewis concert."  And she said, "And I have no idea how to write a review of a concert."  So that was my opening, you know.  So I said, "Well, I can write a review for you."  You know.  And so we went to that Ramsey Lewis concert, and I wrote this review, you know.  And she took it in and the editor said, "This is pretty good.  I didn't know you could do this."  And bless her heart, she said, "I didn't write that.  [HistoryMaker] Milton Coleman wrote that."  And subsequently, he allowed me to write a couple of columns.  Once I got involved with black activism, and during the time of the student activism on--at the UWM campus, I would write press releases, you know, and position papers.  And so when I graduated from UWM and started driving taxi cabs, my roommate at the time suggested that I get a job at the Milwaukee Courier.  And I went to this guy and who is now at the Milwaukee Courier instead of another paper and they hired me.  And that was my first newspaper job.  I had written a few columns and a few reviews here and there, and a national article or two for the old Negro Digest, which later became Black World.
Story_ID: 640493
Speaker 1: Now that's, that's something--did--that's significant.  I mean, while you were in college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], you wrote an article for Negro Digest.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was--who was the editor at that time?
Speaker 2:  	Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller].
Speaker 1: Oh, Hoyt Fuller, right.
Speaker 2:  	Hoyt Fuller, yep.  I wrote an article on cultural nationalism, on educ--another one on education, and I reviewed a Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] pamphlet, and I reviewed Rap Brown's [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] book, 'Die Nigger Die!,' all for Negro Digest, Black World.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah.  Negro Digest, right, then, 'cause they hadn't turned to Black World yet, I guess at that point, or just getting ready to.
Speaker 2:  	Hold on a second (pause).
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't matter.
Speaker 2:  	Well, it's someplace else (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2:  	But I still have those articles, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear), from Negro Digest to Black World.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's--those are the first--I wrote pieces for black weeklies and then I wrote pieces for Negro Digest and Black World.
Speaker 1: Now, when did your piece come out in Negro Digest, Black World?
Speaker 2: I seem to recall it came out shortly after--it should have been around 1968 or '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I can get you that later on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, that's significant of the--see, people like me were reading those in those days.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm surprised I don't remember, you know, the article, but I--yeah, that's the kind of thing I was reading.  I mean that--and people who read it really valued it.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was something that's--it was really significant.  Anybody that had an article in there was a significant person as far as we were concerned.
Speaker 2:  	I was--I mean, I was absolutely stunned to be published like that, you know, and I still have those, those issues.
Story_ID: 640494
Speaker 1: How did you make that connection?  Did you go to Chicago [Illinois] and did you meet Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] or any of the black writers in Chicago in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, the first connection came through the person who was my col- who was my roommate my last year of college [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  His name was Tom Norman, and he later changed his name to Hekima Ana, H-E-K-I-M-A, last name, A-N-A, and he later joined the Black Liberation Army, 'cause he was one of those was involved in the alleged shootout in Mississippi, and he spent time in Parchman prison [Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman, Mississippi].  And Tom had lived in Chicago [Illinois] for a while.
Speaker 1: Now this is the Republic of New Afrika?
Speaker 2:  	The RNA, yeah.
Speaker 1: RNA.
Speaker 2:  	I said Black Liberation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	It was RNA.  RNA.  You're right.  It's RNA.  It's RNA.
Speaker 1: They had a Black Liberation Army, but this is the RNA (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes, RNA.  And--
Speaker 1: They had a significant Chicago, I mean a Milwaukee [Wisconsin] connection.  Not too much in Chicago (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	Right.  And he had lived in Chicago, and he turned me on to Phil Cohran [HistoryMaker Philip Cohran].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	You know Phil?
Speaker 1: Yes (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Philip T. Cohran.
Speaker 1: A musician.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, so this is (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) And the Artistic Heritage Ensemble.
Speaker 1: So did you go to Chicago and participate in what they call the--had a big black showcase in a theatre, the black--
Speaker 2:  	No.  But Tom went to those.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	It was like a theatre in a park.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And that's why I heard about Phil Cohran.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And, then, of course, you know, among the musicians with Phil Cohran were a couple of people who later played with Earth, Wind and Fire.
Speaker 1: Right.  It was (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and Maurice White.
Speaker 2:  	And Maurice White, for a while, was the drummer with [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis.
Speaker 1: Right.  I think they called themselves The Pharaohs (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.  Um-hm.  Um-hm.  And then at some point--
Speaker 1: So Phil Cohran would have known the people in OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture].  Now, I don't--
Speaker 2:  	OBAC, right.
Speaker 1: --formulation of black (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  But somewhere along the line I met Carolyn Rodgers, the poet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That would be the connection through OBAC, Carolyn Rodgers.
Speaker 2:  	And Carolyn turned me--we dated for a while, and Carolyn turned me to Hoyt Fuller, 'cause Hoyt was sort this avuncular figure for young writers, and I think it was through Carolyn that I first got published in Black, Black World, Negro Digest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  That's how that happened.
Story_ID: 640495
Speaker 1: All right.  So that, that makes--that's interesting.  All these connections--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --connect, yeah.  So you had published already and you--you know, so you must have been feeling like you could write fairly well.
Speaker 2:  	I felt I could.  I felt that I could write, and you know, I graduated--my graduation date is official 1968, but I got involved in the black student movement, and I didn't finish my coursework.  And so I had incompletes.  So I didn't actually--I actually did not get my degree until 1969, although UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] listed me as the class of '68 [1968].  And I--that summer, I'm pretty certain it was the summer of '68 [1968] that my first article was published.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I can check that, 'cause I have all those books anyway.  So, yeah, I had been published [in Negro Digest; Black World] and I felt I could write--
Story_ID: 640496
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, let's go back to even further, '68 [1968] back to spring of '68 [1968], 'cause I didn't ask you about the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and its effect in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 2:  	The--well, the summer of '68 [1968], I had--the summer of '68 [1968], I believe I worked at North- I worked through Northcott Neighborhood House [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And we had a summer program called Soul Shack [ph.] on 4th [Street] and North Avenue in what used to be a bank building, but is now a Foot Locker, shoe store.  And--maybe there was sort--maybe that was probably the summer of '67 [1967], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Anyway, but I remember when Dr. King was killed, two things.  I remember, number one, being at Northcott Neighborhood House, because then what we wanted to make sure of was that there wasn't--we didn't want there to be a riot.  And I don't think there was.  I know that afterwards, there was a--there was a rally at Garfield Park, I believe, which is on 3rd [3rd Street; Dr. Martin Luther King Drive] and Burleigh [Street], where the Clinton Rose Center is now, Clinton Rose senior citizen center [Clinton and Bernice Rose Senior Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And I remember giving a speech there and making reference to the McCarran Act [Internal Security Act of 1950], 'cause that I got quoted in the Milwaukee Journal [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel].  But I do not think that there were riots in Milwaukee, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) we shouldn't run past this without explaining what it is.  What is the McCarran Internal Security Act?
Speaker 2:  	It was--my recollection is that the McCarran Internal Security Act was an act that, in effect, talked about rounding up people and putting them in prison if things got disruptive.  And my recollection is that my reference to it was that it had been mentioned--Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] had mentioned it at some point.  Either Rap and or Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] had mentioned it.  And so a number of us also were mentioning it and using the occasion of Dr. King's death to try to heighten the contradictions, is what we called it, you know.  And I remember mentioning that.  And I also--there was also some TV show that I was on, it was on Channel Ten [WMVS-TV, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I think, was the education station in Milwaukee.  And I mentioned it.  They had some kind of hearings, and I remember speaking at some of these hearings and I think I must have spoken when I had a toothpick in my mouth, 'cause somebody talked about me with a toothpick lodged in my mouth or whatever.  But everything sort of kept cool in Milwaukee after that.  And I think it was--I think in 1968 was the summer when I worked at Soul Shack on 4th and North Avenue, which is--which was like a youth center.  I'm almost certain it was down there, because Ken Addison was there by then, yeah, 1968.  But we had--we avoided a riot.
Story_ID: 640497
Speaker 1: So there are activities, federal government funded activities and other organizations--you said the Methodist church funded Soul Shack?
Speaker 2:  	It was sort of the Methodist church funded Soul Place.
Speaker 1: Soul Place.
Speaker 2:  	Soul Place was across from the UWM campus [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Soul Shack [ph.] was the place we had on 4th [Street] and North Avenue.  A guy named Ken Addison, whom--you probably run into him in Chicago [Illinois].  He works out of Chicago now.  Ken Addison was the director of that program, and I was the program director for it.  And it was--it was a place where we taught African history and Swahili, and something else during the day, and there was--and there was a pool table and all that.  And then at night, we had a jukebox, 'cause that was the year that the long version of 'Stay in my Corner' by The Dells was out, 'cause the kids used to always--when we told them, "Okay, we got ten more minutes, and then we're going to close," they would go over to the jukebox and punch everything until it got to that song.  And that'll be the last song.  And everybody would slow dance, and then they'd go outside and fight (laughter).  And what we were trying to do, we broke up all the fights, you know.  I used to have the exact number of how many fights we had, and I think three stabbings and two shootings.  But we kept all the kids out of jail, and we got them home.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a gang problem in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] in those days?
Speaker 2:  	No, no.  Not a real gang problem, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering if the Chicago gangs had infiltrated Milwaukee.
Speaker 2:  	No.  They had not moved up there at that point.
Speaker 1: I know, during the era, I think it was the El--well not El Rukns.  Then they were the P--the Black Stone Nation.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm, Black P. Stone Nation, yep.
Story_ID: 640498
Speaker 1: So, all right, so fast forward then to Milwaukee Courier.  We had you at the Courier before we went backwards in time.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so at the Courier, your job was to write articles and--
Speaker 2:  	My job with the Courier was to do everything (laughter), but you always did at black newspapers.  But mostly I was a reporter.  We had--I was a reporter.  There was a brother named Lee Holloway, I believe, who was a reporter.  Carole Malone was the city editor.  Dave Novak was the managing editor.  Jerrel Jones was the owner.  And the chief photographer was a brother named Kenneth Lumpkin; Kenneth W. Lumpkin, L-U-M-P-K-I-N, from Alabama, who had worked for The Southern Courier, and was a hell of a photographer, who essentially taught me how to take pictures.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And we used to do a photo page every week, and we did some classic photo pages.  We--he would take the pictures, I would write the prose.  And we did one for Mother's Day, which we called Big Mama (laughter).  And I remember we--he even--one time he even shot The Temptations, and I did the copy block for that.  And we all did the layout of the paper, and that was it.  It was a good newspaper.  And Carole Malone was a very good editor, because she taught me--that the great job about news work is, as she always said, "You get paid to know other people's business."  And Carole was very good at it.  She a was a good editor.  And Jerrel Jones--and Jerrel Jones was the publisher, and--I'm sorry I'm striking out on his name.  Who was the editor was the guy who hired me, who was also a Jones.  But he had gone to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], and he was a really good editor.  I mean, they introduced me to community journalism, which became the core of my journalistic experience.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2:  	Walter Jones.  Walter Jones was the editor.
Speaker 1: Walter Jones.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Jerrel Jones, J-E-R-R-E double L [sic.], was the publisher.  But Carole Malone, Kenneth Lumpkin and Walter Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were they related at all, the two (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) The Jones weren't--the Jones were not related.
Story_ID: 640499
Speaker 1: Okay. So how many years did you work for the Milwaukee Courier?
Speaker 2:  	I worked from--I started at the Milwaukee Courier in April of '69 [1969], and I worked there until, I think, a little bit before I left, which would have been--I worked there for about a year or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Until 1970.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, 'cause I came to North Carolina in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, does this have--this story has something to do with how you met your wife in North Carolina (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  I (laughter).  When I was at the Courier, I had done this interview with Jim Turner [James Turner], and it had been reprinted and the Courier sent me to a meeting of the national association of African American educators in Atlanta [Georgia] in August of 1969.  And that is when, according to me, I met Faye Edwards [Faye Edwards Coleman] in the parking lot across the street from Paschal's motor inn [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant] in Atlanta.  If you ask Dr. Coleman when she met me, she would say, not until October of that same year in the student union at North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina], to which I conclude that the old boy just made no impression on her (laughter), you know.  And she didn't notice me until later on, but whenever people ask us how we met, there are those two conflicting stories, which I try not to ever resolve.  It's too precious.
Speaker 1: So in North Carolina, so did you relocate to North Carolina in 1970?
Speaker 2:  	I went to North Carolina to work for the Student Organization for Black Unity.  And eventually--
Speaker 1: Now, this is known popularly as SOBU.
Speaker 2:  	SOBU, yeah.  Later it became YOBU, the Youth Organization of Black Unity.  But I went to work for SOBU, and I was coordinator of informational services.  I think that was my title, but which meant that I was in charge of what started out as the SOBU newsletters, fashioned after the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] newsletter, and later became The African World newspaper.  It's getting hot down here.  Is the air conditioner turned on?
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, what sort of articles were you writing for SOBU?  What were they doing?
Speaker 2:  	Oh we--anything that--anything that fit into our ideological perspective.  Pan-Africanism, black nationalism, some cultural nationalism, reviews of books, ghost writing, a series of and Mozambique.  We had some correspondence.  We were the first to cover the Howard Fuller [Owusu Sadauki]--to do a thorough coverage of the Wilmington Ten, I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Ben Chavis [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.].
Speaker 2:  	Ben Chavis, yeah.  And just anything that fit into our first black nationalist and Pan-African, and later on more Marxist Leninist orientation, although by the time they turned hard Marxist Leninist, I had left.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there from 1970 until?
Speaker 2:  	I was there from 1970 until probably--let's see.  Sekou [Sekou Coleman] was born in '71 [1971], so I would say to '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	To '72 [1972].  Early '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  You left in '72 [1972].
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 640500
Speaker 1: So what was the--now, this is the era of--I know Operation Push [Rainbow PUSH Coalition] was big in Chicago [Illinois] with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson].  You had- were you a part of the founding of Congress of Afrikan People?  (Unclear) I think that was 1970 in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2:  	I was not there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And I think it was--I think the Congress of Afrikan People was after 1970.  I'm not so sure.  No.
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969] or '70 [1970].  I think it's '70 [1970].
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, '69 [1969] maybe.  It doesn't say anything about the '69 [1969].  It wasn't afterwards.  And they had a big (unclear) in Atlanta that they formed it and then they, you know.
Speaker 2:  	I think that--I don't remember distinctly the relationship between the Congress of Afrikan People and SOBU [Student Organization for Black Unity].  But there were--there was a lot of rivalry during those days.  And I think that our wing at SOBU sort of dismissed them as cultural nationalists, and not necessarily Pan-Africanists, you know, 'cause we were--'cause there were also feuds at that time between the Stokely wing of what used to be SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and the Black Panther Party, and Huey [Huey P. Newton] and Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver], all that was dismissed.  There were a lot of rivalries, you know.  And SOBU had a particular line.  It was more associated with Stokely than with other people.  And it had a particular kind of path in it's line.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did Stokely Carmichael himself play much of a role in SOBU?
Speaker 2:  	No, no.  He was sort of an iconic figure.  We talked a lot about what Stokely was doing.  My son is named after Sekou Toure [Ahmed Sekou Toure], which is clearly a Stokely influence, 'cause there are at least two Sekous from that era.  Our son being one and another one.  A friend of ours also named his son Sekou.  My son is named after Sekou Toure and Patrice Lumumba.  Sekou Lumumba Coleman [Sekou Coleman].
Speaker 1: Sekou Toure was the--
Speaker 2:  	Sekou Toure was president of Guinea at the time.  And, of course, Patrice Lumumba was, according to Malcolm X, the first and the rightful prime minister of the Congo.  So we named Sekou after Sekou Toure and Patrice Lumumba.  And by coincidence, Sekou means warrior, and Lumumba, someone is gifted.  So he's a gifted warrior, you know.  But he was named after Sekou Toure.  And so Stokely was never really--Stokely had influence to Cleve Sellers [Cleveland Sellers], because Cleve was active with all of us, you know.  And he spoke a couple of times, but, you know, there was no active involvement.  At that point, Stokely had moved his base of operation to Guinea.  He had not yet, I don't think, become Kwame Ture.  It was still Stokely but he--I know he sent a telegram to Howard [Howard Fuller; Owusu Sadauki] for the opening of Malcolm X Liberation University.  And then a year or so later, he spoke, and he spoke at North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was SOBU [Student Organization for Black Unity] basically led by Cleve Sellers [Cleveland Sellers]?
Speaker 2:  	SOBU was influenced by Cleve, but was essentially led by Nelson Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And Cleve was influential, Howard [Howard Fuller] was influential because SOBU became like the community organization of Malcolm X Liberation University, and Malcolm X was essentially Howard and some other people, (unclear) and some other people.  'Cause by then, he had become Owusu Sadauki.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  So this is the key organization, I guess, in the proliferation of African Liberation Day. I know, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] had started an All-African People's Revolutionary Party around the same time, I guess (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  'Cause I think the first ALD was 1972.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2:  	And spoke--and Stokely spoke at that, at Malcolm X Park [Meridian Hill Park].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  You're right.  Right.  Right, this becomes like an annual event in Washington, D.C. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And around the country and other places, too.
Speaker 2:  	Right.  Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: The big one was always in D.C.
Speaker 2:  	Yes, the biggest one was D.C.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 640501
Speaker 1: So you were there until '72 [1972].  Now, why did you leave SOBU [Student Organization for Black Unity]--I mean, I'm- this is a rhetorical que- I mean guess you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) I left because I became interested in journalism, you know.  And so I had--and I--I didn't go along with the hard turn towards Marxism.  I just didn't.  And so, I left SOBU and started something called the All African News Service, which was a news service aimed at black publications.  And we started that in 1972 with some of the people who had worked at The African World newspaper.  And that's what brought me to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	'Cause I figured if I was going to have a national news service, it could not operate out of Greensboro, North Carolina.  It needed to be in Washington, D.C.  And so we had a couple of small grants and we moved to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you affiliated at all with Drum and Spear here?
Speaker 2:  	I was not affiliated with Drum and Spear, but Drum and Spear was closely affiliated with the Center for Black Education [Washington, D.C.].  And the Center for Black Education was part of a group of independent schools.  It was Malcolm X Liberation University, the Center for Black Education, and a school in Newark, New Jersey [The Chad School] that Leon Moore was the head of.  I can't remember the name of it.  But they were all independent black schools, you know, and had work--sort of working relationships.  And Drum and Spear actually was right down the street from the Center for Black Education, 'cause the Center for Black Education was on Fairmont [Street] between 14th [Street] and 15th [Street].  And Drum and Spear was on Fairmont in this big apartment building on the ground floor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And Charlie Cobb [Charles E. Cobb, Jr.] was big with Drum and Spear and some other people.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2:  	Who were all part--they were all the old SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] folks, you know, with some others, including this brother.  Did you know Acklyn Lynch?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Right.  Yeah, from Trinidad.  Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  Yeah.  You know his son, too?
Speaker 1: I don't know his son.
Speaker 2:  	Jair Lynch?
Speaker 1: I heard of him, but I don't know him.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  He won a gold medal in Olympic gymnastics.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.  He (unclear) on TV (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.  And he now--he now has a development company here in Washington [Jair Lynch Real Estate Partners].  He's developed a lot of properties.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Acklyn Lynch, he was part of Drum and Spear?
Speaker 2:  	He was affiliated with them, people--because these people had a connection with the University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] at the time, and Acklyn was at UDC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And it was Acklyn, Jimmy Garrett, Charlie Cobb, Courtland Cox, a whole lot of those people.  Freddie Greene.  Yeah, a lot of the old SNCC folks.
Story_ID: 640502
Speaker 1: Say old SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]--they were all young (laughter) (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) They were all young, yeah (laughter).  Yeah.  They're all young.
Speaker 1: You know, but I guess they had to be old SNCC by that time.
Speaker 2:  	Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--it's quite a group in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], you know, but--
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But all the groups had like a slightly different ideological twist (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Exactly.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: --twist (unclear).  So did--okay.  So--all right.  Now, All African News Service.
Speaker 2:  	It's called the All African News Service.
Speaker 1: Who was in charge of that?
Speaker 2:  	I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you didn't make that--okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you started that.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then moved to D.C.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  Moved, yeah.
Speaker 1: Moved and got some grants, you said, from--
Speaker 2:  	We had a couple of small grants.  I can't remember who they were from.  One of them may have been from--I can't remember where they were from.  I will misspeak.  I shouldn't say I know.  But very, very small grants.  And we tried to survive by subscription costs, but people didn't pay their bills (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you provided content for black newspapers, the black news and other, I mean, I don't know if you provided content for Jet or (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) No, no, no.  It was mostly aimed at black weeklies and some student newspapers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	You know.  Because my original purpose for getting into the news was so that--to help black folks better understand reality so we could make better decisions.  That's why I got into the news.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems like that--or the '70s [1970s], early '70s [1970s] were a tremendous time for news about Africa to reach the United States.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I don't what happened but even Jet covered Africa much better than they do today.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: The magazines we talk about, Black Scholar [The Black Scholar] and Negro Digest--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was a very robust time.
Speaker 1: --Black World.
Speaker 2:  	Yep.
Speaker 1: You know, Black Books Bulletin.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause, what's his name was the editor at Ebony, Lerone Bennett, Jr. [HistoryMaker Lerone Bennett].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And he had just done 'Before the Mayflower' ['Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America'].
Story_ID: 640503
Speaker 1: So you just couldn't get the papers to pay their bills on time--now, this is probably, no matter what kind of service you had, it probably would be an issue in the black (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.  And because of--I mean, that was the beginning of the thing--of the black--of the black press.  You know, the black press had been at its high point in the '60s [1960s].  And then as is so frequently the case, once white folks start doing it, the black folks go out of business, you know.  And it was always clear to me from my days at the Courier [Milwaukee Courier] that so much of the advertising in the black press at that time was not consumer driven.  Then the advertising came primarily out of the public relations budget of the supermarkets.  But they weren't really trying to get black folks to buy their cabbage and coleslaw.  They were just trying to look good.  And even to this day, a lot of advertising toward ethnic publications is not consumer driven.  You know, it's public relations driven.  And the black press had really been good until white folks started covering the Civil Rights Movement, 'cause up until that time, if you wanted to read about what was happening in the South, you had to read the Chicago Defender and the Afro-American Newspapers; the Atlanta Daily World, you know.  The black press told you about the lynchings.  The white press did not.  And so I was part of the generation, probably on the tail end of the generation of people who came out of the black press into mainline newspapers, you know.
Speaker 1: I've been told not just in journalism, but in many other fields, doors for opportunity, you know, popped up after the '68 [1968] riots.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And (unclear) mean black people who had not even--didn't even dream about being in a riot were able to get a job, you know, in so many fields.  They were the first African American--I interviewed the, you know, the first African American to do this or do that, anything you can think of almost.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so.  They were actually recruiting people to be a part of like, Newsweek or Time or whatever.
Speaker 2:  	If you read the Kerner Commission report on the chapter on the news media, it paints a whole picture of what life was like for black folks in the media at that time.  I mean, Carl Rowan was the only black syndicated columnist.  The only one, you know.  And there were hardly any editors or--because, you know, essentially, white guys cover the Civil Rights Movement, and that was their springboard to higher positions in the news media, you know.
Story_ID: 640504
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in--so what happened at the close--now, in '72 [1972], you start All African, the news service [All African News Service], and just before we leave that, like, how did you get your information?  I mean, did you--
Speaker 2:  	I had--I had a bunch of people--a bunch.  I had a few people in various strategic locations who would write stories, and I had somebody in San Francisco [California], brother named Reggie Major, who was very close to the Panthers [Black Panther Party] and wrote a lot about what was going on in Northern California.  I had a sister, Asha Turner [ph.] in Atlanta [Georgia], who I think worked for a TV station, would write some things for me.  I had somebody in New York [New York] who was a student at Columbia [Columbia University].  [HistoryMaker] Francis Ward was in Chicago [Illinois] from the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], and he would send me stuff on the side.  And that's how we made it, you know.  I'd occasionally write things.  We got international news from some- if somebody was in Africa at the time and they did a story.  And Charlie Cobb [Charles E. Cobb, Jr.] did some stories out of Tanzania for us.  And otherwise, we would play rip and rewrite.  We would listen to the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] and whatever news they would broadcast about Africa, we'd write it up as a brief, put it in our own package and send it off, you know.  We had students from some campuses.  It was clearly a fly by night operation, I'll tell you.  But not bad.  Not bad.  I mean, I had a columnist--oh, I feel terrible forgetting all these people's names, but the brother who was the sportswriter for The Washington Post, then went to USA Today, wrote a sports column for us on the side.  And that's something people did at the time.  Black journalists who worked at white organizations would moonlight for you and send you stuff.
Story_ID: 640505
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'm glad I asked you about that, 'cause that's important.  I mean, when we talk about--in those early days, Mutual Black radio [Mutual Black Network], I think got started.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, and there were some other independent efforts or semi-independent efforts of black journalists in the print media and in the, you know, the electronic media, who put out the black point of view.
Speaker 2:  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this is also the era of independent black schools.  This is also the era of black professional organizations.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, the black police officers association.
Speaker 2:  	Right.  Right.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The teachers, the, you know, fire fighters; everybody's got some (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) That's right.  That's absolutely right.
Story_ID: 640506
Speaker 1: So what did you do--so, in '72 [1972], so this lasts from '72 [1972]--the All African News Service lasts from '72 [1972] until when?
Speaker 2:  	Seventy-three [1973], I think.  It lasted about a year.  And then it folded, and I went to work for WHUR Radio [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Because Charlie Cobb [Charles E. Cobb, Jr.] had been working there, and Charlie went to NPR [National Public Radio].  And I was hired to replace Charlie Cobb at WHUR.
Speaker 1: Charlie Cobb, he's an interesting person.  A lot of people mention him.  He was an ex-SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] man.
Speaker 2:  	Yep, he was.
Speaker 1: Now, a Pan-Africanist.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Writer.
Speaker 2:  	His father [Charles E. Cobb, Sr.] was big in, I think, the United Church of Christ.
Speaker 1: Right.  He's from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2:  	And Charlie was like the chronicler of SNCC.  He was the writer of SNCC.  You know, and he lived here for quite a while, and he's now down in Florida.  But I was hired to replace Charlie Cobb.  And this was 1973.  I'm almost certain, because it--because, yes.  It was 1973, and--'cause the issue on the Hill [Capitol Hill] was self-determination of D.C.  That's what the whole rule bill passed, in '73 [District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973].  And I also was the Washington [D.C.] correspondent for something called Community News Service, which was based in New York [New York].  I was--it was black and Puerto Rican oriented.  And the editor of it was a guy named Emil Milne, M-I-L-N-E, who subsequently became the chief of staff for Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel].
Speaker 1: That's Community News Service.
Speaker 2:  	Community News Service.  Based in, in New York City.
Story_ID: 640507
Speaker 1: And so I was working for WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.] and moonlighting for Community News Service.  And then, going toward the first African Liberation Day, I met a reporter from The Washington Post named Alice Bonner, B-O-N-N-E-R.  Alice Carol Bonner from Dinwiddie, Virginia.  And Alice told me about the summer program for minority journalists [Summer Program in Broadcast and Print Journalism for Members of Minority Groups] at Columbia University [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York].  And so I applied to that program for the 1974 summer and was accepted into the program.  By that time, my son [Sekou Coleman] had been born, and I was saying, you know, I need to get a job in daily newspapers, 'cause I got to support this family.  And so I applied to the summer program for minority journalists which at that point had been renamed the Michele Clark Summer Program for Minority Journalists [Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists], because Michele Clark had been in that program, and then she was killed in that airplane accident in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Explain to us who Michele Clark is.
Speaker 1:  	Michele Clark was a CBS news correspondent, a black woman.  And the Michele Clark summer program was for minority journalist wannabes, who had never been given a chance to break into the--to mainstream journalism.  And at the time, it had--they had a broadcast section and a print section.  And the way it worked is, you would go to Columbia Graduate School of Journalism for an eleven or twelve week summer program; it was like a boot camp.  And the good thing about it was, at the end of that time, you would be guaranteed a job at a daily newspaper or a TV station.  And I had worked--since '69 [1969], I had worked at the Milwaukee Courier and then done community journalism, and then done Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], but I'd never worked at a white newspaper, you know.  And so the great thing about the Michele Clark program, the year that I was in it, was the people who ran it, because it was run by Bob Maynard [Robert C. Maynard].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what year is this?  I think we have to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Seven--1974.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1:  	Nineteen seventy-four [1974].  It was the last year the Michele Clark program was at Columbia.
Story_ID: 640508
Speaker 1: Bob Maynard.
Speaker 2:  	Robert C. Maynard, M-A-Y-N-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: You know, so we--for who the Maynard Institute [Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, Oakland, California] is now named.
Speaker 2:  	That's right.  His daughter, Dori [HistoryMaker Dori Maynard], runs it.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well, tell us about the influence of Bob Maynard?
Speaker 2:  	Bob Maynard was a phenomenal journalist and a wonderful guy who really took people under his wing.  And Maynard, at the time, was the ombudsman for The Washington Post.  And this, of course, was during the Watergate years.  And Maynard brought us in and said that his role was to--armor building.  He wanted to build armor around us so when we went into the newsroom, we wouldn't be scared to death.  And the program [Summer Program in Broadcast and Print Journalism for Members of Minority Groups; Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists] was just so good.  I mean, first of all, the staff--Maynard was the director of the program, and the deputy director of John Dotson, John L. Dotson, D-O-T-S-O-N, Jr. [John L. Dotson, Jr.], who, at the time, was chief of correspondence for Newsweek.  And we put out a publication called Deadline [ph.], a weekly newspaper.  And we all wrote for those.  We were put on assignments every week, every day.  We were told that we had to be at the newsroom at nine o'clock in the morning.  And at that point, we should have known or read The New York Times, The Wall--The New York Times, the New York Daily News, and watched CBS news, and we were responsible for all that.  And they would send us on assignments, and they were tough.  It was tough editing, you know.  And Maynard was a stickler for detail.  And so, and he would come up from Washington [D.C.] every Friday, 'cause the paper would come out on Friday morning and we hadn't critiqued the newspaper.  And he would tear it to shreds, you know.  He was really, really good.  I mean, Maynard, at one point, criticized somebody because they said the grand jury handed down an indictment on somebody, and Maynard said that's incorrect.  The grand jury hands indictments up to the judge.  So I note, they hand up indictments.  They don't hand them down, you know.  The first day that we had this test, Maynard--I remember Maynard asking me what was the budget of the New York City Council, because it was on the front page of The Times that morning.  I got that right, you know (laughter).  And I, and I felt good about that.
Story_ID: 640509
Speaker 1: And then Walt Stovall [Walter Stovall III], who was originally married to [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault, and was--had worked for AP [Associated Press] in Georgia.  He's from Georgia.  And he then worked for AP in New York.  I remember Walt Stovall sending me on a--to cover a budget hearing at New York City Hall [New York, New York], and I didn't know what was going on.  So I asked this guy on the city council [New York City Council] what was going on, and he explained everything to me.  It was Matthew J. Troy [Matthew J. Troy, Jr.], city councilman.  And so I called in to Walt thinking that I was going to have--I had always felt right, you know, and in this wonderful Georgia accent, he said, "Who did you talk to?"  I said, "Troy-- Matthew J. Troy."  He said, "That's what I figured."  He said, "Mattie Troy is the biggest liar around.  Don't you believe a damn thing he tells you.  And if Mattie Troy tells you that the sun is going to shine tomorrow, you come in this goddamn newspaper with an umbrella."  You know.  "Now, go right around the corner--," he told me--he told me exactly where to go.  And lo and behold, about several months later, Matthew Troy was indicted.  You know, so I mean, they knew.  I mean, the very first session we had was on interviewing.  And the--who did the interview session for us, Mike Wallace, you know.  There was a guy who wrote the book on libel.  We had a session with him, so that by the time I got to the Minneapolis Star [Star Tribune], and they had sessions on libel with the staff attorneys, I said, I don't need to go to that thing, because I took libel from the guy who wrote the book, you know.  It was a phenomenal program [Summer Program in Broadcast and Print Journalism for Members of Minority Groups; Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists].  An absolutely phenomenal program.  And you went in--you came out of that program feeling that you could own any newsroom in the country, because you had been taught by the best, you know.  And so when I went--when I came to the Minneapolis Star, I just felt reassured that I was going--I could do whatever needed to be done, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you're at the Minneapolis Star Tribune, right?  And that's--
Speaker 1:  	I was at--there were two papers at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	The Star was an evening paper--afternoon paper, and the Tribune was the morning paper.  The Tribune was the state newspaper, the Star was focused primarily on Minneapolis [Minnesota] and primarily on the Minneapolis side of the Twin Cities, because there was sort of--we didn't invade St. Paul [Minnesota].  That was the Pioneer Press dispatch territory.  We didn't invade that.  Now the papers have crossed that line, you know, but--
Story_ID: 640510
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so you went directly there after you finished the Columbia [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, the deal was that when I went into the program [Summer Program in Broadcast and Print Journalism for Members of Minority Groups; Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists], I had a newspaper--I had to have a newspaper that was going to take me afterwards.  And Maynard [Robert C. Maynard] and Dotson [John L. Dotson, Jr.] thought I was a little bit over talented for the program, so they got--they got me to the largest paper they had, which was the Minneapolis Star [Star Tribune].  Other people went to smaller Gannett papers, but I went to the Minneapolis Star.  And the agreement was you had to stay at that paper for a year.  And so, I went there in the fall of 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And my first job was--my first beat was suburbs, the western suburbs; Richfield [Minnesota], Edina [Minnesota], Scott [Scott County, Minnesota] and Carver counties [Carver County, Minnesota].  And then my next beat was city hall.  And all the time I really wanted to get out, and I really, 'cause it was cold up there, we didn't have very many friends.  I had--we had one friend from Milwaukee [Wisconsin] who had moved up there, and I asked him to tell us some people who we could talk to, to find out what it was like to be black in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And so he had us sit down with this woman who lived in the complex where we were going to live, which was in a new town, in town; place called Cedar-Riverside [Minneapolis, Minnesota], which is now nearly all Somalis.  So we go in to see this sister, and we said, "So explain to us about the black community in Minneapolis."  She said, "Well, the first thing you have to understand is that in Minneapolis, the black community is predominantly white."  Said, okay, you know.  But we wanted to--we wanted to get out of there.  Faye [Coleman's wife, Faye Edwards Coleman] was working for something called the Minnesota family daycare project, which flew people--flew her around the state with other folks to train family daycare providers.  And so she would go to all these outposts in Minnesota, and she came--she went to a couple of them where people had never seen a real live black person before, and they actually rubbed her skin to see if it would rub off, you know.  And so I said, we got to get out of here.  So I'm in for ten months, and I called Maynard.  In his wonderful, sophisticated speaking style, wonderful accent--Maynard's from--I think his folks are from Barbados--I said, "Bob, I really need to get out of here."  And he said, "So who have you sent to jail lately?"  I said, "Excuse me?"  He said, "Who have you sent to jail lately?"  I said, "Bob, I ain't sent nobody to jail.  I'm trying to get out of this place.  Now why you ask me that question?"  He said, "Well, call me back when you send somebody to jail."  Hung up the phone.  That was it, you know.  And so I did some investigating and stuff there.  I almost sent one guy to jail.  I became known as the--as the paper's expert on municipal finance, because that was the time when New York was going under, you know.  And so I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I still remember the City of New York [New York] yeah was in--
Speaker 2:  	Bankruptcy.
Speaker 1: --bankruptcy.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: John Lindsay was the mayor.
Story_ID: 640511
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Right.  And I, and I wrote a, I wrote a series on Minneapolis finances that became part of my packet that I sent out looking for a job.  And so I started looking for a job after I'd been--I had already been turned down by the Dayton Daily News, and turned down by The Philadelphia Inquirer a year earlier.  And so I get this letter from the woman who's in charge of recruiting for The Washington Post newsroom, because I had applied for another job in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I put Maynard [Robert C. Maynard] down as a reference, and Maynard had given this woman the clips, and she wanted me to come and interview at The Post.  And so I had three interviews set up.  One at The Washington Post, thanks to Maynard; one at The Philadelphia Inquirer, and one at the Washington bureau Newsweek.  I had these three interviews.  And so I come down and do these--all the interviews, and I get back to Minneapolis [Minnesota], so Faye [Coleman's wife, Faye Edwards Coleman] says, "Well, what's the story?"  I said, "Well, I have two interviews--I have two job offers.  I have one from The Philadelphia Inquirer, and one from The Washington Post."  She said, "Which one's the better offer?"  I said, "Well, actually The Philadelphia Inquirer has the better offer."  She said, "Why?"  I said, "Well, if I go to The Washington Post, I'll be covering government and politics in Montgomery County of Maryland.  If I go to The Philadelphia Inquirer, I'll be covering the governor."  She said, "Where's the governor?"  I said, "In Harrisburg [Pennsylvania]."  She said, "I hope you have fun." I decided to come to Washington [D.C.] (laughter).  But it was a good offer in both places, but she was not about to go to Harrisburg.  Wise woman that she was, 'cause Three Mile Island occurred a year or so later.  And so that's how I wound up coming to The Post.  And I--while I was in Minneapolis, I was mentored by, not only by Maynard, but by Joel Dreyfuss, who later became all kinds of things including the managing editor of theroot.com.  But Joel was--I would write stories and send clips of those stories to Joel, and Joel would critique them in a no holds barred way, and Maynard and Austin Scott, who at the time was with The Washington Post, but had been with the Associated Press.  And Joel taught me to always be concerned about who your editor is and to try to get an editor who would not only tell you why your story is no good, but would help you understand how to make it better.  And I learned that from Joel, and I learned how to write better from Joel, 'cause Joel was--Joel at the time was at The Washington Post, and he was on the style staff and, in fact, when I came down for interviews, I stayed in Joel's apartment in Washington, 'cause I had my interviews in Philadelphia--in Harrisburg on, like, a Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  And my interviews at The Post were, like, on Monday and Tuesday.  So I came down to Washington and stayed in Joel's apartment.  He was away.  And Joel, himself, had been the center of controversy, because he had trapped--he had been on the job as a Los Angeles [California] correspondent for The Post, and had been denied that job in a very public way, 'cause Ben Bradlee wrote a memo to Joel saying that, "Joel, you're a good reporter.  Everybody wants a good reporter in Los Angeles, but nobody wants a pain in the ass," and all of that had become public.  And so when I came down here, I told Joel.  I said, you know, "Joel, if I'm offered a job at The Post, I'm not so sure I'd take it."  And Joel said, "Why?"  And I said, "Well, because of what went down between you and Bradlee."  And Joel said, "You'd be a fool if you do that.  What happened between me and Bradlee is between me and Bradlee."  And Joel said very prophetically, "You might be able to do things at The Washington Post that I could never do."  So with that advice from Joel and the sage advice of my wife (laughter), I came to The Washington Post.
Story_ID: 640512
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is in 1975?
Speaker 2:  	Six [1976].  May 12th, 1976, was my first day at The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-six [1976].  Post.  Okay.  So what did you cover for the--Montgomery County [Maryland]?
Speaker 2:  	Montgomery County politics and government, specifically the election for the, what was then, the 8th Congressional District in Maryland, and the guy running for it, the Democrat was a guy named Lanny Davis, who subsequently worked in the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] White House.  Lanny J. Davis.  Lanny Jesse Davis.  He lost the election and blamed it on me.  But I came there at a time when Herb Denton was in line to become the first black city editor of The Washington Post.  And he was the Maryland editor at the time.  And I was in Montgomery County for two months.  No it wasn't.  Yeah, for two months.  And he said, "Your next beat is going to be D.C. city hall, the district government.  But you got to stay there through the election."  So I stayed through the primary in September, I think it was, and then they moved me to the district building, where I covered the end of Walter Washington and the beginning of [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry as mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was that--now, this is the beginning of a new era in Washington [D.C.] politics and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, because the home rule act had been passed in 1973 [District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973], approved by the voters in 1974, and that's when the first elections were held for mayor.  Walter Washington was elected mayor.  Marion Barry was elected to an at large seat on the city council [Council of the District of Columbia].  And no sooner than he got on the city council, he started running for mayor.  And so the first election, the first time he ran for mayor was in the primary on September 12th, 1978.  And he won the primary.  In D.C., if you win the Democratic primary, you're in.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  The Republicans have no--
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: --city voting strength at all?
Speaker 2:  	No.  No.
Speaker 1: Like a lot of cities.  Like Chicago [Illinois], or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania](simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right; it's a one party town.
Story_ID: 640513
Speaker 1: So that's when Marion was, Marion was elected in--well Marion won the primary, and then he won the general election.
Speaker 2: What were your first impressions of [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry?  He was an old SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] man, too.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, but Marion--Marion was a founder of SNCC, but Marion had gone north and was somehow working in the New York office of SNCC when he then moved to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  And I think he was--he came here as a fundraiser.  I liked Marion as a politician, and I learned D.C. politics from Marion Barry.  I really did, because he was--there were two--there were several old SNCC people here.  One of them was his alter ego, Ivanhoe Donaldson.  And Ivan O' became the chairman of Marion Barry's campaign.  Courtland Cox was involved in it.  Charlie [Charles E. Cobb, Jr.] was involved in it.  But also the other person who was around who had been a SNCC guy was John Wilson [John A. Wilson].  And John Wilson was on the council [Council of the District of Columbia] like Marion was.  Marion was an at large person, Johnny Wilson was representative of Ward 2, which at the time was the downtown ward.  And the first thing I learned from these guys was how elections really worked, and there's a false notion out there, because, you know, you decide to run for office, you go out and present yourself to the voters, they decide whether they're going to vote for you.  And that way you win or lose.  And that's not the way these guys ran elections at all.  Their view was, you decide how many votes it's going to win this election.  You identify your voters and get them to the polls.  And that's how Marion Barry got elected, you know.  That they decided that this three way Democratic primary, about 100,000 were going to vote, and if you could win 34 percent of those votes, you could win this election.  And they knew where they were going to get those votes from, and they got them.  And it was about identifying their voters and getting their voters out.  And to this day, that is how elections are won.  And D.C. has this strictly racial--not strictly.  But very strongly racial voting patterns, you know.  There's a white city and there's a non-white city.  And Marion won the first time around by getting his voters to the polls and they were primarily white voters.  And then after he won, he very wisely shifted his base to the black middle class and the poor.
Story_ID: 640514
Speaker 1: And you know, the thing about Marion, when I first met Marion, Marion was the chair of the finance and revenue committee, you know.  People don't know that, you know, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry was a Ph.D. candidate in chemistry at the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee], you know.  And he had a good staff.  People there were very smart, you know, especially Ivanhoe [Ivanhoe Donaldson], you know.  And so, he was a good politician.  He understood politics, and he understood the budget.  I remember asking Marion something about some program he was going to get that's going to cost $100,000.  And I said, "Marion, where are you going to get the money from?"  He said, you could always find $100,000 in a million dollar budget.  He was right, you know.  He was smart.  He played good politics and he had a good staff.  And so I learned an awful lot about politics from Marion, and I don't deny that, you know.
Speaker 2: I think around the country, people will look at Marion Barry's public appearances broadcast nationally and not have as high of an opinion of him, you know, because as he might say--sound uninformed and so forth.  But that's not the case, is it?
Speaker 1:  	No.  Marion--what ruined Marion was sort of being elected mayor and getting the power and chasing younger women, you know.  I remember talking to someone who had been in AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] with Marion, who said that that's--that young women sort of ruined Marion.  They're the ones who got him into drugs, and then also the power of being the mayor.  And if you were going to chase women, that's a good line to have: "I'm the mayor," you know (laughter).  And that was the beginning of Marion's downfall.
Story_ID: 640515
Speaker 1: Marion [HistoryMaker Marion Barry] took office in '79 [1979], reelected in '82 [1982], and by that time, things had started to go bad.  The crack [crack cocaine] epidemic really didn't hit 'til the mid-'80s [1980s].  And by the time, we were being the murder capital of the world, it was close to '90 [1990], '91 [1991]; sometime around that time, and it was because D.C. [Washington, D.C.] had the highest homicide rate in the country on like a per capita basis.  There were actually more murders--more murders in New York City [New York, New York], I think, but we had--we would sometimes have like four hundred homicides in a year.  And ironically, it was for the same reason that there're so many homicides in Chicago [Illinois], the availability of guns.  The availability of guns.  And the people settle their differences with guns.  That's how I remember.  At the time, I hired [HistoryMaker] Nathan McCall as a reporter to cover Marion.  And Nathan had served time in prison for armed robbery.  And I remember talking to Nathan about guns, and Nathan telling me how wonderful a killing weapon it is, 'cause Nathan says, you know, "If you stab somebody, it gets messy, and you got to feel the knife going in all the time. You got to keep at it, keep at it, keep at it."  He said, "A gun is very antiseptic.  You stand over here and pull the trigger and he's gone.  Just like that."  And it was a chilling conversation.  I'm glad I had it with Nathan.  But that's why there's so many killings now, and that's why handguns are such a problem, because you can just get them.  And Courtland [Courtland Milloy] and I did pieces--at the time D.C. had its prison in Lorton, Virginia, and Courtland and I spent a lot of time talking to prisoners at Lorton [Lorton Reformatory].  And they would all talk about guns in this way and that way.  And it's the same problem we have now.  You know, guns are available.  Anyway, I digress.  (Laughter) Go ahead.
Story_ID: 640516
Speaker 1: But--okay.  But we were talking about the early stages in [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry's mayorality.  And well, your position at The Washington Post, you were covering city hall, right?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so did you cover it through--I mean, how long did you cover city hall?
Speaker 2:  	I--Marion was elected in '78 [1978], took office in '79 [1979].  I stayed as a reporter until 1980.  In 1980, I became first assistant city editor, then city editor.
Speaker 1: Now, how did this transition take place?  What was (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	Well, the key person was a guy named Herb Denton, D-E-N-T-O-N, who--Herb was from Little Rock [Arkansas], went to Central High School in Little Rock.  Herb went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at the same time as Don Graham [Donald E. Graham]. And Herb and Don went to Vietnam together.  Don comes back to Washington [D.C.], gets a job as a police officer.  Herb comes down here, and I think Herb got a job at a bank.  But anyway, Herb wound up coming to The Post as a reporter.  And then he became the first black city editor of The Washington Post.  Herb was a mentor to me and taught me how to operate in The Post newsroom, even as a reporter.  And so after the elections, Herb left the city staff and went to cover the White House.  And Leonard Downie [Leonard Downie, Jr.], who was then the metro editor, Downie went to London [England] and Woodward [Bob Woodward] became AME [assistant managing editor] metro, and Bob offered me a job as city editor because I knew the city, I had a good record as a reporter.  And so I first became assistant city editor, and then I became city editor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is--city editor in Washington at a time when D.C. was then properly called Chocolate City.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, I think that 85 percent of the population was black, something like that; some ridiculous figure like that.  And which is not--no longer true (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --but that was a time of a lot of political power in D.C. and a lot of rich cultural stuff, and you know, and some other things that may not be so good, too, but so what was your--what was going on in the city (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, a lot was going on.  A lot was going on in D.C. at the time.  And so I became city editor, and Herb had changed the way that The Washington Post covered the District of Columbia, because Herb insisted that we get out into the neighborhoods, that we get to know people, that we come to understand the power structure, and not only that we know the communities, but we need to become known in the communities.  And so I spent a lot of time out in the communities as did Courtland Milloy, as did Pat Camp, Patricia Camp; as did [HistoryMaker] Juan Williams, because Juan was--Juan came to The Washington Post the same year I came, 1976.  He came as a summer intern.
Story_ID: 640517
Speaker 1: We learned how the city operates from the ground up.  We felt part of our job was to make sure that every aspect of black Washington [D.C.] that we could get in the newspaper [The Washington Post] we got in there, whatever it was.  I remember at one point, Herb [Herb Denton] hired someone as a reporter and this was before there was Powerball and the lotteries, and I once asked Herb why he hired this person.  He said, "Well, if we ever need to play some numbers, he'll know where to go to play them.  You won't," (laughter).  And Herb was right, you know.  I mean, we really covered every aspect of the community, because we felt that was our obligation, you know, and it was an exciting time.  There were scandals we were blamed for, for being hard on people, on black politicians.  We felt that that was part of our responsibility, however, because I used to say at the time, nobody in the black community ever told me they don't want to know--learn about wrongdoing.  They never said that.  The wrongdoers may say they don't want you write about it, but the community wants to know about it.  And we also tried to do all sorts of positive stories that got--stories about black folks into the paper that wouldn't have gotten in there any other time.  And not only that was what we felt was our mission, and Herb's started that when he was city editor, and I felt that I could continue it, in addition to hiring more people of color.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, what's the most memorable story, I guess, that came--that you had--that you were associated with in terms of or--I don't know.  I may not be asking the right question here or the--
Speaker 1:  	I don't know that--I don't know that there was any one story at that time.  I mean, it was my--as a reporter, my calling card was covering [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry.  As an editor, it was covering Marion Barry, hiring folk in the jobs, and the Million Man March.
Speaker 2: That's not until '95 [1995].
Speaker 1:  	I know.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1:  	We got that right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the, in the--okay.
Speaker 1:  	We got that right.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 640518
Speaker 1: But in the-say in the '80s [1980s] here, this, you know, late '80s [1980s].  Is there a time when as city editor or assistant editor, you really--something that you did really made a difference, and if you hadn't done it, it would not have been--
Speaker 2:  	No, no, no.  No.  My most interesting job as the city editor was Janet Cooke.  But--
Speaker 1: Now, Janet Cooke, that story--that's like 1980?
Speaker 2:  	No.  It was 1981.
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981]?  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I think.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just kind of, you know, I guess give us a, you know, a brief--
Speaker 2:  	Synopsis of it?
Speaker 1: --a synopsis (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, it was a story that--it was a story about a young kid, who we said was a heroin addict.  I think the kid was eight years old, supposed to be eight years old.  And it turned out that the story was a fabrication.  It won a Pulitzer Prize.  The Post [The Washington Post] relinquished the Pulitzer Prize.  Janet acknowledged that she made all this up.  She resigned.  It was a horrible embarrassment to the newspaper, and so all of us who were involved, and I was her editor.  I was city editor at that time.  And if you ask anybody what was [HistoryMaker] Milton Coleman's fifteen minutes in the limelight as city editor, it was Janet Cooke.  You know.  And it was--
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back at that, is there anything that you could've done--you should have seen?  Or I guess it probably is by now.
Speaker 2:  Oh, plenty of things.  I mean, I should have--I should have listened to people who were giving me warnings, and I didn't.  That's, that's the main thing, you know.
Story_ID: 640519
Speaker 1: What did people say?  What were the warnings?
Speaker 2:  	Don't trust her.  I mean in so many words.  That's--you know.  And her--the person who was her editor, Vivian Aplin-Brownlee, just kept suggesting to me that, be careful, don't believe in this story too strongly.  And I didn't listen to Vivian as much as I should have, you know.  She, too, was an Ohio person, by the way.  She was from Steubenville.  And Courtland [Courtland Milloy], who I knew was a really good street reporter, Courtland didn't believe it.  And I sort of dismissed that as jealousy on Courtland's part, which I should not have done, you know.  And then it was only later that things began to pop up that I thought were not really Kosher.  But by then, it was sort of too late, because by then, I had become sort of locked in on the story.  But let me back up a second and tell you that part of the problem was there was this reputed eight year old heroin addict.  This kid was eight years old.  And Janet [Janet Cooke] had been turned on to that story by a woman who worked in a treatment center, a woman named Alyce Gullatte, who was a special advisor to the mayor, who at the time was Marion [HistoryMaker Marion Barry].  And I think what happened is, Janet was told about this kid who she nicknamed Jimmy at the time we could use pseudonyms.  We don't do that anymore.  And I think she never actually found the kid.  She never located him, but she just fabricated all these facts about this kid.  And so--and, of course, one of the things you learn at the newspaper is you have to trust your reporters.  And so many times you, as an editor, you put stories in the papers, you don't understand them, but you got to believe it to report it, you know.  And so I had this feeling that if, indeed, there was this kid out there and--I knew nothing about heroin, although I did ask somebody who was a former heroin addict, if the description given in the story before we published it ['Jimmy's World,' Janet Cooke], is that how, ius that what happens when you shoot heroin.  That person said, yes, that's exactly how it works.  Okay.  So that all seemed good.
Story_ID: 640520
Speaker 1: And we had written stories before about people shooting up heroin, you know, and many of which we had been told about by police officers, you know.  And so my first--when we published the story ['Jimmy's World,' Janet Cooke], I figured--I said, okay, the D.C. police [Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia] are pretty good.  So it's going to take the cops seventy-two hours and they're going to have this kid, you know.  They'll identify him and everything.  And when the police didn't find him for the week, I got suspicious, 'cause--because I knew and trusted D.C. police.  They were pretty good, you know.  They had told one of our reporters they had taken to a shooting gallery and she wrote a story about folks shooting up heroin and everything, and I think by that point, Courtland [Courtland Milloy] had written his story about One Arm Diane [sic. Diane White], who ran an oil joint, you know.  And things just didn't ring true.  And then the turning point came when--'cause first of all, Marion [HistoryMaker Marion Barry] said she--he was going to find this kid.  And, of course, the police wanted us to say where the kid was, and I didn't know, and I wasn't going to tell them.  And I had been given the--I'd been given the treatment by Howard Simons and the managing editor, who always told you, you know, when something was going to be a stake, and when you might be called in to testify and might even go to jail.  And I said, I told Howard, I said, fine.  I don't know, and I'm not going to tell.  If they throw me in jail, okay, fine.  You know, and all that.  So the pressure was building on The Post [The Washington Post] to turn over this kid, you know.  So, finally, Howard and I talked and I said, "Okay, Howard.  Let's--I'll go out with Janet [Janet Cooke] on--next week, and I'll go and talk to the family and tell them to turn the kid in.  Just turn the kid in so he can get treatment."  And in those days, there was a--the afternoon paper was the Star [Washington Star], and the most important newspaper of the week was the Sunday newspaper, and if you were an important editor, as the city editor was, you worked Tuesday through Saturday.  You were off Sunday and Monday.  So you'd be there on Saturday when we put out the good newspaper.  So I told Janet that we were going to go and talk to this kid, when I came to work on Tuesday, we're going to do that.  I come to work on Tuesday, and she's left a note for me saying she'd been out there on Monday and they'd moved, and she didn't know where they were.
Story_ID: 640521
Speaker 1: I went in to Howard Simons and said, "Howard, I don't believe this.  I don't trust her now.  I don't trust her."  And Howard said, "You may not, but you have to be the last one to give up on her, because you are her editor.  The moment you give up, it's over."  I said, "Okay.  All right."  You know, so I hung in there, and then we win the Pulitzer Prize, and some reporter, and I think it may have been the AP [Associated Press] starts checking her resume and finds out that she did not go to Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York] as she claims.  And so Ben [Ben Bradlee] asked me to talk to her about that.  I take her across the street to the, what is now the Capital Hilton hotel [Washington, D.C.], she insisted she went to Vassar.  I call the office in Vassar, they say we have no record of a Janet Cooke ever attending this college.  I go back and I says, "You lied."  And she says, "No, I didn't.  Blah, blah, blah.  I don't know what the problem is," you know.  So we go back and Bradlee says, "Okay.  Get her in the car and go out and find those people.  Go back to that house."  So we get in the car, we go down to Xenia Street in Southeast [Washington, D.C.], X-E-N-I-A.  She says she can't identify the house where they lived.  So I take her back to the office, tell that to Bradlee.  Bradlee then has a horrible conversation with Janet in which he calls her, pointblank, a liar.  And she had also said on her resume that she was fluent in French.  So Bradlee, who was the information attache at the U.S. embassy in Paris [France] at one point, breaks into French and asked her what he said.  She didn't have the slightest idea.  And she breaks down in tears and everything.  Then she wants to talk to David Maraniss, who was then the deputy AME [assistant managing editor] from metro news, Woodward's [Bob Woodward] deputy.  And she acknowledges to Maraniss that she made it all up, you know.  So the next day the--Bradlee calls a meeting in the newsroom and says, we're going to give back the Pulitzer.  And Janet has resigned.  And meanwhile, I was not at that meeting.  My task was to go to the airport that morning and pick up her mother, 'cause her mother was coming into town.  And so when people ask me, you know, when is the last time I talked to Janet Cooke, I said, the morning after the night before.  And to this day, that's the last time I talked to her.  But anyway, that's, that was my city editor thing, you know.
Story_ID: 640522
Speaker 1: I've never heard a story following up on what happened to her.
Speaker 2:  	Janet--Janet subsequently got a job at the--at a department store here [Washington, D.C.].  I want to say it's Bloomingdale's--was a Bloomingdale's.  Then she got a job--she was said to have been working in a department store in Detroit [Michigan], and then several years later, she sold--a guy named Michael Sager [Mike Sager], S-A-G-E-R, who's a contributing editor at either GQ or one of those, I think it's GQ, a respectable men's magazine, not Penthouse or anything like that, but, you know, men's fashion magazine, wrote a story about the Janet Cooke he knew, 'cause they had known each other as reporters.  They sold the screen rights to the Janet Cooke story to somebody, but the movie never came out.  I talked to Sager around that time.  I have not talked to him since, and I have not talked to Janet since.  But she never got a--she never got a job--to my knowledge, she never got another job writing, you know.  She was a very good writer.  She was quite a gifted writer.  Had I been her agent around that time, I would have told her, look, sell your story to the highest bidder, you know.  Jump all over this guy Coleman [HistoryMaker Milton Coleman] and The Washington Post, then get a contract to do a second book, fiction, 'cause you can write.  You're a good writer, you know.  But, I was not her agent (laughter).  But, so I don't know what happened to her, you know, but it was--it wasn't a pretty time.
Story_ID: 640523
Speaker 1: I guess it caused you a bit of trepidation, being her editor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.
Speaker 1: You know, and you--'cause you said a little while--I mean, you had to refer back to what you were told about how an editor deals with a writer.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Being--having trust in them and then sticking with them as long as you (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.  I mean, anybody who edits at The Washington Post or any newspaper like The Washington Post, you're bound to put stories in the paper that you simply do not understand.  And in the end, you have to trust your reporters.  And we gave a lot--we gave reporters a lot of leeway at that time, even though there were considerable safeguards.  But you trusted reporters, you know.  And even now, I remember when I--there's a reporter at The Post, Sari Horwitz, who has won three Pulitzer Prizes, and I've always said of Sari Horwitz, if Sari says it's true, I'll put it on the front page of the newspaper, you know.  And then there were other reporters like the person who was city editor for a while, but it was a reporter when I was the metro editor, a brother named Keith Harriston, who really had good news judgment.  And if Keith Harriston said it was not true, it was not true, you know, 'cause he was a good reporter, you know, and you trust people like that.  And Herb Denton had taught me that there was a guy who was the foreign editor of The Washington Post, subsequently became the ombudsman, and is now--subsequently became the ombudsman for NPR [National Public Radio] for Mike Getler [Michael Getler], who, when I came to The Post covered the defense department [U.S. Department of Defense] and National Security [National Security Council], covered the National Security people.  And Herb once told me, he said, you know, "Getler is a really good reporter."  I said, "Why do you say that?" He said, "Because most of what he writes about, none of the editors understand it.  But if he says it's true, they'll put it in the paper."  So you gave people that kind of trust.  And I was not as sophisticated as I later became about how to, how to judge reporters, and how to smell a rat.
Story_ID: 640524
Speaker 1: Now, the Janet Cooke case, you know, caused a lot of embarrassment in the black community amongst people that want to see black people succeed in the black community--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and also amongst the black journalists who--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --probably especially so.  And, but the whole black community was embarrassed by this.  Here's someone that reached this level that, you know, has that kind of a fall, you know.  How did you, even though you, you know, did what you thought was right, you're also editor--her editor.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So how did you--were people calling for you to resign too, or were people suggesting that you are culpable in some way in this, in the Janet Cooke case, or--and how did The Post [The Washington Post], like, stick by you or did they (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	The Post stuck by me all the way.  I was never asked for, nor did I ever volunteer to resign.  I got some people who--one person who shall remain nameless, called and said, "Are you going to be made a scapegoat for this?"  And I said, "No.  I don't think so."  The person said, "Good, 'cause if they were going to make you a scapegoat, I'll have a thousand angry black people down there tomorrow."  I said, "No, no, no, (unclear). We don't need that," (laughter).  But people stopped by.  People who knew me said, you know, it seems like you made an honest mistake, big mistake, but honest one, and one person who was one of my assistants gave me a real good piece of advice.  He just--he said, you need to now just, you know, pull in your horns and become an ambassador to your staff, you know.  And I did that.  And then a year or so later, we wrote a story about a guy who had a contract to provide hotel rooms for homeless people in the city. And the reporters and the editor, both of whom worked for me, had a copy of the indictment of this guy, what they said was the indictment of this guy.  And we ran a story on the front page about this guy's record.  Only afterwards did they tell me that the middle initial of the person they said was indicted was not the same as the one that we said it was.  And Bradlee [Ben Bradlee] came down for a meeting, I think it was Tuesday vice presidents' meeting.  When he had found out about this from some other vice president, and I hadn't told him about it because I was just now learning about it, and so Ben chewed me out in the middle of the newsroom.  At that point, the city editor's desk was in the middle of the newsroom, and Ben chewed me out right there in front of my staff.  And typical of Bradlee.  He always led with his heart and then came back with his head, you know.  So later that day, Ben calls me--comes back--then comes back to me and takes me into Woodward's [Bob Woodward] office, you now.  Like all offices at The Post, it's all glass, you know, 'cause Ben insisted that there not be walls.  Everybody can see when people were meeting.  So Bradlee says to me, "A couple of things I need to tell you.  First of all, I was wrong to say to you what I said, where I said all that.  And I apologize for that.  I'll never do that again."  You know, again, typical Bradlee.  That's the guy he is.  And he says, "So, secondly, couple of things you need to know.  Number one, if you get into trouble, come let me know right away, 'cause I know how to get you out of trouble, 'cause I've been in more trouble than you've been, okay.  And secondly," he said, and this meant a lot to me, he says, "now, you're running in the fast lane, and you just fell flat on your fucking face, and you know what that means?"  "No, Ben.  What does that mean?"  "Get up and run.  Get up and run again.  Don't let--don't let this throw you back."  Some of the best advice I ever got, you know.
