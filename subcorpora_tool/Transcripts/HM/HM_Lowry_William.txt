Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Amy Billingsley.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: William E. Lowry, Jr., and that's L-O-W-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and William is spelled the regular way?
Speaker 2: W-I-L-L-I-A-M.  I don't use it that much.  So, (Laughter) I don't know how to spell it, either.
Speaker 1: And you're known as basically--
Speaker 2: Bill.
Speaker 1: Bill Lowry.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you give us your date of birth, and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 16, 1935, Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a vice-president with the [John D. and Catherine T.] MacArthur Foundation, Vice-President of Human Resources and Administration.
Speaker 1: And you retired from Inland Steel?
Speaker 2: Retired from Inland Steel Company ten years ago where I was, my last position there was director, Corporate Director of Personnel and Recruitment.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, can you tell us what today's date is?
Speaker 2: Today is February 19, 2003.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the MacArthur Foundation offices.  And it's in the Marquette Building on Dearborn; 140 South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 626222
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five "People Magazine"-ish type questions that I'm compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one is Sir, what is your favorite food.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Well, that's sort of easy.  My favorite food is fried chicken.  It's just that I can't eat it anymore.  People won't let me eat it, my wife or anybody else.  But fried chicken is my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Sir, what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: That's more difficult.  I guess I would say blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The older I get, the warmer I get.  (Laughter).  So, I would have to lean toward summer here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Alright.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't know about favorite.  But more recently we've been spending a lot of time in Mexico, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico which I like very much.  And at one point, Aruba was a favorite vacation spot of mine as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't really think I do.  You'll have to ask some others who know me better than I know myself about that.  I don't think I do. But I don't know.
Story_ID: 626223
Speaker 1: Alright.  What... let me ask you some questions about your family background.  How much do you know about the origins of your family, and can you...  How far back can you trace your family?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Actually, not enough.  And Larry, that's one of the things that I guess I'm most frustrated about.  Because we have, my brother and I have to do a better job of this. My mom [Camille Lowry] is ninety-two years old, and we're trying to go back as far as we can, and we just haven't gone back far enough.  But in terms of actual knowledge, I never knew my grandparents... my grandfathers.  I knew my grandmothers, but not grandfathers.  And we can go back I guess as far back as my mom's parents, and not much further than that.  And that's, therein lies the problem, because we want to go deeper than that.  And my mom was from Mississippi and my dad [William E. Lowry] was from Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee.  My mother is from Hollandale, Mississippi.  And both of them came to Chicago [Illinois] pretty early in their lives and then spent their lives here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let me ask you about--well, before I go into that...  Did your grandparents tell you... your grandmothers tell you any stories about their growing up at all?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little bit.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A little bit, but unfortunately when they were telling me, I was so young.  Because of my grandparents, my grandmothers, died pretty early.  You know, at that time the life expectancy was not what it is now.  And so, I was really a little shaver when they were talking.  But yeah, they used to talk about... more about growing up.  And my grandmother, certainly in Mississippi would tell me about things there, and cotton and all those things.  And as a kid playing--and the same to some extent with my grandmother who was from, had come from Tennessee.  But there's nothing what I would call of any substance that at this point I'm able to pass on.  And therein lies this part of my frustration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they came from basically the agricultural setting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, rural.
Speaker 1: Rural.
Speaker 2: Rural areas in both--I guess and Memphis probably was more urbanized than where my grandmother was, from Mississippi.  Because they talked about farming; they talked about being around animals and critters more than I remember my grandmother or my father talking about in Memphis.  But I think we could say rural more than anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626224
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your mother [Camille Lowry].  Now, when was she born, what was her name?  What was her name, when was she born, and what kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we can say what kind of person 'is' she.  I can talk about--
Speaker 1: Is she, okay.  Oh, okay, alright.
Speaker 2: --the way she was.  But she's still alive, so we can still talk a little bit about what kind of person she is now, yeah.  Mom was born Camille Caldwell in Mississippi, and didn't have a middle name.  And because she didn't have a middle name, she thought that every child should have a middle name, so she gave herself one.  And she called herself Evelyn, although that is really not her middle name.  So, her name is Camille Caldwell.  And then later, obviously became Camille Lowry.  Mom is an interesting person.  I think in growing up...  I don't know what she was like as a child.  But my guess is that she was probably rather reserved, not extremely out-going, and I would say probably mannerable.  And docile may be too strong a word, but I think mom was the kind that grew up and was a child that was pretty happy in her childhood and took things pretty much the way that they came, and probably didn't push back a great deal as a youngster.  But she was what I would call a slider... would take things as they would come and move on with them, and was very agreeable.  And she carried that into I think her adulthood, and is still the same way.  And for the most part, still... behavior is still the same.  I mean she's a, she's a person that's pretty agreeable; will try to do whatever she can to assist others and accommodate others; isn't too overbearing in most cases with respect to what she expects or requests.  And as a parent, some might call her an easy parent.  But I think for us, she worked.  And for us--meaning and my brother and myself--she would let us know what she expects, but she wasn't going to hound us over it; she expected it to happen.  And I think we tried to accommodate her, or certainly respect that in her, and did it.  And because of her rather under-stated way, I think that she was pretty effective, and remains pretty effective.  And she was a sharp contrast, in a sense from my dad [William E. Lowry], who has passed.  Because he was quite different in terms of style, a little bit more domineering.  And I think he identified with what he considered to be the epitome of a father, which is to be there; to be the head of the house and the person who provides and takes care of the children and puts a roof over your head and food on the table... and work.  And he did that.  And for several years, he worked two full-time jobs so that he could do that so that my brother and I could go to school, and those kinds of things.  But you didn't ask me about my father, did you?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Not yet.  But since you're on it, let me...  Now, I assume your mother was born around 1912 or so?
Speaker 2: Mother was born in 1910.
Speaker 1: Nineteen-Ten [1910].
Speaker 2: In 1910.
Speaker 1: And well, what about your father, when was he born?
Speaker 2: Dad was born in 1906.  And-
Story_ID: 626225
Speaker 1: Is there a story about he and, he and, about how he [William E. Lowry] and your mother [Camille Lowry] met?
Speaker 2: There's probably a story, but I guess I don't know it as well.  Because actually, Dad came to Chicago [Illinois] when he was eight years old, and had not been to school.  And came to Chicago and went and got into school immediately, and then graduated from [Wendell] Phillips High School when he was sixteen.  Mother went to, graduated from Phillips too.  But they really didn't meet... if they met, they were not close in dating at Phillips.  And it wasn't until later that they got together and got married.  And I'm sure there's a story there, but Larry, I don't really know the story.  As I talked to Mom, it seems as if they were mutual friends; they met through mutual friends that were socializing together, and then eventually they got married.  And then, either fortunately or unfortunately, they eventually had me.  And I'm the eldest.  And when did that occur?  Because I was born in '35' [1935], and I guess they got married in, I want to say '33' [1933], 1933.  And Dad was working at the post office and worked in the post office for almost forty-one years.  And then Mother, at the time that they met, I believe she was working at a drugstore, in the pharmacy.  And later she got in the post office, went to the post office and started working when I was eight years old there, and then retired... and beat the system.  And so did my dad.  My mom's retired and she's now alive at ninety-two, and still receiving her pension.  And I guess she retired in roughly '65' [1965], I want to say around '65' [1965] or a little before.  And Dad had retired early.  And when he passed, I think he'd been retired something like about twenty-six years or so, too.  So, in one sense, they both have sort of beat the system.
Story_ID: 626226
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to reflect back on the neighborhood you grew up in.  Describe it for us and tell us what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, my childhood was a good time; very enjoyable memories and indelible memories.  There were a lot of kids on the block.  I grew up on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois]; 6044 Eberhart was the building we lived in.  It was just south of the south end of Washington Park at 60th Street.  And so as children we spent a great deal of time in the park.  And those were times when you really could spend a great deal in the park with impunity.  We played ball every day.  We were there until late at night, until parents were screaming for you to come home.  There was a lot of greenery.  It was truly a neighborhood... a lot of trees.  It was a diverse neighborhood.  It was diverse not only racially, but diverse in terms of occupations and the rest.  In fact, I have said that although open occupancy and things was probably very good in many respects, I think the one thing that it did in terms of black communities--or at least the neighborhood that I grew up in--it sort of took away the diversity that existed there because... as blacks.  Because you couldn't move to many places you might want to move, even if you could afford it.  In a sense, we were confined to live together.  But what that meant was that you had professors and doctors and mail clerks and ditch diggers, and everybody living on the block.  And those were your extended families.  But because of that, it was enriching.  And the same thing was true I think in the schools I went to, public elementary school, and it was the same way.  There was an enriched environment there, diverse environment.  And then as blacks became more affluent and more mobile and as they moved out, then unfortunately that took away the diversity of the neighborhoods.  And I think it was somewhat debilitating and deleterious to blocks, at least the block that I lived.  The smells and so forth, that's interesting.  I'm not sure I can remember smells, but I remember all the things that as kids grow up... you know, the cleaners on the corner.  And we used to play handball up against the wall, which was very dangerous, around 61st and Eberhart, but we did it anyway.  And playing football in the streets, pretty much the way that Bill Cosby talks about it in terms of going behind a car doing this.  And we had that big park that I'm telling you about.  It was the largest park in Chicago that was just north of us I should have said... just north of us.  But would we go in the park and play?  No, we're going to play in the street where the cars are running and everything else.  And fortunately, we all made it without getting killed.  And then there was a produce around the corner where we'd go.  And they would send, my parents [Camille Lowry and William E. Lowry] would send me to get the vegetables or so.  And then there was a corner drugstore where we actually could have a soda made, and a milkshake and all those things, where they actually put egg in them, if you can believe that.  And had the prescription in the back, you know, not like the huge stores that we have now... but the little stores.  And everybody knew one another, you know.  And it was, I just, the extended family of the neighborhood... or neighborhoods... because it wasn't just the block I was living on; it was several blocks within the area.  And there was a very comfortable feeling.  And as I say, just marvelous feelings of growing up in an area with people whom you enjoyed being around, who were genuine, who presented themselves to you in a very open way.  And I guess the obvious issue there...  I guess unfortunately you have to grow up.  And as you grow up--and then instead of growing up in the same dimensions of honesty, then I think life changes a little bit, and we change a little bit.  And then all the genuineness that I'm speaking of--and that I remember when I was in the neighborhood and everything--and then grows into manhood where... and adulthood, where things aren't quite as... to me, anyway... aren't quite as honest and quite as above-board as otherwise.  And you are trying to search too much in the language of people to try out what exactly what they're saying and how they feel.  It was a lot easier and more simplistic then, because it was very easy to know what people were thinking and where they were.  Later in life it's not quite that easy.
Story_ID: 626227
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of a little boy were you?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I liked to play, I guess like most...  And lived in the park [Washington Park] and found enjoyment in football and basketball and baseball very early, and especially baseball, and then later football.  Basketball came even later than that.  I enjoyed being with the guys, sitting around and just talking.  And as I said, there were a lot of kids around.  And I'm sure we annoyed the heck out of the adults and everything.  But I guess they had to I guess surmise that it was much better that they corralled all of us and we were there and talking at night and just telling our lies or whatever the heck we were doing, and joking and so forth, rather than having us running and gallivanting all around the place.  Personally, I guess I don't know what kind of person I was.  I guess you would have to talk to other people who can make better assessments of me than I can.  I guess I found myself as someone who really-- I enjoyed life.  I liked to laugh, I liked to play.  I tried to be responsible as the eldest in the family.  Two of us... I had the responsibility of my brother [James H. Lowry] in a lot of ways, in terms of being with me all the time and watching out after him and everything.  And I guess sometimes as irritating as that might have been for me--to have your younger brother with you all the time--I think I sort of enjoyed that as well, and liked it, the more I thought about it.  And I think it probably bonds in a way that you're not aware of at that time.  But I think I was the kind of youngster that was... tried to be obedient, tried to do what I was told, and tried to stay the heck out of trouble.
Story_ID: 626228
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are some... that area at that time was vibrant.  You know, Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] was this huge park with a lagoon in it and all these huge playing fields.  And you had, Bronzeville was jumping then with a lot of entertainment and shows and, you know, live, live shows.  And you had the forum of Washington Park, with speakers.  Did you, did you catch all of that?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I caught all of it.  And in fact, you know, in a sense...  Larry, from time to time I reminisce about that, and I miss it.  All the things you say are true--the lagoon there, the boats in the lagoon; and you could go and rent a boat.  And especially the guys who were older, they'd take their dates out and you'd row around the park, which was beautiful.  You had horses that used to come around on the bridle paths in Washington Park, which you don't see anymore.  The scene, yeah, especially where I was, 63rd Street, was a marvelous street, and as I got older, especially in terms of jazz and in terms of places to go.  Yes, the forum, and I guess what I used to refer to as--I don't know what we called it, Bughouse Square or something.  But yeah, the orations and things that used to take place in Washington Park.  Down there, yeah, as a kid I'd walk by and I'd hear these people saying all these things with the crowd.  Going out there... in the space between 51st and 55th to see just about everything imaginable happening.  You saw people playing cricket, you saw people playing baseball... you saw people just running around.  And it was alive.  And the field house there, the swimming pool--they had an Olympic swimming pool.  And as you may have heard or know about, in Chicago, many times I'd go up there just to watch some of the guys and gals swim, because it was just a beautiful thing to me.  And then later in my life and when I got into high school, I was an usher at the Regal [Theater].  And that was extremely enjoyable, because that was the day when the Regal existed and had the stage shows.  And so, just about every other week we had a personality coming through there, like Billie Holiday or Dinah Washington or Ella Fitzgerald or Dizzy Gillespie and the rest, which was just outstanding.  And as an usher, yeah, I had a job to do, but you got a chance to be a part of all that.  And then later, I was sort of the runner.  And I was the one that was backstage.  And as these performers and so forth needed food or a drink or cigarettes or something, I'd run up on 47th Street and bring it to them.  But it was just the excitement of being there.  And then later I moved out, I was the first black usher out at the Tivoli [Theatre] which was out at 63rd, because that was part of the Balaban and Katz chain.  And I moved out there that summer to usher out there, and was ushering between the Regal and between the Tivoli as the place was changing; racially it was changing, as blacks were moving further south and into some of those areas.  But it was an exciting time, and there was a lot to do and a great deal of enjoyment.  And I think, Larry, we probably didn't realize just how marvelous things were at that time.  Because that was just life, that was the way it existed.  And it wasn't missed until it wasn't there anymore.
Story_ID: 626229
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  And what did you... how did you like school?  And where did you go?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  You said like school.  I guess I liked school.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  No, I think--
Speaker 1: How did you feel about it?
Speaker 2: No, I think you're probably right.  Actually, school was a good experience for me, it was.  I went to, first of all I started at Betsy Ross [Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois] which was further west.
Speaker 1: Fifty-First and Wabash?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then we moved, because at that time we were living at 62nd and what was then South Park, which later became King Drive.  And when we moved over to 60th and Eberhart, then I transferred from Betsy Ross to Sexton [Elementary School].  I was at Sexton until I graduated.  And it was good, because the neighborhood was really in the school.  And so the buddies that I had outside of school were the buddies I had in school.  I think for the most part the teachers were--I found the teachers palatable.  I would imagine and hope that they found me the same way.  And you know, as much as a kid could really...  I'm not going to stand before you and say that I was one of these that was just so obsessed with education and learning and so forth that every day I got up in wild anticipation of running to school so that I could find out how much I could learn...  No.  But I did not dislike it, and I did like it for the most part.  And I guess as I think about it, I try to think--and believe that there was somewhat of a balance.  Because whatever I got out of it academically, I think that I prospered by it.  And I enjoyed it, and I studied about as much as maybe a kid my age would, and got pretty good grades and did okay.  But on the other hand, the social aspects of that were marvelous as well.  Because most of my buddies were there, and we were in school, and we'd go home together and continue to play and have a...  And at the same time, I think we were picking up some pretty good values.  But more than that, I think we just felt we were having fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there any particular teachers that showed a keen interest in you, or that you admired?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were, there were a couple.  I would imagine like most kids there were two or three teachers or so that, for whatever the reason, seemed to stick to you a little bit more than others.  Perhaps the most important teacher in my life, at least my young life, was a math teacher whose name was Alice Hudson.  And it was Mrs. Hudson that approached my parents [Camille Lowry and William E. Lowry] about me applying to the University of Chicago Laboratory School, the Lab School in Chicago.  And quite honestly, we didn't even know what the Lab School was.  And she had talked to them and told them that she thought that I showed some promise and might be able to get into the school, and she thought it might be advantageous if we went.  And my parents, they didn't quite know what to do.  So she sort of, she moved us through those chartered waters... uncharted waters... and led us to the area to apply for the school, and then got into the school.
Story_ID: 626230
Speaker 1: And so, I started the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois] after graduating from Sexton [Elementary School], and that changed my life completely.  But it was because of Mrs. [Alice] Hudson, really, that we were there.  And I think otherwise I would have moved on.  And I would like to believe I would have been able to do a few things as well, and, and, just like a lot of my friends moved on and did extremely well in life and achieved.  And I would have hoped that I could do that.  But the Lab School changed... it was a different kind of culture.  I was involved in different things.
Speaker 2: Were there other kids from, that came out of Sexton or your neighborhood that were going to the Lab School too?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was, and one that came out of school and went to Lab School at exactly the same time, a fellow named Walter Walker, who was a bright guy and who did extremely well, and eventually got back, came back to the University of Chicago as one of the vice-presidents and then went on and was president of the college himself.  And Walt and I went there the same year, and we were in the same class.  And we were not in the same class at the University of Chicago.  He was smarter than I was.  He went back... he came... he entered the class as an eighth-grader.  I entered as a ninth grader, although we were about the same age.  I think as I look back, he was smarter than I was.  I should have gone in in the eighth grade as well, because it was quite a jump; it was quite a jump from that.  But it was, it was a meaningful jump.  And I think that it was quite an experience not only for me, but for my parents as well.  Because we had, we were public school people, and my parents had gone to public school.  I'd been in public school all my time, and we didn't even...  And a private school--the existence and the culture of a private school--we just had no idea what it was.  And we soon found out.
Speaker 2: Well, what were some of the differences?  I mean I know that the academics were a little more stringent.
Speaker 1: You say a little more. (Laughter).
Speaker 2: A little more stringent.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, they were.  They were a lot more stringent.  Yeah, yeah, I think... yeah, your whole day changed, you know.  And you've heard me talk about enjoying my life, and playing, and doing all the things that I did.  Well, I didn't play quite as much when I got to the Lab School as I played before I got to the Lab School
Speaker 2: Did you had to get up earlier in the morning?
Speaker 1: Well, I did, because I was, I would take... I would ride my bike to school and everything.  And I'm going further, a little bit further to school.  So, one, it was just in terms of time alone that you had to get up earlier.  But, yeah, I, and I had to structure my day.  But I had to learn how to manage my time better, because I had to study, you know, then.  And I think one of the first things that I guess impressed me and scared me, Larry, was the first day of class, I remember at the U of C [University of Chicago].  And we had homeroom, and the teachers as I recall--and that's a long ago--it's better than fifty years ago--I remember the teacher gave the profile of the class.  In other words, you know, who you are racially and all of the rest.  And it also included the average IQ, if you can believe that.  And then so--
Speaker 2: And actually, you know, the teacher--now let stop right...
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Let me just kind of freeze this for a second.  The teacher actually... he... he or she--
Speaker 1: She.
Speaker 2: --gave a biography of you in the class?
Speaker 1: Well, it was a profile of the class.
Speaker 2: Oh, of the whole class.
Speaker 1: This is the class of 1950.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, as they looked at the demographics of this class--
Speaker 2: This was done in class?
Speaker 1: This was done in class.  This was letting the class of 1950 know who you were and, and, and what you were composed of, who made you up.  And as I recall, one of the... one of the dimensions was IQ.  And (Laughter) I wasn't so dumb as to realize that, you know, IQ, you know, there's a top and there's a bottom.  And this was, this was pretty large, you know.  And so, I'm looking at this; it's pretty high.  And I'm saying wow.  There was also announced that in this class--and I don't know, I may have the terms wrong.  But they were either the whiz kids or quiz kids or something like that that used to be on... basically on radio.  Because I was at a time of transition from radio into television.  But, and these were these brilliant kids who were on the air.  And they would ask these very esoteric questions and so forth.  And they would come up with this... and they announced that we that had seven of those kinds of people in our class and everything.  So, I'm reeling from this a little bit.  So, my first class was in French.  Now, I'm going to French, and I barely speak English.  But now I'm going to... my first day of French.  And I go up there, and before I go into class, the kids are standing out there and they're talking.  And the teacher walks into the classroom and they say, "Bon jour, Madame, comment allez-vous?"  And she says, "Tres bien."  And I'm standing there amazed, because I have no idea what they're talking about.
Story_ID: 626231
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, oh, we were talking about, okay, first day in French class [at the University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then after that, after reeling from that, I said my goodness, this is going to be more difficult than I thought.  Then I went to math class, and I swear to God, I went into math and the teacher was talking.  And then he goes to the blackboard and he starts putting up some figures there that I thought were hieroglyphics.  I'd never seen anything like this in my life.  So, I said oh, my God.  But this time now I've broken out in a cold sweat.  And the only person I could think about is Mrs. [Alice] Hudson who was my math teacher, and the one that's responsible for all this, right?  So, I run home and I call Mrs. Hudson.  "Mrs. Hudson," I said, "This is William Lowry."  And she said, "Yes?"  And I said, "I had my first day at Lab School," and I said "I need some help."  I said, "Will you help me?"  I said, "I've got a math assignment."  And she says, "Fine, why don't you come over to the house."  I jump on my bike and I ride out to Mrs. Hudson's.  I get out there and I show her this math I've got, and all of this.  And she looks at it, and she's looking at it.  After a while, she looks at me.  She says, "William, I can't help you."  That just went through with me... just... I never felt so stymied in all my life.  And I think from that point on, I had to... it was difficult.  Because one, I think I acquired that, unfortunately, that very eerie feeling of it's better to let people think you're an ass than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.  And I was beginning to lose kinds of self-esteem, because now I'm in this group with all of these very brainy children, you know.  And here I've got assignments that even my teacher can't do.  How in the heck am I expected to do it?  And so, I'm trying to deal with all this.  And then my parents [Camille Lowry and William E. Lowry] were getting some reports back that, you know, "William isn't working up to his expectations" and so forth and so on.  So, they became a little un-nerved.  And fortunately I got in with a group of guys, and so we're going to start playing basketball.  So, socially, you know, things were going well.  It's just that I was beginning to feel that this is something that I probably could not do academically.  And then we had a, I was asked to do a paper.  And I got an A on that paper.  And with that, came confidence.  And with that, came performance.  And it's amazing what this thing can do for you.  Now, we don't control it, but it did it for me.  And from that point on, I'm not going to say that it was so easy that it was not any... it was no problem.  But I am going to say that it got a lot better.  My self-esteem returned and I felt much more confident, and was able to do the work and get through there and feel fairly good about it.  But it was very difficult at first.  And as I said, it was an entirely different thing.  It was far more academically oriented than anything I'd ever been in before, and required a lot more of me than had been required of me before.  And it was quite a test.
Speaker 1: Did you have a conception of what the University of Chicago [Illinois] was like before you went over there to the Lab School?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Just that... because a) perception, like most people, this is just something where people go there and are awfully smart, you know.  And aside from that, you know, at that point I didn't know anybody that had ever been to the Lab School.  So, I didn't really know the rigors of it; I didn't know what to expect other than the fact that there were a lot of people there that were smart, and I would imagine it's going to be hard.  But it's hard to define what hard is.
Story_ID: 626232
Speaker 1: I know in the seventies, you know, I can only speak about the seventies when I got here.  But the impression was that the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] was almost an island on the South Side that had defined boundaries and activities that did not include the rest of the South... I mean they could include you on some level.  But it was very, it was an ivory tower world; it was almost inaccessible.
Speaker 2: Well, I would imagine... you know, this is 2003.  There may be some people that feel that same way now.  I mean, you know, first of all, the University of Chicago is the University of Chicago.  I think it draws outstanding faculty, outstanding administration, and outstanding students, with some exceptions.  But for the most part, they do... they just have...  And it is a rigorous program, but the people that get through it...  We're talking about some awfully gifted people.  Now, there are probably a lot of gifted people that don't get through it.  Maybe they don't apply themselves, you know, to do so.  But most of the people that go there certainly have potential to do a lot of things.  So, when you're just looking at an institution like that, I think that that makes it unique, that makes it special.  And the University of Chicago probably has what, more Nobel Prize winners than any other college around, and a lot of other things, so it is special.  But to say an island within itself, personally, I didn't.  I just found it to be a very special place that had special people.  And I got a lot out of it.  Maybe didn't get as much as I should have, but I got quite a bit out of it.  And I felt, I felt good, because I'd gone through it.  I felt good because I had been there [University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois], and I felt good about a lot of the relationships that were formed when I was there.  And there were a lot of people I know now that I went to school with that are just very good people.  And so, for me it turned out to be a very good experience.  And I left there and went, had another good experience at another school.  But the University of Chicago turned out fine.  And as I said, socially, it worked out.  And I was able to participate at a pretty high level in the events and things of the school, not just athletically, but otherwise.  And it turned out that that two-year stint that I was there was profitable for me.
Story_ID: 626233
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were there [University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois] for two years?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I was there for my ninth and tenth grade year.  At that time, you graduated from the Lab School in your tenth grade, at the end of the tenth grade.  And then for those that applied and that could make it, you went into the college.  A lot of other people chose to leave there and then go to another high school as a junior.  And then I went, I left after tenth grade and went to Francis Parker.  And in my class at Francis [W.] Parker [High School], there were two or three other people that were in my class from the Lab School.  Some people then went on into the Lab School--went on to the University of Chicago maybe for a couple of years and then left there and then went to another college as a freshman.  So, there were a couple ways of doing that.  But it was the Lab School.  And since that time I think they've changed it.  I'm not quite sure what they do now.  But I think at one point they took out the seventh grade.  And so, you went from sixth grade to eighth grade.  And so, they were experimenting.  But for the most part, they were experimenting with people that could meet that kind of challenge and still excel, and they did that.  But it was good.  But it prepared me well for some of the other things that happened to me in my life after that, educationally and otherwise.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you graduated from high school from Francis Parker?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was Francis Parker like?
Speaker 2: Well, a little like the Lab School, but not quite the same thing; probably more socially oriented in a way.  Because I would say in the common vernacular, maybe not quite as brainy, although there were some very bright kids there, but probably not regarded as certainly the same profile in terms of intelligence; but they were there.  More affluent and, of course, the thing I have to be mindful of is that when I went there, not only was it a change in environment and so forth, but I was getting older, too.  So, I was no longer that freshman, and now I was a junior that went on to be a senior.  But it was a good stepping stone, or a step for me from the Lab School.  The Lab School had prepared me in a lot of ways.  It taught me in a sense the rigors of, of, of academics and how to study in a sense--the regimentation that's needed and some of the other things which helped me.  And then when I got to Parker, it was a little bit more the same, and a little bit easier for me.  Because that transition wasn't nearly as nearly as difficult for me as the one I felt when I came out of elementary school and then went into the Lab School.  And Parker was the same thing; it afforded me an opportunity as the Lab School did--to participate at all levels, athletically and otherwise.  And government... student government, and every part of Francis Parker was there available for the students, and I enjoyed that; it was a successful two years for me.  And that prepared me along with the Lab School in going into college.
Story_ID: 626234
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, every year you were there you played sports, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Baseball, football and basketball.
Speaker 2: Right, at Francis Parker.  The Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois] didn't have a football team.  But during that time when I was at the Lab, when I first got to the Lab School, I was playing football for the park team in Chicago.  They used to have park teams in Chicago.  You had a maximum weight limit of 110 pounds.  So, I played on Washington Park's team.  And we used to play during the halves of the Bear/Cardinal games, which was, it was kicks.  That was a lot of fun.  And so, I did that one year.  And when I went to the Lab School, I'd just finished that fall playing football.  Then after we got at Parker, Parker had a football team.  So, I played football, basketball and baseball.  At the Lab School, I played baseball and basketball.  And what I really, I guess, that helped me too in terms of getting acclimated, is that I made the varsity team as a freshman in baseball, which hadn't been too many people that had done that.  And so, I guess if it was something I was looking for in terms of some achievement or success that would help me in terms of relating, I guess that helped a little bit.  But, but, that was, that was a joy; that was kicks.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you play in baseball?  What position?
Speaker 2: I played second base.  I... first of all, when you're young and everything, they put there in right field so that you can't do too much damage, I guess.  (Laughter).  But that was sort of a natural position for me.  I had a decent arm, but not a great arm.  And I was fairly quick, so that helped.  And I was one of the few that could make the pivot at second base, so that helped too.  But--
Speaker 1: That's a thinking position.
Speaker 2: Well, maybe.  (Laughter).  But it, yeah... and I enjoyed it.  And yeah... right.  And I played that throughout the rest of high school.  And then most of college, I played second base in college as well.  And that was, I guess, my position.  Although in college, I did play a little outfield as well, and played some third base, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626235
Speaker 1: Now, now, who were your mentors in high school?  I mean were they... you know, other than--I know the coaches were, on some level.
Speaker 2: Good question.  I think... I'm trying to think of... in the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois] I think I was relating more...  Well, there was an adjustment teacher there.  And I cannot--gosh, I can't come up with her name.  But she was black, and was like I guess a psychologist, maybe a psychiatrist.  But I think a psychologist, who was very helpful to me, because those were the conversations that I needed in terms of not only building confidence, but giving me perspectives that otherwise I would not have.  And she was extremely helpful to me in going through those muddy waters.  When I got to Francis Parker [High School], there was a--you said a coach.  But he was also a teacher and also an administrator, a fellow by the name of [Bernard] Barney Negronida, whose, his son and I... his son was one of my best friends there.  And he became not just a coach and not just a teacher, but a very close friend, and a close friend of the family.  And my parents [Camille Lowry and William E. Lowry] and Bob's parents and Barney Negronida were very close.  And he was the kind of person that you can talk to about anything.  And--
Speaker 1: Excuse me, how do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: N-E-G-R-O-N-I-D-A, Negronida.  And he was the kind that you would think--and at the time, I'm not so sure that I was thinking in these terms.  But I felt that, as I look back, he was somebody that had objectivity that you could get when you were--someone that was sincerely interested in you, but on the other hand, was interested in being honest and you being honest.  And he made me face a lot of things that otherwise I might rationalize, you know.  And so, that was helpful to me.  And then he was very helpful.  And there were other, there were other teachers that I certainly respected, and that were very good to me.  And there was, Mr. Ellison was one at Parker, and some others.  But Barney Negronida was, was the person whose coattail in a sense that I sort of grabbed ahold and pulled me through there.  But again, the students... they got very close with a lot of the students.  They spent an awful lot of time on the North Side, and that was maybe problematic for my parents, but not so much for me.  Because I'm going from the South Side over to the North Side every day, and then spending... talking about getting up early and getting on the "L" and getting there and... school on time.  And we'd have football or basketball practice, and you're coming back at ten or eleven o'clock sometimes.  And we never had a car in our family, so I was on the "L" all the time.  And then since we didn't have coaches who were black and everything, then I'm getting on that "L", because nobody's going to give me any rides.  So, I would imagine it was a little disconcerting for my parents.  But at that time, whether it was real or imagined, I guess it was felt that the times were a little bit safer and that kids could do things like that with impunity.  So, there were no problems.  But, and a lot of times most of the South Siders would come back together on the "L" anyway.  So we'd come back in a little pack, which made it a little better.  But it was a good experience.  And I got, I think virtually everything that that school had to offer in the two years I was there.  And it was a very enjoyable time for me, and a growing time for me.  And I think my learning curve was very steep; it continued.  It started in the Lab School and continued as I went through high school.
Story_ID: 626236
Speaker 1: Obviously, you knew you were going to go to college.  But how did you choose college?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Very unscientifically.  I was, yeah, I guess I felt I was going to college.  But that was largely because my parents [Camille Lowry and William E. Lowry] had told me I was going, and certainly my old man had told me.  You know, "I didn't get a chance, I didn't do this.  You're going," and so forth.  So, it was fine.  It seemed to be inevitable, we're going to do this.  But that was okay with me.  And he had also preached to me that education was the thing; that was sort of the key.  And that was the key for us, you know, because as a black person, you'd better get an education and go as far as you can.  And it wasn't that everybody had to go to college.  But he felt for those who could, you should, you know give it a try.  So, yes, that seemed to be inevitable.  How I selected it:  I was going through schools, and I had been pretty lucky, and had some schools that had offered me some scholarships to play ball and so forth.  And I was in school one day, and this guy came--who was introduced to me--came in the class and was introduced to me.  And it was the Dean of Admissions for Kenyon College [Gambier, Ohio].  And he had asked for me.  And what had happened is that the class before me, the class that graduated before me--this was my senior year.  And the year before that, three guys from that class had gone to Kenyon College.  And they were, they were good guys.  And I knew them, and played ball with a couple of them.  And they had gone to Kenyon.  And they said, "I think that..." and these were white guys.  They said, "I think that when you go back to Chicago [Illinois], you might want to look up Bill Lowry, because we think that he'd like Kenyon, and we think Kenyon would like him."  So, the guy comes, he gets... he comes to Kenyon--I mean to Parker--and he gets me out of class.  And he gives me the propaganda and all of that.  So, I applied.  And Kenyon had a sub-freshman weekend--and this was in the spring--for those who applied and those who were aspiring to go.  So, I went there, and an alumnus of Kenyon drove me there.  And I got there and it was a great summer, I mean, great weekend.  I'd never seen Kenyon, and it was beautiful; aesthetically, it was beautiful.  It was tucked away in the hills of Ohio, and gorgeous.  And so, I'm there for that weekend with my three buddies from Parker, and we're having a ball.  I'm seventeen, I'm drinking beer... I'm having just a great time.  And so, I said this is the school for me, right.  So, I go back and I sign on the dotted line, "Yeah, I'm coming back, I'm coming to Kenyon."  I went to Kenyon that fall, and all three of those guys had been kicked out, all three of them.  They had, they had had such a wonderful time they had forgot to study. (Laughter).  And they were bright guys.  One guy at that time had the largest Baker Scholarship that Kenyon College had ever given, so he was no dummy. Another guy was awfully bright, and later he, after leaving Kenyon--or being asked to leave Kenyon--he went on to Knox [College in Galesburg, Illinois] and graduated.  And he was the guy that created the Executive Color Book [Executive Coloring Book], for those who remember it.  So, he's a brilliant guy.  And so, they were bright guys but they didn't...  So, there I was at Kenyon College, and the three buddies that I thought I was going to have, they weren't there.  But it was a good four years.  And I might have missed them initially, but after a while... sort of like the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois], after getting there and trying to hit the books and doing the things you're supposed to do... believe me, I didn't have a heck of a lot of time to pine about people that weren't there.
Story_ID: 626237
Speaker 1: At Kenyon [College in Gambier, Ohio]... I don't know if we really need to talk about the big incident at Kenyon, your world famous incident, with the fraternity and that yet.  Is it time for that yet, or--
Speaker 2: Well, well, I don't know.  That came about a year and a half or so after I, after I'd been at Kenyon.
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: History.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually I was, I was really taken with philosophy.  I don't know, for some reason I just, I, I, I loved philosophy, and it just seemed to be something that made so much sense and was fairly clear to me.  And there weren't a heck of a lot of things that were clear to me.  (Laughter).  But that seemed to be pretty clear to me.  And, but unfortunately I was playing football, basketball, and baseball, which gave me a balance that I think was important to me, even more than I realized.  And because of that, I had a lot of seminars.  And so, for basketball games and the rest, it would... I'd miss the seminars and so forth.  So I talked with the head of the philosophy department, and he--who incidentally was also a sports enthusiast--and he told me, he says, "You know, I think that you playing ball and everything is very important to you while you're in school."  And he says, "I think you ought to do is probably pick another major, but take as many philosophy courses as you can, since you enjoy it and you like it, and you'll still get something out of it."  So, I did that, and I switched to history and found that interesting.  And I liked history, so I... my degree is in history from undergrad school.
Speaker 1: You had some pretty good professors in history at Kenyon?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had some outstanding professors I guess.  I don't think that there are any that, people that would be world renown, but I think that most of the professors there were probably listed in the Who's Who of American Colleges and Universities.  And Kenyon historically has had outstanding faculty.  And we like to believe that we have outstanding, certainly outstanding faculty today, similar to the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory School in Chicago, Illinois].  Because we draw not only outstanding faculty and administration, but also outstanding students.  And yes, I did.  And it was a rigorous program too, but by this time I was a little bit better prepared for that.  But not, maybe as much as I thought.  Because my first test that...  See, now that... by this time I'm getting a little cocky, because I've gone to Lab School and I've gone to [Francis W.] Parker [High School], and I've done reasonably well.  And so, I think that at least... with some reasonable intelligence.  And so, I get into history--one of my history classes, first history class, as a freshman.  And I have my first exam coming up.  And this was pretty much some of the things that I'd taken before, and I felt pretty good about that, to the extent that I didn't study like I was supposed to.  And before the exam, we had the Saturday morning exam before my football game.  And so I took the exam, and the next week I got that exam back, and it was just bloody.  I mean it was just so red.  And the professor says, "Mr. Lowry, I think you're going to require... the college requires a little bit greater depth that you've been used to giving us."  So that, that woke me up very early, thank goodness.  And I recognized that I was probably going to have to put forth a lot more effort than I thought I was going to have to put forth.  But it was, it was good, it worked out.  Kenyon was good for me.  It wasn't good for everybody, but it worked out for me.
Speaker 1: Now, did you major in American History or Ancient History, or--
Speaker 2: No.  We just had history majors, where you... you had the panoramic view, and you took quite a few courses.  There were a certain amount of courses you were required... The part of history that... that I guess that I gravitated to and enjoyed was Renaissance and Reformation.  But we took courses in all of those--in American History and Renaissance and Reformation, and English History and, you name it.  The Hellenistic Age, and all those things.  And then we had comps at the end of the four years, where we had eight-hour comps that you had to take to pass to graduate, which covered all of the history that you had.  So, that was, that was interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have to write a final paper on that?
Speaker 2: We had to... yeah, we had a senior paper that we had to write.  We had a senior seminar then, where all the seniors were together in the senior seminar, where you sort of took this panoramic view of history.  Then you had to pick something and write a senior paper.  Then you had the comps later, the eight-hour comps to determine whether you get your degree or not.  So, yeah, we had to do all that.  And it was, it was patterned a lot after European school structure in terms of the comprehensives and the papers and the like.
Story_ID: 626238
Speaker 1: Now, you were... and Kenyon [College in Gambier, Ohio] was all boys' school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a... we used to say men's college... men's college, right?
Speaker 1: Men's school, right.
Speaker 2: Men's college, right. (Laughter).  Now, not too many... not too many of us were men.  But yeah, we used to say men's college.  That was a men's college.
Speaker 1: You were surrounded by colleges I guess, in Ohio.
Speaker 2: In Ohio, yeah, there was just--
Speaker 1: Wesleyan--
Speaker 2: All over the place.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: You name them.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: And we were in the area, too, that was closer to Ohio Wesleyan, and Denison [University in Granville, Ohio], and Otterbein [University], and [College of] Wooster [Ohio], and all of those schools.  Yeah, well, you've got over two-hundred colleges in Ohio.  And playing ball, I think I got around to just about all of them over those four years.
Speaker 1: And all those colleges are about the size of Kenyon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're small.
Speaker 1: They're together.
Speaker 2: Right, they're small.  Yeah, it was, it was a pretty nice community.  And you shared some common denominators with most of those schools; if nothing else, size, which made it nice.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that you socialized at Central State [University in Wilberforce, Ohio], I think, before we--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had buddies that... from Chicago that went to Central State.  And off and on during the time I was at Kenyon, they would come and get me.  Because once again, I didn't have a car.  I didn't learn how to drive... I didn't have a car until I was married and in the military.  So they would come and get me and we'd go to Central State, and I'd spend a weekend with them, then they'd bring me back.  And so, yeah, Central State provided a social outlet for me, which was very good.  Because with the Kenyon men's college there, we had less than, a little bit less than five hundred guys, and tucked away in the hills of Ohio. And I pretty much played ball and waited tables and studied.  And so, the social aspects of a Central State, I think provided some equilibrium for me.
Story_ID: 626239
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in terms of the social life at Kenyon [College in Gambier, Ohio]--you were involved in sort of a protracted struggle over a fraternity, joining a fraternity.  You were invited to join a fraternity and joined, and there was a problem.  Well, what... can you tell us a little bit--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, Kenyon had... the first semester I guess... rushing there.  So, they had the... even though it was a very small school, it had about ten fraternities there, ten national fraternities, nine or ten national fraternities.  And I was--and the other thing I guess that's fairly significant, is that of the roughly five hundred students that were there, there were probably just four blacks.  And I don't think at any time while I was at Kenyon over those next four years, that it ever exceeded more than four blacks on the campus at any one time, certainly not more than five or so.  And I was extended a bid to, for one of the fraternities, Phi Kappa fraternity.  And the Betas, I was extended a social bid.  And that was a bid that you could live in the place with the Betas and you could, you could be a part of many of the activities.  But you would not... you wouldn't get a pin, and you weren't involved in the meetings and all of those things, which was fine for me in a sense.  Because I'd have to foot that big bill to pay that money.  And the Betas, I was drawn to the Betas because those were guys mostly that I'd started playing football with, and some other things.  And so, we were sharing not only the athletics and some things... and so that was just the group that I sort of gravitated to.  And then after being a social member... so I said "Yeah."  So, I accepted that.  And then after being a social member for almost a year, the guys in the fraternity came to me and asked me if I wanted to join the fraternity.  And I had mixed emotions.  And it wasn't because they never had a black in the fraternity before.  I mean, nationally, they never had a black.  That wasn't it.  I'm too busy thinking about this money I'd have to spend for the initiation and all the rest of these things.  So, my mind is thinking about entirely different things.  And so, after a while, I said "Yeah, why not?"  I mean, here's a good group of guys.  There were about fifty guys or so.  I said, "Yeah, its fine."  It was recognized as a pretty good fraternity, locally as well as nationally.  But what I didn't realize, of course, was the battle that was going to ensue.  But the guys did.  And what it was is that Beta Theta Pi had, did not have anything in their by-laws precluding membership of anyone because of race or anything like that.  But there was a tacit agreement it just didn't happen.  And so, the guys realizing that, they didn't notify the headquarters that they were going to pledge--or I should say, they were going to bring into... initiate a black.  And they waited, and as a group decided to do a couple of things.  One was to make sure that everything was in order, and that the national fraternity could not pull a technical on them in a sense.  So, they all became, got financially sound.  So, everybody paid up their dues and got their money, so that they couldn't get caught on that.  They watched their grades, and they got up above the all men's average, so that they couldn't say that they were a fraternity that wasn't academically sound.  And a lot of other things they did.  And once they felt that they had prepared themselves for that, then they notified the national fraternity that they were going to initiate a black.  And that's when all hell broke loose.  Because some of the good old boys just weren't interested in all that, and they didn't want that fraternity tarnished, and the rest.  So, the guys that were there in the fraternity, they took an awful lot, I think, because there were people that were not only calling and so forth, but visits by people from there.  And the night that I was initiated, there were some people down from headquarters--up until the time that I walked in there to be initiated--who were arguing and telling them that this is something they shouldn't do.
Story_ID: 626240
Speaker 1: At any rate, let's talk about what happened next with the fraternity [Beta Theta Pi at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then we had the, at the initiation, I think I mentioned that there were two or three guys that were there with the guys, and telling them that this was something that they shouldn't do, and that I'm going to kick them out of the fraternity and a lot of other things, trying to dissuade them from going through with it.  But anyway, I was initiated.  And after that it was pretty interesting, because there was a lot of clamoring, and there were an awful lot of people who were quite, quite upset about the fact that, oh, we got a fly in the buttermilk.  And one of the, a couple of the guys went to the annual event that's held every summer, the convention.  And from what I'm told, that was a very interesting convention, because yours truly was the only thing they talked about, and it wasn't all in glowing terms.  In fact, I was told--I was not there--that at one time at one of the meetings--at the end of the meeting they had--one of my white brothers ran up to the stadium, ran up on the stage at the podium and grabbed a mic and said that, you know, "If there's anybody here that's really interested in getting that pin back, come up and see me after this and we'll go that pin from that nigger."  So, for years--and it may even be that way now--I was referred to in the Beta book, the Beta Lore, as the "Kenyon affair."  I wasn't mentioned by name, but they mentioned that in 1954 the Beta Alpha chapter of Beta Theta Pi of Kenyon College initiated a Negro.  And--
Speaker 1: So, they never really--they made a move to try to remove you, but they really couldn't do it?
Speaker 2: Technically, they couldn't, I mean because of the by-laws and the governance.  There was not, there wasn't anything, as I said, that precluded them from bringing me in there.  It's just that no one had had the temerity to do that.  And I think it should be... should be noted here--at least as far as I'm concerned--and I've said this publicly, you know, and I'll say it here.  I think that you've got to put this in perspective.  This was 1954, and I'm in the hills of Ohio at a predominantly white school.  And this fraternity's got fifty white guys--fifty or fifty-five white guys at this school--many of them affluent people, but from all over the place.  And the voting, you know, one blackball and you're out.  And you can do that anonymously, so they don't have to know who dropped the blackball.  And these guys decided that this is something that they wanted to do.  I don't what the heck they got out of it, because the only thing that did, it was just more of the same.  And I think it took a lot of courage.  And I think that the thing that they...  And as I think back, in 1954 this act itself was I think a very significant act for a group of people to do at that time.  Now, maybe it's just the kind of thing that just happened--that this was a group of people that came about at that time that were doing something like that.  You didn't have all of these things springing up all over, but the United States was beginning to come alive; there's no doubt about it, racially.  And then it followed... even more than that.  But we were still a little ways away from the great awakening in getting it.  And so, for this group of guys to do something like that, I thought it was pretty gutsy.  And I had... then I had a great deal of respect for them then, and I have a great deal of respect for them now.  And it's only recently that the fraternity has felt that this is something that they can publicize, and almost fifty years later recognizing the fact that this took place.  But it took a while.
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1954.
Speaker 2: Nineteen-Fifty Four [1954], April of 1954.
Speaker 1: Brown v. the Board of Education decision.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] hadn't really emerged on the scene.
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Story_ID: 626241
Speaker 1: Most of the, most of the varsity athletes on the college campuses were still all white.
Speaker 2: That's right.  In fact, it was very seldom as I went around playing ball that there were other blacks on the other team.  And if there was, it was one other black here and one other black here.  We played Hiram [College in Hiram, Ohio], and Bill White was playing for Hiram, who later became a star for the Giants... baseball star, and then later president of the National League... outstanding athlete.  And I played basketball and football against Bill.  And there would be one or two others as we go.  But you're right.  And Ohio wasn't too swift.  I mean I was in Gambier, in Mount Vernon, Ohio.  And many times going into town, I'd run into as much prejudice there as anyplace else.  We'd take baseball trips.  At Kenyon [College in Gambier, Ohio], each spring one of the athletic teams would take a baseball trip by car; they couldn't afford anything else.  So the lacrosse team would go, and the baseball team would go the next year.  So, the first year I got there it was the baseball team's time.  And so, the coach had already set up the itinerary, or the schedule to play.  And they'd go to Florida and they'd play Rollins [College in Winter Park, Florida] and schools like that.  And so, he had the foresight to let the coach know that he had a black on the team... and the coaches know they had a black on the team.  And when he told them, they refused to play us.  So, he had to change all of that within a couple of weeks or so.  And so we then went to places like... played Quantico Marines, and Marshall, and Fort Lee, and places like that, and went through Lynchburg, Virginia and [Washington] D.C. and all those places.  And even in doing that, I still couldn't stay with the team.  Because I'd stay in what were then called Negro settlement houses.  And it was only later that it registered, that as I was going into these homes and these places staying at night--and I'm separated from the rest of the team--that when I'd sign in on the register... I was signing in, and an awful lot of other people that were there that were much greater people than I was, you know, that... the Roy Campanellas and the Jackie Robinsons and the others, who could not go with their professional teams when they were going through those areas as well.  So, it was a very interesting time.  Going in, going from--
Speaker 1: Did you ever run into any of these people, I mean, on these--
Speaker 2: No, no, just by name.  Later in life, I ran into some of them and had a chance to talk to them.  But at that time, no, I was just a little college kid coming into these things, signing the register like the big boys did.  And I just recognized those big names and those outstanding individuals.  And it was later, you know, I recognized it was an honor to be among them.  But the point was, is that there was, it was that everyone was treated the same.  And Jim Crow was there and alive and kicking.
Speaker 1: Now, were you the only black player on the teams, the sports teams at Kenyon?
Speaker 2: Not all of them.  On that baseball team, I was the only black on the baseball team.  On the basketball team, depending on the year, there might be one other black on the team with me.  And in football, there might be one or two other blacks.  But basically, that was it; never much more than that.
Story_ID: 626242
Speaker 1: Now, did you experience racism on your team in terms of not being passed the ball and that sort of thing?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I didn't experience that.  Let's put it like this.  If I was experiencing that, I was too dumb to realize that.  No, I don't think that was the case.  And most of the time, since I was a guard I had the ball anyway.  So, I was the one that determined who got the ball in play.  (Laughter).  But what I did experience though, was racism in terms of the teams we would play.  And it went far beyond just name-calling and everything.  I mean, there were a lot of things--gouging of eyes and throwing blocks so that the feet--the foot comes up in the groin--and all kinds of stuff like that.  And I got a lot of that throughout the year, especially in football--more in football than anything else.  In baseball it just--it was just a case where they refused to play us.  But in football we played, but they were determined that they were going to take some of their grief out on me, in terms of--
Speaker 1: How were you able to endure that?  Did you really know the--I mean had you come to accept that this was what was going to happen and you just had to kind of get through it, or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's probably what it was.  I don't know what was going through my mind.  But it wasn't the first time I experienced this; I experienced this in high school.  And when I was playing at [Francis W.] Parker [High School], we played teams that did the same thing.  In fact, there were times I--one time I know my mother [Camille Lowry] screamed, because we had played a football game, and when I came home and we were talking and I did like this--you know, I said, "gosh, I'm tired."  And she looked at me and she screamed, because I had scabs all over my eyes.  And I hadn't realized this, but in the pile--because see, I would, I'm so old, and we played so long ago, we didn't have face masks all that.  (Laughter)  See, so they could get to my eyes and everything right away.  And so, they reached down in piles, and they would grab my eyes and scratch my eyes and all this.  And so I had experienced... I had experienced this growing up in the city of Chicago [Illinois] in many ways.  And so, it was... it was... it went with the territory, to me.  I guess this was part of life as a black living in the United States.  And these were things that you had to tolerate, you know.  I remember asking my dad [William E. Lowry]--because I came up at a time, you know, before Jackie Robinson was in the majors and before blacks in any numbers were playing professional football and the like--and basketball and the NBA and that kind of thing.  And I'd ask him--you know, well, I came up in a time when blacks weren't even vendors at Comiskey Park, couldn't even sell peanuts.  And blacks weren't even driving Yellow cabs and Checker cabs; we had jitneys in Chicago.  And I'd ask my dad, my old man, I said, "Why is this?" you know as I'm becoming aware of some of these things.  And he would look at me and he'd say, "Well, it's just because that's the way it is."  I didn't accept it as just the way it is, but I did accept it as something that obviously we had to go through.  And my determination was, I guess, to show people that I was just as good or better than they were on the athletic field.  And then later you wanted to do that academically, and so many other things.  So, it drove me.  I mean, it helped me get through.  Because the more I guess I felt that people wanted to hate me, the more I wanted to accomplish.
Speaker 1: Now, this is '54 [1954].  You know, Paul Robeson described similar treatment at Rutgers [University in New Brunswick, New Jersey] when he played football--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by his own teammates.  And this is almost fifty years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just the--you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, just the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he had it a lot rougher than I did.  Yeah, that part I didn't experience.  But, yeah, and he was living in times where it was far worse than probably what I was living.  I was, had the good fortune of meeting him later in life.  But, yeah, you know, he--I can't compare what I went through with what he went through.  But yeah.  And it exists today in many forms.  Let's face it.  You know, I think people have progressed in many ways but, you know, we're not there.  We've got a long way to go, and I think that, you know, our rather unique system of slavery has fostered basically two complexes: one, inferiority and the other superiority.  And I think it stays with us and lives with us today in many ways that manifests itself in a lot of ways.  And in many cases, people don't even realize it.  And probably in my lifetime, it's going to continue.  And I hope that eventually we can eradicate some of that.  But I don't think the amalgamation of races is going to happen, and I think these are things in many ways that we're going to still have to combat.  And although we, we gain a little bit each time... but it's deep, it's very deep.  And I think that it's something that we all are living with each day of our lives, some more so than others.
Story_ID: 626243
Speaker 1: Going back to the schooling--and I don't know how significant this is.  But these are the kinds of things we were going through.  And since you're on this, I think it was important.  I was, I was pretty lucky in college [Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio] and did well.  And I said, I participated in those things, I was--I played football, basketball, and baseball.  And I was captain of all three.  I was president of the Student Body, and I was in all the other honor societies and all this; I had a good record.  And my senior year, although I went through ROTC, I knew that I was going to be commissioned in the [United States] Air Force.  Like everybody else, I wanted to see if I could secure a job before maybe going into service, so I'd have something else to come to once I got out.  And like all of my white classmates, I would go to these campus interviews when they would come.  And everybody would want to see Bill Lowry, until they saw Bill Lowry.  Because coming to a place like Kenyon, you don't expect to see blacks, you know.  And they'd look at my record and they couldn't by the name; they couldn't tell by anything.  And I mean, God, the looks on these guys' faces were just incredible when they'd come in there.  Well, I didn't get one nod.  No one invited me in for interviews.  And there was a guy--and I liked him--he was a fraternity brother of mine; he was a swimmer.  And he struggled through those four years, and he barely--and he flunked his comps.  And so, he had to go back in the summer and take his comps again, and he couldn't be commissioned until he passed them.  And he was going, and he was getting interviews.  He was getting calls, or he was getting letters inviting him in for interviews, second interviews at the companies and so forth.  And I wrote his acceptance letters and I helped him put together his resumes.  And so, when you start thinking about how, you know, what kind of world you're living in...  And then later after I was waiting to go into the service, I remember when I--there was--Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio] had an ad in The Times, you know.  And it had the silhouette of this guy, and he had this homburg, and he had this attache case.  And it said, "You too can be a $10,000 a year man."  You know, and "Sign up here."  And they had this little, little brief spread that you fill out--name, rank and serial number, and college, and all this stuff.  And so I filled it out, just on a lark, you know.  And about three days later, you know, I got a call from the office of Procter and Gamble in- downtown.  So, the guy called me and said, "Well, you applied to an ad and possibly a job at Procter and Gamble."  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Well, can you come down for an interview?"  "Yeah."  So, they gave me the date and the time.  So, I went downtown and walked through that door.  And when I announced myself to that receptionist, I mean that poor lady almost died.  And then she began to just stutter, and she just couldn't compose herself. "Just a minute, just a minute..."  And she reaches... then she jumps up and she runs in the back.  And she gets the guy and the guy comes out, and he's like... I mean he says, "Well, Mr. Lowry," he says, "I've got to be very honest with you."  He says, "We don't have..." that time, "We don't have any Negroes in Procter and Gamble in management program."  He says, "But if this is something you'd really like to do," he says, "you know, we can process this."  And I just looked at him and I said, "You don't look strong enough for that."  And so, I just turned around and left, you know.  But I also knew that I was going into the service pretty soon.  But, you know, and I'm not the only one that went through those kinds of things.  That was just not unusual at that time.  So, when you say on the football field--it's more of the same, just a little different and a little bit more physical.  But, you know, that was... that was the times.  And in fact, I had not realized what my children had not gone through.  And as they growing up... one day years later when they were... I guess my daughter [Kim Pilcher] was--I don't know, upper teens, and my son [William A. Lowry] was mid-teens or something.  And we were just talking about some things.  And a lot of the things we're talking about now, I began to talk to them about.  And it dawned on me, they never experienced anything like that.  We had never talked about that, you know, being... and going to the Negro settlement houses, and having people call you "nigger," and go through all this.  They had not experienced this; they were living in the city of Chicago.  Now, this isn't to say that Chicago is racially free and is absent of discrimination, that's not true.  It's just more covert and different.  But they had never experienced that, nor had they ever thought about me and my experiences.  And so as we began to talk about that, I think they found that pretty enlightening, too.  Because they just had never thought about it.
Story_ID: 626244
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you, now you became class president [Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio], you just told us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that take place?
Speaker 2: President of the Student Body?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Election.
Speaker 1: Student Body president?
Speaker 2: We had Student Body president elections.  And I ran for Student Body president and was elected president of the Student Body.  And that was most of my... most of my senior year up until the middle of my senior year and everything.  And I, you know, I don't know what happened.  People voted, and I was foolish enough to run, and they were foolish enough to vote for me.
Speaker 1: Well, one could conclude that you were fairly popular?
Speaker 2: I think probably so.  I mean it was a small school, and so we all knew one another.  And yeah, I'm waiting tables and playing ball and all of that.  Yeah, you know, I got around a little bit.  On a campus like that, you can be ubiquitous, you know, because you're all over the place.  (Laughter).  But yeah, it worked.  And as I said, it was a place that--you know, for me four years at Kenyon worked.  I mean for a lot of other people, blacks and whites--it just didn't.  I mean, to be tucked away in the hills of Ohio at a men's college and so forth, people said, "I don't need this."  You know, guys were flying out of there like crazy.  But it was for me.  I mean it was quiet, it was good, I could play ball; I had access; I had some mobility; I could go to Central State [University in Wilberforce, Ohio], I could go to Columbus [Ohio] if I wanted to, come home if I wanted to.  And so, for me it was a very comfortable four years.
Story_ID: 626245
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you project that you would do after college [Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio]?  Were you, you were already on track to go to the [United States] Air Force, I guess.  So, you were trying to get, you were experimenting with these jobs, job applications.  What happened?
Speaker 2: I didn't have the slightest idea.  You know, I went to a liberal arts school; they told me I'm a history major.  And the more I thought about it--you know, outside of the military, where do you go?  You know, I could be pretty good at cocktail parties, you know.  And I could talk about a few things.  And it didn't have any great depth, but at least I could talk on the periphery of some things.  What was I going to be?  What I was going to do?  No, I didn't know.  But you know, like everybody, I started thinking, "Well, maybe business."  You think about business, you know.  I thought about maybe education.  But I didn't know.  And I knew that three years of my life was taken care of anyway.  And then after the military--and I was an officer, which was fine; we got paid for it.   And if you got to go that was--I'll tell you why I went into the ROTC.  Some people really know, if they think I'm crazy, they'll know I'm crazy when I tell you this.  But I got into the ROTC for a couple of reasons.  One, I told myself--if you stay in the ROTC in your junior and senior years, you got paid for it.  And so, I'd pick up eighty-two dollars every three months, which I used, and it went a long way in college.  And the other thing I told myself, "If I'm going to off to a war or something like that and get killed, I'm going to make as much money as I can before I get killed."  (Laughter).  Now, that's stupid, but that's exactly the way I was.  So, I went into the ROTC.  After getting out of the service, I didn't know what I wanted to do; I just needed a job.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: In the Air Force, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the Air Force and I was stationed...  I went in through Lackland [Air Force Base] like most people, down in San Antonio.
Speaker 1: Texas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then went into flight school, and I was in flight school down in Mission, Texas at Moore Air Force Base near the Mexican border.  And while I was in flight school--and I was going through probably the roughest part--the Air Force changed its--and wisely I think--changed its requirements to--if you became a pilot, instead of three years, you owed them five.  And so, I signed out.  And when I signed out they sent me to radar school at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida for a couple of months, and then sent me to Alaska.  And I was in Alaska for a year on a remote radar site in Alaska.  That was a trip.  And then after that I came back to the States for my last year and a half, and I was stationed at Texas--in northern Texas near Denison and Sherman, Texas--at Perrin Air Force Base, in Air Training Command, where I helped train fighter pilots in terms of radar intercepts.  Then got out of the service in '60' [1960] and I didn't know what I was going to do; I had to get a job.  And so, I wasn't going to stay in the service, because people were saying, "Well, you know, you're going to die out there.  If you go outside, you're not going to be able to get a job.  You're not going to do this, and you're not going to do this."  And I heard so much 'not' I said, "I'm going to show you."  So, I didn't know what I was going to do, but I got out.
Story_ID: 626246
Speaker 1: And I was trying--before getting out, I tried to get jobs.  I was writing all these letters to people and and companies and everything, and getting turn-down after turn-down after turn-down.  And on the resume I put down, on there, "American Negro." "American Negro."  "American"-- And I came to Chicago [Illinois] and had a couple of interviews.  And the only reason I was extended an interview was because I was coming to Chicago and they weren't going to pay for it.  So, I interviewed at then Illinois Bell and at Carson's and Marshall Field's.  And Carson's might have given me a job, but they just, they couldn't give me any money.  Because I had a family...  But, so I couldn't get a job.  And then what happened was that at my old school, Francis [W.] Parker [High School], it just so happened that they had just fired the athletic director.  And so, they had, I was there talking to Negronida, [Bernard] Barney Negronida.  And he said, "We just fired somebody."  And he said, "You know, have you ever thought about teaching and coaching?"  I said, "No, not really."  He said, "Well, you ought to."  So, I was hired by them.  And I had to go and take some education credits, because I didn't have any education credits to satisfy North Central's Teaching Association, I guess.  And so, I taught school and coached for two years before going to Inland [Steel Company], and loved it.  I enjoyed it, I had a ball.  The only thing about it is that my family and I, we liked the more luxurious things in life, like toilet paper and toothpaste and so forth.  (Laughter).  Because they weren't paying anything.  And, but, I loved the job.  I loved doing it, and was reasonably successful as a coach.  And I had a lot of good kids that I could relate to, and it was a ball.  But I only did that for two years, and then moved to Inland.
Story_ID: 626247
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you got married when you were in the service [United States Air Force] or?
Speaker 2: I got married when I was in the service.  I got married when I was in the Air Force.  And the first time I got married on the radar site.  Because I was supposed to get married after--
Speaker 1: Not in Alaska, did you?
Speaker 2: In Alaska.
Speaker 1: You got married in Alaska?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  (Laughter).  Yeah--
Speaker 1: It's interesting, because they say... they've said for a long time there are not many women in Alaska anyway.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't meet her in Alaska.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  This was, I had met, met my then, the lady I married while--just before going to Alaska.  And so, we were going to be married when I came back.  And so, when I got to Alaska... this was in December.  So, I got on this remote site, and it was just about three or four days before Christmas.  It was 32 below zero.  And I walked into this, into the club, the officer's club, and I saw this guy dancing with this broom.  I said, "This is going to be a long year."  (Laughter).  And so, I, I just started thinking...  (Laughter).  And all you've got to do... you know, you work, and read books, and you drank too much, and you gambled, and all these things.  So I said, "This is no good."  So this one night, to be very honest about it, I guess I really got blitzed.  And so I called this lady and said--you know, we were supposed to get married when I got back that next December.  And I said, "How would you like to get married in Alaska."  And so, she was sober.  And she said, "Yeah."  (Laughter).  So, so, she came to Alaska, and we were married in the base theater on the radar site, and then honeymooned for two weeks in Anchorage [Alaska].  And then she went back to Chicago [Illinois], and then I finished my tour.  And then I came back to Chicago that December, and then we went on together to Texas for the year and a half after that.  So, yeah, it was a long year.
Story_ID: 626248
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now, so you were at Francis [W.] Parker [High School] coaching and teaching?
Speaker 2: I did that for two years.
Speaker 1: And did you coach everything, or did you--
Speaker 2: No, I coached football and basketball, and was athletic director.  And then was teaching physical education and taught a little history.  And it was, it was good.  It was a familiarity to me, and it was a comfort zone for me.  Because I knew a lot of the people there, and the landscape and so forth, and it was good.  And as I said, you know, I guess I had, was beginning to think of myself as probably staying in education for most of my time.  And then this Inland [Steel Company] thing came up, which was sort of interesting.  And it was outgrowth of the fraternity [Beta Theta Pi] stuff we talked about.
Speaker 1: How did it happen?
Speaker 2: There was a guy that was the personnel director at Inland Steel Company who was a Beta, from Wittenberg [University in Springfield, Ohio].  And he was one of these, one of these guys that lived for fraternities.  And he knew of me by reputation, in terms of what had happened with the Betas and so forth.  And there was a guy that was with me at Kenyon [University in Gambier, Ohio] who was actually the president of our chapter, who had taken a job with Inland.  And so, he saw him and he just asked him, "Whatever happened to Bill Lowry?"  And the guy said, "Well..." he says, "...he just got out of the service, and he's teaching and coaching at Francis Parker."  And so, so the guy was curious.  And he said... he said, "I'd like to meet him."  He says, "Would you give me his name, his address and everything."  So, he did, and he dropped me this note.  And being a wise HR guy, he put an application in there.  Well, you know, as I told you, I probably should have been looking for a job, but I wasn't.  But long story short, we had lunch, and he satisfied his curiosity I guess.  And then he talked to me about a training program that Inland had--an executive training program for guys coming out of college and so forth.  And after about twenty-six interviews--there were quite a few--I was accepted into that program, and I was the first black to go through their management training program at Inland.  And I did that, and then thirty-one years later, I retired.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a lot of ground.
Story_ID: 626249
Speaker 1: Tell us about Inland Steel [Company].  Now, what did you do at Inland Steel?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first started, I went through the training program.  This was, well, 1962.  And it was a nine month training program, and six of us went through that, where we went around to all areas of Inland Steel Company divisions and subsidiaries.  And after getting a good look at the company, then they would ask the various places that we'd been to in Inland if there was anybody that wanted to hire any one of us six guys in there.  And then they asked us, "Of all the places that you've seen, where would you like to go?"  And I had quite a few options, but I selected to go into production control.  And actually, the guy, the Beta [Theta Pi] that I talked about who was personnel manager became sort of my mentor in a sense.  And he had advised me--he said, "If you're going to be in the steel industry, you ought to know how steel is made, and you'll be able to follow it."  So, I did that.  So, I was, I worked in there for three years.  And then after that I was transferred out of production control into what was then called industrial relations, or personnel work, and did labor relations work and personnel work.  And then I went through Inland the rest of that time in human resources.  And as I may have stated, the last job I had with Inland, I'd been through divisions and subsidiaries and headed up their personnel area at Ryerson [Inc.] and then went, came back downtown to headquarters and was corporate director of personnel and recruitment, and then retired ten years ago from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so what were your duties in terms of, I mean what kind of things were you in charge of, in terms of personnel?  Were you in charge of recruiting?
Speaker 2: The whole ball of wax.  It started off that I, you know, the first job I had was sort of a generalist job, where I was at a plant location at the plant container, where I was introduced to all of human resources, quite frankly--the recruiting part of it, the benefits part of it, and labor relations; and you name it--training and the whole bit, safety and the like.  And then as I had various assignments around Inland, I had particular assignments that might be in training, and education, or management development, or recruitment, or some of the other things.  But then as I gained greater responsibilities, then generally I was given oversight to all the functional areas.  And when I was over human resources at Ryerson, my responsibilities were really all of those areas--all the functional areas within human resources--the recruitment, the employee relations, the benefits comps, labor relations--not labor relations--but training in all of those areas.  And then when I came back down to Inland, I was personnel manager at Inland for a couple of years and then later was the corporate director of personnel and recruitment.  And there my major responsibilities were in the corporate recruiting, all the recruiting of Inland Steel Company and what that entailed, as well as diversity was a big part of my job.  And I got involved in training and management development to some extent.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a philosophy of human resources that you, I mean, that works better?  Some people, I mean, some managers are a lot tougher on employees than others.  I mean and some people provide a lot of things, extra-curricular things, some don't.  I know the Japanese had a model of how... a team building concept.  What do you, what's your philosophy?  What do you think works best?
Speaker 2: My philosophy?  Well, that's sort of tough.  You know, I think...  That's a good question.  I think really what you're saying, which is true, is that there are a lot of people that have different styles.  And just like individuals have different styles, I think there are a lot of different styles and philosophies that companies may have, or a community within that company.  As far as I'm concerned, I think that, you know, maybe it has to do with my heritage, I don't know... or my youth.  But to me, it's a very simple case of the Golden Rule.  I truly believe that if you treat people the way you want to be treated, you're going to come out alright.  I think for the most part, you'll gain the respect that you should have, because you're giving respect to others.  I think you're going to approach people the way that people generally want to be approached.  And if you're honest about it, I think people reward you for that in many ways.  If nothing else, they respect you.  And in most cases, people are going to work for you.  Most people want to work for somebody that treats them right, that allows them to maintain their self-esteem and all those things.  And I think for the people, or for the company, or for the industry that does that, for the most part I think people give them payment in terms of high performance and productivity.  To me that's the way that people ought to look at it.  And I say that, not just in terms of human resources, I say that in terms of life.  And I think the same thing applies in life and politics and anything you want to do.  I mean, when you get right down to it, we're talking about human beings.  And we respond to the behavior of others in a way.  And depending on what kind of behavior you get is going to determine your behavior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell me about maybe some tough decisions you've had to make in this field?  You know, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there are a lot--you know, any decision that relates to a man or a woman keeping or losing their job, to me is a tough decision.  And one of the reasons why I retired when I did was because I could, I guess.  But once it had gotten to the point that what I was doing was really...  I, my... I was giving oversight to down-sizing a fourth of our steel division population, which was not fun.  And then telling people who had jobs and who didn't.  And, and, all of these men and women, many of whom had families and others, that's perhaps some of the toughest things that I've ever had to do.  And it just never is easy to do.  Firing people is not easy to do, you know.  Even if it's for cause, sometimes it's very difficult.  In fact, I used to refer to that as "industrial death."  Because when a man or woman loses their ability to earn money, I mean that creates havoc in one's life, and it's not always easily overcome.  So, for me those are some of the toughest decisions.  In terms of other things, functionally, and what kinds of programs we use and what input that I would have in some things that Inland was doing--whether it was acquisitions or the rest--those weren't as tough, because obviously there are people that are making some decisions that are much greater than mine.  But I think those decisions that relate to men and women and their livelihood is the toughest decision I've made.  But on the other hand, I think that's another thing that had made me concentrate so much and feel so... that jobs are so important, which also in a sense led to television, which I was fortunate enough to be in for several years.  And... because it's a job to me.  My dad [William E. Lowry], you know, coming out of the Depression and everything, used to... oh, he'd tell me all the time about how important a job is and the importance of having money and the importance of having respect and all of this kind of thing, and how important it was for him to have money to take care of not only our family, but his mom and siblings and the rest.  And so, jobs became very important to me.  And I guess that's another reason why I sort of gravitated to personnel work.
Story_ID: 626251
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: The other side of the coin, the good--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the happy side.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I did two things in my life that I think are major accomplishments for me, that I feel good about.  And I didn't do them alone, I had help.  But one was that shortly after getting at Inland [Steel Company], they had, they had started a program from [Washington] D.C. called "Plans for Progress."  And a lot of people may not remember this, but they had assembled in D.C. what they call "Negro executives."  Well, there weren't too many Negro executives in 1963 or 1962.  In fact, I'd just come off a trainee program, so I was no executive.  But I think they'd gone to a lot of the people that had been instrumental and worked with the administration.  In our case, it was Joe Blockett, who was our chairman at Inland.  And I think these forty companies sent a black that they had there.  And so, we started what was called the "Plans for Progress."  And what that simply was is that we were given schools, black colleges, to go to, to talk to the students there about staying in school and letting them know what kind of exposures might help them in terms of getting them where they wanted to go... but you got to get out of school first and do this.  And it was called the Vice-President's Task Force on Youth Motivation [under vice-president Hubert Humphrey].  And so, we were doing that for a couple of years and a couple of us from Chicago [Illinois], a fellow by the name of Bill Farrow who was with Commonwealth Edison, and Joe Black who was then with--rest this guy, rest his soul--was with Greyhound and a former Brooklyn Dodger pitcher--and I would make these trips together and go back and forth.  And we decided one day that, you know, to go to the black colleges and talk to black men and women, that's great.  But those kids have made a big jump already.  They're in college and they're going through some things.  And what about some of the kids that aren't in college yet?  They've got to get through high school, they'd got to some...  So, the three of us came back and after a couple of years we instituted a similar program, but much lower in the grades in terms of the public school system here in Chicago, and going into the schools and living... having the living witness concept of getting a lot of blacks together--men and women who were working in various occupations and going to the schools and talking about what kinds of jobs they have.  What will they do and what kind of training had they had?  And what did they have to go through to do it, so that the kids can get some idea of what's entailed in some of these jobs.  There were doctors, there were postal employees, there were policemen; there were lawyers and the like.  And we got that program installed and implemented, and it ran for better than thirty years in the school system and came throughout the school system.  And the three of us felt very good about that.
Story_ID: 626252
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that by chance, I happened to get on TV and had a program on employment, which I feel very, very good about.  And we got a couple of Emmys and a Peabody Award for the program.
Speaker 2: You say by chance, but how did it happen?
Speaker 1: Well, it really was by chance.  The CBS locally was, wanted to do some local programming in one of three areas--either housing, employment, or education.  And they decided to look at employment first.  And they were going around looking and talking to people in the field.  And so, they went to the Urban League and they were talking to people at the Urban League.  And they went to the Chamber of Commerce and they were talking to people.  And it just so happened there was a guy at the Chamber who was an executive on loan that they had talked to.  And he had--at the time they talked to him about what's happening in employment... and as a TV show and something that could be viable and how would they go about it--three days or four days before that, he had come out and observed one of these programs that I was conducting in the high school, this youth motivation program in the high school.  And he was impressed with the way the program was run, and then I guess to some extent with the way that I did it.  And so, he went back and told the people at CBS, he said, "I think if you want to talk to some people in the field, you should talk to Bill Lowry.  He's in the field and so forth.  And I think that he might be the guy that you'd even want to host it if you decide to do a program."  And so, they did contact me.  And we had lunch and we talked for three or four hours about a show.  What kind of show would it be?  What are some of the issues of employment and all of this?  And then I'd sort of forgotten about it.  And then about, I don't know, three or four weeks later or something like that, I got a call.  And they said, "We decided to do a show, and we'd like for you to host it."  So, to me, that's by chance.  And then they pulled me in there and he says... and the producer asked me, says, "Get with the cameraman."  And I got in there and he said, "We have to get some feel for presence, if you have any camera presence."  (Laughter).  And so, he looked at me and he took me in this... in the place and he looked at the cameraman, and he says, "Okay, give me ten minutes worth."  I said, "Of what?"  He said, "Of anything."  I was petrified.  I couldn't think of anything.  You know, ten minutes is a long time for doing some things.  And I was trying to think of the Gettysburg Address, anything that would... that would give me some time.  But anyway we went on and had the show, and it came on, started out on Saturdays.  We were on for twenty-four years.  And as I said, we got, won a couple of awards.  But it was, it was good.  And what we did, it was estimated that during that time we serviced a little bit better than maybe a million and a half people in this region with respect to employment and training.  And what we did is we got jobs from the State that I would... I would talk about on the air.  And for those people that are interested in pursuing jobs or training, they would call.  There was a number they could call, and they would call in, and then they would have--
Speaker 2: With the Illinois Department of Labor?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They'd provide--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --listings.
Speaker 1: That's right, the Illinois of Labor, right.  That's exactly what it was.  And then when they would call, they'd be talking to someone from the State, or a volunteer that would give them a date and a time.  And then they would, they would then go in and talk about the job or training opportunity that they were looking for.  And then after we'd been on a little while, then people would call in.  And we were getting twenty-six hundred to three thousand calls a week from people that were responding to the show.  And then we started to feature what I refer to as sort of the success story.  And that was someone that had used the show to get a job or training.  And then we'd go on remote and then do a five-minute bit on them, to give some authenticity to the show.  And it really was, it was a lot of fun.  But more importantly, it was really helping some people, and it was really bringing supply and demand together.
Story_ID: 626253
Speaker 1: And I think of all the things I've done and the things that I perhaps cherish most, I think that that was something that was extremely important.  And each week we would also profile a particular program, or particular industry, or a particular job.  It might be sales, it might be health care, whatever; education and so forth.  So, we tried to give people information on that.  And we would literally pull people out of the unemployment lines.  And they're there to look for jobs and get their checks maybe or something, and the next thing they know they're talking to this idiot on TV.  And I would actually interview them on the job, trying to interview them in a sense so that prospective employers could get an idea of who these people are, what they have done.  And often jobs would result from that, as well as going through the State [Illinois Department of Labor].  And I did that from 1967 to 1991, and it was a ball.  And then did some other things there in TV.  But that was, that was very gratifying.
Speaker 2: That's right, I remember the show, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people come up to me and say, "I remember you.  I used to look at that as I was going looking for my cartoons."  You know, (Laughter) which also would tell you how young--
Speaker 2: Saturday morning, that's--
Speaker 1: Right, you know, Saturday morning.  You know, yeah, they were looking at, they were interested in cartoons; they were looking at that.  But that was, no, that was kicks.  But it was also important.  And I think there are probably some things like that that could be done now.  But we don't do it, because it just as important.  I mean, we're not doing any better job as far as I'm concerned now of getting supply and demand together as we did thirty or thirty-five years ago.  So, it's a still a vehicle that could be used.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, why did they stop it?  I mean, it seemed to be successful thing.  And people were using... you know?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, if a local... for local TV, twenty-four years is a long time; that was one thing.  And I think that regardless of how good you are and everything, probably some of that gets stale.  But what happened, too, was that, as you know, a lot of... they stopped a lot of the local programming.  And then the most important thing is, you know, you're going to get on TV for the people that have the money that have come in.  And if they're going to come in and buy that time, then the local program, or the local broadcast, they're going to give it up.  And so, they did.  And we were replaced by, I think the Gospel Hour or something.  But they did their own production and they paid for the time.  And then programs like "The Opportunity Line" and so, they vanished everywhere.  I mean when you look at it now, you don't see a lot of local programming now.  I think we need to go back to it, and it's probably time to revisit it.
Speaker 2: Did the FCC rules change in terms of what they, the stations comply to?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's a good question.  Because I think it did.  Because at the time we started this--and one reason why we were on twenty-four years to be very honest about it, I think, is that the licensing--when they would go through that--you know, the fact that you could have a reward... I mean an award winning program on--especially not just an Emmy, but a Peabody and so forth--that puts you in good stead.  So, they got their license each year with virtually no problem at all.  And I think it did change, to the extent that those requirements were not there anymore.  And then as, then what happened too is, you know, the TV industry had a lot of personnel changes--people changing, and this and that.  So the format changed, and they had different performers... I mean different producers and the like.  And then the show took a different format, and we still tried to keep it as current as possible.  But it just, it didn't have the same kind of glamour that it had when it first came on.  I think it was still just as significant in bringing people together, but time took its toll on that, I think.
Story_ID: 626254
Speaker 1: Now, how much of your, I guess, work week was consumed with the show ["The Opportunity Line"]?  And what... well, how... what kind of work week did you have?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, not as much as people might think.  One of the things, I had a lot of help, I mean from the studio.  You have interns and you have the producers doing a great deal of the work.  As I got more into it, I did more in terms of producing a little bit and being a little bit more involved in that.  But for the most part, I just came and I did my thing, you know.  Inland [Steel Company] was very good about giving me time to do that.  And when we first started, we would tape on Friday nights.  And so, I'd go to the studio and maybe get there a couple of hours before taping time and would meet with the guests who were going to be on there, and then give them some idea of what the show was going to be like... run them through that.  And then we'd actually tape.  We got to the point where we could tape pretty quickly, and we'd tape the half hour show in maybe an hour or less.  And so, maybe I'd put in two and a half to three hours of taping time for that show.  And for some others, it took a little bit longer.  But for that show, that was about it.  And then as I got more involved, and then more involved with helping the producers identify people--identify topics, and doing a little of the scripting and that kind of thing--then it took on a little bit more.  But that was because I wanted to do that.  And I, it was just, it was something I enjoyed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, typically what were the... what jobs would you get the best response, I mean the best match-up with, I guess, between the potential employers and employees?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It was sort of varied, and I'm not quite sure.  But my... my... I think that I'm right about this.  It's that most of the audience that were tuning in for the show and everything were not professional.  I mean, we weren't... we're not talking about unemployed academicians or doctors or accountants as much as we're talking about people who had had some jobs and had been working (unclear), and for the most part might be in manufacturing or some of the other things we're talking about--semi-skilled and to some extent skilled--but semi-skilled people for the most part, clerical workers and the rest.  And I think that they represented by far the larger percentage of it.  So, people in retail, people that were working in warehousing and manufacturing, and forklift operators--people with descriptions like that.  A lot of people that were working... we had shift work.  We did a lot of... a lot of jobs that we had were working around the clock, and they were normally hourly jobs and the like.  And I think that a large percentage of the people fit that bill, and took jobs like that.  Now, we had a few professionals from time to time, but for the most part, I think those were the people that found... I think, that probably more informative than anything else.
Story_ID: 626255
Speaker 1: I guess, I don't know if I'm asking you everything that has to do with this or not.  I know I haven't.  You know, I'm trying to think of...The show ["The Opportunity Line"] was your best experience you said?  And the toughest thing was dealing with the personnel issues in terms of letting people go?
Speaker 2: And that's still... that's still the case.  And I, and I think that one of the things we haven't covered, and we can just cover this pretty quickly, is that after Inland [Steel Company]--and I retired from Inland  [1993] and I still felt that I was reasonably young and reasonably healthy and could do something.  So, I worked with and for my brother for a year in management consulting, Jim [Jim H. Lowry & Associates].  And then was asked to do some consulting with the [John D. and Catherine T.] MacArthur Foundation.  And I was doing some consulting for them and was asked to join... think about joining them on a full-time basis [in 1994], and I did.  And I've been here nine years now.  And that's, this has been a good experience for me, too, for a couple of reasons.  One, it's sort of a neat change from what I'd been doing all those years.  And it isn't that Inland Steel Company wasn't something that I enjoyed and something where I think that I had some achievements there.  But... and met good people and worked with good people.  But this was a nice, pleasant change.  And the not-for-profit arena was not on my radar.  And to come here and have an opportunity to work for an organization that... its value structure is so in line with my own... is marvelous.  And I don't how many people get a chance to do that.  And when you have an organization that says... you know, that... it's really working.  And I think we mean it, when we say to enhance the human good.  That's pretty broad, but the kinds of things that we get involved in, and the contributions that we can make to the life of other people and organizations is a turn-on for me.  And it's the kind of thing that I think is not only inspiring, but it's the kind of thing that you enjoy doing.  It's the kind of thing you enjoy being associated with, and you feel pretty good about it.  And to take the public trust, if you will, and this money, and leverage it in a way so that it benefits literally thousands of people, is something that I think that very few of us that kind of experience.  And for me, it's pretty exhilarating.
Story_ID: 626256
Speaker 1: So, you basically... here [The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation] you manage the employee benefits and--
Speaker 2: I have total responsibility for the... I was hired as the V.P. of Human Resources and Administration, where functionally I have all of those responsibilities, plus as an officer of the Foundation, where I'm involved in the policy and helping set policy and establish policy for the Foundation.  I'm not involved in the programming part of it that much.  But I am involved in the total process of it, which gives me a very broad view.  But the thing that I think for me, the benefit for me, is it's so enriching because the many areas that we get involved in, and the many people that really assist us, or take our money and do something... because we don't do anything really.  What we do is we give money to people to do something.  And to get the benefit of the research, and the smartness and the things of those people, and the breadth of all that--to me is it's bewildering in a sense.  But it's marvelous, and it's almost... it's more than an individual can really comprehend.  But the kinds of things and people that we have coming here that talk about the things that they're doing and what... the grants that they have that would enable them to do it.  And then my chance... for me to get... travel around and visit with our grantees and to see the things that they're doing and to see how the grants... how they benefit from the grants and others benefit from there--so that you can make the complete circle and bring closure to that--is something again that I had never experienced before.  And for these last nine years, it's been extremely gratifying and insightful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you recruit, right?  So--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we recruit some people.  My office is responsible for bringing in the people, yeah, the staff.
Speaker 1: I often wondered how foundations identify personnel who--you know, grants officers and so forth, you know.  Because I've seen them come from different--you know, sometimes they come from not-for-profits and sometimes they come from other sectors.  Is there a profile of a person that you recruit?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on the job, and it depends on the program area.  I think in many cases the way that we recruit for people here is not unlike the way you produce at a for-profit, depending on what the job is.  You know, if I'm looking for somebody in human resources, or somebody in information technology, or I'm looking for somebody in accounting, it's pretty much the same; you go to the same kind of sources.  In the programming area, it's a little different.  If you're running a program, for instance, on the former Soviet Union, and you're looking for somebody--depending on what that program is--you want somebody that's familiar with the language and familiar with the country and probably has taught in that, or something.  And you go to places... it may be the Academy where you go looking for people like that, or researchers and the like.  And you might use different kinds of publications that you would put ads in, as opposed to what you would obviously for the accountant.  So, a lot will depend on what the program area is, and what that person's going to do as to what it requires.  But sometimes it's pretty tough.  But on the other hand, though, sometimes again depending on the program area... a lot of the people in the area... you know who the good people are.  You know who the people are out there that you would like to get.  And so, that, that traffic and that population may not be that large, because you... the people have a pretty good idea of those who are contributing, and they're doing the research and the rest.  So, then the idea is how to recruit those people from wherever they are, and what they're doing to see if they will come and do that for you.  In some other cases, the traffic or the population might be a lot broader.  If you're looking for someone in the programming area within let's say, workforce development, that area's not quite as difficult to try to find somebody working in that as it might be if you... or you have a program in terms of eradicating parasites, or so.  But it's, it's... a lot of the principles are the same.  This is one of things why I've liked human resources, because I think that what you have are principles that you can apply in almost any... any place.
Story_ID: 626257
Speaker 1: I think I'll just ask you this question, I guess.  In terms of training personnel and that sort of thing, do you... I mean what, what, what techniques do you think are useful, I guess?
Speaker 2: And again, I guess it depends on what it is the person's doing, you know.  When I was with Inland [Steel Company], in industry, we were training in a lot of areas that quite frankly we don't train here [The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation].  And is this a case where it's not needed?  I don't know.  But I think it was the case probably it was felt at Inland that it was more needed.  For instance, in the for-profit where we did a lot of training in terms of strategic planning, decision-making, training... relative skill training, depending on the area that a person was in--a lot of team building and, and, a lot of supervisory training, and all of those kinds of things, to help people do their jobs better and to supervise others or the performances of others.  And it was ongoing, and you did this all the time.  We also did a lot of training academically, because a lot of companies will tie into executive training programs at the major colleges there.  And in this case, the University of Chicago [Illinois] or Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois].  And they're training their managers to be VP's, and hopefully the president of the foundation.  So, the MBA programs and others become very important in terms of their management training.  In a not-for-profit it's a little different, in the sense that, for instance, here, you know, we don't have what we call a succession planning in the sense where you, we hire trainees and then you move them through the organization, and you're planning life for them over the next twenty or twenty-five years and hopefully they become the president of the foundation.  One, we're not that deep, and we're more shallow.  Another thing is that what we're doing is that the breadth that we have, and in the program areas the life of some of those programs may be three years, may be six years, may be nine years or something.  But there's a beginning and an end in many of those.  Because in many cases, if you're leveraging your money or you're putting money in a particular area, some foundations--and to a large extent, we're the same way--if there's some people doing something that's very meaningful in an area that's very important to you as a foundation--and in our case it could be world ecology; it could be nuclear disarmament; it could be education, any of those things.  And they have good people doing good things, and you want to help them, then a lot of times you use the money so that they can be positioned so they can do these things, but also get to a point so that they can raise the money that they need, or will need, for perpetuity, or at least to continue.  And then you're going to something else.  Because if something else pops within the general area of your interest, then you're probably going to start initiation, or initiate another project someplace else.  So, with those things happening, you're not building a workforce up for fifteen and twenty years, when you have a lot of people coming and going, depending on what the needs are for that particular initiative.  And so, the training that you're going through is not quite the same in most cases.  So, what kind of training do we do?  Well, we, I have instituted some training, and we do some training for supervisory training.  Because we're finding that as you get larger and so forth, and people have to get things done more through people--than maybe just being independent and doing their research and doing some things--they probably need to be exposed to some kinds of techniques and ways of trying to do that effectively, so that you work together as people and as a team.  And we did some training also with respect to writing.  Writing and expression and clarity is very important, especially in the program areas in doing these things.  And so, we would provide some training there.  And we do some diversity training.  This is an organization here that not only talks about diversity, but we try to do something about it.  And so, the issue here is that we believe that diversity actually does add value to the organization.  It adds value to the decision-making, and it adds value to dialog and the rest.  And so, we want to expose all of our employees to the importance of that added value, and how to use it, and how to appreciate it.  And so, we do that.  So, and this isn't to say that for-profits don't do the same thing in diversity.  I'm just saying our training is probably not as extensive as the training might be in the for-profit.  Because we're, our approach to things are a lot different.  And we're not quite, we don't have the depth of that a for-profit will have in terms of... and the mindset is different.  In the for-profit I used to go out and recruit, try to recruit people on the campus that are just coming out of an undergraduate program, in the hopes that we could have them at Inland for the next twenty or thirty or forty years, and they may surface as our VP's and presidents.  It's not done here.  And we will conduct national searches for the president of the foundation or for certain... directors of certain programs.  So, it's just a different approach to it.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me, what's the state... what's your assessment of the state of the black community's, community's preparedness for, I guess for the current job market?
Speaker 2: It's a much better question probably than answer I have. It, you know, in many respects I'm... I'm really...  In some respects, I like very much what I see in terms of where, what blacks are doing and where they've been, especially professionally.  I'm really impressed many times as I go out and I see men and women who have really excelled in colleges, and not just colleges, but in some of the best colleges in the world.  And they have acquired the knowledge and the savoir faire to be effective performers in virtually anything that you have.  And, and, that hasn't always been the case.  I think in many cases we were either denied access to that or, for whatever the reason, we didn't go and so forth.  And I really enjoy and relish in seeing this happen--and with the great numbers that they have, and I have seen some just outstanding people, outstanding blacks in all areas.  On the other hand, what dismays me is the growing disparity between the haves and the have-nots that's taking place in the black community, just like it is anyplace else.  Because for all these marvelous people that I see that are just, that are so outstanding and excel in so many ways, we have so many other people that unfortunately have been crippled by either the poor educational system or inability to get into the system and do some things.  And they just really are not prepared.  We know the educational systems and in a sense, especially in most of the urban areas, they are not preparing...  Is at best we're getting in many cases functioning illiterates coming in?  As the sophistication of machinery and other things increases, we have people decreasing in terms of the educational experiences.  This I'm told is maybe the first time, the first generation, where we have a generation of kids that are less educated than their parents and those who preceded them.  To me, that's not a good thing.  I think that that... and that doesn't augur well for the society, and it certainly doesn't augur well for us.  I think we've got to do something in terms of the educational system.  And it's one thing to say that no child is left behind.  But it's another thing really to do some things to make sure that that's the case.  I also know--and I'm not smart enough to figure out how you do these things--but it's not just the case of education, I know that.  And these things are intertwined and they're inter-related.
Story_ID: 626259
Speaker 1: And you can't talk about just education; you've got to talk about all the things that go with it.  You know, the housing and child care and...  I was, I was placed in... or asked to chair a taskforce, the City-County Taskforce on Welfare Reform by the [Chicago, Illinois] Mayor [Richard M. Daley] and by [HM Cook County Board] President [Todd] Stroger some years ago, right after the change in the welfare laws.  And so I got much more involved in this, in those issues than I'd ever been before.  I was fairly familiar with the employment aspects of it.  But the other aspects, I really was not--the housing and the transportation and health care.  And then the more I got into it, I guess the more depressed I got into it.  Because the more I... it... there were so many problems that just seemed to be so difficult to resolve, and they were all inter-related, you know.  As an example, if you're talking a TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families] mother who has three or four children who's really interested in working...  But if you can't give her a job that there are hours she can meet, and somebody can help her take care of her three kids and so forth, this woman can't work.  And so what happens is, well, in many cases she can't work and she can't do things.  And if you have jobs that are not accessible to the people where they live and in their communities, you know, people don't have cars, they can't drive to them, even if you can get somebody to babysit for the kids.  And so, all of these problems have come in.  And we've got to do a better job as a society of looking at these problems--seeing the inter-personal relationships, the inter-relationships of these things--and trying to then develop plans in a sense that address these areas.  And I think that one of the things that troubled me is that the--in welfare, for instance, I strongly feel that the impetus for change in welfare was more, to me, because they wanted to get--they, meaning the administration and some others--wanted to get rid of the "welfare queens" and all the people that they considered abusing welfare and so forth.  And it was just the case of getting them off the rolls and so forth.  And it wasn't a case of thinking through... even if these people got off the rolls, society is still going to have to do something for them.  So, we're still going to have to deal with the people that are out there they've got to work, or somebody's got to help them; somebody's got to do some things.  And to me, I said, "Well, you pay me now or pay me later."  And if we can't give them jobs... and if we can't make them... give them the kinds of skills they need so that they can hold jobs, then as a society we're going to have to take care of them or address this in some other way.  And it could even be much more, much more expensive.  And so, to answer your question, I think that there's a large percentage maybe of our, the black population, that is becoming extremely well-trained and has knowledge and expertise that exceeds what many of the predecessors have, and is equal to almost anybody around.  But there's a larger group probably that do not have that--that are poorly educated in a sense, and that are functional illiterates that are having a difficult time not only getting employment, but maintaining it.  And we're not doing I don't think what we should be doing as a society to try to bring these two together.  And when I say the two together, I'm talking about that other group that truly needs the help and they need the assistance and they need the education.  And they need the support to get them into jobs, so that a) they can take care of their kids and their families in a way just like other people do.
Story_ID: 626260
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I would imagine it's like everybody else.  I think... I don't know... I guess a couple of things.  One, I... one of the hopes is that I hope that as a black community we can continue... we can think together as a community.  And I'm not so sure we really do that.  I think that it seems as if almost the more we progress, or the more some people progress, the less cohesive we are, you know, and the less we really come together.  Because then that may be just the way it's supposed to be, if that... frames of reference... that there's great disparity between the frames of reference that maybe they shouldn't come together.  But to me, the common denominator--I think there's a common denominator in blackness.  And one of the things that has driven me all of my time is that during my life people have always helped me in some kind of way.  I didn't do any of the things that I've done by myself.  There was somebody that was willing to help me, to support me in some way.  And I've just avowed that I've got to do the same thing.  And I've got to try to help those who, in a sense, need the assistance so that they can get where they're going, and then they in turn can help somebody else.  I don't think that's the mentality of a lot of people.  I think unfortunately we're just like, we fall victim the same way just whites and others.  You know, many get some things and they say, "Okay, I got mine, and that's it."  And that bothers me... that truly bothers me.  So, I think first of all, as a race we should be thinking more internally.  As a race, we should be thinking about more things that we should be doing for one another and for ourselves, rather than thinking about maybe what has to be done by somebody else.  Secondly, I think that we have to as a society recognize where we are in terms of not only blacks, but others who are poverty stricken, or lack the education they need for jobs and so forth--the people who are poor, you know.  We've got working poor people.  And until we can attack those with equal vigor and money--that we can attack, or think we can--in terms of what we do in defense areas and so forth, I don't think we're ever going to cause some people to really uplift themselves and to be able to move in some circles and into tiers that are going to be beneficial to them and to their families.  And so, I guess I'm talking about a national mindset now.  And, and, you know, you sound very Pollyannian-- Pollyonic.  And I know that people listening to this will say, "Oh, my God, that's so unrealistic."  Well, it is.  But, you asked me, "What was my dream?"  That's my dream.  Realistically, what's going to happen?  We're going to continue to have these issues, and we're going to continue to have to plow through them.  And maybe at some point there's going to be some person or some people that will recognize that there should be some parity in terms of these major issues that we have in society, and try to address them in a way that might help those who need it.  Now, you can't help everybody, and everybody can't be saved.  But I think we can do a better job in terms of percentages than we're doing now.
Story_ID: 626261
Speaker 1: Sir, what would you consider as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I guess I never considered a legacy.  I think... I don't know.  I'd like to believe that--first of all I have a, I have some children that not only understand maybe my frame of reference, but hopefully embrace it, and would do some of the things that I have just articulated to you, and that they would be responsible for my grandchildren doing the same kinds of things.  And then hopefully, you get a rippling effect there.  I don't know if that's a legacy or not, but that's sort of the kind of thing I want.  I think another thing is that I, I, I really want people--if people could feel less selfish about the things that they want and the things that they would like to have and their own personal satisfaction, I think that they could do more, and would do more for helping others in terms of moving them forward.  And if that's a legacy, then I'd accept that, because that's truly the way I am.  I've been truly blessed in my life.  And, and as I said, I've been helped in so many ways.  But after a while, to me, it's not so much about what happens to me.  It's what happens to those who haven't been as blessed as I have, and what can you do in a practical way to assist them.  And I don't think I'm a fool, and I don't think I'm going to run around and try to save everybody in the world.  I can't do that, I don't want to do that; that's impractical.  But there are an awful lot of good people out here, who with just a little nudge, a little help, a little support, often you get... a metamorphosis is taking place.  Those are the kinds of things where I think we have to be able to recognize those, and do something about 'em.
Story_ID: 626262
Speaker 1: Okay.  And finally sir, this is slightly different from the previous question.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I guess I'd like to be remembered as somebody that for the most part was... tried to be as honest as possible, who was genuinely concerned about others, and did something about it.  When I was a kid, my dad [William E. Lowry] used to take me to get a haircut every two weeks.  I was eight years old, and I used to hate it.  And I didn't like the haircut.  Plus, we'd go to this place, and it was at the time Joe Louis was the champ.  And he had this part down the middle of his hair, and they skinned his head and everything.  So, I didn't like the way I looked, you know.  So, I'd go, and I'd have to get that haircut because my dad wanted me to look like Joe Louis.  So, I'd go and I'd sit in this chair, and I looked and looked, and I said, "God."  I just, I'd hate it.  But I was a kid, I can't do anything, so I'd have to live through it.  And as I'd sit there on this wall, there was only one plaque there, just a single plaque.  And on this plaque, it showed this guy on his knees with a halo around his head.  And I'd see this every two weeks.  And the caption under that was, "If you want your prayers answered, get off your knees and hustle."  And I'd like to believe that people... I lived by that.  Because I wasn't just sitting back all the time asking for this and everything.  If it was something that had to be done...  I kept that plaque in mind, and I got off my knees and tried to hustle.  And if people remember me for that, and that there was some good that came out of that, then I'm happy.
Speaker 1: Alright, well, thank you very much, Sir.
Speaker 2: My pleasure, thank you.
Story_ID: 626263
Speaker 1: This, this is my daughter and her husband, my daughter Kim [Pilcher] and her husband, Elmer [Pilcher], and my son Bill [William A. Lowry] and his wife, Cheryl [Lowry], and Bill and Chery's little Billie.  And this was little Billie about four or five years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: The top one is my wife, Teri [Teresita Lowry], and I at Kenyon College [Gambier, Ohio].  And that's the Craig Cup, and that's the cup that's given to the Kenyon alumni who's contributed the most in a year towards the college and its affairs.  And it's a rather important award and one that I treasure.  The bottom one is me as a duffer golfing with some friends and acquaintances.  That's Walter Payton on the far left, Mike Singletary next to him, and the gentleman between Mike Singletary and myself is Mike Singletary's father-in-law.
Speaker 2: Okay, the year?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Did we mention the year?
Speaker 1: Oh, year.
Speaker 2: Well, if you can't get the year, maybe roughly the decade.
Speaker 1: Well, the top one is, that wasn't too long ago.  That was just a couple of years ago.  That really was, I think that's 2001.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was earlier and this was before... that was while Payton was playing.  And so, gosh, I would have to say early nineties.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he was gone by '86' [1986] or so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, this was--I'm sorry.  I know exactly when that was.  This was 1986.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's when they won the Super Bowl?
Speaker 1: Ninety-Eighty Six [1986].
Speaker 2: Well, starting upper left.
Speaker 1: Upper left is, that's my brother's [HM James H. Lowry] senior year in college, which had to 1961, I guess.  And that's my brother who was a senior in college.  That's my mom, Camille [Caldwell Lowry], in the middle.  And that's me with the hat on the left.  And we were visiting Jim at Grinnell College [Grinnell, Iowa].  On the lower right, these are all my [United States] Air Force buddies at King Salmon Air Force Base in King Salmon, Alaska--two hundred and fifty miles south of Anchorage.  And this was in 1958.
Speaker 2: Okay, next. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The one on the left is my mother, Camille [Caldwell] Lowry. And gosh, I don't know, but I'm going to say this was about--what is this, 2000?  I'm going to say maybe 1980, somewhere in that vicinity.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: On the right there--
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead, Sir.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's me in my freshman year at Kenyon College, and that had to be in 1952, the fall of 1952.  My face is a little swollen, because in the game last week I got kicked in the head and had four stitches in my head.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: About two years... there--
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: About fifteen years ago.  So that would make that what, '89' [1988], '88' [1988]?  About 1988.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's yours truly on the set of "The Opportunity Line."  And these are some guests-- that came after "The Opportunity Line."  It was called "Objective Jobs," where we, each week we had a particular thrust that we explored in terms of jobs and training.  And this was a panel that I had on that particular program.  I don't remember what the thrust was.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the people?
Speaker 1: No, no, this was a long time ago.  That was "Objective Jobs."
Speaker 2: When was this?
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean the time.  Yeah, this was, yeah this was '80' [1980], this was mid-eighties, I'd say somewhere around '85' [1985], '84' [1984], '85' [1985].
Speaker 2: But that was also at CBS?
Speaker 1: CBS.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was CBS, it was down at the CBS station.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead, next.
Speaker 1: That's me, Bill Lowry, at Kenyon College.  And that's right after receiving my, an honorary degree from the college.  And that was in, that was '99' [1999], 1999.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's Bill with his wife Teri and step-daughter, Alexis, at our backyard.  And that was 1999 as well.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Now, that's Bill Lowry as a Kenyon College student.  And I think that, that looks like that was my junior year, which had to be 1955.  (Laughter).  God, almighty.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's me with Sam Bernstein, who was the, actually one time was the head of the Illinois State Employment Service, and then later worked for Mayor [Richard M.] Daley and the City of Chicago.  And, oh, I guess Sam was Commissioner of Employment and Training here in the city.  That's [Edward R.] Ed Kenefick, who was the general manager of CBS Chicago at that time, and myself.  The other gentleman, I don't know.  We were receiving an award, it was around Emmy time.  But I don't know if that was an Emmy or not.  And that was, that had to be 1969.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Opportunity Line, and this is on the set with my pork chops.  This was the Opportunity Line, and this was around 1968 with my sort of half Afro and pork chops.  I'd cut my hair down, but letting it grow longer on my face.  And that's CBS Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's Bill Lowry and Ed Kenefick who was the general manager of CBS, and John Sengstacke at an awards ceremony where the show was given the Mass Media Award by the, I think it's the American Jewish Committee.  And that had to be, again, that was around 1968.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This was, this was giving a presentation to a church group.  And I think this was around 1970 or '71' [1971].  And I think I was, I forgot the name of the church.  But I was speaking at a church on... really blacks in employment.
Speaker 2: That's yours truly being, after being installed into the Kenyon College's Hall of Fame.  That had to be, gosh, 19... I want to say 1990... oh, boy, 1996.  And I think I'd also just come back from Mexico, because I'm darker than I would normally be.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah... one.  Well, yeah, to the extent that it makes sense.  This is Phil Jordon on the left--
Speaker 1: The other guys?
Speaker 2: Well, I only know two.  Two of the guys who were installed with me were Kenyon College grads, and I don't know them.  The guy on the left is Phil Jordan who was the president of the college at that time.  And this is the athletic director on the left who was Phil Jordan.  And the athletic director on the right whose name I can only remember as Bob, I can't remember his last name.  But he was a Kenyon College athletic director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before...
Speaker 1: Okay, mid-nineties.
Speaker 2: Okay, mid-nineties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was, this was at a banquet where we were, had just kicked off the Youth Motivation Program in the public school system.  That was partially sponsored by the Chicago Chamber of Commerce.  The people standing, to the left is Terry Porterfield, and then I'm next.  And then there's [William] Bill Farrow, who was one of the co-founders of the program, and then Warren Bacon, who was an outstanding Chicago personality who was an Inland Steel [Company] employee as well as a very distinguished citizen of Chicago.  He was the president of the School Board and many other titles.  Also, he had been asked many times to run for Mayor of Chicago.  And the people seated, I think one is the president of the Chamber of Commerce at that time, and I cannot--Sam is his first name, I can't come up with his second name.
Story_ID: 626264
Speaker 1: This is a continuation of the photo at the end of Roll Five.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the tape roll cut out as we were describing the last couple of people that Mr. Lowry can remember.  So, he's now going to tell you about the people who are seated at the table.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I...  On the far right is [HM] Manford Byrd [Jr], who was the Superintendent of Schools at the time [in Chicago, Illinois].  The other is the CEO of Amoco at the time, or yeah, I guess we'd say Standard Oil at the time, really.  And I cannot think of his name right now, I'm embarrassed to say that.  And then the other guy next to him was the president of the Chicago Chamber of Commerce.  His first name is Sam, I can't think of his last name either.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.  Next.
Speaker 2: There I am again on the Opportunity Line set, and this had to be the first year or so.  This had to be 1967 at CBS Chicago on the set of the Opportunity Line.  In fact, it was before we changed...  It was 1967, because in the background it says Opportunity Center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had to change that... this was probably taken on the first show.  Because we had to change it, because the lady called in and said that she had an organization called the Opportunity Center.  And so, then we had to change it to the Opportunity Line.  And so, this was probably the very, just the very first show, which was in June of 1967.
Speaker 1: Very good, next.
Speaker 2: There is yours truly.  This had to be around 1941 at my desk at 62nd and South Park, which is now King Drive.  Actually, it was 6216 King Drive.  God, almighty... Betsy Ross [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Okay, very good.  We were over there today.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah?
Speaker 1: At St. Edmunds, we were right across the street--
Speaker 2: St. Edmunds, sure.
Speaker 1: --from Betsy Ross, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's, there we are... this is in the first session, or program, that we had in the Youth Motivation Program in the public school system at Farragut School [now Farragut Career Academy], and this was 1967.  And I'm on the, that's me on the far left. And that's George Seals next to me who was, played for the Chicago Bears.  The lady next to him was a student at Farragut High School, her name was Georgia Johnson.  And the guy on the end is a fellow by the name of Bob Johnson who was also with the Chicago Bears, and to my knowledge no relation to Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did you know--
Speaker 2: And that's at Farragut.
Speaker 1: Did you know Harold Charles over at Farragut?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: He was a science teacher.
Speaker 2: That's yours truly, too.  And I guess, I've got to guess and say that that had to be probably either latter 1935 or early 1936, because I'm standing.  So, I guess I had to be at least over eight months old.  So, I'm going to say probably the latter part of 1935.  My mother [Camille Caldwell Lowry] tells me I walked at about nine months, my mother tells me.  So, I'm going to say that's late 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay, very good, next.
Speaker 2: God, that's old.  That's yours truly not too long ago.  That, I think that was about 2001.  That's at home in Chicago.  And it was around the holidays, and I want to say Christmas.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's Bill Lowry, me, 13 years old, 6044 Eberhart in Chicago.  This was the day I graduated from A.O. Sexton Grammar School.  So, that had to be 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay, very good, thank you.
Speaker 2: Alright, group, thanks a lot.
