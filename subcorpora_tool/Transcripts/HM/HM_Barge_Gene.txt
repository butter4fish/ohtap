Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's [Esther Edward Barge] side of the family and your father's [James G. Barge, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not going to give my mother's full name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, can you give us her partial name?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: No, so you're not going to give us her name at all.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, what about her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't have the information.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So can we say that she's from Virginia too or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's from Virginia.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace her?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's side of the family, most of them lived in Maryland and they were very religious people, churchgoing folks.  And she had, she had a brother, brother and three sisters far as I know and that's--my mother and my father separated when I was about six years old so I don't have a lot of information.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, so you didn't grow up with your mother around?
Speaker 2: No, my [paternal] grandmother [Georgia Rhodes Barge] raised me.
Story_ID: 631110
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Well, it's the same as mine, he's a senior [James G. Barge, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't have my father's date of birth.  It was--I would have to say 1916 and I forgot his birth date.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 1916 would make him ten years old when you were born.  Was that--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, twenty years old exactly, 1906 [sic. 1905].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  In 1906 and was he born in Virginia, too or?
Speaker 2: No, he was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, they were all Barges and they--he was an only child of my grandmother [Georgia Rhodes Barge] and grandfather [Joseph Barge] and they migrated from Fayetteville, most of them, to Virginia and so we had, my grandfather had several brothers and, so for the most part they all lived in Virginia.  And Washington--Well, one lived in Washington, D.C. and the rest of them are scattered around in the Virginia, Washington, Maryland area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a reason or a story in the family as to why they migrated from Fayetteville to Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I guess they were looking for a better opportunity.  You know Fayetteville is right there in the--the biggest deal going in Fayetteville was the [U.S.] military, Fort Bragg [North Carolina] in that area and the--most of the people were--the jobs were in military jobs and et cetera and were in Norfolk [Virginia] and Newport News [Virginia] and the rest was Tidewater [Virginia].  The other jobs were up near Washington, D.C. working for the government.  So basically one of his brothers whose name was Garfield [ph.], lived in Washington with his wife and daughter and they all worked for the government.  And so the others are, you know, carpenters and et cetera and one of his brothers was a Korean [Korean War], [U.S.] Navy man, so everybody moved to where they could get a better lifestyle.
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's basically it.
Story_ID: 631111
Speaker 1: Now did your father [James G. Barge, Sr.] have any stories about the family that he heard when he was growing up about--were there any stories about slavery or Reconstruction or about, you know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, the slave- the slavery, you know, was of course in Fayetteville [North Carolina] it's still--they might still have the auction block in Fayetteville, downtown Fayetteville where they auctioned off slaves.  And every time he would go into that area, you know it burns a hole right in your soul when you see that kind of thing and even if you didn't know anything about slavery, you would see--surely be reminded of it because you would see that in Fayetteville.  And no, you--we used to sit around and talk, but, you know, funny thing being born in Virginia like that.  People just didn't sit around discussing racial situations basically because they knew what--everybody knew what they were up against and so what we were trying to do is figure out a way how we could improve our, our situation.  So the emphasis basically was on education and trying to improve your situation and trying to find a job.
Story_ID: 631112
Speaker 1: So what did your father [James G. Barge, Sr.] do when he was growing up, did he go to school and learn a trade or what?
Speaker 2: My father, he did odd jobs, all kinds of jobs.  Unfortunately for me, my father and everybody, we ended up in the middle of the worst depression [Great Depression] America's ever seen.  And the--he was driving a truck for a candy company or something and that was supposed to have been a pretty decent job and he just did odd jobs.  He ended up for a while, a long while becoming a janitor and he was janitoring for two buildings at one time downtown in Norfolk [Virginia].  And then after school I used to go down and help him out on the weekends sometimes, cleaning some of the offices and what not.  And around '40 [1940], around 1940 I think he got a job, or '41 [1941], just about the time the war, the Japs [Japanese] bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], I think he got a job in the, in the [U.S.] Navy shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, and the Norfolk Navy yard [Norfolk Naval Shipyard] was located in Portsmouth, Virginia and he got a job as a welder and they trained him.  He went through some training to become welder and then he became a welder for the Navy.  And that was the--one of the better jobs he had ever had, better paying jobs I might add, and he developed some skills.  And he picked up automobile mechanic on his own.  Although a lot of people didn't have automobiles before the war [World War II, WWII], he learned how to work on cars and then he would study manuals and that and so later he got a job in the naval air station as a aircraft mechanic.
Story_ID: 631113
Speaker 1: But in the meantime, during all of this, he [Barge's father, James G. Barge, Sr.] also played banjo and he changed over to guitar, and he played on the--during that time the guitar was just emerging as a viable instrument in popular music.  And he switched over to electric guitar.
Speaker 2: That, that's something that we don't think about that much.  But you're right, before I guess the rock and roll era, the guitar was a marginal instrument in popular music, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Sort of--I mean, 'cause the big band sound and stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.  One of the, one of the, one of the situations that made guitar noticeable and popular was when the Benny Goodman band hired Charlie Christian and he recorded a song called 'Solo Flight' on electric guitar.  And along with some other notables in the business and that just seemed to perk up the attention around the country for the solo, for the electric guitar.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's for the Benny Goodman band you said?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Now--
Speaker 1: Famous solo called 'Solo Flight.'
Story_ID: 631114
Speaker 1: Did your father [James G. Barge, Sr.] talk about how he met your mother [Esther Edward Barge]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he didn't talk--did he talk about her at all?
Speaker 2: He might have, but I didn't, I didn't, I didn't get it, you know.  I didn't get that, I didn't get the information.  I know my mother loved music and she loved to sing and I guess my father loving music, I thought they probably met because they had that one thing in common, music.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're assuming they met around music and you didn't--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because he never really told the story.
Speaker 2: No, but they--and he was playing guitar when I was young, when I was about four or five years old I can seem to recall him sitting around the house and, at nights and she would sing and he would play.  She would sing; he would play.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were around until you were about, I mean your mother was around until you were around how old?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Or how old were you when your mother left or?
Speaker 2: I told you about five, six, about six (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About five?
Speaker 2: --years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right after--she carried me to my first enrollment in school in the first grade [J.C Price Elementary School, Norfolk, Virginia].  She made sure that I got into school and she carried me to become--to get my vaccination--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --which was required by the State of Virginia at the time to get vaccinated before you could enroll in school.  And right after that she left.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you never heard from her again?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we talked, we talked--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --back and forth.  She would come back and do periodic visits, but not often.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She got really s- very ill.  She became diabetic, got very ill.
Story_ID: 631115
Speaker 1: So you were raised basically by your grandmother you said.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is your father's [James G. Barge, Sr.] mother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandmother and grandfather [Joseph Barge].
Speaker 1: This is your father's mother and father?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Your father's mother and father?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Georgia [Georgia Rhodes Barge].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Georgia Barge?  Okay, all right.  Tell us something about her, what was she like?
Speaker 2: She was a very strict person.  She was like--she was just a tough lady to live in an environment, live during that, through the Depression [Great Depression].  My grandfather was a butcher and they ran--in Fayetteville [North Carolina] they had a little, little butcher shop down there.  And she was the leader of the family, you know.  She had good, a great sense of morality, really tough and made us kind of have the kind of discipline we needed to get through those hard times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but she was living in Norfolk [Virginia] at the time--when you were being raised, right?  She was in--
Speaker 2: What happened was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before my mother [Esther Edward Barge] and father separated, I lived with them.  I was the oldest child.  So I was living with her anyway even though my mother and father were together, they let me live with them.
Speaker 1: This is in Fayetteville or in Norfolk?
Speaker 2: In Norfolk.
Speaker 1: In Norfolk.
Speaker 2: I knew nothing about Fayetteville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother didn't either.  She was, she was from Virginia, basically.  So the--I lived with my grandfather and grandmother even though my little--I had four bro- four brothers and they lived with my mother and father.
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers for us and--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Could you please name your brothers for us and give us their order, everybody's order of birth.
Speaker 2: Well, it was Arthur Leon Barge [Arthur Barge], my next oldest.  Next to him was Milton Joseph [Milton Barge], and next to him was Burrell E. Barge [sic. Berly Barge], and my baby brother, Wendell Phillip [Wendell Barge].
Story_ID: 631116
Speaker 1: When you think about their personalities, their talents, their dispositions, who do you think you took after the most?
Speaker 2: Who do I--my personality and et cetera?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well I got a combination of both my mother [Esther Edward Barge] and my father [James G. Barge, Sr.].  My father was a little more, more serious.  My mother had a great sense of humor and liked to tell jokes, and my father, he was kind of subtle in his approach, kind of quiet guy.  And he hung out with all the musicians 'cause he was a musician; they used to play music in bands and stuff.  And so he used to, he used to tell stories about their musical experiences and the job they played and stuff like that and how they played jobs in the white clubs and they had to play behind a partition in some of the clubs.  And they had some of the white strippers and they had to turn their backs and play behind with their backs to the audience and all kinds of crazy madness that dealt with racism in the nightclubs and what not.  And I just heard stories of my [paternal] grandmother [Georgia Rhodes Barge] used to do housework in order to put some money into the family budget there and if--we were raised on the Depression [Great Depression] times and if you can imagine when a pound of sugar was three cents and a loaf of bread was three cents and other things were six cents and I guess and if you--there weren't many cars, but if you drove a car a gallon of gas was nine or ten cents, sometimes eleven, twelve.  So the--we were oblivious to the, to the Depression, the kids and we, sometimes I don't think we realized we were as poor as we were because we were concentrating on trying to have some fun and trying to get ourselves educated.  But like most kids, you know, the parents had to really bear down on them 'cause we didn't--like a lot of the kids, six, seven and eight, nine years old, they don't, they don't realize even now the value of going to school, you know.  A lot of times you wake up in the morning and you don't want to go to school.  But parents bore down on us and made us go, you know, and so our neighborhood was a little place called Lindenwood in Norfolk, Virginia which had some of the more progressive and aggressive black people in the city, some of the more important black people in the city.  And from house to house, from neighborhood, from block to block, we had to really behave ourselves 'cause the neighbors wouldn't--would tell our parents, and we would be disciplined for poor behavior.  That's basically it.
Story_ID: 631117
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of the neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Yeah, of growing up period, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, see the thing of it is, Norfolk, Virginia is sitting right at the Atlantic Ocean.  And the city is almost like an island.  And the thing of it is you had to cross bridges and water everywhere you went; the Elizabeth River and its outlets.  If you went around to the other parts of the Tidewater area [Virginia], you would have the James River on the other side, the Newport News [Virginia] area, Potomac River, Hampton Roads [Virginia].  So everything was like seemingly influenced by the location, where we lived.  And the--the naval activity there played a big part in our lives and the sailors, the town was loaded down on the weekends with sailors and sailors--civilian and [U.S.] military sailors.  So basically that was going on and then you had the competition with schools and football and basketball and that was, that was a big thing in, for us, you know.  Down there with the schools in Newport News and Norfolk and Portsmouth [Virginia] and it was very important that we competed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Especially musically, the choirs and what not.  They're some of the great, historical musicians like Noah Ryder and people that, who were bouncing around over across the water at Hampton Institute which is now Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  And then there was influences from the colleges in the area, Hampton University, Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University], up in there, Petersburg [Virginia] and Norfolk State [Norfolk Unit, Virginia Union University; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] there.  And so the whole thing was--we didn't have any lot of big time factories there, mostly maritime business and military business.  That was basically it.
Story_ID: 631118
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: J.C. Price Elementary School in Norfolk [Virginia].
Speaker 1: It's Jesse?
Speaker 2: J.C., the initials J.--
Speaker 1: Okay, J.C. Price--
Speaker 2: --C. Price [Joseph C. Price] who was a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --an important historical black man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You have to look at the history up on him.
Speaker 1: Okay, J.C. Price school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Norfolk, okay.  And so you started the first grade at J.C. Price.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you like school when you started?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear) school.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now did you have, did you gravitate towards any particular subjects in school when you started off?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.  I just, you know, that's basically reading, writing and arithmetic, baby, it's--that's what the, I mean, order of the day.  I mean, reading, mathematics, mathematics and the--a little bit of geography.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your personality like in school?
Speaker 2: For what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: Mine?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was a very aggressive guy.  In fact, my mother [Esther Edward Barge] before she left named me Alec, Smart Alec because I always seemed to have the answer for everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your name was Alec, huh?
Story_ID: 631119
Speaker 1: Now you're, you're a pretty large person.  I guess you were tall for your age in those days, were you?  I mean were you tall?
Speaker 2: No, I was six, I wasn't, you know, I was just a normal size.  In fact I wasn't as big as some.  When I went out for the football team, I was considered a little undersized but some of the guys--we had pretty--some pretty burly guys on the (laughter)--in the Norfolk--Booker T. Washington High School was one of the more competitive high schools in the whole East Coast.  That band that--we started when I was in eighth grade, it went on to become one of the largest bands of--a band of almost two or three hundred pieces, you know, on the East Coast and we were in competition with the Norcom High School [I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia] band and the Huntington High School [Collis P. Huntington High School] band in Newport News [Virginia]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and up in Richmond [Virginia], you know, it's a lot of people who now became famous and went to Norcom like Ruth Brown she went to Norcom High School across the, across the river [Elizabeth River], and goes on and on, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey.  One of my neighbors was--eventually became the--her name was Teeny [ph.] and her real name was Carolyn Robinson Payton [Carolyn R. Payton], the first black woman to head the Peace Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First woman to head Peace Corps.
Speaker 1: You said Pearl Bailey was around there, too?
Speaker 2: She's from Newport News.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So yeah, I.C. Norcom High--
Speaker 2: I.C.
Speaker 1: I.C., yeah, I.C. Norcom--
Speaker 2: That's where Ruth Brown went.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, right, and then Booker T. Washington.
Speaker 2: That's Norfolk's [Virginia] high school.
Speaker 1: In Norfolk and then Huntington High School in Newport News?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And these three high schools competed for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and also Phenix--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --High School [George P. Phenix High School] in Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's right near the Hampton Institute campus [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, we were, we were--these were our competitors.
Story_ID: 631120
Speaker 1: We talked about this before the interview that a lot of people, when they hear about Norfolk [Virginia] or Portsmouth [Virginia] by themselves and they don't go there, they don't realize that this is a metropolitan area with a whole, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was really busy with--a lot of people live in that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they call it the Tidewater area [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: Because of the ocean tide swells and comes in twice a day in twenty-four hours.  And these, these neighborhoods embrace each other, Newport News [Virginia], Hampton [Virginia].  Now over on the peninsula side, and then Portsmouth, which is--they used to have a ferry that goes across the Elizabeth River from Norfolk, it takes five minutes on the ferry.  And that was the only way to get there unless you drove around south and come back around into Portsmouth.  And we used to ride the ferry.  In fact, they had a streetcar, a real streetcar that would go on the ferry and get off the ferry and then continue its route through Portsmouth.  It's, you know, they had these trolley, it's a trolley car.  And we would pull the trolley down once it gets on, and then when the trolley gets off the docks, put the trolleys back up and it continues down Broad Street in Portsmouth.  So it had--that was the transportation.  Now as time progressed, they built tunnels to all of these areas because we used to have the ride the ferry to Newport News.  Now they built a tunnel under Hampton Roads [Virginia], which is a huge waterway from the Atlantic leads inshore, and it's like a big bay, Hampton Roads, and they built the tunnel that goes under Hampton Roads to Newport News and it connects with route 64 [Interstate 64] and you can go on Route 64 from Norfolk all the way up to Washington, D.C., or Richmond [Virginia] anyway.  So then they built, and across twenty-six miles of water from Norfolk to Cape Charles [Virginia] on the other side of the peninsula, on the other side, east, the--that was one of the largest undertakings in America in terms of causeways crossing that span.  And at the mouth of Hampton Roads and the Atlantic Ocean join, meet, that's where it was built.  And so we used to ride that ferry and--that go across to Newport, to Hamp- to Cape Charles and that ride was an hour and forty-five minutes on a ferry.  So the, so the whole--we were influenced by the--it's like you know if you're in Seattle, Washington or somewhere like you live in a seaport like that or live on the coast and you had to deal with the waterways and, and getting across from one community to the next you had to cross water.
Story_ID: 631121
Speaker 1: What were the black communities like in the, in the Tidewater area [Virginia]?  I mean were they very developed, did you have businesses and theaters and--
Speaker 2: We had some very progressive blacks in Norfolk [Virginia], very, very progressive; some great professional people.  They knew what they were up against so they had to try to be better.  I told you about Carolyn Robinson [Carolyn R. Payton] becoming one of the--she was a Ph.D.; she taught at Harvard, I mean Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  She taught at Elizabeth City State Teachers College [Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina].  We had Dr. DeWitt Proctor [Samuel DeWitt Proctor] who became the president of A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], who mentored guys like Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and what not.  He lived in a section of Norfolk called Huntersville.  His--he had--his mother [Velma Hughes Proctor] and father [Herbert Proctor] raised about four or five boys, him as a--one of the leading educators and black educators in America today.  I mean, he's passed now.  His brother was my best friend; he became a surgeon, lived in Atlanta [Georgia].  He died too.  Another brother became a flyer in the--well, I think he joined--I don't know what--he was right there at the 99th Pursuit Squadron (unclear) where he became a pilot and a lieutenant.  And another brother became a [U.S] Army music director.  This was the Proctor family.
Story_ID: 631122
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were talking about the Proctors and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the Proctors were, lived in an adjacent neighborhood to me, a neighborhood called--I lived in a neighborhood called Lindenwood [Norfolk, Virginia] and they lived in the next neighborhood over called Huntersville [Norfolk, Virginia].  And so there were a lot of, a lot of prominent black people lived in Huntersville.  And I used to go over to the house and stop--when I stopped back coming from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia], we had to walk about four or five miles to high school anyway.  So I would stop by the house and talk and talk to their mother, Velma [Velma Hughes Proctor], and their daddy [Herbert Proctor] and the whole family.  And I got to know them pretty well.  But I had no idea--and his brother was all excited one day when we were in high school, telling me his brother had won a scholarship to a col- college called Crozer University [sic.], I had never heard of it.  And it didn't--it was like water on a duck's back, I didn't, didn't mean too much to me.  He was all excited.  "Man, my brother won a scholarship," and I got this book by Dr. Proctor [Samuel DeWitt Proctor], he was over--Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Jesse L. Jackson] had him over to PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] a few years ago and he was selling his book, he had a, he had a--and I bought it and I got it at home you know.
Speaker 1: Crozer Theological Seminary [Upland, Pennsylvania], right?  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, a scholarship.  He had to work his way through, though.
Speaker 1: I mean, so you didn't have an idea then how big that was and--
Speaker 2: No, but then I was--he was impressed so I got impressed, you know his brother was really--I knew the Proctors were really smart people.  And just like I tell you about Carolyn [Carolyn R. Payton] and then there was one of the high school teachers we had named Aline Black Hicks who kind of sued the school board [Norfolk Public Schools] for--to get equal pay.  The black teachers in Norfolk were making less money than the white teachers, like Granby [Granby High School, Norfolk, Virginia] and Maury High School [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia] and Norview High School [Norfolk, Virginia].  Those were the three white high schools, we had one black high school and one Catholic, St. Joseph [St. Joseph's School, Norfolk, Virginia] I think was--and, but that was parochial.  But the public school teachers in Virginia, in Norfolk [Virginia] anyway, were paid less money than the whites so she schooled- sued the board and that started some of the activists in that, in Norfolk to back her up and support her and she got fired.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But they had to equalize the pay as a result of her actions.
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I thought, I thought that was very significant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you remember Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] here in the City of Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, you know, his father was Lutrelle Palmer [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.], the principal of Huntington High School [Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia] in--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --over there.  And he was fired by the State of Virginia for the same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there was also, can't think of the guy's name, came from Virginia too.  He became--he became a spokesman and on air personality too, can't think of--dag, I can't think of his name.  I'll think of it soon enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there's two or three people here from Norfolk who, who had been raised in Norfolk, you know, and that.  But a lot of people went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Here in Chicago in addition to Lou Palmer, you are saying there are other--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --figures here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so yeah, but as I was saying, talking about some of the prominent black people in Virginia, you know, there were so many of them, you know, that were trying to shake this racist, racist kind of attitude and the racist cloud that hung over, hung over us in terms of--to the point where it's kind of ironical and Virginia ends up with one of the first black governors [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] (laughter) in the South and in the country for, you know, other then the governor of Massachusetts [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick].  And so we got a lot of people on the city council [Norfolk City Council] later when I was coming up.  Didn't have no black policemen, they eventually got a couple of black policemen, friends of ours and became cops.  Now the whole police force had two black cops, eventually they came.  Another guy named Drummond [ph.] became a sheriff of Warwick County [Virginia] in Newport News [Virginia] area and he, I think he went to West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  And this--And various sections and spots in our society we've had black people to kind of push and try to get the black people--the conditions for black people in Virginia upgraded to, to get out from under, under the thumbs of some of these racist people in Virginia.

Speaker 1: Now what kind of music were you hearing then and was--
Speaker 2: Well, I was raised in the jazz era.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And the jazz was the, you know, the thing you listened to.  You listened to the Lionel Hamptons and the, and the Duke Ellingtons, the Chick Webbs and Jimmie Lunceford and Buddy Johnson and those people.  And the, then later the great saxophonists within--my big influence for saxophone was Lester Young, that was my big influence.  But I must say that I did get a chance--my uncle introduced me one day to Fats Waller (laughter).  I got a chance to meet Fats.  I just shook hands with him and that was impressive.
Speaker 1: How did that happen now?  Where was it and what were the circumstances?
Speaker 2: Well, this was down in Norfolk [Virginia] where blacks couldn't stay at white hotels and so there was a hotel called the Plaza Hotel [Norfolk, Virginia] run by a lady named Bonnie McEachin, and it was on Church Street.  And Church Street was the main drag in--for black people in Norfolk.  And in fact I later named my band the Church Street Five.  So the--my uncle was--he used to write numbers.  And, so he would make his rounds down the bottom end of Church Street and he knew all the entertainers, he loved circuses and he--when I was a kid, he carried me to Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey [Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus], I'd never experienced that before.  He made sure that we went.  So it seemed like Fats was in town for a concert somewhere and he was staying at the Plaza.  My uncle was hanging out in front of the Plaza, so he said, "I'm going to carry you up on the block," and we went up and he--real fast and I shook hands with him, I was a kid.  That was impressive.
Story_ID: 631124
Speaker 1: So Ms. McEachin's [Bonnie McEachin] you know, she had a small hotel for the black entertainers?
Speaker 2: Called the Plaza, yeah.
Speaker 1: People (unclear)--okay.  All right, Plaza Hotel [Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now was there a black theater in the, in the area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was, there was the one called the Attucks [Attucks Theatre, Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: A-T-T-U-C-K-S, Attucks.
Speaker 1: Oh, named after Crispus Attucks.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: However you spell Attucks.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then there was another one called the Regal [Regal Theatre, Norfolk, Virginia].  And the Attucks was then later named the Booker T. Theater but now they've revived, they've rehabbed the Attucks Theatre here of late, last few years and in fact they had me and Gary Bonds [Gary U.S. Bonds] appear there last August as a re- reunion concert.  And a lot of the shows were held, live shows were held in the Attucks Theatre.  And, so the--they got what you call the Norfolk [Virginia] sound that occurred in the late '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] and they've given me and Gary credit for being a part of that movement of the Norfolk sound because we recorded, recorded the three and The Griffin Brothers and Margie Day and Jimmy Soul and Ruth [Ruth Brown]--and some other people, you know.  So the Attucks Theatre is now, recently last, I think it was last Friday, Clarence Clemons, the saxophonist with Bruce Springsteen, died and they had a memorial service for him last Friday in--not this past Friday, but Friday before last, and everybody, Gary and them were all down there at the Attucks Theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was from Norfolk too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Clarence Clemons.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, now was he influenced by you and other saxophone players that came ahead of him?
Speaker 2: They say I influenced him, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I knew I met Bruce.  Now Bruce seemed to think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  I'm sorry, I'm writing this stuff--I'm trying to write it down as fast as you tell me, but--now so did you get a chance to hear much live music when you were growing up?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Norfolk didn't have a lot of venues where you could go and hear live music, but I heard some.  And then, and then I knew some of the music.  My daddy [James G. Barge, Sr.], you know, knew a lot of the musicians so we would slip in to hear some of the band rehearsals, guys like Sam Harris and Clint Turner and those people.  Eventually I played with some of these guys that grew up--that were in bands with my dad.  I--when I came back from West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], I started playing with them guys, you know, Clint Turner, one of the more famous band leaders in Norfolk, and a lot of, lot of, lot of the good musicians played in that band.  And then I played with another one named Sammy Harris, played in his band.  And some of the guys that played with my dad played in those bands, so I played side by side with some of these musicians who had played with my father.
Story_ID: 631125
Speaker 1: From what I understand, you got your first instrument when you were in the eighth grade, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a cl- I used a school clarinet.
Speaker 1: Now tell the drum story first, though, before the--
Speaker 2: Well, my dad [James G. Barge, Sr.] had bought me I guess I was about thir- twelve or thirteen, had bought me a drum, snare drum.  I wanted a drum.  I wanted an instrument and he would never give me too much instruction on guitar because his guitar used to be in the living room behind the davenport and I would pick it up and try to strum, but I wasn't getting very far with that.  But I wanted a drum and so he bought me a snare drum, a really good snare drum.  And when I went over to try out for the band they had this notice we're going to have tryouts for the band, brand new band because there was no band--they had disbanded the band at Booker T. Washington High School [Norfolk, Virginia].  So this was going to be the Booker T. Washington High School, but they were starting with the junior high section of Booker T.  And I asked for a clarinet and got it, and that's where I started playing clarinet.  And, but I didn't get any individual instruction, I got group instruction, you know.  The band director, Mr., a guy named Mr. McPherson [ph.] was my band instructor and he started the band.  And Mr. McPherson was really a French teacher who was moonlighting--(laughter) he was just asked to start a band because he could play some instruments.  And, so that's when I went over to high school after that at about fifteen years old, I continued to play in the band but I wanted to play sports and I got on the football team.  So that kind of diminished my efforts to play clarinet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had to kind of choose which one, right because the band--
Speaker 2: Well, down south (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) the band was at the games too?
Speaker 2: Well, down south, you know, some of the high schools are really small.  And I recall during the halftime the guys on the football team would go (unclear) playing at one of the schools in Carolina, the football players would--instead of being in the, in the locker room listening to instructions, well, years--let me explain this.  There's a foot- two football teams in high school.  They didn't have any gyms or anything.  So when the halftime came, the coach would carry his team down on the way--one end of the field and the other coach carried them--and they would go over what's going to happen in the next half.  And that's what did happen.  But some of the guys came back up to the band and put on the sousaphone or the instruments with their football suit on and played the half, so, you know, like you got a high school of eight or nine hundred people in some of the high schools, you didn't have enough students to really be in, be in all of these activities, so you only had a few male students period.  So like some of the, some of the teams like basketball teams, I remember some of the guys only had ten players, you know.  So the--some of the players would be both on the football team and the band.  So if they needed them real bad, they would come in their football suits and come out during the half and play and then go back, play the game.  So that's what they were--that's the way it was in some--and Booker T. when I went there had a brand new gym, just built.  We hadn't even--we couldn't even spell gymnasium.  We never even heard of the word gymnasium and cafeteria either when I was a young kid.  We didn't even know--during that era no television, none of this kind of stuff, you know.  It was just a, a whole different scene compared to what the kids are going through now, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So this primarily during the '30s [1930s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 631126
Speaker 1: In high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia] you were--it was in the '40s [1940s], early '40s [1940s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, see, well I come under three president- I mean during that time, Calvin Coolidge [President John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.] was president when I was born and then the Depression [Great Depression] president, Herbert Hoover [President Herbert Clark Hoover] started in the, in the '30s [1930s].  And Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] come in at '33 [1933].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So basically, so in '33 [1933], let me see, I was seven years old.  And the Depression, the Depression was in high, at high speed (laughter) at that time, it was really going on, you know.  So President Roosevelt had to make a move to do something.  He started what you call the CCC camps [Civilian Conservation Corps] and all of these kinds of programs to try to get people in America working and getting them going and growing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were in high school, you were in high school and this is--you started high school what year?
Speaker 2: I think I started high school around, around '41 [1941], '42 [1942], '41 [1941] I think it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: About the time Japs [Japanese] bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii] I think--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So yeah, do you, do you remember hearing about that news in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was on my way to--I was supposed to go down and caddy on the base [Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that morning.  But there was--everything was cancelled, it was, it was something, you know, to hear that, you know.  I was going to, I was going to go down--it's just like a Sunday morning or something and I was going to go down and be a caddy that day and it was cancelled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--your family have a radio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a little--
Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a radio, Philco (laughter) (gestures).
Speaker 1: Okay.  You say most people had a radio then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you knew, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a radio.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Didn't have but about three stations (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: So it was a Philco shaped like a, like a--
Speaker 2: (Gesture) (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with a round top?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 631127
Speaker 1: So in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia] did you have--were there any special teachers or mentors that you had?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a guy named Mike Spellow [ph.], Mr. Fulton [ph.], one big, one lady that really, who was in junior high, Ms. Ashburn [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now what did she do for you?
Speaker 2: She was my eighth grade teacher and she introduced me to her husband who was a, who was a barber, owned a barbershop and also had a Sunday school orchestra and when I got in the band, she told me that my husband has a (unclear).  He runs the kindergarten, I mean the Sunday school band (unclear), over at First Baptist Church, one of the largest churches in Chica- black churches in Norfolk [Virginia].  So I went and met Mr. Ashburn [ph.] and he used to give me free haircuts if I played in the Sunday school band, so I used to go and play in the Sunday school band.  I, I didn't even go to that church.  I was going to a church called Mount Olive [Mount Olive Baptist Church, Norfolk, Virginia], so I went over there and played in that band and she, she was just a nice lady.  Good teacher.
Story_ID: 631128
Speaker 1: So you, you did con- keep playing the clarinet on some level even though you played football (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I wasn't very good, but I played.  Hey, I'd never seen a clarinet before and then Mr. Mc- McPherson [ph.], you know, got us all started.  But it started at--how I got to play saxophone was I had--I was in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia] and I had gotten out of the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now wait a minute let me--let--then let's take you to the military first and then we'll get you back to high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So how did you end up getting involved in the military, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was when I was, when I was a teenager in high school, we used to go, we used to go when I was a kid, we used to go around the neighborhoods, white neighborhoods about a mile away, quarter of a mile away, and try to go into the alleys and the back of the houses and find metal and scraps and wood and stuff because times were really tight.  And we'd find copper or whatever and take it to the--and lead and stuff and some of the guys used to melt it down, melt the metal down and we'd go to the junkyard and sell it.  So we stumbled upon a guy--can't think of his name, Mr. West [ph.] or something, who was making an airplane in a garage in his house.  And, so we went--so he saw us standing out there looking, so he invited us in, in the garage.  And the plane had no wings on it, just a fuselage was in the--so he was putting in the cables for the pedals for the rudders and the stabilizers and you had to put so much of a--so he'd put us in the cockpit and says, "Okay.  Now push this pedal, push this pedal."  Because he was working by himself.  And he was teaching us the names of all the parts of the plane.
Speaker 1: This is a white guy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think his name was Willoughby [ph.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that's when we got introduced to aviation.  So when he says, "Okay, when I finish this plane I want to give it a test flight," and we said, "Well, when you gon- Mr. Willoughby when are you going to put the wings--." "I can't put the wings on in here.  I'm going to move it and then we'll put the wings on."  And, so sure enough later, some months later, he finished that plane and just a spread with the outside of the plane was like canvas or some kind of material, it wasn't metal.  They spray it with what you call dope and it would harden up and tighten up.  And he flew it across our neighborhood and buzzed the neighborhood.  I was so impressed with the flying aspect of it that I wanted to be a pilot.  So when--so I began, during the war [World War II, WWII] I began to study the silhouettes of all the planes around the world and what the Japs [Japanese] were using, the Zero [Mitsubishi A6M Zero], the German (pronunciation) Luftwaffe, Luftwaffe planes, the (pronunciation) Fox Wolf 109 [Focke-Wulf Fw 109] and the Mr. Smith [Smith DSA-1 Miniplane] and the American planes, the P38s [Lockheed P-38 Lightning] and all of those planes.  So you would have to idenn- a pilot would have to identify just the silhouettes of the planes in order to pass the test and all of this stuff.  So we were--I was up on that and I--we had a teacher, a great, a great math teacher named Surelda James [ph.], she was my math teacher.  And I went to her and asked her, "Would you teach me a course in pre-flight math?"  She says, "You want to--." I said, "Yeah."  And her sister was teaching me French, and they also went to First Baptist [First Baptist Church, Norfolk, Virginia], so they saw me in the Sunday, high, in the Sunday school band.  So they kind of got to know me, aside from being my teachers.  So she did, she set up a course in pre-flight math.  Wasn't nobody in the class but me and another guy.  And so we took the class and to get me ready to take the entrance exams for the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Force; U.S. Air Force].
Speaker 1: So you were really serious.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You were really serious.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You knew exactly what you had to learn to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pass the test and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 631129
Speaker 1: So here I am seventeen years old, so I volunteered for the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Force; U.S. Air Force] 'cause I didn't want to go in the [U.S.] Navy (laughter).  So they accepted me at seventeen but I wasn't inducted until my eight- one month--eighteen and one month.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, well, did you get a chance to be a pilot?
Speaker 1: No.  What I did was they assembled us as cadets, a cadet class called flight 99 [99th Pursuit Squadron] in Biloxi, Mississippi and we took basic training.  And we took a series of tests, a battery of tests.  Ninety--I think it was six--flight 99, sixty-three black guys, youngsters, most of us teenagers.  Some of the smartest guys I'd ever run across, you know, from New York, from all over the place, youngsters.  Some of them more advanced than I was.  I was a little leery because I thought being from a segregated southern high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia], that my education was inferior.  But when I got among them I found out that that was, I was competitive with them.  And so--but what happened, what was happening was that this was three months after D-Day, June 6, 1944.  I went in in September 1944.  So the 99th had been flying from North Africa and flying over Italy, mostly to fight the German fighters and escort these bombers from North Africa.  And, so as the war was winding down, the 99th had already made, kind of made its mark and then they sent Chappie James [Daniel James, Jr.] who was the executive officer of B.O. Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] for the 99th, sent him back to America to start a bomber group.  I think it was 477 [477th Fighter Group], I don't exactly know the name of the group, but when he went to (unclear) field and carried--then they gave him the B-25s [North American B-25 Mitchell] and start training pilots out of there.  So they needed a crew, he needed crews.  He needed some radio operators, some gunners and some bombardiers and navigators.  So this class that I was in was assigned all of these various schools and I went to radio school.  It wouldn't--they washed us out as pilots, they wouldn't let us continue pilot training.  And it was so segregated because most of the black pilots trained in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And they wouldn't accept--we were- weren't going to be accepted at the other flight schools in Texas and other places where they were training pilots.  So we--I went to Rantoul, Illinois--Scott Air Base [Scott Air Force Base, Illinois] and the course length was six months.  So we had to learn to send and receive Morse code from transmitters in the airplane.  But the school, we never--we didn't fly, we just--we were in this school on the ground learning to send and receive Morse code and we learned how to encode messages and decode messages.  And we got the manuals and stuff and we had to be checked out by the military for--to be able to handle secret, top secret information.  So we had to--they checked our neighborhoods and our friends and interviewed them without us even knowing, you know, some of the, some of the government people like, almost like [U.S.] Secret Service kind of guys, you know.  At that time they didn't have a Secret Service, I don't know what they were calling them then.  But at any rate, and this is in 1945.  And then Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] died in '45 [1945], Truman [President Harry S. Truman] took over in '45 [1945], and later Truman ordered the bombing of Nagasaki [Japan] and Hiroshima [Japan] and the war [World War II, WWII] was for all practical purposes, was over.  Now we were going to--they were going to put these crews together and send Chappie and his squadron of B-25s to Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], but that didn't happen.
Story_ID: 631130
Speaker 1: So war [World War II, WWII] ended, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so in 1946, July the 4th, I was discharged.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So on July the 4th, 1946 I came home and right shortly after that my daddy [James G. Barge, Sr.] had a beat up saxophone that a navy, a British sailor from the British navy [Royal Navy] gave him.  And he was working, he was working in the naval yard [Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia] as a welder.  And this ship had been torpedoed off the coast of the Atlantic [Ocean] and we had a, we had a lot of naval action going on fif- twenty, thirty, forty, fifty miles, hundred miles off the shore of America during the war with British, with Nazi submarines, the U-boat, Nazi U-boats.  So they torpedoed this British ship but the ship didn't go down.  They sealed it off, keeping it from sinking and brought it, it limped into Norfolk [Virginia] for--which is a whole lot of dry dock and shipbuilding, ship repair action going on there.  And when they opened this section up and put it in dry dock, they started getting stuff out it and the sailor bought the saxophone out, water soaked and everything else and gave it to my daddy.  He gave it to me.  So I was hanging out with some musicians and this is man, they say, "Man, you get this" (laughter)--so they went to cleaning it up and buffing it up and some of the keys wouldn't open or close.  They bolted them down so I learned how to play on (unclear)--two or three of the keys bolted down.  And that's what I--that was my first saxophone.
Story_ID: 631131
Speaker 1: So when you come back from Norfolk [Virginia], you've got this saxophone now that was once waterlogged and you're starting to play it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's--yeah, well, one of my friends, a guy named Leroy Cafe [ph.], a saxophonist, took the saxophone and started working on it and cleaning it up and got it in playing shape so I could at least start playing on it.  And I enrolled in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia] that September because I wanted to go to college but I wanted to get back into the swing of going to school and getting back acclimated to sitting in a classroom.  And so I enrolled in high school for September but in the meantime, I would practice two or three hours at a time, my [paternal] grandmother [Georgia Rhodes Barge] would just let me sit there in the front room and just play and wouldn't interrupt me.  And then I started playing with some of the local little bands, some guys who were about in the same category as I was in terms of playing an instrument, they were just getting started good and playing good, and I played with them.  And then I began to play in a little better bands as time went down that--from when I graduated from high school in forty- in January of 1947, I just continued playing from that January all the way up until I left for college in August to go to West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  I really wanted to be an architect and so I tried to--I put in applications to some schools but I wanted to go to Penn State [Pennsylvania State College; Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania], I don't know why.  And they were, they didn't, they turned me down.  They wouldn't--they turned my application own.  And some of the guys were going to go to West Virginia and they were telling me about they were going to play football over there and they had scholar- one or two guys in school with me had scholarships and they were trying to influence me to go out for the team.  So I went to West Virginia, I got accepted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you try out for the team?
Speaker 2: I went down and talked to Coach Cardwell [Mark H. Cardwell] who was the coach and when I got in there and he looked at me and weighing about 165 pounds and said, "Can you crush a 300 pound tackle?"  He had two guys standing behind him, one was about 6'7", weighed about 275 pounds and the other one was a guy named Simon Coast [ph.] that weighed 315 pounds.  I went dead to the administration building and registered as a music major right away (laughter).
Story_ID: 631132
Speaker 1: West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  Now this is an exciting time 'cause a lot of people there that later become famous and you were telling me about them before we started.  So, so who were some of the people at West Virginia State when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the undergraduates was the mayor of, became the mayor of Cleveland [Ohio], Carl Stokes.  There was Earl Lloyd [HistoryMaker Earl Francis Lloyd] who became--who was a star on the basketball team and became the first NBA [National Basketball Association] black coach.
Speaker 1: Well, he became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Detroit Pistons.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he also was the first actual player to play in an NBA game.
Speaker 2: He was?
Speaker 1: He wasn't signed first, but he actually was on the floor first.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: Yeah, played--
Speaker 2: He was with the Detroit Pistons.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And his nickname?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: His nickname?
Speaker 2: We called Moonfixer 'cause he was so tall, you know.  And then there was Vincent Reed who became, who later became head of the Washington, D.C. school board [District of Columbia Public Schools].  Also on The Washington Post which is a prestigious paper on the East Coast.  He became a member of the board there.  Dr. T.J. Anderson [HistoryMaker T.J. Anderson] was a music composer who taught at Tufts University [Medford, Massachusetts] for a minute and various schools around the country.  He was--we called him Bee Bop 'cause he was a trumpet player during the bee bop era (laughter) in our college band.  We had several guys who became top surgeons, Beny Primm [HistoryMaker Dr. Beny J. Primm] out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  We had--oh, so many I can't even begin to name some of the people who came out of the mil- who had been in the [U.S.] military and one of the guys that came under me became one of Chicago's [Illinois]--helped start the military school [Chicago Military Academy at Bronzeville, Chicago, Illinois] over 35th [Street] and Calumet [Avenue] I think it was.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Frank Bacon [Frank Chandler Bacon, Jr.].  He was a--he became a general and he recently passed, about two or three years ago, but he was instrumental in, with the mayor to get that military school over here.
Speaker 1: The Bronzeville Academy we call it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Now that's recently when they set--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They set that up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --maybe about ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when they, when they set it up, he invited me to come over and make a tour of the school with him and go around and invited a couple of colonels who were in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] with him, our guys who were colonels.  Our--West Virginia State probably had--from the ROTC unit graduated about--anywhere from thirteen to fifteen of the eighteen generals came out of that ROTC unit who eventually went into the military and became high ranking officers.  That unit was a field artillery at the time when I was there.  So I played in the ROTC band because they used to bring them out on line for reveille and for review and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 631133
Speaker 1: But Whitehead, Colonel, Major Whitehead [John Whitehead] was one of the top pilots out of--he was, he was in the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron].
Speaker 2: The Tuskegee Airmen, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he graduated from there [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  My music teacher was a, was a flight instructor at West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] and his name was Mr. Grider [Joseph Grider] and he had taught some pilots way before I go there.  He might have taught, trained Whitehead, I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: G-R-I-D-E-R, Professor Grider.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know his first name.
Speaker 2: Okay and I know you mentioned that Major Whitehead's nickname from the Germans--
Speaker 1: The Germans named him Dr. Death (laughter) because his jaw--he was light brown skinned, he was about your complexion.  His jaws sunk way in like that and his head looked like a real skull.  When he put that flight cap on and them jaws--(laughter) his eyes back in his forehead, he looked like a skull (unclear).  I guess the Germans got a good look at him and they had this write up on him, they put it in some of the barracks around the country and PXs [post exchange] and recreational lounges cause the [U.S.] Navy--the [U.S.] Army used to put heroic deeds of guys up sometimes to boost morale.  It seemed like he had flown this escort mission and he was on his way back to base and he had, he had run out of ammunition and he saw this supply train down on the, down on the ground and so he flies down on the plane, takes out his sidearm, his pistol and tries to kill the pilot of this, the engineer on the train.  That's Whitehead for you (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's the same one--you said that he also came back to Norfolk [Virginia] and flew under the bridge?
Speaker 1: No he was coming back to campus--
Speaker 2: To campus, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) from like a homecoming day or something.  He flew the--I don't know whether he was at Wright Air Base [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio] or where he was stationed, it was close.  And he flew a plane back and flew down the Kanawha River under a bridge.  He got reported (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay. Now this is--it's interesting 'cause this is the eve of the opening of the movie 'Red Tails' in theaters around the country.  Today is January the 20th [2012] as we talk about this so people gone be watching this Steven Spielberg movie about the Tuskegee Airmen and we're talking about this again.  But that's a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: I wonder if Major Whitehead is going to be depicted in the movie.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And some of the other guys I knew too, pilots, Charlie Fox and a few others.  Also significant right now today Etta James passed, and I worked with her.
Story_ID: 631134
Speaker 1: So these, these are people--and you mentioned Jimmy Holley [James W. Holley III] who was--?
Speaker 2: Jimmy Holley?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a dentist.  He graduated from West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] and became a dentist and then he went back home to Portsmouth [Virginia] and became, later became mayor.  He might still be mayor as I speak.  And he was really something, he was a very extroverted guy, he was real crazy and he was--used to get on the floor during sports, during the basketball game and try to lead the student body in cheers and everything.  He was real--very enthus- enthusiastic student, you know.
Speaker 1: What kind of personality did Carl Stokes have when he was there?
Speaker 2: Carl (laughter), Carl was kind of laid back.  He was--you know the Cleveland [Ohio] group, the group of guys from Cleveland were really ultra hip guys you know, they kind of laid back and, you know, not too excited about nothing.  They were--they were right on this trend of everything--good students and--what sort of happened, they called me Wild Root on campus that was my name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So a lot of guys, if you mention [HistoryMaker] Gene Barge or James Barge, they wouldn't know who you said, but if you say Wild Root, the guy that play saxophone, they would know who I am.  And what happened was in Cleveland they had this, riots many years after I graduated and I was, I was working for Chess Records and I went back to Cleveland and in this club the [U.S.] military was out in the middle of this--the National Guard was out in the streets.  And I was in this club to get a drink or something, me and--I was with the--I was going to record The Blind Boys [The Blind Boys of Alabama] or somebody.  And there was Carl Stokes sitting there in the middle of the club with some of the military brass who had command of the National Guard to kind of quiet things down that night.  So I thought I heard (unclear) said, "Man, the mayor's in here."  I said, "Where?  Yeah."  So I went--I goes over and I say, "Hey, Mr. Mayor, you recognize me, you know who I am?"  He said, "Oh, yeah, I know who you are Wild Root" (laughter), just like that.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So and his brother, his brother Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes] was a congressman.  So he was a mayor and his brother Louis--I didn't know Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I saw him, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And their first cousin is Rick James, the--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Their first cousin is Rick James.  Did you know that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The guitarist and player?  No kidding.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what Louis told me, yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--it surprised me, so--you never know.  I didn't know they had any musicians in the family, so--
Speaker 2: Me either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, see he left West Virginia way be- you know about in the middle of his sophomore year or something and went--finished Western Reserve [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] I think it was, near Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you had a lively group of people at West Virginia State and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 631135
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers then that you had?
Speaker 2: Well, we had music teachers, Mr. Grider [Joseph Grider] I have to mention him.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We had--one of my, one of my big influences was Dr. Ed Lewis [Edward C. Lewis] and he went on to become the head of music at Tennessee State University [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And he taught a guy named Frank Greer.  And Frank Greer was one of the oldest students, he had been out in the world arranging and stuff and he came back to college at the same time--I was an older student, but--'cause I was a twenty year old freshman.  But he, Frank was maybe a year or two older than me.  But Frank Greer established the great marching bands at Tennessee State when Tennessee State turned their whole music program around and the bands were under Ed Lewis.  Ed Lewis brought Frank Greer in there and one of the great marching bands--cause you know the greatest marching band among blacks and a big influence even on a lot of whites was Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida A and M University, Tallahassee, Florida]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --at the time, FAMC what we called it.  And that--those were some of the greatest marching bands of the era.  And I think Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley] was in that band I think and so they were, they were--all the--all the colleges were getting their butts kicked at halftime by the Florida A and M bands, so they had to do something.  Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and all of those schools down south had to, had to kind of in order to compete, had to build up their instrumental music program.  So Frank Greer did the Tennessee State band, you know, and under Ed Lewis.  Ed Lewis was my instructor.  And then some of the other instructors there, Dr. Wallace [William J.L. Wallace] in chemistry; Mr. Hamblin [Adolph P. Hamblin], biology, great biologist; Mr. Kitchen [ph.], business; and they had a guy who escaped from--a Jewish guy who escaped from the Nazi concentration camp named Dr. Lanier [ph.].  He some kind of way got out through Asia, through Russia and escaped and our prexy- the president of our school was one of the great educators in the United States, was John W. Davis.  And he was a good friend of Mordecai Johnson--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --who was president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  These were two of the great black educators and, so people who--I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's a lot, that--those are a lot of great people.  I think either Judge Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] of Detroit [Michigan] the federal judge, or his brother [sic.] went to West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] too I believe--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --during that same era.  But that's a lot of--it's a fantastic group.  We interviewed a woman [HistoryMaker Della Hardman] who was the editor of the local paper [Vineyard Gazette] of Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] who was another graduate of West Virginia State.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah she passed away a couple of years ago, but.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She's about your same age, you know, but that's--it's really, really remarkable.
Story_ID: 631136
Speaker 1: So you, you graduated from West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] in 1950, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated in three years because I didn't have enough G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] to go four (laughter).  So went to summer school, summer school, summer school (laughter).  I graduated in the summer of--I--well, my class marched in June of 1950 and Eleanor Roosevelt spoke at the graduation.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.  Now this is a big deal and I think it probably marks a pivotal, a pivotal point in U.S. history when--I mean the G.I. Bill and how it was used by the black soldiers when they came back, right?  A lot of them went to school that wouldn't have had a chance to go.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the G.I. Bill was a blessing.  It was a great thing.  And, you know, a lot of the politicians; racist politicians called it welfare at the time.  And they didn't want the G.I. Bill extended it to the soldiers coming back.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: In fact, in fact it's a lot of the politicians didn't want social security under Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt].  And they gave him hell.  It squeaked through it in Congress.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--we're still fighting with that now.
Speaker 2: It's just--I mean the social security program was battled tooth and nail in the United States Congress.  I think it was in the '30s [1930s], and they didn't want it.  And, so as we look at the program now with some of the Republicans fighting the--some of the programs that we have, you know, that Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was trying to get through, the--it's kind of remin- reminiscent of what was going on when we were young.
Speaker 1: Now this is also a big deal that Eleanor Roosevelt speaks at graduation.
Speaker 2: Of course, she was the one that caused the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron] to be established.  She went to President Roosevelt to try to get him to yield and let these black pilots be trained, she and Mary McLeod Bethune.  And he just gave up and said, "Okay," but I think he just said, "I'll make a fool out of you.  I'll let them do it, they're going to fail, you know."  And--but it so happened they didn't fail, you know.  But she really stuck her neck out.  She stuck her neck out for Marian Anderson who they wouldn't let sing in Constitution Hall [DAR Constitution Hall, Washington, D.C.].  She had to sing out on the--Eleanor Roosevelt helped set up so she could sing out on the steps of Constitution Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Out in an area with one of the greatest voices of our time, Marian Anderson and they wouldn't let her--the Daughters of the American Revolution, DA--DAO--A. or whatever they were called.
Speaker 1: Yeah, DAR, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Fought tooth and nail to keep her from singing in Constitution Hall in a concert, so she sung on the steps.
Speaker 1: So you were, you were very aware of this at the time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Of course I was and music--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --and to love music like I did, you know.
Story_ID: 631137
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating [from West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], now di- you majored in music, right?  So when you were on your, on the edge of graduation, what did you see for yourself, what did you think you were going to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I wasn't going to teach, (laughter) I didn't want to teach.  But my major was public school music but I didn't want to teach.  And when I got out, I stayed around Huntington, West Virginia and worked for a guy named McClean [ph.], he had a club and a funeral home, so I worked with him from my graduation in August up until January I stayed in Huntington, West Virginia working in the club, worked in his club and kind of knocked about in Huntington, but finally I went home that January after New Year's.  Went home and there, then I started playing music.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and that was in '51 [1951].  Then I went to work for the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Worked three years as an electronic mechanic 'til '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.  From '51 [1951] to fifty--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --three [1953]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '53 [1953].  Got fired because of--not anything that I did but the Navy just had a big layoff.  They didn't have the budget, so they laid off five or six hundred people and I was one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any training as an electronic mechanic?  I mean did you--
Speaker 2: Well, when I went to radio school, I, you know, the--learned a little bit about the ins and outs of radio and stuff like that.  We had to learn some theory about it.  And then this job that what we were doing was we was working on what we call overhaul repair, O and R on the naval air stations.  And what we were doing was stripping the airplanes so they could be overhauled, so we had to take all the, all the electronics gear out of the planes.  That was my job.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I actually wasn't repairing anything, I was taking it, taking the gear out, you know, so--
Speaker 1: So you had to take it out carefully, right?  You couldn't--
Speaker 2: Well, we had to take it off the racks.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to take it off carefully so it would be intact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that they could send it to the lab and the lab guys would break it down and put it back together.  Break the gear down, the chassis and the wiring and the tubing and whatnot and then put it back together.
Story_ID: 631138
Speaker 1: Now you were playing your instrument all the time that you were working for the [U.S.] Navy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And to--at some point you started playing mostly rock and roll rather than jazz.
Speaker 2: I was playing what we call R and B.
Speaker 1: R and B.
Speaker 2: It wasn't--
Speaker 1: Rhythm and blues.
Speaker 2: It wasn't rock and roll at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Rhythm and blues, okay.
Speaker 2: They say R and B had a baby and up popped rock and roll, that was the expression (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: They call it race music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's what Eddie Murphy called it, white's race music.
Speaker 1: At that time you couldn't hear it on the radio, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they started having a few radio stations and they started playing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when Fats Domino and Charles Brown and Amos Milburn and Sonny Til and The Orioles and that's when all, that's when all the doo wop groups started to emerge.  They called them bird groups 'cause a lot of them when they end up--Orioles and this--we started naming them well, you know.  And then one of the great groups of all time, The Five Keys--a lot of people don't know about them, came from Newport News, Virginia.  And my group was the--I got the sign--when I got the record out in 1955, 'Country,' I signed with Shaw Agency [Shaw Artists Corporation, New York, New York] and Shaw Agency had all the big names in R and B.  And they assigned me to the, to the, to the doo wop group what did I say they were--The Turbans.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: That's the group I toured with mostly.
Speaker 1: All right.  So this is 19--and you were saying that you all sometimes played ahead of Ray Charles and--?
Speaker 2: Well, we had, we had a couple of dates we played when Ray Charles was on the date.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I played--actually I played on the concert with Gary Barnes [ph.] and Ray Charles was on the show.  This was a big concert put together by a promoter on the East Coast and they had all the big names on it.  There was [HistoryMaker] B. B. King; Sam Cooke; everybody was on the show, Ray Charles was on the show; Mickey and Sylvia.  So Ray Charles was on that show with us.
Story_ID: 631139
Speaker 1: Now what, what was the first record that you appeared on?
Speaker 2: The first record I appeared on was with The Griffin Brothers, and I can't remember the title of the tune, but we recorded in Washington, D.C. in a studio.  We only recorded about three songs with him.  And I appeared--I played on that session with The Griffin Brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was around fifty- '53 [1953], somewhere up in that area of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what I have here is that it was on the Dot [Dot Records] label?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on Dot.
Speaker 1: On Dot, okay.  Okay.  And, okay, so you--so at the time it says here that they just needed a sax player because the regular sax player at--wasn't available?
Speaker 2: Yeah they had a guy, sax player named Virgil Wilson.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he couldn't make it, so they got me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now how did you meet Gary U.S. Bonds?
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing he lived in my neighborhood (laughter).  And he used to be in the neighborhood as a little kid.  And mother used to bring him to the store; I used to see him down there with his mother [Irene Bonds] at the store.  But what happened was I had done a recording in New York with Chuck Willis, a guy came and got in my house and heard about me and came and said Chuck Willis needed a saxophone player, this was around '56 [1956], '57 [1957].  And around '56 [1956], and he came and found me and said Chuck--so I didn't have a job and I just went over to Newport News [Virginia] and joined the band and went to New York with Chuck Willis and we made a demo, 'C.C. Rider' and then later Atlantic Records got, brought me into New York and I did the session, I played the solo on this segment, it became a big hit, 'C.C. Rider,' Chuck Willis.
Speaker 1: Right, I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I played the solo on it and then they brought me back and I played 'Dupree Blues' later.  And so after that, things kind of quieted down for me and then Guida [Frank Guida], this guy that owned Legrand Records where U.S. Bonds was the maj- major artist for him, offered me a chance to record so I went with him.  And then Gary was on that label and that's when I met Gary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I may have jumped ahead too far, but we'll get back to it, but your first recording that you--
Speaker 2: My first, yeah, my first recording was around fifty- 1955.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And I sent a, sent a--sent this record in, this tape into Chess Records and they liked it and put it out, a thing called 'Country.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  This an instrumental, instrumental?
Speaker 2: Instrumental.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did it do pretty good?
Speaker 2: It went to number one hundred on the national charts, but what killed it was 'Honky Tonk.'  So that instrumental, that instrumental grabbed all the attention of all the instrumentals that came out during that little period, during that year.
Speaker 1: Now that's Bill Doggett.
Speaker 2: Bill Doggett.
Speaker 1: So, okay, 'Honky Tonk' and that was the biggest instrumental that year.
Story_ID: 631140
Speaker 1: Now, okay so we go down to Gary U.S. Bonds.  Now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so when I, so Chess [Chess Records] put out another record, a song on me called 'Way Back Home' [sic. 'Way Down Home'].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And a few months later, then after that they didn't renew my contract with Checker Records.
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute now, 'Way Back Home,' is it anything like the one that Junior Walker did--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --did later?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wilton Felder--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and The Crusaders [The Jazz Crusaders; The Crusaders], that's 'Way Back Home.'
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I use that as a theme song now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's--But no, it wasn't nowhere--and, so anyway after that they kind of--Guida [Frank Guida] got me in the--around '59 [1959] or '60 [1960] and I recorded a thing called 'A Night With Daddy G.'  Gary heard it, 'cause he had a hit out called 'New Orleans.'  And he was on the road and he came back off the road, he says, "Man, I heard the song and I put words to it."  And in the meantime he couldn't follow up 'New Orleans' because they had tried to put some other records out and they couldn't match 'New Orleans' in terms of popularity.  So we influenced Guida to record this song for him, with him as the artist and it turned out to be num- number one in the country in 1961.
Speaker 1: This is 'Quarter to Three,' right?
Speaker 2: 'Quarter to Three.'
Speaker 1: Now the Daddy G, was that you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're the Daddy G referred in, to in the song (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what happened was--here's what happened.  He called--he brought me in to try to record something, so I recorded a song called 'Autumn Leaves,' this was a popular song at the time, I did that as a vocal.  And I recorded 'A Night With Daddy G.'  Well, they wanted to emulate this--Bishop Grace [Marcelino Manuel da Graca; Charles Manuel "Sweet Daddy" Grace] was a evangelistic preacher at one of the churches and in that church [United House of Prayer for All People], they had a tremendous rock band, gospel rock band.  Some of The Griffin Brothers used to play in that band, the drummer Nabs Shields [Emmett Shields] played in that band who eventually became my drummer on the recordings.  And so we tried to, tried to sort of emulate how that band would rock in the church and I called it 'A Night With Daddy G.'  And--
Speaker 1: So the song 'Quarter to Three' actually sounds similar to what--
Speaker 2: It was the same song.
Speaker 1: --Daddy Grace and them were doing in church?
Speaker 2: Well it's what--it's what I was trying to do with my version of it.  Now when we recorded 'Quarter to Three,' they recorded the same song like--okay with different musicians and then putting words to it and it kind of got away from the Daddy G thing, but that was basically it.
Story_ID: 631141
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you to do something that you might think is strange, but can you, can you hum some of 'Quarter to Three'?  Or can you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Whenever you're ready.
Speaker 1: Go ahead, right ahead.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Go right ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Quarter to Three.'  Well, Gary [Gary U.S. Bonds] came to me and I say, "Gary, what are you talking about?"  He said, "Well, I wrote words to your song."  I said, "Okay, sing it."  And he said, (singing) (snaps) "Don't you know that I dance, I dance 'til a quarter to three, when I had that night with Daddy G.  Everybody was a happy as a they could be, hummin' with a Daddy G."  You know, and all (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, it had a, it had a nice beat, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They rocked it, they rocked it.  So that's the origin of that and I, you know, that's amazing.  It had something to do with Daddy Grace [Marcelino Manuel da Graca; Charles Manuel "Sweet Daddy" Grace] who was one of the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --like Daddy Grace was similar to--
Speaker 2: That was a great band.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The shout band, they called it shout band--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in the church [United House of Prayer for All People].  And in the church they had--people were shouting, it would hurt, kind of hurt--so he built us, in the church in Norfolk [Virginia] he built--he had churches in Newport News [Virginia], one in Norfolk and one up north somewhere in there, Baltimore [Maryland] or somewhere a little further.  And he was living in like, somewhere like Puerto Rico and somewhere and he would come up once a year or twice a year and make his tour of all his churches.  But in this church he had a sawdust pit where people could go and shout.  He had a shout choir and a shout band.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting.  He was similar, correct me if I'm wrong, similar to Father Divine [Reverend M.J. Divine].
Speaker 2: Yeah, similar to--both of them were flourishing at that time too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: 'Cause Father Divine, guys were going to church and say, "Peace, Father," and he would give them a meal, you know.  And a lot of the musicians in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] would go into Father Divine's place in Philadelphia and get meals.  Guys like Stan Getz and all of, some of the jazz guys who were kind of down on their luck could go in there (laughter), they either go in there, you know.  My brother was getting a master's from Penn University [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he would go in there too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had a brother that went to Penn?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: So you had--one of your brothers went to Penn, huh?
Speaker 2: He got a master's from Penn (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's--
Speaker 2: He graduated from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's significant.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, not everybody gets a chance to go to Penn.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, anyway, so Father Divine, Daddy Grace and I remember--there's a famous picture of Daddy Grace with a crook and a sheep, you ever seen that one with him dressed as a shepherd?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of The Griffin Brothers [Buddy Griffin] used to be a show performer whenever he came into town.  He was a--he was, he eventually became blind you know, but he--when he was young he used to--he went to Booker T. [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia] and then he was a member of Bishop Grace's church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he--as a blind guy, he played the piano and he flourished as a blind person though, later because he was like the brains behind the band, him and his brother [Jimmy Griffin] played the trombone, Bay-bay.

Speaker 1: I forgot to mention that I had three sisters by, or half sisters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and one of them (coughs)--two of them are math majors and one was a pharmacist.  And the oldest sister, Faye [Sandra Barge Tolliver], went to work in the space program as a mathematician and then later she got tired of traveling and married (clears throat), and so she went--so they transferred her into the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] and she worked for the Joint Chiefs [Joint Chiefs of Staff] as a, as a, you know, in the administrative division of the--of [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: Her name was--?
Speaker 1: Faye.
Speaker 2: Faye.
Speaker 1: Faye Tolliver, her name was Faye Barge Tolliver.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so she, you know, other sister Celestine Barge [Celestine Barge Bailey], she was, she was a pharmacist in Petersburg [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Virginia.
Speaker 1: My baby sister lives in Florida.  But all of them, all three--two of them went to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and Celestine went to the pharmaceutical college in Philadelphia [Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science; University of the Sciences in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], one of the famous pharmaceutical--

Speaker 1: Do you remember when the young students, black students, integrated Norview High School in some--and the white high schools in Norfolk [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I--you know, the memory is faint, but I remember some of the first students to get (unclear), you know what I'm saying.  And the--even though they admitted students into Norview, they still hadn't fully integrated the Norfolk system [Norfolk Public Schools].  And I remember we were talking about the young man who became a--on the football team.
Speaker 1: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Andrew Heidelberg.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I was, I was around Norfolk, in and out of Norfolk or doing something at the time.  I remember him I mean, upsetting everybody when he ran for that touchdown in that game (laughter).  They put him in and he just took off, man.  They thought it was an accident, so he did it again.  They gave him the ball again and he--so yeah I remember that.  But what--you know, and after that, after I left, I left Norfolk in '63 [1963], '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: But a little before I left there, this was--he was in--he went over to Norview way before that.  But when I--the system hadn't fully integrated so some of the students left high school during the '60s [1960s] and marched downtown to the school board and just stood there.  They didn't say nothing, didn't raise no sand, just stood.  And that was the first--that was one of the--what made an impression on the school board or somebody at that time 'cause they--after that they began to integrate, fully integrate the schools.  And have students to go to Murray [Matthew Fontaine Murray, Norfolk, Virginia] and Granby [Granby High School, Norfolk, Virginia] and, you know.
Story_ID: 631144
Speaker 1: Now here you have this number one hit in the nation, a 'Quarter to Three,' based on a song that you wrote.  I mean, with lyrics by Gary U.S. Bonds, did you make a lot of money?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did not.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, the guy paid me a royalty on the song.  Gary was the artist, so I didn't get paid as an artist.  I just got paid as a songwriter.  Songwriting at the time the statutory rate for writing a song for publishing, the whole pie was only about two cents, or two cents on the dollar, you know what I'm saying, 2 percent.  So when you split that up, I mean between the publisher and the writers, what happened was when I--the guy that owned the record company [Legrand Records] really took us for a ride, me and Gary both.  He just cheated us out of the--our money.  I would dare say that the--that company owes me money now, maybe almost a million dollars, maybe if I would sue them.  And the Guida, Frank Guida who owned the company, died, but he was a scoundrel in terms of what he did to Gary and I.  So--but, you know, it was happening all over the country with black artists in the record business.  The record business was relatively new and the structure of it wasn't known to a lot of the artists at the time.  We are sort of the pioneers for a lot of the black artists who are now rappers and what not, for getting to know the business because when we got suckered into the business and we had no choice but to go along with these guys or else we wouldn't have recorded anything at all.  We began to try to teach the younger people the structure and the business part of the business.  So that's what we've been doing.  Guys called me from all- everywhere to ask me about the business, you know.  Well, I know Etta James was bitter because she felt like the company, Chess Records had robbed her of her royalties to some degree.  Bo Diddley was bitter because he felt the same way.  And it goes on and on and on.  And Ray Charles was one of the guys who when he went over to Tangerine Records, established his own label and his own publishing and was able to maintain the rights to the stuff that he had written later in his career.  I mean, nothing later, but right in the--I mean, he was getting ready to peak.  He gained control of his work, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: So that's the--that's part of the movie 'Ray' that's actually true.  He actually got control of his own--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he got control of it.  And Stevie Wonder too to some degree.  But see Stevie Wonder was writing for the Motown publishing company [Motown Records].  And he--but he managed to, when he got away from there, he managed to get control of some of his music.
Speaker 1: So songwriting gets two cents on a dollar in a age when a 45 record [45 rpm record] only cost, costs less than fifty cents.  And then there's no accountability on the accounting.  I can see where--
Speaker 2: No, you don't know, you have no way of knowing what's going on in the administration of the record company.  These accountants can say we only sold 40,000 on your statement, when they could have sold 150,000.  So that was the point.  It was the account that they paid you on.  And you had no way of proving that.  If you got a lawyer and all of this, it would probably cost you more money than you would get if you actually won the suit.  So a lot of guys refused to sue.
Speaker 1: There was a, there was a piece on public radio, I was interviewing [HistoryMaker] Carl Davis a few years ago and there's a piece on public radio just I interviewed him and they said that any recording artist now that sues a record company, any record company in the United States, will probably win.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they'll probably win now.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But I might, I might put in a suit later, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But what--but I remember--'cause I played over there with Carl, I played a lot of sessions over there [Brunswick Records].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I played on the Chi-Lites, [HistoryMaker] Tyrone Davis.  I might have played, I did, I played, I don't know--I know I played on a couple of Jackie Wilson dates and--for them, you know.  But the people that ran that company got put in jail.  Nat Tarnopol and one of their, one of his assistants.
Speaker 1: What's the name of that one, that was--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was the one that Carl was associated with?
Speaker 2: Nat Tarnopol.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: He owned the company.  And the other big executive there was Nat To- Nat Tarnopol's partner and assistant, they got put in jail not for robbing anybody, but basically for using payola--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to promote the records; paying off disc jockeys and whatnot.
Story_ID: 631145
Speaker 1: Now you started at Chess Records in 1964, they brought you over as a producer, arranger and you are a sax player.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964], okay.  So who were some of the artists you worked with?
Speaker 2: Well, when I, when I landed at Chess and went to work, I landed on a Saturday, walked out of the classroom in East Suffolk High School [Suffolk, Virginia] in June of '64 [1964], got on the plane, landed in Chicago [Illinois] that Saturday and went to work for Chess Monday.  Around that Monday in rolls a guy named Oliver Sain from St. Louis [Missouri] and he had a keyboard player named Fontella Bass and they--and another singer named Bobby McClure.  And they began to record and Oliver sang.  So they decided when they heard Fontella singing, they decided to make--say, "Wait a minute," and had her sing this song "Soul of a Man" and that's what I soloed and played stuff behind her.  And they made her an artist because they took her from Oliver and signed her on a special contract, and then they brought her back and she recorded "Rescue Me" and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, most, I think most people that have heard the song "Rescue Me," and I heard it when I was a teenager, I was fourteen when it came out, people assumed that Fontella Bass was just a singer 'cause she was fine, I remember her song in concerts she came out and sang that song.  But then many years later I was surprised to find out she's a dynamite keyboard player.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: That's how she got there to start with.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She was playing keyboard for Oliver.  And then she went out on the road, Fontella and Bobby McClure, they sung this duet and "You Gonna Mess up a Good Thing" [sic. "Don't Mess up a Good Thing"].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then I wrote a song called "Miss You When I'm Gone" [sic. "You'll Miss Me When I'm Gone"] for Bobby, Fontella and Bobby, you know.  So she went out as a single soloist and then she went out with Bobby.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so you worked a lot with Fontella Bass, Bobby McClure, who else?
Speaker 2: Well, I did a Little Milton, did a lot of Little Milton and I was writer on one of his biggest hits called "We're Gonna Make It," and so a writer on there with three other guys.  And then 'Little Milton Sings Big Blues,' I was the producer of that album and then later on I was an arranger for several of his, two- three of his albums.  'Grits Ain't Groceries' album was one of them.  And so then I also--Charles Stepney and I got together on Muddy Waters' 'Electric Mud' album, and then the Howlin' Wolf electric album ['The Howlin' Wolf Album'].  And before that I had done the album on Buddy Guy, 'I Left My Blues in San Francisco.'  And before that I did solo on "Wang Dang Doodle" with Koko Taylor.
Speaker 1: Now that's a Willie Dixon song, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: That's a Willie Dixon song.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think he wrote that.
Speaker 2: Willie wrote it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But I was probably, you know, at the time during the, during the '60s [1960s], I was probably one of the most recorded saxophone soloists in the business.  I was so--I did the solo on the--Chuck Willis, "C.C. Rider."  I did solo on The Dells' "Oh, What a Night," "Wang Dang Doodle," Little Milton's "We're Gonna Make It" and goes on and on and on, soloist on some of the, you know, top artists around the country.  And, so I was also doing at the time gospel music too for Chess Records while we were doing the R and B [rhythm and blues] with Fontella and Billy (unclear), you know, involved with the Billy Stewart sessions too.
Speaker 1: Billy Stewart with a distinctive role, yeah (rolls tongue).
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: He became big when he did that "Summertime."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then, and Billy Stewart was a friend of mine.  I was, you know, during 1950s when Bo Diddley came out with his big hit, Bo Diddley, he was on Chess Records as well and, so I got to know Bo 'cause Bo did some shows where I was--Bo's band and my band were on the same shows so I got to know him and this guy that played the maracas with him, Jerome (gestures) Richardson and Bo Diddley and Billy Stewart played piano and a guy named Frank Kirkland played drums for Bo and, so we all got to be pretty good friends.  So when I got to Chess, Bo was surprised to see me over there and he was glad to see me and we became, me and Bo were pretty good friends, you know.  So I never did play on any of Bo's--maybe, maybe one Bo session or something, I don't know.  But then I did, you know, did a lot of blues with Muddy and Milton and some other guys, you know.  So Etta James, did quite a bit with Etta.  This was after "At Last".  I mean, this came after she had had the big hit and which she--I would be with (unclear) shows with her and we did "Tell Mama".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I recorded her by myself on the thing like "Tell It Like It Is," that single.  And then I did a couple of albums with--I was arranger, Ralph Bass was the producer.
Story_ID: 631146
Speaker 1: Now today, Etta James passed today.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I knew she was very ill.  You know, I knew that.  She--it seemed like to me all of her troubles started when she started losing all that weight and it seemed like she just, you know, she just got a whole litany of troubles.  I think she eventually had cancer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was--I remember she was greatly agitated about the release of the movie about Chess Records.  The one--what they call that, it wasn't called Chess Records, it was called something else.
Speaker 2: 'Cadillac.'
Speaker 1: 'Cadillac Records,' right.
Speaker 2: Well, it seemed that the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times]--
Speaker 1: It starred, yeah, it starred Beyonce [Beyonce Knowles], right?
Speaker 2: Well, the Sun-Times called me--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --about--in fact before the record was cut, the guy--I had been, I had been in about six or seven movies, okay.  So the guy that I did most of the movies for his name was Andy Davis [Andrew Davis].  He called me and says, "You know, they're getting ready to do this movie."  And we were trying to do a movie, I was hired as a consultant to help guys with a script for a movie about Chess Records prior to this.  And, so the guy's name was John Davis and he was trying to get money to produce this story on Chess, so he had a couple of guys to write stories, write a script.  And so he pitched it to several of the companies and it looked like he had a deal and the deal fell through; so, now up pops this idea, a germ out there about doing this thing with Beyonce and some other people.  So I'm told that a guy named Levi [Robert S. Levi] and who was a producer who had done the, one of the series for the six hours of recorded music series, who was this, anyway he did--
Speaker 1: Oh, the jazz, you mean the jazz documentary ['Duke Ellington: Reminiscing in Tempo']?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a doc, and he had, we had, we had Chuck D on there, we had Upchurch [Phil Upchurch].  I put together some of the guys, I got my daughter to help me to put together some of the old Chess staff and they did a series, one hour series, you know.  And I don't know if it was Spielberg [Steven Spielberg], no, no it wasn't Spielberg, it was the big producer out of New York, can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: The one that does the gangster movies, wasn't it--let me see, wait a minute.
Speaker 2: I know what you called him, one of the guys helped put up the money, Gates' [Bill Gates] partner, West Coast.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Steve Jobs?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Steve Jobs?
Speaker 2: No, not Jobs [Steve Jobs] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: It wasn't Jobs, it was the guy that dragged Gates out of college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] early and he left the company [Microsoft Corporation] and went on, retired like, but--
Speaker 1: I think you're talking about Martin Scorsese, right?  Was it Scorsese?
Speaker 2: No, Scorsese was the one that was in charge of the prod- all of the productions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But this other guy was Gates' partner.  He lived in the Seattle [Washington] area.  And he was the one that kind of preserved some of Hendrix [Jimi Hendrix] memorabilia.  I'll think of his name.
Story_ID: 631147
Speaker 1: But at any rate, these guys, the--what happened was they told the production people to call some of the guys for a consultant on this movie they were going to do about Chess Records, but nobody ever never called me.  So when they put the movie together, the Sun-Times called me to go down and look at it on the preview, sneak preview and I went down and looked at it but the movie had a lot of fiction in it; didn't have some of the true things.  They had Leonard Chess going with Etta James, that wasn't true.  And 'cause I was around part of that time, I knew about that.  And, so it was entertaining, but a lot of it wasn't factual.  And what really kind of hurt me a little bit was I don't think that they should have--I think they should have called Etta James in and used her as like a consultant or just sort of talked to her.  They took her song 'At Last' and Beyonce sung it, and then after that she was invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.] during the President Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] inaugural in 2008 I think it was, and she got all of the accolades and glory and Etta James was left with nothing.  And she was the artist who made the song.  So I just felt that--and Etta was hurt and she made some inflamed statements that people held against her for saying what she said.  But I can, I can understand how she felt because she was totally left, you know, left out of, out of all of the hoopla and advertising and image building and stuff like that, she was left out of it.  And I think that--I think people should kind of recognize that people don't know what she went through as a, as a youngster in this business, you know.  And so that part of it just, you know, don't get me wrong, I like what Beyonce has done in the business and I like what she is, but I don't like what she did in that parti-  She could have done something because she was part pro- producer, I mean she was in the production team.  Producers help raise the money in movies, they don't do what they do in the record business.  It's a whole different role for producers in the record business producing movies.  So anyway--
Speaker 2: So she could have reached out and (unclear) in some way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she could have reached out and said, "Come on, baby, sit down with us.  You don't have to--can't get on screen but help us out.  Give us some pointers."  We've done, you know some of the movies that I was in with Andy Davis, they reached out to some of the cops and had them come in and be advisers and consultants and look at the, look at what we were doing and say no, don't do that, do this, do this, that.  This is the--cops do this, this is what cops do and blah, blah, blah.  So basically you know they use them as consultant.
Story_ID: 631148
Speaker 1: Now what was Etta James like?  What was your--
Speaker 2: She, well I think Etta James really missed her calling.  I think she should have been an actress because she--first of all, she was extremely funny.  I mean she was a riot.  She would have you laughing.  She could impersonate so many different people, different singers.  She could sing just like Ray Charles if she wanted to.  She just had that talent.  She was witty, very fast and, but I think what set her back was she just didn't have the education, you know, when she was coming up because she came practically out of the streets.  And she was a teenager when she got into the business and I think Johnny Otis helped get her in it, you know.  And her mother [Dorothy Leatherwood Hawkins] didn't, didn't--was a youngster and didn't have the kind of parental--give her the parental guidance that she needed like she needed it.  And I met her mother too, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And by this time, Etta had been in a lot of trouble with drugs and all kinds of stuff, you know.  A lot of people thrust into this business, especially girls, are thrust into show business with no parental guidance and nobody to talk, whisper in their ear and tell them, "Don't do this and don't do that."  And they just get into trouble.
Speaker 1: Now was there any truth to the story in the movie about the white guy being her father?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--they say Minnesota Fats [Rudolf Wanderone] was her daddy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Minnesota Fats.
Speaker 2: But I think Alan Hale [Alan Hale, Jr.] was really her daddy.
Speaker 1: Alan Hale (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The guy in 'Gilligan's Island.'  I really believed, I don't know but I really believe that he was her father.
Speaker 1: Why do you believe that?
Speaker 2: Because she looked more like him, she talked more like him, she's got more of his ways.  And I think her mother was fooling around with him anyway, I'm not sure, you know.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Minnesota Fats, that's right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's exactly right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: That's who they said it was, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's who they say was her father.
Story_ID: 631149
Speaker 1: So what about some of the other people too, there are so many people that you worked with.  Are there any stories about some of the other people you worked with, Fontella Bass or--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you know, see during that era, you know so much was going on.  It's very difficult to just pinpoint like, you know, you were talking, you said you were talking and you told me you were talking to Cash McCall, and Cash McCall was talking about Upchurch [Phil Upchurch] walks in the studio with a snake.  He really did.  He had this, little baby boas, constrictors.  And then he went out to the pet shop and bought mice to feed them cause they, you know, they internalized these mice and then the boas would then--go into a state of sleep like to digest these animals that they would swallow whole, you know.  So he had this little box.  We was recording in the studio.  He was working mostly with the guy, a producer named Charles Stepney, arranger, and he would bring this stuff in, bring these animals in and he was showing me the little small mice that he was going to feed them, you know.  And he had them sitting on--out in the hallway or somewhere and bring them in, that's Upchurch for you, you know (laughter).  So that's true, what Cash was telling you was really true.  And it goes--the stories go on and on and on and on.  Billy Stewart had a terrible temper, had two conditions.  Real--everything was funny to him, he just laughed and laughed and then the other side he'd go into this rage where he was like scary, you know.  Start cursing and he would swing on guys and what not.  He was a big guy too.  So (laughter) two dispositions, so, man it's just--some of the entertainers were you know, just--it's interesting to see the temperament of some of, you know, the--some of the guys.
Story_ID: 631150
Speaker 1: The character Little Walter in the movie 'Cadillac Records' was really--had a hair trigger temper and got into trouble with the police and actually--
Speaker 2: Well, Little Walter was really a character.  When he--he was the harmonica player for Muddy Waters and he went out on his own, and a series of harmonica players with Muddy Waters, Cotton, James Cotton, Little Walter.  But Little Walter was really out there (laughter).  And he began to drink a lot, you know and that would get him into trouble because he really dranked a lot.  But he was one of the top harmonica players in the world at the time.  In fact all the British guys loved him, his playing, Mick Jaggers [sic. Mick Jagger] and Keith Richards and all of those guys.  So he got so ridiculous that Chess [Chess Records] and them had to stop recording him, had stopped recording him.  And there was a report that he was driving around in the car with no doors on it (laughter), taken all the doors off.  'Cause he was, he was making money on the road and he got really popular and had a sack full of money, cash in a bag.  Pull up to a service station and asked the guy how much he owed and the guy would--how much I owe you and the guy would tell him and he would take the bag and say, "Okay, get your money."  You don't know how much the guy was getting out of the bag, he just reached in and got a handful of dough.  He--near the end of his days Leonard [Leonard Chess] and them decided to record him.  So they had cut these tracks ahead of time and so Leonard says, "Okay, I'm telling you," then he would call everybody Mother.  Said, "Look, Mother, I want to tell you right now, nobody, nobody is to give this guy no liquor and don't let him out and don't go to the liquor store for him, okay?"  So, okay.  So we're going to--so Leonard and them came up to the control room and stood there while Little Walter had all of his hops all over the floor.  So he wanted some pop or something and they gave him 7 Up.  And he was sitting there playing.  And Leonard and them went down for the phone, the phones were ringing and come back, Little Walter was drunk.  You know now he got drunk, in that, in that 7 Up bottle full of gin (laughter).  Nobody know how he got the gin, how he got--who slipped it to him or whatever.  And Leonard said, "That's freaking it," you know.  So they didn't do it.  So then a guy named Johnny Pepper who had Pepper's Lounge on 43rd [Street] and Vincennes [Avenue] for a long number of years where it was like the home of Muddy Waters and a lot of the guys, he lost his license or something over there and moved out to Chicago Heights [Illinois] and had a Pepper's Lounge out there, somewhere out there.  I was--I played in it one night too.  And the night I played Little Walter was there and Little Walter hung out there with Pepper.  Him and Pepper were really close.  So he sat in with us, playing the harmonica and so that night it was kind of a bad night like it is now.  And some kind of way he got Johnny Pepper's car, Johnny Pepper had a brand new Cadillac.  And Little Walter took the car and drove home 'cause he lived in Chicago [Illinois].  And Pepper was mad, he was fit to be tied.  He didn't know what the hell was going on, where his car was and Pepper--and Little Walter had the car and Pepper says, "He ain't gone get very far 'cause the car is on empty."  And Little--and Walter had gotten home without running out of gas.  Nobody knew how that happened, you know.  So that was one of the funny things that happened and Pepper was all excited and scared to death and that's, that's another one of the little episodes of Little Walter.  He was, he was a trip.  And--but he was very talented.
Story_ID: 631151
Speaker 1: What about Muddy Waters now?  He's one of the high--
Speaker 2: Well, Muddy was a good guy.  My experience with Muddy was with 'Electric Mud.'  I did another song called 'Muddy, Blues and Brass' [sic. 'Muddy, Brass and the Blues'] with Charles Stepney, the great arranger and I got together and we arranged horns on that album that was my first experience.  And then the next experience I had with Muddy, a guy named Charles Stepner who worked for, who was just a young guy in his twenties, just got a job with J. Walter Thompson and he came to Chess Records and wanted to get Muddy Waters to do an, a jingle, an adver- a music ad.  And so he get to Marshall [Marshall Chess] and Marshall sent him to me.  So he comes to me and says, "Man, I want to do Muddy Waters."  He said, "How can I get him?  Can you get him?"  (Unclear) I say, "You go to his ag- his manager?"  He say, "The manager I don't think would talk to him."  So I say, "Yeah, I can get him."  So I said, "But I got to caution you.  If you get Muddy, Muddy's going to have a problem with the script because he don't read and write to any fluency--with any degree of fluency.  He's just learning how to sign his name and write and stuff."  So I said, "We'll have to give him the script by rote, can you handle that?"  He says, "Yeah."  So we got Muddy in and we did the spot called Hamm's beer [Theodore Hamm's Brewing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And it was the first spot--this was around '68 [1968], somewhere in that area.  And it was a short spot by a ma- a major manufacturer by a blues artist, national spot.  And so we cut the spot, I think we had the great Wayne Bennett on guitar and a bunch of guys.  All star rhythm section I put together.  And, so when he carried it back to the agency, I think there was a lot of jealousy and racism going on on the staff, they didn't want to do this black guy on the spot to start with.  Don't even know how he got the assignment.  Anyway the spot--when they put the spot on the air, it's a thirteen week cycles.  So the spot ran for one cycle and it became popular to the point where they picked it up for another thirteen week cycle, broadcasters did.  So he got fired for that, Charles Stepner, Chuck Stepner got fired from the agency, period.
Speaker 1: Even though it was popular (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah and he went on to work with NBC and some other people and got--they might have done him a favor when they fired him because he went into, you know, television and stuff like that, production.  And, so--but the spot was Muddy Waters on the Hamm's beer commercial.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: I've only heard that one Hamm's, the Indian thing, (singing) "From the land of sky blue waters"--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But that, yeah.
Speaker 2: But we did a regular--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --blues spot, baby, you know.  He was getting down.  So then later on we, I did work with Marshall Chess, Charles Stepney and I, we were the three producers on 'Electric Mud,' which was a big album for him.
Story_ID: 631152
Speaker 1: Now what about another figure that's in that movie 'Cadillac Records,' is Howlin' Wolf.
Speaker 2: Wolf or Chester Burnett, (imitates) Wolf.  We did an album right behind--Wolf didn't want to do this album.  See what had happened was around the world the rock guys had picked up on a lot of Willie Dixon tunes and Willie Dixon stuff and they started cutting these same songs and the guys, the originals like Muddy Waters and whoever wasn't making any money.  So when we cut 'Electric Mud,' that's- that went up to the top of the charts.  It was the first time Muddy had ever made that kind of money on a recording.  And so we decided to do the same thing with Wolf and Wolf didn't want to do it.  And when we did it, he didn't like it and knew it.  So we told Wolf, you know, "Hey look, just play what you been playing, we going to modify and update the rhythm section around you to make it sound more in the rock and roll vein rather than just straight blues," and that's what we did.  So when we did that album on him, Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones heard it and carried it--brought him to London [England] and did another album on him in London.  So it's kind of elevated his, you know, his image around the world and--but he was kind of a character indeed, you know, and kind of a--he was--some of the guys in the band were kind of intimidated by him 'cause he would whip their behinds if they didn't do right, you know do what he told them to do, you know.  Hubert Sumlin who just died not too long ago, stayed with him all the--all the way around.  He whipped (laughter) Hubert and Eddie Shaw, the saxophonist played with him and, so, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that depiction was fairly accurate, the intimidating.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was an intimidating guy.
Speaker 1: Would he try to take members of other people's--I mean, the other musicians from other artists and--?
Speaker 2: No, he would--he had, he had a core of musicians that pretty well stuck with him, you know.  He was accused of a lot of stuff he didn't do.  He was--and you got to know him, he was a pretty good guy but he didn't stand for no foolishness from the guys he worked with, you know.
Story_ID: 631153
Speaker 1: Okay now on the other side--I mean the, some of the doo wop groups, I mean, the, like the Chi-Lites and the, the mighty Dells [The Dells] from here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played--for The Dells I played on The Dells' records but I wasn't the producer, I just on the side, I just played the solos.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I played the solos on the Chi-Lites, the 'Hey, Girl' [sic. 'Oh Girl'] and the, you know, those, a couple of those big hits with the Chi-Lites because they were recorded by [HistoryMaker] Carl Davis and them.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In the Brunswick [Brunswick Records] down the street from Chess [Chess Records].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The record road, (gesture) down the street.  Chess that way (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Brunswick that way, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and some of the--I was the sole, I was the producer for The Soul Stirrers back in 1964--'65 [1965].  And the (unclear) in gospel and The Violinaires in gospel, Professor Alex Bradford in gospel and The Davis Sisters in gospel and I recorded the hit I--'Lord, Don't Move that Mountain' [sic. 'Lord, Don't Move the Mountain'], Inez Andrews in gospel.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And recorded the hit 'I'll Make It All Right,' Beautiful Zion Choir, that, you know, did a lot of that stuff.  Then I went to--19--1960, what was it, what was it?  Yeah, 1973 I went to work for Stax [Stax Records] and I worked a few years, almost two years at Stax in gospel.  That was a--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) gospel, Stax.
Speaker 1: Did you relocate to--?
Speaker 2: No, I commuted.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is in 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 2: And right after that Stax went under.  They let me go before they went under.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Soon as I left, but they knew it was going under, that's one of the reasons they let me go because they were having problems with the government and having problems with payola--but they had a distributing deal going on with CBS and some kind of way it got really crazy with Al Bell and payola, Al Bell and the government with payola.  They just caught them with a lot of money and stuff and so finally this, the company went under.
Speaker 1: Did you fairly, do fairly well as a pro- as a producer--I mean, with all those hats, producer, side--?
Speaker 2: I didn't make no money.  I was on salary.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I didn't make a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Overall (unclear), no.
Speaker 1: So did you pick up like most of your money on tour, I mean, you know, playing?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Did you play a lot of gigs on tour?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't go out much.  I played locally mostly.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I played locally and I just mostly got--I was on salary, I was a staff guy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I made some money on royalties, on some of the songs, you know, just little money, short money.  I didn't make a lot of money.
Story_ID: 631154
Speaker 1: So then I went to work with two friends of mine, Marvin Yancy and Chuck Jackson, and we started doing Natalie Cole.
Speaker 2: Now this is what, 19--?
Speaker 1: This is about '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-three [1973], '74, [1974].  And I won a Grammy [Grammy Award] I think it was '76 [sic. 1977] for doing 'Sophisticated Lady,' being a producer on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's great.  Now this is--was this your first Grammy?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is 1974?
Speaker 1: I might have been nominated before, I don't know, I don't know all the stuff that I did 'cause--but in '76 [1976] I think it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  1976, okay, all right.  That's when Natalie Cole really started--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --making it big.
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: She started really becoming popular in '76 [1976].  I mean, but she--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we did, we did about six, six or seven straight albums, hit albums.  What happened was here's what happened--the Jackson and Yancy came to me and said we were on the elevator in New York and walked in there with our manager and met Natalie's manager and they wanted to try to find her a deal, so we knew, we tried--decided to do a demo to try to place her with a record company.  So they said, "We want you to put together the demo for us."  And they wrote the songs, four songs, and I booked the studio, Universal Studios [Chicago, Illinois] and called the musicians and we cut the four songs.  And they took the four songs and sent them out and Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler at Atlantic [Atlantic Records] turned her down and a lot of companies turned her down.  She always had the door open to go to Capitol [Capitol Records] because that's where her daddy [Nat King Cole] was.  So finally she had to accept the deal at Capitol because she thought that Capitol wouldn't be able to see her style as she wanted them to see it because she was R and B [rhythm and blues] and her daddy was pop.  But they accepted her and coming out of the pop, but I got fired from the team of Jackson and Yancy before they sold her.  You know, me and Chuck and Marvin fell out.  So they finished that album, but they used the four tunes and they finished that album at Curtom studio [Curtom Records].  So they rehired me again for the second album and we did that at Curtom and that's when we cut 'Sophisticated Lady.'
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And then we did a third album at Paul Serrano's studio, P.S. Studios [P.S. Recording Studios, Chicago, Illinois].  And then we went the rest of it in Hollywood, you know.  So that's what happened with her.
Story_ID: 631155
Speaker 1: And then 1977, I get a call while we were working on Natalie [Natalie Cole] for this movie.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this same guy that I did the spot for for Hamm's beer [Theodore Hamm's Brewing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota], Chuck Stepner, recommended me to the producer.  He was happening to have been sitting around talking to this guy, and so I got a chance to do a movie called 'Stony Island' where I had one of the starring roles in the movie.  And we cut it in Chicago [Illinois].  And they're getting ready to re-release some of it now on the 4th of Octo- the 4th of April I think it is.  And repa- repackaging and putting it out with a video and everything else.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, 'Stony Is-' I remember when 'Stony Island' came out.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, I didn't see it, but I think I did see--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now you got a cha- this propelled you into other movies, right?  You were in--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, same, the same producer--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --same director.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Andy Davis [Andrew Davis]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --put me in 'Fugitive', 'Under Siege,' 'The Package.'
Speaker 2: Right that was shot here in Chicago [Illinois] with Gene Hackman.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gene Hackman (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And 'Code of Silence' with--
Speaker 1: 'Code of--'
Speaker 2: --Chuck Norris.
Speaker 1: 'Code of Silence,' right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right, the same produ- same director.
Speaker 2: Steven Seagal's--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'Above the Law' and 'Under Siege.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and 'The Fugitive' now was a big movie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 2: The final scene--
Speaker 1: Tommy, Tommy Lee (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And the final scene shot at the downtown--
Speaker 1: Hilton [Hilton Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the Hilton downtown, right.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  And, so, yeah, so this is--so is that--so are your finances getting stronger now?  I mean, as a--
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Are you making more money now as a, as an actor?  Are you doing--?
Speaker 1: Who, me?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, then were you making more money then, yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, well, I got--well, I got paid union scale.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And do you get residuals for those films?
Speaker 1: Yeah we get residuals.  Actors, they made--they made it possible that actors, the union made it possible for actors to get residuals in the '70s [1970s] I think it was.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Okay.  That's something.  So you're a part of a lot--so the mid to late '70s [1970s] was really a good time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: --for you.  Yeah, all right--
Speaker 1: So after I got through--
Speaker 2: So how did you--well, let me just ask this question.  Now how did you--I know you were selected to be in the movie 'Stony Island,' did--but had you had any acting training--
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: --previously or--
Speaker 1: No, no, what happened was they had this, had written this script by a lady named Tamara Hoffs [Tamar Simon Hoffs] and her father was a Rabbi Simon [Ralph Simon] with one of the big Jewish parishioners on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], had a big church [Congregation Rodfei Zedek, Chicago, Illinois].  And so she came, actually raised up in Chicago but she became one of the writers with Andy, she and Andy got together in Hollywood and wrote this script.  And so that's how I got hired to do--they were looking for this character named Percy Price in this movie.  And being the older guy to mentor these younger musicians and so it so happens that when Chuck Stepner says, "I know just the guy for that part," and then he says, "Who?"  And he says, "[HistoryMaker] Gene Barge."  They said, "I never heard of him."  So then they called me and I was on the coast doing Natalie and I--when I came in, my wife [Sarah Harvey Barge] told me, "You got a call to go out and do a reading or something."  So I went down and soon as I walked through the door, they said, "Yeah, that's it, you're the guy," so I did the part.
Speaker 2: And what was your role in 'Stony Island'?
Speaker 1: Well, my role was Percy Price, a guy who was working for a funeral home and they needed--the band wanted to have somebody to help train them so that they could get into big time and get a deal.  And, so they stumbled up on this guy Percy Price, who was a saxophone player, who was a musician, who was sort of--gotten older and hadn't, wasn't getting gigs and stuff, was working in a funeral home.  So they came and found me, so as it turns out I gets fired from the funeral home and I go out and tries to get these guys and they had a big gig.  And we were auditioning, practicing for the gig and I die in the movie.  But they went on, you know, that's what happened.  But it was the first gig for Dennis, what's the guy's name, 'New York Ci- PD Blue.'
Speaker 2: 'NYPD Blue'?
Speaker 1: Dennis Franz.
Speaker 2: Dennis Franz.
Speaker 1: His first movie.  Rae Dawn Chong, her first movie.  Susanna Hoffs, lead singer for The Bangles, her first movie.  Upchurch [Phil Upchurch] was in it a little bit.  [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr. was in it and some, and Ron- Ronnie Barron from New Orleans [Louisiana], keyboardist, and Tennyson Stephens keyboardist.  So you see, you see all these guys, man, you know, young Dennis (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's great, that's great.  So you had a second career as a movie actor.
Speaker 1: Well, some of those movies, you know, some movies.
Speaker 2: Then this continues through the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: These appearances and movies keep going through the '80s [1980s].  You do about one movie a year at least, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Through the '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 631156
Speaker 1: But in the meantime, in 1982 I went with The Rolling Stones.
Speaker 2: Now that's significant too.  How did that come about?
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was around 1981 or something Ahmet Ertegun called me and said he's coming to Chicago [Illinois] and he wanted to record some guys, you know.  And some blues, he wanted to do some blues.  He had always wanted to do some blues, so he says, "I need somebody to put together some rhythm section and book the studio for me and I'm coming in."  So I put the call to musicians, booked Paul Serrano's studio, P.S. Studios [P.S. Recording Studios, Chicago, Illinois], and then he came in.  Before he came in, he said, "Oh, I'm getting a call 'cause, I'm calling you because when I come in I'm going to bring Mick Jagger with me, he's going to hang out."  So, and, so we booked it, 323 East 23rd Street, Mick Jagger came in and we hung out for about a week and I got to know Mick Jagger.  So then Mick Jagger in 1981 was doing an American tour, so I kind of got a hold of him and asked him, "When you come to Chicago out near O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], that arena out there."
Speaker 2: Rosemont--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Horizon [Rosemont Horizon; Allstate Arena, Rosemont, Illinois].
Speaker 1: I said, he says--I said, "Man, I want in, to come to the concert."  So he said, "Okay, I'll--." So he was downtown at a hotel and he gave--and I went down to pick up tickets and backstage passes and I got to know him pretty good.  So then I wrote him a letter again and told him, "If you need a saxophone player, give me a call."  So it just so happens that Ernie Watts was the saxophone player for the American tour and Ernie quit and went back to Los Angeles [California] and because he was doing a lot of sessions and stuff.  So Mick called me in April or something like that, of '82 [1982] and asked me would I do it.  He called me himself, he didn't get an agent or nobody, manager, and asked me would I make the tour with him.  So I said, "Yeah, I'll do it."  And so I went to Europe and we went into rehearsals in Shepperton [Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, England] and using The Who's, The Who's studio, using their rehearsal studios and we got ready for the tour and I made the tour, so--
Speaker 2: Well, how--
Speaker 1: So we toured.  They were projected to make about two million dollars, I mean, I mean, play for twenty something, two million people rather, projected to work in front of two million people on the tours and we were working soccer stadiums mostly.  As it turns out we worked for 2.2 million people and we--and I think they grossed somewhere between sixty, seventy million dollars or something like that on this tour in Europe.  And then Europe was going through sort of a hard time during that time because the economy weren't bad, weren't good in some of the countries.  So Mick Jagger just dropped the prices on the gate to fifteen dollars in some cases and twenty dollars in some, you know, so people would have--but we had, we had sold out crowds everywhere we went.
Story_ID: 631157
Speaker 1: I know a movie's been made about life on a rock tour, 'This Is Spinal Tap,' you know.  But what, what is, what was it like being on tour with The Rolling Stones 'cause they're, they kind of have a reputation of being kind of wild and--on--
Speaker 2: There was nothing like it.  I hadn't experienced nothing like this.  I've been there and so when I was on tour with them at night I would go mostly in Keith Richards' room, mostly hang out with him, we called it Keith's disco.  And Keith would, wouldn't wake up good until about five or six o'clock in the evening.  And then we would go in his room at night and sit around and he had his roadies bring in all his records, trunk full of tapes and records, a lot of reggae and all kinds of stuff.  He's really an R and B [rhythm and blues] historian because he knows so much about the music.  So I hung out with him.  Mick Jagger was out mostly hanging out with some of his friends and traveling around on our days off and chasing (laughter) chicks and what not.  So anyway I hung out with mostly Keith and Charlie Watts and Ron Wood [Ronnie Wood].
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And, but it was nice.  I mean you know, they had--the reputation followed them, pursued them everywhere they went.  We got strip searched in a couple of airports because they figured they were on drugs.  And man, we got into Scandinavia, I forgot, Norway, I forgot which town and soon as we walked through customs, they ordered us into this room and had us strip, take off all our clothes, looking for drugs.
Speaker 1: Now you're saying like Keith Richards, now somebody--we all know that somebody with The Rolling Stones was a music scholar on some level way back in the day when they got started (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was a what?
Speaker 1: A music, not a scholar, but a really--you said that Keith Richards really knew music.
Speaker 2: Well, Keith Richards was a good guitar player, so was Ron, so was Ron Wood.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Ron Wood was a base player and he played with Rod Stewart and everybody.  Mick Jagger had attended the London school of music, business [sic. London School of Economics, London, England] rather--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --which is equivalent to Harvard school of business [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  So he had some early training in business.  So that's basically--I don't know which one of them guys--I know Ron Wood was an artist, very good one too.  Charlie, Charlie Watts was more of a historian, keeping up with British military history.  And, so that was basically it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the other horn players that were--
Speaker 2: The only one--it was only me and Bobby Keys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were the only two horn players on the session.  Ian Stewart was on the keyboards, and then Chuck Leavell on piano; that was the band.
Story_ID: 631158
Speaker 1: You were in a lot of movies, all the movies we've mentioned pretty much took place throughout the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you're still playing music.  And is there anything else that happens before I talk about the documentary, 'The Blues'?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.  I was in that movie with Keanu Reaves and, not Keanu Reaves, but who was it, the guy that--this [U.S.] Coast Guard movie; forgot the name of it, dag.  I can't think of the name of the movie.
Speaker 1: That Steven Seagal, that--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Not Steven, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not Steven, came later in Shreveport, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: We were down there for--it was a Coast Guard movie, 'Rescue and'-- [sic. 'The Guardian']--what's the guy's name that Demi Moore's boyfriend.
Speaker 1: Ashton Kutcher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ashton Kutcher.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was one of the stars in the movie.  And that movie we shot in Shreveport.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was the last one I was in.
Story_ID: 631159
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about working with Martin Scorsese's crew on the documentary 'The Blues' in 2003.
Speaker 2: Well, this was produced, well, directed by a guy by the name of Levin [Marc Levin].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I can't think of his first name.  He was--he had been doing TV work and some movies and features and Scorsese was mostly was the overall administrator, supervisor.  He didn't actually do any of the actual directing of the, of the--see there's five series and Spike Lee was supposed to do one.  They got Levin to do one, and Clint Eastwood did one and the other two, I don't know who the directors were on those.  But I think the guy from England [sic. Germany] who won, who won something, can't think of his name [Wim Wenders].  He did a thing on the Cuban musicians ['Buena Vista Social Club'], I can't think of this guy's name.  He won--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He did one.  He--I forgot the name of the series, but he produced a group on some Cuban musicians who were sort of obscure until he brought them on, brought them out on film.
Speaker 1: Right, right I remember the movie, yeah.
Speaker 2: But he came to Chicago [Illinois] and shot some footage here, this guy did.  But in the meantime on the series we did, they wanted sort of to revive, revive the stories that centered around the Chess [Chess Records] situation and the 'Electric Mud' situation.  So Chuck, Chuck D who was the Public Enemy lead and feature guy, came in and he had been very interested in the 'Electric Mud,' sort of inspired him to do what he was doing in rap and blues.  And Chuck, Chuck is a little, a little different from most rappers because he reads a lot and he's very interest- interested in the black music experience, period.  So he came in and we brought in the--as much as the rhythm section as we possibly could from 'Electric Mud,' we brought in Morris Jennings, Philip Upchurch [Phil Upchurch], Pete Cosey and some of the other mus- Roland Faulkner and his guys I think passed away.  And so they brought them in and then they brought in the rapper Common in, he was there.  And, so we went, we went on to do an hour, an hour, you know, series.  We sit around and talk and kicked it around a little bit and then we played some music and we went to CRC [Chicago Recording Company, Chicago, Illinois] I think studios and did some music and stuff.  So basically that's what that was all about, you know.  Just sort of tell the story about--centered around Chicago and Chess and et cetera, Muddy Waters.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you've appeared in some other documentaries and--over the past few years.  There's one--I think the last one we have here is 'Roll over Beethoven.'  Is that the--
Speaker 2: Chuck Berry?
Speaker 1: No, it's something called 'Roll over Beethoven: The Chess Records Saga' in 2010, is that true?
Speaker 2: Two thousand ten [2010]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know, man, I'm, I'm in some things that I don't remember what the titles of them were, and I don't know what I said.
Story_ID: 631160
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now let me ask you this, I didn't ask this before, but how would you describe your technique as a saxophone player?  What do you think characterizes how you play the saxophone?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And what do you try to achieve?
Speaker 2: First of all I'm described as one of the more soulful saxophone players.  I'm supposed to be like the guy who started playing, extremely soulful sax- almost church like saxophone.  And if you listen to what I'm playing, you'll discover that I did sort of play churchy, soulful.  At the time when I was in New York [New York] during the 'C.C. Rider' thing, King Curtis was one of the leading saxophone players on the New York scene and, so what happened was I played the 'C.C. Rider' solo and I went into Small's one day, one night and--Small's Paradise [New York, New York], and I think Wilt the Stilt [Wilt Chamberlain] was running it then I think.  And I think King Curtis was the house man, and I hadn't met King.  So I went into the, into the latrine, the john and I'm standing there relieving myself and in walks in the next stall next to me was King Curtis.  And finally he looks over at me and says--so we introduce ourselves.  So he mentioned the fact that Ruth Brown had said something to him about me.  And he--it kind of pissed him off because Ruth Brown told him, says, "[HistoryMaker] Gene Barge," says, "you're copying Gene Barge's style," or something.  And that really sent him in a rage.  So he tells me, he says, "Okay, since you think I'm--get your horn, come on.  Come on up here."  I said, "Man, I ain't got no horn, come on man."  So anyway later on King and I became very good friends, but his style was a little different from me, but he went on after that and did 'Yakety Yak' and he did the Aretha Franklin solo on 'Respect.'  These are, these are like historic solos he did, you know.  And he was probably the most recorded saxophone soloist in the country.  And after that I became one too because I went on back to Chi- I went on back to, I went to Chicago [Illinois] and I did all of the stuff on Chess [Chess Records] and a lot of the stuff down at Brunswick [Brunswick Records] and other places, you know.  So I became a highly recorded saxophone player too.  So he was a very soulful saxophone, so was I.  And then along came Junior Walker who came after us at Motown [Motown Records].  And, so I would say the three most soulful saxophone players was King Curtis, Junior Walker and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you say that Junior Walker's version of 'Way Back Home' is not the same one that you--has nothing to do with yours?
Speaker 2: No, no, that- that's a whole different thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And mine was more very country like on the saxophone, you know.  These are--Junior Walker did a version, a take off and a version of Wilton Felder and Joe Sample's and Stix [Stix Hooper] on 'Way Back Home,' they wrote that.  These are the guys from Tex- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Crusaders, yeah.
Speaker 2: These are the guys from Texas who went, went on with The Jazz Crusaders and made that song, a whole different ballgame.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Junior Walker put some lyrics on it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he went on to do it.  But Wilt (unclear) was very soulful, I loved Will playing, you know.  He's a bass player though and he made his money mostly playing bass.  He was on a couple of sessions for me with maybe some gospel dates, and maybe one Natalie Cole day, and I'm not sure, but we're friends anyway.

Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite cut of all the things that you've played?
Speaker 2: Of my stuff?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I'm not a big fan of [HistoryMaker] Gene Barge (unclear) (laughter).  I don't sit around listening to me (laughter), no.
Speaker 1: Well, I think during this interview, I've discovered that I am a fan, I've heard of so much but I didn't know it was you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, there's an interesting dynamic here in the United States, a lot of people don't know who the musicians are that appear on the records that they listen to.  And I think there was a--I know the Motown [Motown Records], the guys that played for Motown, it was always a surprise for them when they would go to England and the people would know who they were.  You know they weren't listed even on the albums here.
Speaker 2: Well, see I made a point when I was at Chess [Chess Records], being an A and R [artists and repertoire] man, I was a staff A and R man and then I was the head of A and R for Chess for a while.  I made it a point of putting the musician's credits on the, on the, on the label, on the LPs and whatever I could get them on, I made it a point.  Right now I'm doing an album around--I'm struggling now trying to remember some of the guys that played because I want to give them their credits.  I know over there there's a baritone player, I can't think of his name, he played on a lot of solos and then there was a guy named Eli Fontaine who played on the Marvin Gaye stuff.  Great saxophone player as far as I'm concerned, as far as him being able to produce on records and come off with a real great sound and, you know, soulful sound too, and, so I tried always--everything I did, even with the Natalie Cole stuff, to try to give--print the guys' names on the records, you know, because I would turn in the information for the, for the--a lot of the Natalie Cole stuff.
Story_ID: 631162
Speaker 1: Now do you think that, that, that you would be able to play the type of music that you play without your roots in jazz?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, you know, by me coming up in jazz, listening to jazz, I think I added another, a different element to it, but some of the other guys were--like Jimmy Forrest who plays 'Night Train,' they have a great saxophone player, man.  And he was real soulful and he's more or less a jazz player.  Clifford Scott who played 'Honky Tonk,' great saxophone players, some great saxophone players out there who really play soulful and with a lot of feeling.  And I'm not, I'm not taking credit from these guys.  These guys are, you know, Tom Archer, the saxophone player from Texas and King [King Curtis] was one of them.  There's two or three guys from Texas, Arnett Cobb and all these guys, you know, these guys, Jacquet, all these guys could play man.
Speaker 1: Illinois Jacquet, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, great players.
Speaker 1: Who is your favorite tenor saxophone player?
Speaker 2: My influence was Lester Young.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of my influences.  And, now you got to understand my contemporaries.  I was born the same year, I'm two months older, I'm one month or two months older than Coltrane [John Coltrane], two months younger than Miles Davis, we all born in 1926.  So I came up, you know, in the same era.  Coltrane was born in Carolina.  When he was eighteen he was graduating from high school.  Miles graduated before both of us 'cause he graduated like in January of 19--of, what was it 1944 I think it was.  And when I was stationed in Rantoul, Illinois I was stationed only a few miles from Miles' home.  So where I was eighteen years old and Miles was eighteen years old, he was fooling around in St. Louis [Missouri] trying to get his deal going, you know, and Coltrane was coming out of--when he was eighteen, he was coming out of high school.  See I was in the [U.S.] Army and neither one of them guys were in the [U.S.] military, I was in the military.  So they were out playing and I wasn't, you know.  They were--they had a head start on me, eighteen and nineteen, Gene [HistoryMaker Gene Barge]--all these guys was sitting up playing big time.  I think Miles had gotten a gig with the Billy Eckstine band [Billy Eckstine and His Orchestra] that was on tour in that part of the world and they had--needed a saxophone, I mean a trumpet player and they hired him, you know.  That influenced him a lot.  So anyway some of the great players, you know, I'd got a chance to listen, like Earl Bostic and guys, you know, that's some of the great, great players.  I got a chance to talk to some of them too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know I got a chance to talk to Dizzy Gillespie.  I didn't never meet Byrd [Donald Byrd], but I got a chance to talk to Earl Bostic and several other players.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said that earlier you mentioned Clarence Clemons as actually being from Norfolk [Virginia] too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Clarence Clemons cited you as a, as a, or someone said that he was greatly influenced by your sax playing.
Speaker 2: Was I?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, that's what you said, said that Clarence Clemons was very much--he passed away last year, the sax man for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They just had a thing last Friday, Friday before last at his home, memorial service.  Gary [Gary U.S. Bonds] went down for it and the reporter here for--Dave Hoekstra from the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times], he went down.  He called me and told me he was going down.  But I wasn't invited.  Gary was trying to get me down there, but I wasn't invited to go down for this, for the, for the, for the program.  But yeah--the reason, the reason they probably said that--because when Bruce [Bruce Springsteen] first started, he was impressed with the record 'Quarter to Three.'  So much so that he recorded it, you know, later in his career--early in his career, rather, when he was, when he was--that band was getting out there and getting started good and he recorded 'Quarter to Three,' which means that somebody was influenced by what Gary and I did, and I was the principal saxophone player on 'Quarter to Three' and one of the writers.  So I would assume that maybe yeah, there's some influence from me on what they did.

Speaker 1: Now what advice would you give young musicians today?
Speaker 2: Well, the main, probably thing that I think, you know, I'm a, I'm a bug for education, I'm a stickler for education.  And I think that education in, is the key.  The enemy is ignorance and your best friend is discipline.  And the name of the subject matter that you study in school are called disciplines.  And I got my biggest taste of discipline from my [paternal] grandmother [Georgia Rhodes Barge] and my next from the [U.S.] military.  So I think that the kids need to study and study and study and study.  If you like music, practice.  But you were talking about us not making the money and the industry robbing us.  I think the kids need to study the business of entertainment.  They need to really study that so if they make some accomplishments, they will be able to get the benefit from their accomplishments.  If you're writers and producers and et cetera, you need to know what steps you need to take in order to keep people from taking your talent away from you and getting robbed.  So I think the kids need to study some parts of business and learn how to compute, read and write and compute so that you don't--there's some very creative kids out there.  But they need to--singing and dancing, you need to know, also know the business so you can--so your singing and dancing will pay off for you, you know.
Story_ID: 631164
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: I don't know how I could.  You know I backed into a lot of stuff, a lot of things happened that I had nothing to do with.  I don't know--if I had a chance to do it all over again, I would get better trained, that's what I would do.  I would have tried to find--but I came up during the Depression [Great Depression].  We couldn't afford a teacher, we couldn't afford nothing.  You know my daddy [James G. Barge, Sr.] would be lucky if he made fifteen dollars a week during that time.  That would have been top salary in the 1929, '30 [1930], '31 [1931].  So there was nothing I could do.  I mean it's--we couldn't afford anything, you know.  Half of the time we couldn't even afford a doctor, much less talking about music lessons.

Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be your musical legacy?
Speaker 2: For me?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I, I just think that the musical legacy for me would be that a lot of the young musicians or younger musicians say that I help them a lot.  A lot of the guys you talk to, like the Upchurches [Phil Upchurch] and Cash McCalls, and any number of musicians that come up in Chicago [Illinois] who--pretty good players right now, and some of the gospel guys will say that I, I did help them.  I reached out and tried to help them.
Story_ID: 631166
Speaker 1: Now we didn't ask you much about your family, but are you married and you have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my wife [Sarah Harvey Barge] passed in 2008.  So let's see, we had been married forty-three years when she passed.  And I have two daughters, I have one daughter on the West Coast who lives in--right outside of Los Angeles [California].  And the--my youngest daughter who lives here in Chicago [Illinois] looks over my shoulder and takes care of me and takes care a lot of my business.  Her name is Gina [Gina Barge].  And Gina Barge and she's a consultant and recruiter for Aon insurance company [Aon plc].  And she's a headhunter, she discovers, finds talent for corporations.  My other daughter is now a minister and teaches deprived children on the West Coast.  And, so that's, that's it, that's my two children.  My wife's, wife's gone so that's it.
Story_ID: 631167
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I need to ask you, or you need to say before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I think we've just about covered it all, except that I was, you know, a member of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and I worked with the Breadbasket Band and--
Speaker 1: Under Ben Branch, and, yeah.
Speaker 2: Under--well, Ben Branch and I were like co-leaders and I was Ben Branch's producer too for what little recording he did.  And I worked with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] all the way through and I recorded those albums, the Memorial to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], 'The Last Request' album and two or three other albums, and worked with Wayne Bennett and all the guys at Breadbasket [Operation Breadbasket] and musicians and Jesse Jackson and all his children are friends of mine, and his wife Jackie [HistoryMaker Jacqueline Finney Brown] as well.
Speaker 1: Did you work on the album with Cannonball Adderley, the 'Walk Tall' album with the--?
Speaker 2: He put my name on that album.  He recorded that album live at PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] and I had nothing to do with that album except Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley] and I just liked each other a lot and (laughter), I played the--I guess he heard me playing at Breadbasket and so he just stuck my name on the album.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't play, though (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I love Cannon- I love Cannonball.
Speaker 1: There- there's probably--
Speaker 2: He was a great influence too, great player, great player.
Story_ID: 631168
Speaker 1: We could probably have a whole other session and talk about Chicago [Illinois] history without even talking about music and you would fill up another three hours.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But thank you for allowing us to interview you, and the last question is, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would just like to be remembered as an earnest producer of music and a songwriter and a guy who would like to see kids try to get as much education and training as they possibly can get.  I'm an advocate of our young people, especially our young black kids to stay in school and get their training and move on.
