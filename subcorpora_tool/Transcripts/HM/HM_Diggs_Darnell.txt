Story_ID: 29725

Speaker 2: Yes, Janie Mae Diggs.  Her maiden name is Davenport.  J-A-N-I-E, M-A-E, D-I-G-G-S.

Speaker 2: Her date of birth is April 26, 1931.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Pike County, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Alright, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back, can you trace them all the way back to slavery or beyond?
Speaker 2: I cannot, no.  I cannot.  I only remember my mother's parents cause--
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Those are my grandparents, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they don't have any stories of their parents?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  They're deceased.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you know about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I know that, I mean they're just, traditional things like that's my mother's mother [Lela Davenport].  I don't know a whole lot about them.  I know that they grew up working, picking cotton and those type things, but--
Speaker 1: Were they sharecropping perhaps?
Speaker 2: They were sharecroppers.  They were not formally educated, strong Christians though, very strong in the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they ever tell you any stories about what life was like down there?
Speaker 2: Yes, being taken advantage of, a lot of stories in terms of working because they couldn't read and write, not getting paid like with checks, getting paid with money, and not getting paid the full wages, things of that nature, yeah, in picking cotton.
Speaker 1: So, they knew--so they highlighted the disadvantage of not having an education.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did they talk about why they didn't have one or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they had to work.  And that's the primary reason they always would say, we had to take care of the family, so.
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people nowadays take it for granted that if you want to go to school, you just go to school.  But it wasn't true with them, right?
Speaker 2: Right, in that case.
Speaker 1: Okay, and in many cases in the South there was not a school necessarily to go to.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was that the case with them?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had a one-room school I think they mentioned to me one time before, but not all day like the kids do now, when you can, and so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were your grandparents names?
Speaker 2: My grandfather is U.L., I mean literally, U, period, L period, Davenport.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind him having just two initials for a name?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I asked that question, but no one could tell me that.
Speaker 1: That's often, I mean it's not uncommon that people have those.  I always ask if there's a story behind how they got the two letters, you know.  Okay, and your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Lela, L-E-L-A, Davenport.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And they lived in Pike County then?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Okay, any other stories about them?  Did they tell any folk tales or ghost stories or anything like that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.  My grandparents were very old when I came along anyway, so.  My grandmother was ninety-eight when she died in 2000.  So, I don't know a lot of stories about them in terms of their history.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they talk about the Civil Rights Movement at all in Alabama?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was wondering if any of that affected 'em or you know, that side of the family talked about it because they would have--you came along in 1970, I guess, when pretty much things were straightened out, at least on paper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my younger family always talked about the Civil Rights Movements.  My grandparents didn't really talk about what, their participation in it though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, my grandmother's cousins, and a lot of them participated.  They marched, they did the March from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama] [1965] and things of that nature so
Speaker 1: Okay, did any of the changes, you know, how did the changes, did they seem to affect your grandparents in the way that they, were they amazed that things had changed, any, at all?
Speaker 2: In terms of?
Speaker 1: Civil rights.
Speaker 2: Were they amazed about the change?
Speaker 1: Yeah, was there anything that really changed that they noticed?
Speaker 2: I'm not aware of that, yeah.
Story_ID: 29726
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now, did your mother [Janie Mae Davenport Diggs]--what did your mother say about growing up?
Speaker 2: It was very hard, had to do a lot of working, picking cotton.  As a matter of fact, she took us to, she took me and my twin sister to a cotton field to pick cotton, to show us what type of work it was, so, to show us how they were brought up.  And this was interesting to me because it showed me what I didn't wanna do (laughter) in life, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you mother have a chance to go school?
Speaker 2: She did.  She didn't finish high school.  She stopped in tenth grade, I think.
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of the schools that I've heard about, I think I talked with someone yesterday associated with a school that actually stopped in the tenth.  A lot of the colored schools would stop in the tenth grade, as if by design.  You know, these are state-supported, you know, colored schools with less equipment than the other schools, you know, one room, pay the teachers less, and then they stop at the tenth grade which seems like it takes--I mean you can't graduate from high school if it stops in the tenth grade, right?
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, (unclear) if that was a reason--
Speaker 2: I don't know, I always heard them say that they stopped, she stopped school because she had to work.  I don't remember her saying that she didn't, because she didn't graduate but I know some people her age did graduate from high school so.
Speaker 1: Okay, from that particular one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the one that she went to?
Speaker 2: I, it--I don't know the name of the school.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, Alright.  Now, what did your mother do for a living after she--?
Speaker 2: My mom worked at the cafeteria, Pike County Elementary School [Alabama] cafeteria as a cook.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is this after integration?
Speaker 2: This is, I guess, yes, I would think so.
Story_ID: 29727
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, okay.  Well, let me switch to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is John Henry Diggs.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story behind the "John Henry"?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know why he's named John Henry.
Speaker 1: There's a famous folk hero--
Speaker 2: Right, I do know that, but--
Speaker 1: --but he never talked about whether that was?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, John Henry Diggs.  And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is July 13, 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Pike County [Alabama] also.
Speaker 1: Okay, Alright.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not much cause I didn't know his parents.  They were deceased when I came along, but he didn't talk much about, his mother died when he was twelve, I think, yeah, cause his sister was eight.  So he didn't talk much about his mother that much.  And I didn't know his father either, but my other siblings, they did, the older ones, you know, knew him.
Speaker 1: Did they have about, you know?
Speaker 2: I didn't hear anything, that he was a nice man, very quiet like my dad.  That's, basically, those type things they said about him, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they have the same, did your father's side of the family have the same problems with how they were treated in terms of settling up with their, was your father a sharecropper too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now, he was treated very badly, according to my mom [Janie Mae Davenport Diggs] in terms of his pay, and I think his self esteem was marred because he, my mother and father had eleven boys and four girls.  So having to take care of the family in terms of not being able to, not speaking up for himself.  The guy he worked for sometimes would just pay him, my mom said, would pay him a couple of dollars for a whole day, you know, but he wouldn't say anything because he know he needed it, which was a problem for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the boss would pay him whatever he wanted to pay him?  He wasn't paying (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Pay him whatever he wanted to pay him because he couldn't read or write, but the other workers, they weren't treated like that, according to my mom.  And my mom was very aggressive.  She would always, she would say something (laughter) but my dad wouldn't say anything, so.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear him complain about it?
Speaker 2: No, actually, I didn't.  He never did, never complained, very quiet man.
Speaker 1: Now, so, he didn't get a chance to go to school at all?
Speaker 2: No, third grade.
Speaker 1: Now, did he have any stories about growing up, what it was like when he was growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically, it was hard.  That's the common lingo that they would speak.  He's now deceased, but it was difficult having to work all day, having to support his sister.  He only had one sister because his mom died early, and (unclear) his father was divorced.  But that's basically the main theme of their lives in terms of--
Speaker 1: Hard work?
Speaker 2: Hard work.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I think, my mom told me that her grandmother introduced them and told her that you should marry him, basically like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: And she did it.
Speaker 2: And she did it.
Speaker 1: So did they go to the same church or anything or?
Speaker 2: Initially, no. They did not.  My mother's side was Baptist, my father's side was initially Pentecostal.  So it was like a difference there, but eventually they did.
Speaker 1: Which side did they go to, the Baptist or the Pentecostal?
Speaker 2: Baptist more so than Pentecostal.
Story_ID: 29728
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a sense, I guess from any of the relatives what life was life before 1970 cause you came along as things made a radical change in Alabama.  So you said that some of your relatives participated in the Civil Rights Movement and marched, you know, tell us about some of that and what did you hear when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I mean, like we met, I met Senator John Lewis.  He would come and speak.  'Cause a lot of those guys were, I think, I wanna say he's from Brundidge, Alabama, I believe.  They would talk about how they marched, and with [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], and how they were treated in terms of the difference, like the white only, black only type of restaurants or water fountains, rest rooms, all those type things like that, but, and how education was very powerful and the black church, how it would come together.  And the community would be very strong in the African American church, so things like that,(unclear) and what I read about in the books.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But for me, where I grew up, in high school, I didn't realize until I got to college.  I went to Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama], it was a historically black school.  And I would show some of my friends my yearbook.  Well, in 1988 when I graduated from high school, everything was black and white.  You know, we had a black queen, a white queen, in '88 [1988] (laughter), but I didn't know it until I got to school, like this is not normal.  You know, you would think that, okay, white, black.  But no, we had a white captain for the cheerleaders, a black captain.  A white prom queen, a black prom queen, black SGA [Student Government Association] president, a white vice president, you know, everything was black and white which is--
Speaker 1: It was a dual (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was (unclear) (simultaneous)--could we sue them for that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Probably, you know, I mean I don't know how long it would take.
Speaker 2: I'm just kidding.
Speaker 1: But so, now, do you, when you think about your parents' personalities, and even really anybody else's, when you think about their talents, their personalities, their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my mom [Janie Mae Davenport Diggs].  She's more outspoken.  She would defend herself.  My dad [John Henry Diggs] was, is, now, the older I get, I understand him more because you have to pick and choose your battles.  He was just one that didn't complain, you know.  He just did, and he didn't internalize a lot of things.  Like, you know, I never saw him downtrodden, like, you know, sad and depressed and saying, oh, you know; very soft spoken, but lively at the same time.  Now, my mother, on the other hand, you know, if you crossed her, she would tell you, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories in your family about being terrorized by the white people in the area?
Speaker 2: No, I think one of my brothers did, growing up because we had white neighbors.  And then, you know, in the country, like you have a house here and then you go down the street and there's a house there.  But then it was a house across the street.  I think that, I wanna say the story goes that, I think that she liked my brother, but her father didn't like that.  And so they had some type of tension there.
Speaker 1: Okay, but no--I was just wondering if there were any historical stories in your father's past or in your mother's past?
Speaker 2: No, not that I'm aware of.
Story_ID: 29729
Speaker 1: Okay, Alright.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory.  An earliest childhood memory?  Like what?
Speaker 1: Well, is there a first thing that you remember?  If not, then we just go on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I can't, I don't remember.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Well, describe, you know, where you grew up?  Now, did you grow up on a farm or in the city?
Speaker 2: I grew up in the country, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the country.
Speaker 2: On the farm, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is Brundidge?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I remember things like playing with my cousins and we were very creative cause we didn't have a lot of money.  So we were very creative in terms of building things.  Like if I wanted a go-cart, we would take parts of a lawnmower and wheels from a wagon and other, and build it.  I remember things like that in my childhood.  But any one particular moment, I can't think of.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you describe the place you grew up on?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: In terms of, it was, if you're talking about in terms of being poor, I didn't recognize that.
Speaker 1: Well, no, just what size building did you all live in, I mean what did it look like?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was a nice home.  My siblings grew up in a house where there was no bathroom and that type of that stuff.  But I didn't grow up in that because I mean, because when I was born, we had progressed some.  But, and all of my siblings didn't live in the house at the same time, like, one would think.  So I said, with having that many siblings, so we weren't like 'The Waltons' where we had this big house and all these kids there.  A lot of my siblings were gone, you know.  So I grew up in a home, maybe like, it was like four or five of us at one time.  But it was, my home was a nice wooden home, a bathroom inside, inside plumbing that could house all of us.  Then I remember when I was like ten, they got them a house built, a four-bedroom, two bath, brick home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, what were some of the, I mean did you have any neighbors immediately around you or were you kind of isolated out in the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with family, family, you know.  It wasn't a house what I see now in the city, you know, a few feet.  You look out the window and they're all in your business, but it was like, we had a big yard, you know.
Speaker 1: So the next neighbor was within sight?
Speaker 2: Within sight, but down the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights.  Well, I vividly remember being able to see, 'cause, I was interested in science.  So it was so dark, I could go out and see any, I mean all the stars.  That's something I remember most vividly from being home.  Smells, fresh.  It was the country, fresh air, fresh, clean air.  I could smell the flowers in the springtime, and those type things, hear the birds chirping.  I saw a lot of hummingbirds that I don't see now.
Story_ID: 29730
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your personality like growing up?  I mean were you scientific at all as a child?
Speaker 2: I mean not fixing things, but I was exploratory in terms of I would read a lot.  I used to read, it's funny because I used to read encyclopedias.  I would dream a lot too.  But I was always interested in nature, outside, particularly astronomy.  Now, they call it astrophysics, planets and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you dream about?
Speaker 2: I would dream about where I wanna go, what I wanna do, where I wanna, because like we have the, particularly, like if we see something like the news, like the weather, and they have the map of the entire United States, like over here on the West Coast, we're having so and so and so and so.  I'm like, okay, I wanna go there or I wanna go there, and I've been there.  So, those type of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, was television important growing up?
Speaker 2: Not like it is today cause you know, being in the country, there's no cable TV.  So I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't have any TV.  I didn't know anything about a lot of the shows until I got to college.  And then people talked, oh, you know about this, the cartoon network, oh, this, that, and I'm like, no, what's that?  But, and the shows went off at, what, 10:30 at night, and you'd get this fuzzy stuff.
Speaker 1: Was radio a big--
Speaker 2: To my sisters, but not to me.  I mean she would look at, listen to 'Soul Train'--well, that came on TV and 'American Bandstand', but I wasn't interested in, but we couldn't be inside a lot anyway.  She made us go outside, my mom [Janie Mae Davenport Diggs], go outside and play.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have to work growing up?
Speaker 2: I didn't have to.  I did when I was sixteen.  I had my first job at Burger King.
Speaker 1: Okay, sixteen, that's pretty well along, you started working at sixteen.  You didn't have to work as a little kid?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have to work as a kid.
Speaker 1: Okay, because I know in some places even now, trucks pull up and, down South, and load up the whole family and take 'em to go pick something or, you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I may have did that for myself like pick peas or pick, or I mean haul hay, something like that, but not mandatory like in terms of resources for the family like that.  No, it was my own personal money.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are you the youngest in the family?
Speaker 2: I have a twin sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm four minutes older than she is, so she's the youngest, no, we're the youngest (laughter).
Story_ID: 29731
Speaker 1: Okay, now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Very big, yeah.  Not an option.  It wasn't even a question.  You're going, Sunday School and church which I am very, very, very, very appreciative of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have like responsibilities in the church and they try to, you know, develop the youth?
Speaker 2: I was in the choir, but I eventually went to another church.  I mean that was my early, my first church, but then I went to my father's [John Henry Diggs] side, to Pentecostal, which I'm currently Pentecostal now so.  And I was in the choir, and all those type things that most youth do.  And then I eventually became, I'm in the ministry too.  So I became like for our district, for the Church of God in Christ, we have like, in Huntsville, Alabama where I went to school.  We have like eight churches, and I was like the president over the eight church of the youth department.  So, I was heavily involved in the youth.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your father's church?
Speaker 2: My father's church was New Hope (unclear) Church.
Speaker 1: New Hope?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's a Church of God in Christ?
Speaker 2: No, that's in Brundidge [Alabama].  Now, I was jumping stories.  My church Huntsville [Alabama] where I did all the youth work was when I was eighteen, and that was True Life Church of God in Christ, which I'm currently a member of and ordained in that particular church, that denomination.
Story_ID: 29732
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where did you start grade school?  What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Pike County Elementary School [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Now, this is an integrated school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is what?  1976 or so, '75 [1975], '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975], kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved school.
Speaker 1: And what did you like about it?
Speaker 2: I mean I loved interacting with the students, and I enjoyed learning, so, but I loved school.
Speaker 1: Okay, Alright.  Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  English and history, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they teach black history in those days?
Speaker 2: They did not.  I mean, you know, well, they would mention, yeah, like one of the pictures of King, Martin Luther King, during Black History Month, but in terms of teaching Black History, no.
Speaker 1: So what particularly did you like the most about English and history?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked English because of the writing skills that, you know, I didn't realize how powerful writing was until I had my-- It was a AP [Advanced Placement] English course actually.  But then I had a history teacher that was, that could tell history and make you feel like you literally sitting in that particular time.  So I really enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is later on?
Speaker 2: This is later on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Early on, I mean I just, I don't know.  I just did my work like I was supposed to, so.
Speaker 1: Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Some would say so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you into athletics at all?
Speaker 2: Nope, none, zip.
Speaker 1: I think that's amazing because you're, you know, people might be able to tell from watching this cause we only have a head shot of you, but you're about what, six-three [6'3"], six-four [6'4"]?
Speaker 2: Five [6'5"].
Speaker 1: Six-five [6'5"]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know two--
Speaker 2: Two hundred and sixty pounds.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: People normally think I played sports.  I was a band student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I played the trumpet, first chair.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so nobody tried to recruit you for sports?
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: Usually, when a guy's that tall, were you tall when you were young?
Speaker 2: I was tall, and actually they did.  I mean and I made the basketball team, but I just knew it wasn't for me so I just, I didn't do it.  But I did make the basketball team just to prove to myself that I could do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's in high school?
Speaker 2: That was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, were sports a big part of growing up at all, I mean just playing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, outside with my cousins and my brothers, yeah, but they were heavily into sports.  A lot of the reason had to do with I had asthma growing up so I couldn't breathe.  And then my brothers had broken their legs, and I'm being the youngest.  And my mom [Janie Mae Davenport Diggs] was like, nope, you're not doing it.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you get started playing the trumpet?
Speaker 2: My cousin actually played the trumpet and so he talked me into doing that too.
Story_ID: 29733
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanted to go back to a story about your father [John Henry Diggs].  Now, your father was disabled by a cow?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Can you tell us what happened?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He farmed, as I mentioned earlier.  And he got kicked in the side by a cow which disabled him.  And that's what I basically remember.  I've never really known him to really work like a job, job.  I've always known him to be disabled.  I mean he could walk around, but he couldn't do much physical work.  He wasn't wheelchair bound or anything like that, but he was disabled to the point where he shouldn't--if he did overexert himself, then it would cause like severe pain and so.
Speaker 1: What part of his body was kicked?
Speaker 2: He was kicked in the side by a cow when he was farming.
Speaker 1: So did it fracture his ribs or something like?
Speaker 2: I don't know if fractured his rib.  I don't know what actually happened, but I do know, remember them rushing him to the hospital, and I was, oh, I was around seven years old.  I don't know what internal damage it did, but I do know it did some--they declared him disabled.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you also said that your family did tell some ghost stories or hank (ph.) stories (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My dad used to talk about this hank (ph.).  Now, that I know it to mean ghosts that would walk up and down the road (laughter).  I don't know if he would tell us that to scare us, but he spoke of it as if he really believed it.  So.  You know, some guy, some older man would be walking up and down the street in the country, so, well, road.

Speaker 1: Okay, in the country.  Now, this is Alabama, and there's so many, I know the blues is, there's one origins of blues in Alabama, Mississippi, southern states.  Were there any local musicians playing blues around that you know of?
Speaker 2: No, I mean people in the country, they played their guitars, but they weren't like considered musicians in terms of people who knew them, if you're asking that.  But a lot of the local guys, they would come and sit around.  You know, we'd sit out in the yard or on the porch at night, under the tree, and they'd have like fish fries so forth and so on, and they would play their guitars and play those single songs.  I had no idea what they were talking about, but, yeah, that did happen now.
Speaker 1: Okay, but people kind of took it for granted?
Speaker 2: In terms of, took it for granted?
Speaker 1: In terms of it not being something special, just sort of an everyday thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it was something to me.  It was something, for me and my sister, it was hilarious to us, but to the older people, they really, really, really enjoyed that.  So, I guess maybe I took it for granted because maybe I wasn't aware of where it all came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you said you all, did you consider it like old timey or something when you saw it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to me it was old timey, you know, the way (laughter), the way the guy would sing and he would put something on his finger and would go up and down on that guitar.  And, yeah, it was funny to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't anything that you wanted to emulate at the time, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, well, actually I did wanna play the guitar so I started playing.  But his singing, no, cause he was singing some blues song (laughter), about love and drinking and those type of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, you know, a lot of people, a lot of the musicians now, you know, despair that young people really don't even care about that kind of music any more.  But I was wondering.  So you started playing the trumpet in high school?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And you say your cousin introduced you to the trumpet?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, I wanted to play, I initially wanted to play the piano, but, of course, we couldn't afford that.  So, my mom [Janie Mae Davenport Diggs] was like, okay you could be in the band through school.  And that was a one-time fee, trumpet, buying a trumpet was a one-time fee as opposed to taking consecutive lessons each week for the piano.  And then we didn't have a piano either, so how would I practice.  But, so I got in the band through school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you primarily just play the band music or did you branch off into other music?
Speaker 2: Yes, I cannot play by ear.  I can read so I primarily played band music, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy classical music more or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't play classical music.  We played, like I remember the theme from the 'Cosby Show', things like that, things that were of interest to young people, you know, to entice them to get into the band, so I played things like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But classical music, I didn't like classical music growing up.  I mean, but now I do (laughter).  It's interesting how things change.  That's what I have in my office as a matter of fact.
Story_ID: 29735
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to Pike County Elementary School [Alabama], then to--now, where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Pike County High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there a middle school too or just?
Speaker 2: No, cause the high school was seventh through twelfth.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have a favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: I did.  I had a favorite, my favorite subject was AP [Advanced Placement] physiology and anatomy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, because it was just four of us in there, and we thought we were doctors.  So we'd put on our white lab coats and act like we were doctors, Doctor this, pass me the scalpel.  So and so, you know, and those type things.  That was fun to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did you, was it in high school that you first read about Ben Carson?
Speaker 2: It was 19--no, I was out of high school, post-high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, we won't talk about him yet then.  We'll just go to, well, were you involved in, well, what size was your high school first of all?  How many people, how many students?
Speaker 2: Very small.  I know my graduating class was like a hundred, if that.  The school was not that big, maybe seven hundred, I think, total.  I'm talking about from seventh through twelfth.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it was integrated, right?
Speaker 2: Integrated high school.
Speaker 1: Black and white?
Speaker 2: Black and white.
Speaker 1: But you said there was a dual everything.
Speaker 2: It was dual everything, even the leadership, white principal, black vice principal (laughter).  Everything was black and white.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there black teachers in school?
Speaker 2: Very few, mostly white teachers.
Speaker 1: Let's see, now, did you have like clubs and things in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 4H, which I participated in, but my primary thing was band and ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any thoughts of joining the military?
Speaker 2: I did.  Because that was the first, you know, since I was in athletics, that was the first place I won a trophy.  And I won a leadership trophy, and I was, they have like the, what they called the superior cadets.  And that's for the student with the highest grade-point average and highest performance in drilling and uniform preparation, and I won that award.  When the superintendent came, superintendent of the school system, came down and presented to each level, first year, second year, third year, fourth year students so from that, yeah, I thought about the military.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, by the time you were a senior in high school, had you done any travel outside of the area?
Speaker 2: No, no, I hadn't.
Speaker 1: And you hadn't thought about that, had you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't thought about that.  No, I hadn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I went to Six Flags, something like that, if you're asking that.  That's in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: In Atlanta, okay, so you'd been to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but as far as doing extensive travel, like, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Atlanta's something.  It's different, you know, I mean that's someplace else other than, you know, Pike County [Alabama].  I was just wondering if you'd been to like a major city at that point.
Speaker 2: No, Atlanta was probably the major city I'd been to.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did you have a favorite teacher in high school?
Speaker 2: I did, Miss Harden, H-A-R-D-E-N.  Several favorite teachers.  I don't want that, if that's being documented, and she reads that, then if my other favorite teacher reads that, they might get upset.  But she was my science teacher, but she was a historian but because, you know, I guess she had to teach science because they didn't have enough teachers to do that.  But her major, her degree was in history.
Story_ID: 29736
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you really feel that your main interest was science at that point?  Did you feel like you wanted to be a scientist?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I mean I wanted to be, you know, everybody wanted to be, said they're gonna be a doctor.  And that's, when I took those AP [Advanced Placement] courses, I thought about that.  Then I had a change in my life where I received Christ.  Then I was so interested in the Bible that I thought I, I was like, okay, well, let's get a degree in theology or something like that.  Then I come to find out that Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama] does not offer a theology degree because that's not a private school.  It's a public school.  So I chose business.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, how did you choose Alabama A&M as your school?
Speaker 2: Because my brothers had gone before me.  I had three brothers to go there before me.
Speaker 1: All right.  Oh, what did they end up doing for a living?
Speaker 2: One of 'em, the first one, he's a chemist, a chemical engineer in North Carolina.  Then the other one, he started computer science, but he didn't finish.  He's a correctional officer at one of the prisons there in Alabama, and the last one was, he's a mathematician for the government.  So he finished.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you pretty much knew where you were gonna go to college and that you were gonna go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there anything of note, noteworthy, happen for graduation, you know, when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: Anything noteworthy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean are there any stories associated with graduation?
Speaker 2: No, just glad to get out of there (laughter), ready to leave that area.
Speaker 1: So did you have any role in graduation?  Did you speak or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't speak, no, just graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so that's in 19--
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 1: Nineteen Eighty-Eight [1988].
Story_ID: 29737
Speaker 1: Okay, so Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama], now, that's located in--
Speaker 2: Huntsville.
Speaker 1: --Huntsville, Alabama, okay.  Well, tell us about it.  It's a traditionally black school.
Speaker 2: Traditional black school, founded in 1875 by an ex-slave William Hooper Council.  It's a great school.  I mean I met a lot of international students.  I mean it's predominantly black, which means we had some European American students as well there on campus, particularly, at night because the grad school, it was the only school that offered a master's in Education.  The University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] didn't offer a master's in education, neither did they offer an MBA.  So most of the school, the school literally transformed at night.  You would think it was a predominantly white institution at night.  But during the daytime, you know, you had the African American students that were on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that is unusual as to this change of character--
Speaker 2: This character change.
Speaker 1: Well, do you remember who the president was when you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes, President Carl Marbury was the president when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your, you're a business major, right?
Speaker 2: I was a business major.
Speaker 1: And eventually you changed majors?
Speaker 2: Yes, due to, I had a physical science course with a physicist, a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] physicist.  His name is Donald Hodge.  And I was excelling in his course, and he was like, are you sure you're in the right discipline.  He was like if I try physics or if I give you a scholarship, would I try it?  And I told him yes.  And that's how I got in physics.
Speaker 1: So they gave you a scholarship to study physics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, scholarship, I think it was more for minority students to get minority students into the STEM disciplines.  When I say STEM, science, technology, engineering, and math.  So it wasn't an academic scholarship, but it was money available for, to major in physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's pretty, that's fortuitous.  Okay, well, how did you, I mean did you have any trepidation about become a physicist?  Did you know physicists?
Speaker 2: Did not know any physicists though I had met one later on in the church I was going to, Dr. Paul Ruffin who is now an ST or CSI which is the equivalent of a general for the Army.  He's a physicist.  And I saw him, and then when I joined that physics department and started going to National Congress of Black Physicists, National Conference of Black Physics Students, where I heard people like Shirley Ann Jackson who is a black, first black woman to receive a Ph.D..  It just happened to be in Physics from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And now she's the highest paid college president in the nation, at RPI, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  And they had a conference.  They would fly us in every year to promote African Americans in science and engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you play the trumpet in college?
Speaker 2: I did not because of my religious background.  It's funny, but it's true.  I told you I was Pentecostal.  So, Pentecostal is very strict in terms of secular music and dancing and all those type things just wasn't allowed.  So I didn't do it because, you know, HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], the band is gonna really, get down (laughter).  So.
Speaker 1: And so do you regret not having played or?
Speaker 2: No, actually, cause I mean I couldn't all that stuff anyway.  I mean I couldn't, I didn't have an interest to do all that dancing, but you know, I would go to the games and watch the halftime show anyway.  But I couldn't physically do all those, I wasn't a dancer like that; more traditional, core style.
Story_ID: 29738
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you have-- So now from what I've read you're, initially I guess in physics things didn't work out too well.
Speaker 2: Did not (laughter) cause I didn't have physics in high school.  So I didn't know what it was.  I didn't know what I was declaring as a major.  And then I took it, and I failed it.  Actually, I got a "D" on my transcript.  But I failed the course, but we had a comprehensive exam, and my professor was like, okay, whatever you make on your comprehensive exam, then I will give you that grade.  So I made a 61 on it, and that's a, that was equivalent to a "D" at time.  And that's what I have on my transcript.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did the professor say to you after you--
Speaker 2: He said to me that I, (laughter), he said that perhaps I need to change my major cause no one will hire anybody that's dumb.  So.
Speaker 1: That's how he said it?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Now, this was an oriental--
Speaker 2: He was an Asian, Chinese, chairman of the department, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did you take his advice and, like apparently, you didn't, but, you know, why didn't you take his advice and just change?
Speaker 2: Because I knew I wasn't dumb.  I mean it was a different subject matter.  It was a different way of thinking.  You know, in going through high school, high school wasn't as difficult.  But physics was something different.  You know, I had to think differently.  So I just sat down and, you know, looked inside of myself and know that I can do it.  But then I took it again and got a "C" which is really not, it was some improvement from an "F" to a "C".  Then I went to the second part and got a "B".  Then my grades started inclining.  So I stayed with the subject.
Speaker 1: Now, was it at this juncture that you read a book by Ben Carson?
Speaker 2: Yes, how he almost failed chemistry in the pre-med program when he was at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticutt].  And he was, he's a Christian.  He makes that very known in his book, and his mother didn't have an education, third-grade education, and how he read many books.  He was an in-depth learner and how he rose to the head of the neurology department at age thirty-three.  And people told him not to even go in medicine or he shouldn't try neuro science and things of that nature.  So, similar stories, cause he can do it; I can do it (unclear).
Speaker 1: All right.  So did any actual person there at Alabama A&M encourage you to continue?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Paul Ruffin, he was there.  The secretary of the physics department, her name is Mary Strong.  She was a pastor's wife, and she would always tell me that, "Oh, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you're smarter than what you think you are", you know.  And this guy named Michael Henry who was also a doctoral student, that would always pull me to the side and encourage me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did have some support?
Speaker 2: I had a support system, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, were your brothers of any use in terms of that, of encouraging you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother would, my brother that's a couple of years older than me, he would--we were roommates for the first, not even the whole semester.  He was pretty bright, you know, math, so he was like, "Oh, you can, you can do this stuff; just got to focus, sit down and do it."  And I believed, and I did it, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, you think you would have preserved without any encouragement?
Speaker 2: I mean, well, I don't know.  Without any encouragement?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean would you have believed, been inclined to believe your professor that it's not--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  No, that's not my history (laughter).  No, I didn't, I didn't, I mean I didn't even internalize him.  I didn't even get angry with him for that.  Most people were like, why ooh, I wouldn't have liked that.  But no, I didn't internalize what he said because I was trained like that at home.  You know, you can do whatever you wanna do, just sit down and do it.  It may take you time, some time to do it, but you can.  So that's the reason (unclear).  I mean that's pride, that's determination.  You can do whatever you wanna do.  So I didn't internalize what he was saying, no.  I don't know if that was reverse psychology or what?  Could have been.
Story_ID: 29739
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, tell me now, did you, I guess, how did you manage to choose physics say over, was it because of the scholarship attached to it or I mean over, you know, pre-med or biology or some other science?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean initially it was because of the scholarship attached to it.  And then when I got in it and started going to the conferences and saw that they were, you know, the professor, the people had Ph.D.s, very few where I was, you know, saying statements like, you know, we need African Americans in these fields, in universities and to stay with it, and I just did it.
Speaker 1: In those days, was there any particular physics project or idea that really captured your imagination?
Speaker 2: No, actually, this guy came in and gave a talk on laser's, Dr. Davenport, I wanna say that's his name.  But he's a laser physicist and he had seminars and I really was impressed with him in this seminar that he gave.  It was a Power Point presentation, but it still was good, overhead, not Power Point.
Speaker 1: Yeah, overhead in those days, yeah, that was the way to do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But so, as your grades went up, I mean what did you see, did you project where you wanted to take the study of physics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I was, you know, they would tell us in these conferences, if you're gonna do physics, then you have to take it to the advanced degree level.  So I knew that going in, and so I knew I was gonna get at least a master's degree in physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause a second. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, we have speed again.
Speaker 2: Okay, so when you're in college had you ever heard of a black physicist in your whole life?
Speaker 1: No, never.
Speaker 2: All right, and when was it when you finally realized that there were some black physicists out here and quite a few of them?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there was one on my, in Huntsville [Alabama], we had one black physicist, but he was a, I don't know if I saw him as physicist, but he was professor, so I didn't equate him as, he was a theoretical physicist so I didn't equate him to being an experimentalist.  But when I went to the conferences saw that there is a community of African American physicists, then I knew then that, that is reality so.
Story_ID: 29740
Speaker 1: Okay, well, who were some of the people you met at the conferences?
Speaker 2: I met Bill Gates [sic, Sylvester James Gates].  I met Keith Jackson.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Bill Gates, not the Microsoft Bill Gates--
Speaker 2: Not the Microsoft Bill Gates.
Speaker 1: This is the black physicist, Bill Gates.
Speaker 2: The black physicist.
Speaker 1: He has an interesting hair style, right?
Speaker 2: Interesting hair style, University of Maryland, College Park, extreme theory guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, he's on the cutting edge of theoretical physics, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he is very prominent in the field.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us, you know, just tell us about him a little bit.  What is, how'd you meet him and?
Speaker 2: I met him during a tutorial in quantum mechanics.  And he's brilliant.  As a matter of fact, I always credit him in terms of helping me pass my qualifiers for the Ph.D..  There's an exam you have to take in order to be a Ph.D. candidate.  And you only have two tries.  And if you fail it, then you have to go to another discipline.  But he broke quantum mechanics down so easy, it was like I couldn't believe how simple it was.  And he was, and he convinced me that it really is that simple, that a lot of times, people who teach it, teach it and make it very difficult.  So, but it was very simple.  He was brilliant in doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were in college, is that when you had the discussion with him about religion?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was in a ETTA (ph.) conference, and he was talking about, you know, he's a physicist, and he was talking about the Big Bang Theory and how particles, you know, started the world, so forth and so on, he's like, right? Right?  And I was like, no.  (Laughter) I'm not gonna sit up here and let you tell me that that God does not exist.  And I'm not gonna agree with you.  You can say that, but I'm not gonna agree with you.
Speaker 1: Is that what he was really trying to tell you, that God doesn't exist?
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't necessarily trying to say that God doesn't exist, but he was trying to talk about how the world was, earth was created.  And I was like, you know, well, I do believe the Big Bang Theory.  God said it, and "bang", it happened, but I don't believe like he was trying to say.  He wasn't necessarily trying to push religion.  He was being scientific in his approach, which I do understand.  But when he said, right?  That means he's looking for people to say, yea.  And so I said, nay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you find that you often have to, I mean defend religion when you deal with physicists who are talking about the origins of the universe and origins of things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sometimes people ask me how can I be a physicist and believe in God at the same time.  And my question is "How can you not be one, how can you not--how can you be a physicist and not believe in God?"  I mean the universe is too structured, too ordered.  I mean, that didn't just evolve (unclear) in random like that.  That's, that's crazy.  You could throw things up and things don't just randomly happen into order like that, even in natural (unclear).  So, but then that's a leap of faith.  I can't prove God, and they can't disprove God.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So it hasn't been a, there hasn't been a impediment to you succeeding as a physicist?
Speaker 2: No, no, because most of the greats, like Albert Einstein, they all believed in God, you know, they called it a higher power or someone greater than the universe.  They were believers in some supernatural being that governed the universe.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, but you and Professor Gates [Sylvester James Gates] became friends, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, during conferences he ate, I don't know if he remember this, but he came in and we had breakfast together.  And he remembered me because I basically called him out during one of his sessions.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that didn't prove a barrier to--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this--he usually goes by Williams Gates or--
Speaker 2: James.
Speaker 1: James?
Speaker 2: Gate.
Speaker 1: James Gate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I think it's William Gates--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that's how you get to Bill.
Speaker 2: Bill, right, yeah.
Story_ID: 29741
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well what else happened in college?  Now, you, Huntsville [Alabama] is the site of a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], it's a NASA site, and it's also like the space camp--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for kids, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I think I remember you were involved in Space Camp?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to work there.  I was what they called at the time an educational lecturer at the Space Camp, and I taught astronomy and optics.  And I did telescope viewing and those type things for the students, taught Mars exploration, the shuttle, space shuttle timeline to the kids.  I taught them what, you know, how they eat in space, how they sleep in space, how they prepare their food, how they use the rest room cause that was one of the main questions the kids wanted (laughter) to know, you know, those type things, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do they use the rest rooms (laughter)?
Speaker 2: The kids explain it, you know, there is such a thing called, they call it the slinger, you know, when you use the rest room, if you have to use, if they call it the number two, you have to be strapped in because, you know, the kids say, you know, what if--these are the kids questions, like what happens if you pass gas?  Do you become a solid rocket booster, I mean cause you're in zero gravity (laughter).  So you have to be strapped in, you know, and held down and do your thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: So this is just when you would like shoot out across the room or something?
Speaker 2: You could, I mean you're gonna move and some type of force is gonna take place.  So you, and then number one, you have to, I forgot what they call that, but it's a vacuum that pulls the urine out into a type of container because otherwise it would float, I mean, and you don't want that (laughter).
Story_ID: 29742
Speaker 1: All right, just back to the Space Camp again.  It took special training for you to be able to be an instructor in Space Camp.  It's not something that physicists learn in school?
Speaker 2: Right, the information about the Space Program is not something you learn in classroom.  So they had instructors, and they have different books that we have to read and go through to familiarize ourselves with the information so I can teach it adequately, so.  Yeah, but you don't learn it in school because (unclear) space rockets, I mean space program to our nation, such as, I mean people may say, okay, they can guess like cable TV and diapers, dehydrated foods and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: So these are all byproducts of the space program.
Speaker 2: These are byproducts of the space program.
Speaker 1: Have gone into popular culture and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Everybody.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think Teflon, that what they--
Speaker 2: Teflon, yes.
Speaker 1: --that's what they coated one of the presidents with, I think (laughter).
Speaker 2: Teflon, yes, that's a tremendous one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mylar, (unclear) balloons, so things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you said you learned a lot from the students too?
Speaker 2: I did, I mean in terms of what it takes to be an astronaut, like even height restrictions, like I'm [six-five] 6'5" which I'm too tall.  I didn't know that.  You know, you would think anybody who wanted to be one, they could be an astronaut, like even about Mars, like two moons, the names, Phobos and Demos, or those type things.  What's the hottest planet in the solar system?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: Mercury, I think.
Speaker 2: See, you said Mercury.  That's incorrect.  It's Venus (laughter).  So the kids were teaching those type things, and Venus because it's, Mercury's the closest, but Venus is the hottest because of the Greenhouse effect on the surface of the planet.  So, it traps the heat in.  Things, little things like that, trivial, but it adds knowledge to the universe if you don't know those type things.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Okay, so did you have any other jobs in college?
Speaker 2: I did.  I worked at KFC [Kentucky Fried Chicken]--
Speaker 1: That's a little less scientific (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I would do my little hustle cause you know, I lived on campus.  And so at the end of work, I would sell the food.  (Laughter) I don't know if I should put that on tape (laughter) because the kids were hungry and the cafeteria closest at like, 6:00 [p.m.] and I was making like a hundred dollars [$100] a night, you know, pretty good.  I was known as the chicken man, on campus (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was a pretty good hustle.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear) hustle.
Story_ID: 29743
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you join any fraternities or anything?
Speaker 2: No fraternities, no, I did not join any fraternities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and did you go to a lot of parties and things?
Speaker 2: I did not go to any parties.  Again, I tell you my upbringing was very strict so I avoided all those venues, not to judge anybody else.  It's just not, something I was into, I was heavily involved in my church.  I was always doing something there, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you think being involved with the church helped you focus on your studies?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, I know it did because a lot of my friends, you know, my classmates who did all, a lot of the partying, the next semester, they were not there.  They failed, flunked out of school.  So, yeah, church really helped me focus.  And my pastor, Dr. Harris, and the Pentecostal churches is, like the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church, education is very strong.  A lot of people are educated, and you have to go to school to be a pastor in the AME church, get a degree.  But for the Pentecostal church, it's not the case.  So my pastor had a Ph.D., earned Ph.D., and he was, also he had a degree in math and he was a computer scientist from Jackson State [University] in Mississippi, so he was a role model for me in terms of pursuing, you can be in the church and pursue your academics at the same time.  So, that was a tremendous role model to me, so, influence on my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were a senior in college, getting ready to get this bachelor of science in physics and, well, what standards did you have as a senior?  Had your grades gone up to the point where you were an honor student yet or?
Speaker 2: I was not, no.  I was a "C" student.  It was, I graduated with a 2.7.  I mean throughout the course, I had made, I was an honor student in terms of, I mean honor roll, the Dean's List, the National Dean's List throughout the course, but then there was a certain period my grades declined because of the physics courses and then on the incline in the end.  When your grades start, when your grades drop, like when I went in my first semester, I only had a like a 3.8 cause I was in business, something like that, but when your grades start to dropping, it's hard to get those grades back up cause you have to take courses over and stay at school longer and longer.  It took me six years anyway because I changed my major from business to physics.  So I didn't have any, I had to go back and take like the calculus and differential equations and all those type courses.  So I did finish the physics curriculum in four years.
Speaker 1: All right.  So this is like 19, where are we now?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-four [1994].
Story_ID: 29744
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994], okay.  So you graduate with a B.S..  Now, did you immediately go into the master's program?
Speaker 2: Immediately, in the summer.  I graduated in May, went to grad school in the summer.
Speaker 1: And you went at the same school right?
Speaker 2: Same school.
Speaker 1: Alabama A&M [Alabama Mechanical and Agricultural University, Huntsville, Alabama].
Speaker 2: A&M University.
Speaker 1: Did you have some of the same teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, yeah.  Not for the undergraduate physics courses in terms of like the basic physics courses, like intro to physics, those professors did not teach graduate school, but the one who taught my, the quantum mechanics and the electricity magnetism, they were, some of them were graduate professors.  And you have people from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] that'll come out and be adjunct professors as well, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, as you progressed further into physics, did you, were there enough--well, I supposed in school there were, but I just wonder, were there enough people that you could talk to about what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had developed friends.  I had a lot of Asian friends (laughter) who helped me out cause you know, physics is extremely mathematically rigorous.  And that, from what I've seen at my school, that was the Asian students' strong point.  And then I had American friends, then the conferences I would go to, and then we would help each other out.  We would stay in and study all night sometimes to get our work done, but we did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess what I'm getting at is due to the small number of blacks in the hard sciences, did you find yourself like in black society without, you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, because A&M was, no, A&M was, because A&M was a predominantly black school, we had blacks physics majors in graduate school.  So we all stuck together in our course work.  We basically arranged our schedules the same, you know, to take this class together, this class together, and we studied together.  So, that's how we got through.
Speaker 1: That'd be the difference in, you know, we interviewed Dr. Larry Gladney and Dr. Carl Spight and others who really felt isolated at a certain point.  And whenever they'd go back to the community, they couldn't talk about anything they were doing because nobody understood what they were talking about.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you had fellow travelers with you that made a difference?
Speaker 2: Right, as a matter fact, some, I would hear stories at the conference like some students Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia] were failing because they didn't have any support.  But then Georgia Tech started recruiting more African American students and those students who were failing became stellar students and graduated at the top of their courses.  So, yeah, that's very important, having a support group.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, this is something that, you know, white students take for granted usually that they study groups and support groups, you know, where they're comfortable.
Speaker 2: Right, a lot of times, even when I, at post graduate, when I got here, I went to school at the University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio].  It's interesting because I ran into, you know, took a course where the white students didn't wanna study with the black students.  I did it on purpose just to see if they would, could I study with you if we study?  But they would study together and have information, but were not willing to share, which was very interesting to me.  I didn't have to run into that being at a black school.  But I did see it at a predominantly white school.
Speaker 1: And it's still alive?
Speaker 2: Alive and well, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So how was graduate school?  Was it easier than undergraduate school?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say it was easier, but I had to be, I was more focused because I had to take all the other courses.  I knew this is physics, it's what I gotta do, and I also knew that, you know, you can't make any "C"s in graduate school too, so that kinda helped, it helped a lot.  So, you can, but it's not good.  You know, I think one or two, they allow that (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, by this time, are you really driven by an interest in physics?
Speaker 2: I was, but I was also driven by the fact that I wanted to bring my grades up.  I wanted to prove to myself, you know, that I can do this particular work. So I knew that with a 2.7 that wasn't gonna, that, I mean that's the average, I think, in terms of scientists engineers across the nation.  But I knew if I wanted to, really wanted to market myself, I had to bring my grades up at least above a three.  So.
Story_ID: 29745
Speaker 1: Okay, now were there any special teachers or mentors in graduate school that you remember?
Speaker 2: I do.  The same guy that called me dumb (laughter)--
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Dr. Wong, and he probably doesn't remember that, but he did.  I remember it.  He became an advocate I mean for me in terms of helping me out and giving me extra books to read.  And he started to see, when he saw my determination, cause I was, even in graduate school, you know, because I knew that I didn't do as well as I could have or should have, I still would go to undergraduate courses and sit in the coursework and literally do the work again, but without a grade to strengthen my foundation in physics cause the goal is to master it, right, master your subjects.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your master's thesis about?  What did you write about?
Speaker 2: My master's thesis was in fiber optics.  I built a fiber optic temperature sensor.
Speaker 1: You built a fiber optics temperature sensor?
Speaker 2: Right, a, you know, it's basically a fiber that was, you know, we had built a glass oven around the fiber and then we put like a Bunsen burner under the glass and see how the, how the light, there's a light that propagates through the heated portion of this fiber, see what it looks like on the exit end of the fiber.  So, because with the heat, the fiber up then it's gonna expand and then contract, and the light is gonna change.  So temperature sense, it's sensing heat.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so any stories about your master's degree before we move on to Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Not really (laughter).
Story_ID: 29746
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when did you go to Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: I went to Wisconsin when I was an undergraduate student?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was an internship at the University of Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: An internship up in Madison [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: In Madison.
Speaker 1: Okay, was that, you know, was there anything unique about that experience that you--?
Speaker 2: Not until I got here [Dayton, Ohio].  I mean, again, like Ben Carson said, no knowledge is wasted.  The work that I did there as a student, I was doing that here, my first job, you know, in terms of looking at different materials and how they adhere to certain surfaces, the different tapes, I mean different techniques to measure that.  Like if you wanna check a material will not adhere to a certain surface, all you have to do is get a piece of Scotch tape and put it across the material and then pull it.  If it comes up, it's not good.  If it stays, it's great.  So, and I ended up doing that here, not knowing that that would play a role here in the Air Force Research Laboratory.  It was my first job, so.
Story_ID: 29747
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, tell us about the Ph.D..  Now, you went to the, you received your Ph.D. from the same school--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama].  Now, how many, is it unusual for, well, I know it is, because there aren't many traditionally black colleges or historically black colleges that have Ph.D. programs in the hard sciences?
Speaker 2: Right, not many.  I wanna say, Alabama A&M, I think Howard [University, Washington D.C.] and, Howard, I wanna say Norfolk State[University, Norfolk, Virginia] maybe and Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  I think those four offer a Ph.D. in physics.  I don't wanna say TSU, Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I think they are in engineering, something like that but not in physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that is unusual.  So, now, what was your Ph.D. dissertation?
Speaker 2: My Ph.D. dissertation was in chemical sensing, chemical and biological sensing which is relevant for the Air Force in terms of being able to sense and detect harmful biological agents.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that is about that, sensing harmful biological agents.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how, what's the application of that, I guess activity?
Speaker 2: Now, like if they feel that the next wave will be perhaps chemical warfare.  So if I come into your environment and release something that you can't see or smell or taste, like carbon monoxide which is very deadly and you can't see it and you can't taste it, you can't smell it.  So that's why people succumb to it.  But there are devices in place that can detect those harmful agents, although the physical senses can't pick it up.  And so like even if Iraq, if someone comes and puts some deadly pathogen in your water supply and you don't know it's there, then you'll drink it unknowingly, and could possibly die.  But then there are devices you can make to put in the water and say okay, there's something there or improvised explosive devices which is a chemical.  You can say, okay, you can scan the area and say, okay, that's TNT or RDX, which say that's a potential harmful device there, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what specific substances did you, were you able to detect through your (unclear)--
Speaker 2: We did, to demonstrate the proof of concept, we did, we detect ammonia and we mixed it in different ambient air, like under so many parts per million because of those, it'd be very sensitive to (unclear) the system, the smallest amount in the greatest volume of air.
Story_ID: 29748
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, were there any stories about your Ph.D., was there any portion of your work extremely, I mean difficult to the point that you thought about not finishing?
Speaker 2: No, but I did fail my qualifiers.  And the qualifier exam is when you have, is to, if you pass it, you then become a Ph.D. candidate.  Sometimes you hear people saying they're working on their Ph.D., but the question is, if, in science, if you have not passed your qualifiers' exam, then you are not legitimately a Ph.D. candidate.  So the first time I took that, I did fail it.  And then I took six months off, and buckled down and did it again, and studied and passed it.  So, that's the biggest story.  Oh, my advisor was like, I'm not gonna let you go.  I'm not gonna--I don't care if it take you a hundred years to get your dissertation, you're gonna do it (laughter), those type things.
Speaker 1: That's what your advisor told you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who was your advisor at that time?
Speaker 2: His name was Dr. Sergei Sarkisov. He was from Russia, from the Ukraine, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so by that time, at this juncture, they're not gonna let you not get your degree, I guess (laughter), right?
Speaker 2: Right, but you have to work for it though, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you think it's an advantage to going, to be in a program where you go straight through like that in the same school or do you wish that you had gone to some other, Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] or some place or some other place to get your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I mean it's, it's not good in the sense that, you know, you want, you can get somebody else's perspective, but for me, for what I wanted to do, you know, it was okay cause I wanted to stay in Alabama.  So, and I wanted to teach at an HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].  So that was good for me in those regards, but as far as my education being inferior in terms of, because physics is physics everywhere.  You can't--that's one subject that doesn't change.  Math, I mean calculus is calculus, and physics is physics.  You know, it may not be, I may not get to the extent that a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] student may have, but we have the same foundation.  So I can launch myself to where they are if they're stronger in particular subjects.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you have no regrets about--
Speaker 2: Not at all because the heritage is so rich, you know, you gain more than just--education is not merely the impartation of knowledge.  Education is also the communication of an experience to a people, to a race.  So you get more than just knowledge impartation.  You get experience.  And for me particularly, the black experience, which I appreciate.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you received your Ph.D. in what year?
Speaker 2: In ninety--no, I'm sorry, 2001.
Story_ID: 29749
Speaker 1: Okay, now what were your, I can imagine you were probably sought after, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I interviewed with Lawrence Livermore National Labs in Livermore, California, Brookhaven [National Labs] in New York, several companies in Alabama, Boeing in Alabama and in Los Angeles, so yeah, and here.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you end up choosing Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Truthfully, (laughter) because after September 11th, you know, all those options closed, and Wright Patterson stayed open.  And--
Speaker 1: So, now, why did the other options close?
Speaker 2: I think that after the terrorist attack, like people stopped hiring.  It was a freeze on a lot of the hiring, in the national labs and contractors because everybody was being, I guess, possibly jeopardized.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now what was the nature of the job?  What was your position when you came to Wright-Patterson and did you have any trepidation about coming to Dayton [Ohio] or--?
Speaker 2: I did, because it was, I mean I'm from the South.  So the winter, I was not looking forward to, not knowing anything about the Air Force Research Laboratory because it's not popular.  In the South, you know, we have the army bases.  I knew the Army Research Lab, I knew the Navy Research Laboratory, but I didn't know anything about the Air Force Research Laboratory.  But other than that, I began to read about it, and then I thought it was a great place to work, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started here in 2001?
Speaker 2: December of 2001.
Speaker 1: December of 2001, okay.  And what did you work on?
Speaker 2: I worked, my first job, I was working with polymers, poll polymers.
Speaker 1: What are those?
Speaker 2: Oh, polymers (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because anybody listening to this (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked with polymers, but poll polymers (unclear).  Actually, studying different materials for electro-optic communication devices.  So that was the end goal, so we had to study the material properties of these materials to make sure that they could actually work in our applications.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the goal is communications, optical communications.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see on the material we have, there was quite a number of publications for you.  Most of them came out in 2003--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --concerning the application of polymers and opto-electronic devices.
Speaker 2: Right, and that's what I was speaking about.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what you were talking about, okay.  So, who has written, there's you and there are a few other authors, maybe five other people.
Speaker 2: Right, co-authors.
Speaker 1: Co-authors.
Speaker 2: I mean first author, then co-authors, some papers (unclear).
Story_ID: 29750
Speaker 1: And now, what is organic photonic--I'm trying to read my own writing here, yeah, materials.  What's organic photonic materials?
Speaker 2: Organic is dealing with, that's dealing with DNA.  We were studying different properties of DNA derived from salmon wastes, salmon sperm, salmon eggs, and we were processing that material for our applications.  So it's organic material.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what, okay, so you're studying organic materials in-- Organic means that it's, you know, it's--
Speaker 2: It's living.  From a living being.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so that's a bio-material, which is now hot, you know, people now are looking at bio-fossil, fossil materials for application because you can have a great source.  You have like, like this is waste.  Like we get this material from Japan which has a great salmon industry.  And so they just throw a lot of the byproducts away.  So (unclear) ideas of ways we can use these materials for something.  And we processed it and low and behold, it was great material for what we were trying to do here.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is a new trend really where physicists are using--
Speaker 1: DNA, DNA, you normally talk about DNA in terms of crime scene investigation or trying to determine whether or not someone is the parent or somebody's lineage or so forth and so on but we're using for optical communication devices.
Speaker 2: Okay, by optic, visual communications?
Speaker 1: Light.
Speaker 2: Light?
Speaker 1: Light emitting, like LED's, light-emitting devices, displays that will light up.
Speaker 2: So is this material from salmon actually, I mean it's like photo sensitive, I mean it lights up?
Speaker 1: It's photo sensitive, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: You know, of course, it's not the material alone.  It's in conjunction with other materials that will give you the properties that you need to generate the light that we're looking for.
Speaker 2: Okay, now has any of that material, I guess, been a part of anything that we'd be familiar with?
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a display.  You see displays that light up all the time, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, like in your cell phone or your TV?
Speaker 1: Cell phone displays, LED's, LCD's, things like that, yeah.  That's what we're moving towards.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So these are materials that you guys could grow in a laboratory, I mean or create through genetics or something?
Speaker 1: Actually, that particular material is from Japan, the Japanese researchers over there, Chatulsi (ph.) Institute ship it to us, and then we process it, you know, wherever we want it, but the DNA is purified DNA from them.
Speaker 2: So it has to be processed by them first before you--
Speaker 1: And then further processed here.
Story_ID: 29751
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what's been, I guess--now, you've been, you've received quite a bit of recognition in the past few years.  There's been, you received the Black Engineer of the Year Award in 2004 in the category of the most promising scientist in government.  You received, you were recognized as one of the top fifty Most Important Blacks in Research Science that same year.  In 2005, you received the top Minority in Science Trailblazer Award.  You were also one of the five distinguished African American physicists to appear in a National television public service announcement for the World Year of Physicists in 2005 in celebration of Albert Einstein.  I mean there's a lot of--you were profiled at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry too, I think, for black creativity back in 2005.  So what, I mean, do you have a response to all this recognition?  I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: When people ask me, I give them the real answer.  I mean I like it, but when they say how do you, how did it happen?  I just, I tell them God.  I mean I don't, God and prayer, and being, I guess being in the right place at the right time.  I don't know.  That Black Engineer of the Year Award was, that's highly competitive, and I won that, being, only being like, being on the job a year and six or eight months.  And I was, you know, in the category competing with people who had been on the job for a while.  And the guy who was on the committee that they select, he was telling me that because I was a Sunday school teacher, and I was tutoring, and I was active with the youth, cause you're more than just an engineer or a scientists.  You have to be communally responsible also.  And he was like, a lot of the applications don't, they highlight all of their educational credentials and never show where they give anything back to the community.  He was like, that part of me pushed me over the top.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think it's a stereotypical image of scientists, you know, rocket scientists or something, you know, lab coat, in a laboratory all day, kind of myopic in their views, you know, and not really participating in the community, you know, just always thinking about calculations and, you know, that--I mean, so you don't fit that stereotype?
Speaker 2: No, because I agree with Carter G. Woodson, if you do that, then you're clearly not educated.  I really believe that because again, I said earlier, that education is not merely the impartation of knowledge.  Education is also the communication of experience to a race.  So I have a responsibility to educate and a responsibility to help somebody else along the way.  You can have a degree and miss the education is what I'm saying, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you speak to a lot of young people?
Speaker 2: Often, yeah.  I do a lot of public speaking in, here in Dayton [Ohio], Alabama.  I spoke to a lot of the universities here too, UD [University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio], Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio], and on base [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio].  I do like the Black History.  I did the MLK [Martin Luther King] ceremony for another agency here on base in January.  So I just did like, did U-D's diversity lecture series a couple of weeks ago.
Speaker 1: And you enjoy speaking?
Speaker 2: I love speaking, love public speaking, yes.  I love telling people my story, love telling me what they, you know, encourage people that they can do whatever they wanna do and not to live their lives in the words or thoughts of other people and don't see them as, you know, they're just obstacles, you know, that's all.  But find a way to overcome it.  They can believe what they want.  When someone tells you they can't, you can't do something, what they're saying is that they can't, not you.  So.  You know, (unclear) I believe like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 29752
Speaker 1: All right, so what would be your advice to young people who wanna get involved in the sciences today?
Speaker 2: I would tell them to, first study hard.  Well, I also, when I do motivational speaking, I always bring that component of the character because if you get your character straight, then that will dictate your work ethics in terms of, you know, your character will say, study.  You know, you should be shouldn't be going to this party, or hanging out when you should be trying to master your craft.  So if you're gonna study, if you're gonna do science, then you have to know it because people are gonna pay you for that.  And you can't go in with a weak foundation because if you do, like in this field, this is about saving lives.  So if I'm not good at my work, then somebody could be handed over here.  So I would tell them to work hard, study, develop the concept of subject mastery.
Story_ID: 29753
Speaker 1: Okay, when you consider like what your expertise is right now, how would you describe yourself as a physicist?  I know that some people are particle physicists, some are theoretical physicists?
Speaker 2: I'm more of an applied physicist.  When I say that, lab, experimental-type person.  But then now, as I get older, I think I'm shifting more from the lab to more, I wouldn't say program management type person, but I know I'm more people oriented now, you know, in terms of teaching, a teaching physicist, of that nature.  So, but in my early career, of course, bench-level science in the lab, trying to figure things out type of person.
Speaker 1: Okay, and earlier we were discussing religion and science.  Do you have a personal philosophy of how they go together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Genesis I.  "In the beginning, God created heaven and the earth", I mean everything is there.  I mean, and that's why, that's another reason why I like it because I look physics as, okay, hey, I'm studying about God, just in the physical sense as opposed to like a preacher who will study things spiritually, in a spiritual sense, you know, things you can't see, like a person's heart, a person's mind, the way they think.  But I have physical things that God has put his wisdom into that I can extract to get an understanding of how things work in nature.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, does this world keep you in awe?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.  It's a lot we don't know.  You can't know it all.  You can't learn it all.
Speaker 1: Is there any one things that's really moved you the most in terms of learning about that you didn't know about before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, planetary motion, how, you know, you have the sun and you have all these planets revolving around this big mass, you know, and how one planet, like we talked about the Venus.  You know, how can that be?  One planet and Mercury's closer, and Venus is hotter, how can one planet have its day longer than its year, things like that, which is Venus by the way (laughter).  The day on Venus is longer than its year.  In other words, it rotates on its axis slower than it goes around the sun as opposed to like what we have twenty-four hours in a day.  Well, a day on Venus is like 240-some earth days.  To me that's mind boggling, and I like it.
Speaker 1: So science is redefining some things we take for granted that we know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Like we know what a day is, but we really don't.  It's not the same all over.
Speaker 2: And it puts you, you know, in a place where you're not in control.  You're not in control of everything like some people wanna feel, you know.  Man feels like if they're not in control, then they can't mess with it.  They'll throw something, they'll throw some name on it, at it.  But me, who I throw at it, I give it back to God as found in Genesis I.
Speaker 1: Now, some people that are religious feel that scientists go too far and they try to know too much.  Do you ever have that feeling?
Speaker 2: No, unless they try to make claims that's not true.  I mean if the physics is there and the science is relevant, whether they give credit to God or not, those of us who are Christians, we know who did it.  We also know who's the one that's giving them understanding, to understand it.  We also know that God the one that's opened their understanding so that, to perceive what's taking place even in these different natural phenomenon's.  So, you can search.  I don't have a problem with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I have a problem with people who, someone trying to make claims as if they are God or try to say that God doesn't exist, you know, but that's their own personal belief, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --like Stephen Hawking, 'Hawking's Universe', very brilliant man, a paraplegic physicist, but he doesn't pray to God for anything.
Speaker 1: Now, you're familiar with Dr. Ronald Mallet, right, of the Time Travel--
Speaker 2: I am.  I met him growing up in, when I was a student in physics conferences, and I heard him speak on time travel at Wright State [University, Dayton Ohio].  And he's from the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Mansfield, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Is there any black physicist now who's been out here a while that you have the most respect for or think is the brightest, I mean at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, again [Sylvester James] Gates.  He is very, very bright, and you always see him on 'Nova', expounding on physics and science.  And he encourages the youth too, and that's very important to me.  So.
Story_ID: 29754
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're a member of some organizations here.  I know you're a member of the National Society of Black Physicists and the National Society of Black Engineers, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the Optical Society of America?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, some people may be surprised that there are enough black physicists to make a society, but there are, right?
Speaker 2: There are.  I mean I wanna say, there's like thirty thousand European American physicists.  But, I'm talking about Ph.D.s.  I think that it's like about three thousand, it's three thousand African American Ph.D.s in the nation.
Speaker 1: Well, that's not that different from the percentage of the general population.  Black people are about 11-1/2 percent of the general population, and 10 percent of them are physicists.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear), (simultaneous), yeah, not too bad.
Speaker 1: That's really not under representative, not too far under.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we need to do better though (laughter), three thousand, somewhere in there.  It might be less than that, maybe 1,500.  I don't know.  I forgot what number I read.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, if it's three thousand, it's about 10 percent.  But if it's not, then, I mean I don't know if people's expectations would not be that there would be 1,500 I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I mean if, and now we're falling short. So, and that's why I do a lot of public speaking because America, not just in the African American community, but across the board, students are not declaring any of the STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math] disciplines as their academic majors, you know.  They're just not interested in it.
Speaker 1: Is there still like special money available for black students who go into those STEM disciplines?
Speaker 2: Minorities, women, I mean there's a great deal of intellectual capital existing in the minority community, in females.  I was reading one article that said if, the way we use, with the way we do not use the talent or the wealth that we find among women in science, the stock market wouldn't do that because that would be considered a tremendous waste.  And I agree with that, you know.  It's just untapped.  And it's not encouraged because when you talk about, in homes, most people say, well, I want my son to be a doctor or a lawyer or a teacher or fireman or a policeman.  But you never, you rarely hear, unless they've been exposed to science, a chemist or physicist or, you know, or engineer.
Speaker 1: Now, I would guess that a lot of black households don't know what a physicist is.
Speaker 2: Right, cause I didn't know what it was (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, now, what is the Optical Society of America?
Speaker 2: It's exactly what you saying.  It's composed of a lot of physicists, white and black, of course, not just--people who are interested in the optical sciences, interested in the study of light, you know, how light interacts with materials, how could you use light to promote science.
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess there's another we ought to point out here is that in 2006, you were invited to attend and speak at the U. S. Air Force in Taiwan, Nano Science Initiative held Taipei, Taiwan?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was invited by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research to do that.  We have a collaborative effort with them in Nano Science Technology, and proposals and things of that nature they submit to the U. S.  And I was selected to, as a matter of fact, selected to evaluate one, chemical sensing which was my Ph.D. and that's how I got pulled onto that.  As a result, I was, you know, selected by the Air Force R to attend the conference.
Story_ID: 29755
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're currently, it says here that you're attending classes at the University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not this semester.  I was taking courses in the electro optics department because a lot of my work was dealing electro-optics.  And I wasn't that strong in electro-optics, so since, and they pay for it, so why not.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a profession where you're constantly learning new--
Speaker 2: You have to constantly learn, yeah, which is not bad because the, I mean the science doesn't change, but the technology may change, the approach to it will change.  But the fundamental science does not change.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see.  Oh, it says also here that you're a distant learning student at the Air War College, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Air War College is professional military education that is not required for me to take it, but it does put me in a position to be more marketable if I wanna move within the Air Force in terms of promotions and things of that nature.  So their courses generally require four people who have been here for years like, say colonels and generals and people up in those-type ranks.  So I wanted to go ahead and get it out of the way now, while I'm young, so, to do it, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what do you consider, you're still, you're like thirty, what?
Speaker 2: Seven [37].
Speaker 1: Thirty seven, and you've got a lot of years ahead of you.
Speaker 2: I hope so (laughter).
Speaker 1: What are your future plans?  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Speaker 2: In ten years, I see myself still doing science.  I would like to do more, I mean when I say more, more or less I'm speaking, I'm talking about nationally, more of that.  I'd also wanna teach some courses because I'm not doing that at all, and still probably working doing science somewhere, and teaching some classes.  I really would like to go to an HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] because that's where the need is, you know.  I mean we need African American teachers on predominantly white campuses too, but I particularly like the HBCU's because those, that's the group of people where people feel like, oh, no, no, un-un, because even now, you know, when we talk about schools in the city, we always hear UD [University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio], Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio] and even Sinclair, but we never hear Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] or Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Right, and they're prominent right here.
Speaker 2: And they're prominent right here, and been, and was here before any of the other schools were here.  So, which speaks volumes about this particular area, to me.  People don't like to talk about that, but I mean it is what it is.  It's not about being racist or about being prejudice for a particular group.  It's just the truth.  You know, this is the truth.  It's my perception.  It's my reality and it causes people to examine what's going on, on the inside of them.  Well, you know, we got this school over here.  Why not tap into that, and if you feel like they're capable, then why not send some of your people over there to teach as a part of their job, if you, you know, if they wanna do some career broadening in education cause a lot of times, most of the people, when they retire, they roll off into the universities anyway.  So build it if you feel like it's not competent enough.
Speaker 1: Okay, I remember when Dr. Mallet was here a couple of years ago, he spoke at Central [State University], and all the science students showed up.  Everybody came out in white coats (laughter).  Now, tell me, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: I would study more, yeah.  I would study more.  I would read more because that was my shortcoming.  You know, sometimes, we study and we study, and we get an overview of something, and we think we know it as opposed to being an in-depth learner, learning for the sake of knowledge; not for the sake of an exam or just to get through and obtain a degree.  And I got that from Ben Carson, of course.
Speaker 1: Have you ever met him in person?
Speaker 2: Never met him, but I've been to his, I've seen him speak in person.  I would love to do that.  Can you arrange that?  (Laughter)
Story_ID: 29756
Speaker 1: We might, I don't know.  You know, maybe we'll have a panel (unclear).  But when you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, what today, and though you're only thirty-seven, would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  Well, my educational outreach right now at this stage of my life.  I do a lot of that.  I do a lot of tutoring.  I tutor, from like 10:00 [a.m.] to 12:00 [p.m.] on Saturdays, basically every Saturday at the University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio] to the inner-city students on their ACT's and SAT preps.  One of our students, as a matter of fact, just received a five thousand dollar scholarship from, high school student, he went to Dunbar High School, from Nasby (ph.) and Battelle, for college.
Story_ID: 29757
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you do--now, do you have any children?
Speaker 2: No children, single, no children, yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Get that, note that (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, so you're looking, huh?
Speaker 2: I'm looking.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, there're quite a few women, black women who are physicists.  And I was looking at the website.  There are more of them than there are men.
Speaker 2: There are, yeah.  One of my friends, I have a couple of friends.  They are both, as a matter of fact, there are three, they're physicists for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  They're in Huntsville, Alabama.  And I told you about Shirley Ann Jackson who's now the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and then twenty years later, Cynthia McIntyre who got her Ph.D. from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And she's also at RPI [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute] as well.  So I met them in the conference.  So there're a lot of female physicists, well, not a lot, but there are.  They do exist.
Speaker 1: So the organization is of really a lot of use to people involved with--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are your parents still alive?  Well, your father [James Henry Diggs] has passed?
Speaker 2: My mother [Janie Mae Davenport Diggs] is still alive.  She's seventy-six.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and how does your family feel about your being a physicist?
Speaker 2: Oh, they're very, well, didn't know what it is.  A lot of, my mom doesn't know what a physicist is (laughter).  But I think they're impressed with the title which, I don't downplay it, you know, like Ph.D. or doctor (unclear).  It's a function.  It's not, it's not who I am, and I try to live like that, as a matter of fact, most people don't know it until somebody else brings it up.  As a matter of fact, I had one guy who was telling me about, trying to encourage me to go to grad school, and he was "Man, you could do it, man, you could do it.  And it's not hard at all."  And I said, okay, cool, yeah, I could do it.  I didn't say anything until one of my friends was like, wait a minute (laughter).  He stopped him, and like, do you know who this guy is?  This guy has a Ph.D. in physics.  And the guy was just quiet the whole, he was (unclear), he turned red as, I was like, I was like, man.  I have that happen to me often, even in the gym, this guy was telling me, go to grad school not too long ago.  And he was like, go to grad school.  I said, I was--an MBA, and I was like, I thought about doing that.  He was like, well, you should and what else you gonna do, man, sit on your couch and watch TV all your life?  And I was like, oh, and somebody was like this guy has a Ph.D. in physics.  From then on, ultimate respect.  So.
Story_ID: 29758
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, you have an active life in the Church of God in Christ.  You're an ordained elder?
Speaker 2: I am, yeah.  Okay, tell us about some of that?  Now, that takes a lot of time.  You attend a church in Columbus [Ohio], right?
Speaker 1: Right, well, I was.  Now, I'm in Dayton [Ohio] cause I was, I couldn't find one here.  But I'm ordained in the Church of God in Christ, yes.  The Church of God in Christ is the largest African American Pentecostal Church in the nation.  And it's just, we just celebrated our centennial last year, founded by Charles Harrison Mason.  He was born, and if you know anything about the Pentecostal movement, like Seymour and all those people in the Centers of God which is another, which is the white Pentecostal movement.
Speaker 2: Yeah, spun off from the Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Right, because they couldn't worship together because of racism, which is crazy because--
Speaker 2: The denomination was founded by the black man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he ordained them, because of the times, which shows you that something is fundamentally wrong there.  But I will say about the Centers of God because I don't want to paint them in a bad light, they did have this, what they called the Miracle at Memphis, where they came, the leaders from the Centers of God came back to Memphis [Tennessee] because the Church of God in Christ has our headquarters in Memphis.  That's where [Martin Luther] King did his last talk at Mason Temple before he was assassinated.  They had a service, a feet-washing service, and they all apologized for what their forefathers had done, you know, in terms of separating and not worshipping together because that's not, if you're a true believer, you're not gonna, Heaven is not divided.  You're not gonna say, okay, you're white, white section over here; black section over here, Catholic over here, and Protestants over here.  It's not gonna be that.  It's gonna be one nation and one people, so.
Speaker 2: Okay, so do you do a lot of work with, I mean does your scientific background affect what you do in the Church of God in Christ?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of my messages when I do speak, have a scientific twist and I do or have done, like experimental demonstrations in there because church is a place to learn everything.  God's concerned about total man, not just your spiritual being, but, you know, he's concerned about academics as well.  So, you need to see people in the marketplace, you know, like not just in the church.  But He needs, God wants people, he wants professionals here, there, so they can help establish his kingdom everywhere, like here.  People, everybody knows that I am a Christian.  They know that.  So we go out and everybody, oh, don't ask Darnell.  Oh, he doesn't drink.  Oh, then they something like, oh, Darnell, we're heathens, huh?  I don't say anything.  I'm not gonna judge anybody.  I just don't do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, no, you don't have to always verbalize it.  People watch you, so it's the way that you live.
Story_ID: 29759
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything I have not asked you that you think we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, not (unclear) (laughter), that you haven't asked?  No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as one who has made a significant contribution to society.  It's not about wealth.  I mean if I could help somebody, say, for instance, like what Ben Carson has done.  He's influenced thousands of people, you know, just by telling his story and telling the truth, you know, about his story, in terms of his failures because, and how you don't have--you're not a failure because you failed, but how you can look into failure and dismantle it and turn it into a success.  Tell people they can make it, being positive, you know, for one who doesn't--has not wreaked havoc on society, one who has contributed to the greater good of our community (unclear).  That's my goal, you know, doing for other people, making sure this earth is the way God would have it to be.  And that's good enough for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
