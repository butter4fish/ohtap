Speaker 2: No, my sister was married at that time and my brother--I think he was in the [U.S.] Armed Forces. He was 'cause he was in World War II [WWII], um-hm, he was. So that just meant you know I went to live with my aunt, I mean with my mother.
Speaker 1: And what was that like, 'cause now you were with your brothers and sisters, your other brothers and sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well my mother--I went to work, I had to go to work. It was in the summertime and I use to work for this lady you know that had this large house and she was a white lady and she would--the men would come in from the country and work, work at the militant company, I can't remember but they made ammunition for the you know the war, for the soldiers and I had to--I worked twelve hours a day and made eleven dollars a week, and that's how I you know helped take care of my mom and the three children.
Speaker 1: And you were ten?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and from there we moved to Chicago [Illinois]. My sister Pauline [Pauline Blair Durr] sent for us to come here, and we moved here you know that September and we stayed with her, but my aunt--my mother gave me to my aunt when I was a baby but she said the situation was not at that time where she could take me, and she said, "I've come to get you now," so I moved with her to Gary, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Now this was aunt--?
Speaker 2: Lassie [Lassie Edmonds Blair].
Speaker 1: Aunt Lassie, okay.
Story_ID: 482012
Speaker 1: What did you do about school?
Speaker 2: I went to school; see I told you I worked in the summertime.
Speaker 1: In the summer?
Speaker 2: Yes, all the summer, you know at the beginning of when school was out I worked all that time you know and my sister [Pauline Blair Durr] sent for us like the--was it September? Yes, 'cause I was late getting in school when I went to Gary [Indiana]. See I--my aunt [Lassie Edmonds Blair] picked me up and took me to Gary and I, I went to Froebel School, Froebel High School [Friedrich Froebel High School] in Gary.
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your elementary school years. When you were living with your [maternal] grandmother [Caldonia Edmonds], what school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Manassas High School [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: What about grammar school?
Speaker 2: Well they had grammar too you know. I just said Manassas, I was at grammar.
Speaker 1: So that one school had an elementary school and a high school?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And you started there in kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sure did.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me please?
Speaker 2: Manassas? M-A-N-A, Manas- oh, S-A, I'm sorry, S-A, Manassas, S-A-S-S-E-E [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay and that was in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: And you started there in kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Until what grade?
Speaker 2: Until the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about those years in elementary school before we go to high school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh.
Speaker 1: What are your fondest memories of school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My fondest memory was when I was in the--what sixth, seventh grade, sixth or seventh, sixth and seventh grade. My teacher I think was named Mrs. Williamson [ph.] and I always finished my work before everybody else did and it was always right. I think I was pretty smart, but I would sit up after I finished my work (laughter) and do crazy things, say crazy things and the kids would laugh, and the teacher would look up and I would be looking at her and she said, she wouldn't say nothing, she'd say, "Be quiet," and so everybody got quiet and soon as they got quiet again and she looked down and I was acting crazy again, 'til one day she caught me and took me out in the hallway and I mean she whipped these hands, oh, you know and you'd put your hand back there, "Please don't hit me no more." "Put that hand out there," you'd put it--(laughter) and she whipped you with a belt you know in your hand so she said, "I knew it was you." She said, "I knew it was you." She said, "You won't do this no more," (laughter) and I didn't because I didn't want no more whipping--
Story_ID: 482013
Speaker 1: Did you consider yourself a good student?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I was a very good student. The people--whenever people would come from other cities you know like educators and so forth? She [Mrs. Williamson (ph.)] would always have me to do math you know, bring--you know I was in one of the smartest groups you know and I could--I would do math you know and stuff like that. You know how they like to show off the kids and all? So I was one of, one of those you know and then she before they came she would say, "Look, I don't want no trouble outta you today, you hear me, (laughter) you representing us," and she said, "If you do when they leave, you're gonna be sorry (laughter)."
Speaker 1: What type of child would you consider yourself to have been? Well-mannered, mischievous?
Speaker 2: You know what, I, I, I know that I was well-mannered and, because you know if you got what I got from my [maternal] grandmother [Caldonia Edmonds], you, you know you didn't have no other desire to be anything else but well-mannered and I, I was like a, a leader you know in my household. My grandmother would give me money to go to the grocery store because you know they worked out in the gardens and in the countries and stuff you know. Some picking cotton, whatever and she would give money and tell me to go get groceries. Now she didn't tell me what to get, she'd just give me the money and tell me to go buy groceries. I was about eight or nine years old then and I would buy the groceries and I would--I had to cook. She had taught me how to cook, as a matter of fact Pauline [Yancy's sister, Pauline Blair Durr] and I both knew how to cook and I would have the food ready when they got home. My grandfather [James Edmonds] would sit in the kitchen you know to watch and see if I you know--what little bit he knew you know to tell me if I was doing something wrong. So I've always had to do those kinds of things. When I was with my mother [Leah Edmonds Brown] sometimes I'd feel like I was her mother instead of me being her, her child, and instead of her being the mother 'cause she depend on me for so many, many things and, and seemingly that's the way it's been you know every--from, from then on you know and you know I would you know take over, I, you know I just I don't know that's was, I just had to do that 'cause there was nobody else to do it you know, and I worked, I took care of them just like they were my family you know. I bought clothes and different things for them you know and my mother, I loved doing her hair 'cause she had beautiful hair and I would make up her face you know and I would buy things you know for her 'cause she just was like a child to me you know and so 'cause she always said, "What do you think?" And I've always had to be the leader and, and I didn't necessarily want to be the leader, but that--it was no other way and until I got to live with my Aunt Lassie [Lassie Edmonds Blair] in Gary [Indiana], then I was a little girl and I enjoyed it, I did. When she came to get me and I got to Gary, I thought that was the most beautifulest little town in the world and my life was so beautiful, oh I enjoyed it. I was one of the leading soloists at St. Paul Baptist Church [St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, Gary, Indiana]. I was taking piano lessons and voice lessons. The lady I was taking voice lessons from was teaching me, you know she said I want you to be a classic singer, you know operatic, you know and I did all the anthems at the church and then one time I recorded with the--I was the lead singer on a recording of the men singing and at school, what Froebel School [Friedrich Froebel High School, Gary, Indiana] was highly prejudiced then. We didn't even know that they had a swimming pool in the school, the black kids didn't.
Story_ID: 482014
Speaker 1: Let me go back and jog your memory about your living experience with your mother [Leah Edmonds Brown] and your school. Where did you go to school there? When you moved on the other side of town with mom what school did you attend, because you were ten years old then so you were still in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Right. Well, see you know at that time when school started again my sister [Pauline Blair Durr] had--she sent for us to come to Chicago [Illinois] and then my aunt [Lassie Edmonds Blair] came and got me before school started.
Speaker 1: I see so you didn't finish your--that grade in Memphis [Tennessee] you came on to Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah and they put me in the ninth grade, I, I was in the eighth grade. Was it eighth grade? Yeah, and they put me in the ninth grade. You know they gave me a test and then they put me in--I've never, no I was in the seventh grade and they gave me a test and then they put me in the ninth grade. I've never been in the eighth grade, never have. I don't know why, you know I've often wondered.
Speaker 1: Was there a graduation, eighth grade graduation during that time?
Speaker 2: In Memphis, Tennessee?
Speaker 1: No, you, you were in Gary then, right?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you never technically graduated from grammar school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You just went from seventh grade (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventh grade to ninth.
Speaker 1: --to high school?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that high school was?
Speaker 2: Froebel.
Speaker 1: Froebel High School [Friedrich Froebel High School, Gary, Indiana].
Speaker 2: In Gary.
Speaker 1: In Gary, Indiana okay. Okay, so you were telling us about your experiences in high school.
Speaker 2: Oh it, it was--I loved Froebel but I was you know very shocked to know 'cause I didn't know too many kids and things. You know I didn't know all the things that were going on, I was just excited about being there 'cause my aunt's son was an All-American at Froebel you know, and--
Speaker 1: And his name was?
Speaker 2: James Blair [ph.].
Speaker 1: So that was your first cousin?
Speaker 2: Yes. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when he'd come up to the school you know to check and see how was I doing all teachers and everybody was just so glad to see him and know that I was his little cousin you know, and it was just nice you know. You know--
Speaker 1: Now you say he was an All-American in what area?
Speaker 2: He excelled in all of the sports.
Speaker 1: Okay and where did he live?
Speaker 2: He lived, did he live with any- no, he was married then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had gotten married; he graduated and had gotten married. He had gone to college I think, yeah. And you wanna talk about the school?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well you know it was a mixed school that had you know they was predominately white, black and Hispanics and I had a real nice Hispanic girlfriend, but I didn't know what she was saying you know sometimes when she'd get angry. She would say stuff and then I would have to ask somebody what is she saying and they would say, "She's cussing you out (laughter)." I said, "Well I didn't do nothing," (laughter) and I became afraid of her 'cause she would just get so dark looking, you know and her eyes and the eyes would be sparked.
Story_ID: 482015
Speaker 1: So I could tell my [maternal] aunt [Lassie Edmonds Blair] anything and I went home and told my aunt about it. I said, "What should I do about it?" I--she told me, she sat me down when I first moved with her. She said, "Now you're with me, now you--you know I, I was a young girl once," and she had read books before I came (laughter) so she could know. So she said, "You can tell me anything, I'm your friend, I'm your aunt, but I'm your friend." So I felt so comfortable being able to talk to her and seemingly she enjoyed the things that I talked about to her. I would tell her about you know some of the--, "Hey, Auntie you know that little boy, he asked me to go to the movie with him. I don't wanna go the movies," (laughter) and she was just so beautiful and so when I left my mother [Leah Edmonds Brown] moved to--stayed in Chicago [Illinois]. Oh, she would let me go skating, couldn't skate. She would let me go bowling, and then on--the people, the church people in Gary [Indiana] knew that I could sing, she--they would call her and ask her could I be their soloist. These are different churches in Chi- in Gary and she would take me. She would buy all kind of little pretty dresses for me, I never had that kind of thing, you know those kind of things before and then we'd stop at--after we'd leave there the church then we'd stop at the ice cream place and we'd get ice cream we'd come home and eat it together you know and then she would tell me, said, "They gave you blah, blah, blah." She said, "Now I'm gonna keep this and if you want something," she said, "but I'd like to keep this so I can keep you--buy you nice, your clothes you know and shoes and things that you need you know." So she said, "But if you need something you come and tell me and I'll give it to you," you know and that was the happiest time of my life. I enjoyed--I had so many beautiful sweet friends and the church people was so lovingly and kind, it was just heavenly to me you know as a kid you know and so.
Speaker 2: How long did you live with her?
Speaker 1: Oh, let's see, I lived with her--I was going into the eleventh grade [at Friedrich Froebel High School, Gary, Indiana]. I you know passed to the eleventh grade and my mother called her and told her I had come and stay with her, be with her 'cause she needed my help, and she set me down and she told me, "Whatever you do, you be independent, you take care of yourself." She said, "Don't ask--you know don't worry nobody about anything 'cause that's what she want you to do go to work, and you make sure you take care of yourself, and never depend on anybody to, to you know to give you things," and that's the way it was I went to work and I you know my--she--you know my mother was married at that time too and then I helped her with the children and I helped her you know with the money. I would take it to her and fortunately she was not the kind that would take everything you had, she'd give me something and so I would save it you know until I got enough and then I would go buy me something.
Story_ID: 482016
Speaker 1: So you moved back from Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: To Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: To Chicago, your mother [Leah Edmonds Brown] had come to Chicago in the meantime?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I thought I was going to, to school, I wanted--I loved school and I wanted to go to school so bad, but she said, "No you have to go to work," and so I found a job at Wieboldt's [Wieboldt Stores, Chicago, Illinois] on Ashland [Avenue].
Speaker 1: And how old were you then?
Speaker 2: How old was I then? I think I was about twelve or, twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think I was about twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: And you went, you came over to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Um-hm I might have been about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And to live with your mother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where did you all live?
Speaker 2: We lived on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] on Fullerton [Avenue], that's all I can remember and they had a school over there, over there it was called--the name was Crenshaw [ph.], I would never forget that (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that was an elementary school or high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, high school you know and elementary.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who lived in that household?
Speaker 2: My sister Pauline [Pauline Blair Durr], she was--she worked and Georgia [Georgia Butler], Henry [ph.] and Harrison [ph.]. No, Henry was, I think Henry was dead then. He, somebody beat him up you know and I now it was just Georgia, Harrison and me and my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her husband.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so you went to live with your mother and had your first real job at Wieboldt's department store?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In the coffee shop.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I just thought that was the way things went you know and I just worked and come home you know it was. I felt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where was Wieboldt's located?
Speaker 2: On Ashland on the west, on the West Side.
Story_ID: 482017
Speaker 1: What church were you attending then?
Speaker 2: I had--I didn't know anybody over there so I, I didn't go to church until maybe the, probably the next year and it was like--I think the name of the church then was Pilgrim Rest [Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Do you remember what influenced you to get to Pilgrim Rest? Did someone take you there or did you just see it or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of the people that lived next door, the lady that owned the--you know the place where my mother [Leah Edmonds Brown] lived and the upstairs and everything. I guess you would call those what? I don't know but anyway they would--their sons would take me to church sometimes you know and I--that's all I knew was church you know. So I, you know that's where I went to church and I went there for a while but I, I don't know what happened that I didn't you know go for a long time. Oh, I know why, we moved. We moved to 4000 Dearborn [Street], South Dearborn.
Speaker 1: Okay, now earlier you mentioned that you taught Sunday school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At nine years old, I'd like to know more about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I taught the young--you know the little kids and then you know after--when all the lessons--when the lessons--when the lessons over everybody come together you know and they wanted somebody to do the, do the lesson. You know, you know what you call it, you know do--bring the whole lesson together you know and talk on that. So I got up and talked on the lessons and everything and one of preachers said, some of the things I was saying he said that was, "That's wrong," and so I looked at him and I said, "Well, turn to, to third chapter of John and we gonna talk about that," (laughter) that's what it was, it was great (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Give us an example of one of your lectures or?
Speaker 2: Well, first you know I would talk about the history you know of that, that disciple, you know how he became to be a follower of Jesus and you know I and I would talk about that, I would talk about they're the ones that experienced walking with Jesus, I'm saying this is how we've come to know about Jesus, learn who he is and what he does, you know 'cause this is the way I talk to, I was talking to the young people 'cause that's how I felt about him. I said and it says in there that we are supposed to be like him, and then I went on down to explain some of the you know things that it says you know, like you know be, what it is, we're supposed to be like Jesus and it tells you, said that, "Let this mind be in you that's also in Christ Jesus" [Philippians 2:5]. I said, "But we're little kids," I said, "but we can't, we not, we can grow to that," I said, "but how we can start is by being kind to one another and not fighting each other," 'cause sometimes they would wanna fight me (laughter). I said, "Obeying our mother and father, obeying our teachers." I said, "And enjoy doing it because we know they know what's best for us you know like Jesus knew, knows what's best for us," you know and I'd talk like that to them and everything, but this preacher he wanted to--when I got through reading the scripture to him, he said, "You right, you right, you right," you know (laughter), you know and when I went home I told my [maternal] grandfather [James Edmonds] about it. He said, "That's my girl," (laughter) and that's true you know you have to teach kids according to the way they understand it.
Story_ID: 482018
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying now in this era. This is a different era, the young people don't understand like we do. The Bible is still the same, but you have to deal with it in a way they understand it in today's world and you know they don't understand all of--well, I won't go there but you know they don't understand all the other stuff you know. They be talking about, talk to them on their level where they can get it, because you know they hearing it on other, at other churches you know on other, on the radio, television you know 'cause there are young ministers that's preaching and teaching now and they're dealing with it on their level and that's why the young generation can understand and then when they go to their church they wanna here it like that too you know, and so understand at this day and age there's a great falling away and you know it's our fault you know that we're not giving them--in the--giving it to them in a way they would understand it you know, so that's all what that's about you know 'cause they have problems. You know in school little kids--well, let me shut up (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, go on.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Little children they're little adults, they have problems. Why they don't--they don't understand how come mama didn't give them some ice cream or how come I had to go to bed so early. You have to sit down and tell 'em yeah, tell them what you want, you know why you're doing this. You don't tell 'em, "Just do it 'cause I said it," you tell--explain to them why I think you should go to bed on time so when you get up in the morning you won't be so tired you know, but they don't do--take time. It's so many things in their little mind and that's why some of the kids become so, you know hard headed as the old people use to say you know. That they, it's too much, just like a lot of things is too much for you. You go to work, you don't understand how come your supervisor or whatever did this or whatever. You have problems you know, you're wondering how you should spend your money, you don't have much and blah, blah, blah you know so they go through things just like we do.
Story_ID: 482019
Speaker 1: You worked at Wieboldt's [Wieboldt Stores, Chicago, Illinois] in the coffee shop, what were some of your experiences there at thirteen years old?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh well you know I was a waitress and I--it was okay. You know sometimes people would order stuff and you then you bring it to 'em and then they don't want it you know and then you gotta carry it back and that's kind of crazy but you know, that's the way it was and you know I made a lot of tips 'cause I'd smile all the time, it was funny to me (laughter), and you know people would come in and ask for me you know to wait on their table you know and I would say something funny to them.
Speaker 1: You'd say something funny to them?
Speaker 2: Um-hm and I you know it was just (laughter), it was just cra- you know I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: You enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: It seemed it like the, the Lord just--I don't know he carried me so--through so beautifully. You know I didn't have no business working in no store young as I was. I should've been somewhere in school, that's where I liked--I loved school, but you know I took it in my stride, I felt like that was what I had to do you know and I felt like I wasn't, you know didn't--wasn't supposed to go to school you know, I wasn't supposed to want anything for myself you know, and which was silly you know but you, that's how I felt then 'cause I've always was doing things, you know had to do things you know, take care of this, take care of that.
Speaker 1: When you were living with your mother [Leah Edmonds Brown], how did you spend your spare time?
Speaker 2: What spare time, 'cause I worked every day, every day and then when we moved here [Chicago, Illinois], I forgot when we moved here I would--she belonged to a little church, I don't--can't remember the name and I, she would take me there and I would--ask me to teach the choir some songs. You know and I taught what I knew 'cause you know I didn't have time, I couldn't hear the radio. I don't even think at that time, I'm not sure that they had church, you know black churches on the radio. Now when we moved to Dearborn Street I--one night I was so disturbed I just got out and went to walking. I was working at Kodiak camera [sic. Eastman Kodak Company] place down on Lake Street and State Street I think it was, yeah, and when I got home that night I was just--oh, the people would have me to sing. One time I was just singing to myself and then one time--they asked me to sing. I was singing--what's his name? I was singing this artist's song and--oh I can't think of his name, E-R-S-K-I-N [sic.].
Speaker 1: A gospel artist?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Erskine Hawkins?
Speaker 2: No his last--his first name was Pat [ph.] and his last name--he, anyway I'll think about it later on. I was singing his song and the people liked it so well they asked me to sing different things you know and then they would buy my lunch. Well that meant I knew I was gonna eat that day (laughter) and so you know I never did it just on my own hoping that they would buy me a lunch, I just sang because you know I wanted to sing--Billy Eckstine.
Speaker 1: Oh, Eckstine.
Speaker 2: That's it, um-hm, that was his name and I loved his song and I would sing it. Sometime they asked me did I know how to sing the blues too (laughter), and nobody never asked me about a church song (laughter) and I would just sing and sing you know, and so sometimes I had more money than lunch money you know (laughter), but anyway after we moved to, was it Dearborn, well I can't remember? But anyway you know they'd let a lot of us go you know 'cause they said the business wasn't going too--oh, they were gonna move, that's what it was they were gonna move and so they let a lot of us go 'cause they couldn't afford.
Speaker 1: They couldn't afford it?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 482020
Speaker 1: We moved, my mother [Leah Edmonds Brown] moved to Gary [Indiana] and I went to live with Sister Sally [ph.]. She took care of kids for parents that worked and I think it was about seventeen children she had in her household (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now how old were you at that time?
Speaker 1: I think I was about fourteen or fifteen if I can remember, and I had my little brother so I had Harrison [ph.], my little brother with me. So my mother took Georgia [Georgia Butler] and they moved, they went to Memph- I mean to Gary, Indiana and then she got a place there you know and I took Harrison with me. She said she couldn't take him so I had to take him with me. So for room and board for the two of us, you know that's, that's all I got. I didn't get any money, she didn't pay me any money just room and board and when my mom moved back to Chicago [Illinois] we moved with her to Dearborn Street and then we started--I went to--one night I just walked and walked 'til I walked up in the Greater Harvest Baptist Church [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and Reverend Boddie [Louis Boddie] talked to me and everything and gave me the 51st Psalms [Psalm 51] to read, and he said, "I want you back here Friday night," so that's how I got to Greater Harvest Baptist Church you know, because I just needed somebody to talk to you know 'cause I was getting kind of tired you know? Actually, I was real tired but anyway that, that was good and so I started going to Greater Harvest.
Speaker 2: Now I wanna just make sure that we've got this chronology correct. You moved to Gary in the eleventh grade, then you came to Chicago when you were about thirteen, you worked at Wieboldt's [Wieboldt Stores, Chicago, Illinois] and then from--you stayed with your mother on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and moved to Dearborn?
Speaker 1: Street.
Speaker 2: Dearborn Street, and how old were you then?
Speaker 1: I think I must've been about fourteen, fourteen or fifteen, fourteen, fifteen I--somewhere in there.
Speaker 2: And you lived there about a year? Is that correct?
Speaker 1: We lived there--I lived there until I married my husband [Robert Yancy, Sr.] with my mother.
Speaker 2: Well you say you moved to Gary at fourteen.
Speaker 1: I did move to Gary at fourteen?
Speaker 2: You had your brother Harrison.
Speaker 1: So I must've been about--
Speaker 2: Did you go from the West Side to Gary and then to Dearborn?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What I--when I came from Gary my mother was living on the West Side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And from there she moved to Dearborn Street.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I mean in the meantime, I'm sorry--in the mean- after she left the place on the West Side she went to Gary, I didn't go back (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: I didn't go back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She went to Gary and then she and Georgia, my sister Georgia, and then I stayed with Sister Sally with, with her seventeen children 'cause she was in a wheel chair (laughter), she--
Speaker 2: What was that like and who was Sister Sally? Tell us about her?
Speaker 1: She belonged to, which church? She belonged to First Church of Deliverance [Chicago, Illinois] I think at that time, and I don't know how I got there with her, somebody must of told me about the job. She wanted somebody to you know cook for the kids, wash their clothes and make sure they get--you know get up and go to school and stuff like that and I needed that job.
Speaker 2: And these were all her children?
Speaker 1: No, these were parents that worked children (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's what I thought you said okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, she had a little in-home care for children and so when my mother found out where we were, my mother didn't know where I was, where I had moved or anything you know. So when she found out that my brother and I was there so she came and got us and took us over to Dearborn Street where she had came back and she and her husband had got a place there on Dearborn Street (unclear) (laughter), anyway, anyway from there that's when I went to Greater Harvest you know. One night I just walked and walked 'til I found--I, I wasn't looking for a church. I was just walking, when I knew anything I was standing in front of Greater Harvest--

Speaker 1: Now up to this time before you went to Greater Harvest [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], what were your dreams and aspirations for yourself?
Speaker 2: I wanted to go to school, I loved school. I love school now, I went, went to college [Loop Junior College; Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois] and my grades were great like I thought they would be and I had, had eight kids so I wanted to go to school then. I wanted to go to school, I wanted to go to college and I wanted to be a social worker.
Speaker 1: You mentioned singing a lot, did you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I taught the choir. My mother [Leah Edmonds Brown] joined the church down the street and I sang down there and after I joined Greater Harvest, Opal [Opal Stewart] and--
Speaker 1: But before, before then--before you ever got to Greater Harvest, from let's say the time you were nine until you were fourteen.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you want to be?
Speaker 2: A singer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, 'cause I forgot to tell you when I was like nine years--eight years old or nine years old I was with the Red Circle girls or the Sunshine Band one, and the day that the lady took us to sing at this church 'cause they had an association, you know the convention 'cause the big thing in an association is for you, you know the home, the hometown you know your, church, at, at your real church you know, and you know they all come together you know and then they have meetings and programs and stuff. So this is what took our time.  We was supposed to sing and something was wrong with my eye, something always--but anyway something was wrong with my eyes but I went on anyway and she said, "Instead of us doing the song we want you to sing," the lady that was over my little group and I sang this song--I can't think of it, but anyway everybody just loved it, 'Is Your All on the Altar,' that's the name of it. I sang that for them and from then on I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember that song now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would you sing just a little of it for us?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "You have longed for sweet peace and for faith to increase. You have earnestly, fervently prayed. Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? Oh you can only be blessed. And have peace and sweet rest if you yield Him your body and soul." That was the first song I ever sang in church and I just love singing. I loved singing because I love praising God and I've done all kinds of anthems and all that stuff but I love gospel music, because it reaches down in your soul and just all the things that you've experienced and in bad or good it just blesses you and moves all in you. It makes you happy, it makes you joyful and gives you that help--it helps build your faith and your strength and it just, it does so much for you.
Story_ID: 482022
Speaker 1: So you were with the Sunshine group [Sunshine Band] and that must've been in Memphis [Tennessee], right? And they selected you to sing a solo?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that ['Is Your All on the Altar'] was the solo that you sang?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then what happened with that group after that, did you continue to sing with them or?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm we continued to sing and if they sing, we all sing together then sometimes she would ask me to sing by myself.
Speaker 1: Now was this made--the group made up of kids from the neighborhood or from the church or?
Speaker 2: From the church, um-hm, yeah, from the church and that's how I started to singing and when I--we moved from there I--and my aunt [Lassie Edmonds Blair] came and got me and took me to Gary [Indiana]. I was one of the soloists in the choir at St. Paul [St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, Gary, Indiana], it was the biggest church, had the largest membership in Gary, Indiana and then the men organized a choir, a men's choir and they asked me to sing, lead the song with them. R.L. Knowles who use to be one of the nation's greatest gospel singers along with Robert Anderson; I was the choir director over there and he taught me how--I, you know I had like a--somewhat of a contralto voice, somewhat, and he started me to signing high you know in soprano I should say and I never stopped, I, I went up and never came down (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that was the beginning of your formal training, what you would consider your formal music training?
Speaker 2: Yes, along with my music teacher you know 'cause I can do anthems now you know.
Speaker 1: Who was your music teacher at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't think of her name.
Speaker 1: But you as, as a young child you did have a music teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: That taught you voice and piano or just voice?
Speaker 2: Piano too, but I, I couldn't deal with--you know she was kind of rough and I went home and told my aunt and she said, "You're not going to go there anymore," you know, and I'm sorry, I told her (laughter) 'til today, but it was the truth and she said you know, "I'm not gonna--you don't have to take that. You don't have to go," and she said, "Maybe we'll just take the voice lessons." So--that's my aunt talked to her and that's what I did, take the voice lessons 'cause she would whip my hand, you know hit me on my hands you know if I wasn't playing good.
Speaker 1: So up until the time that you, before you came to Chicago [Illinois] your dreams and aspirations were to be a singer?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And then after you got to Chicago it expanded to be, you said a social worker or?
Speaker 2: Yes, after I married you know, after I wouldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was after you married.
Speaker 2: After I married I went to this school, Holy Family Head Start [Chicago, Illinois] and I became one of the teachers there and then one day after--Savilla Woods [ph.] was the first director and then after than Bob Skipper [ph.] became the director and he was so helpful to me. He just saw a lot of things and he just, he's the one that started me to going to school. I had to get my high, my high school diploma. All the grades I had at, at Loop Junior College [Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois] after I got my diploma, high school diploma, then I was able to get my grade.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay so what was that Greater Harvest experience like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just wonderful. Oh, we just, it was so beautiful--I like people, I love people and we got a chance to--we formed like a little group together and we still together. That's been like what sixty years ago and we're still friends you know, Opal Stewart, Eddie Robinson [Edward Robinson], Jean Anderson [ph.] and Robert Anderson. We--and Clifton Medley we all, we were the soloists in the choir and we all stuck together, we all would sneak out and go to the movies or some place you know on the holidays and stuff. When everybody was looking for us to sing we'd be over in the park (laughter), we were so young you know and we you know, we sang all the time so Reverend Yancy [Robert Yancy, Sr.] would tell us to go on you know. He'd say, "Go on and enjoy yourselves," and Reverend Boddie [Louis Boddie] would be looking, he was like our daddy 'cause when we came back or if he didn't see us that day the next time he saw us all of us had go in and you know explain ourselves to him you know. He was just like a dad and I loved that you know because not--you know not being brought up with my father [Elijah Rhodes (ph.)] you know that, that was a wonderful thing to happen. As a matter-of-fact all of us felt like that you know that he was our dad and we you know we did everything he told us except for you know when we wanted to sneak off a little while go to the movies or sometimes on Sunday we'd sneak to the movies, a whole big group of us and then we had to go back to church. We were in church all day at Greater Harvest and in rehearsals we had two rehearsals a week and then sometime he would make us stay for the tarry service and you know that was something, so we needed a little time for ourselves (laughter) and we--and then sometimes we would go and sing at other churches. If I had--if somebody asked me to come and sing for them, everybody went with us, or what little money they gave us, we would stop at White Castles (laughter), that's how you paid your friends back for coming with you. You would go to White Castle; everybody would eat the White Castle (laughter).

Speaker 1: You were fifteen years old and what--and you were no longer working at Wieboldt's [Wieboldt Stores, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.

Speaker 2: I was working at, where was I working at? I think, oh I told you about the camera place. Yes I did, Kodiak camera [sic. Eastman Kodak Company].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm and I was working there and I--the first thing I ever bought was an outfit from Bertails [ph.]. I always said I'm gonna buy something from that store one of these days and one time my mom [Leah Edmonds Brown] said I didn't have to give her any money and so I bought me a skirt and a blouse (laughter) at Bertails and that's where I worked until--I worked up until I met, met, married my husband.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: What--1948 that we married, I was seventeen, I was gonna be eighteen that October.
Speaker 1: And who was that?
Speaker 2: Robert Yancy [Robert Yancy, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And what was his profession?
Speaker 2: He was a minister; he was the assistant pastor to Reverend Boddie [Louis Boddie].
Speaker 1: At Greater Harvest [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell us about your meeting and your relationship?
Speaker 2: You know he would smile at me, you know and every time I'd see him, he would just smile and I asked Opal [Opal Stewart], I said, "Who is he smiling--who is that man always smiling at me?" She said, "What man?" I said, "The one that be in the pulpit with Reverend Boddie, who is he?" See I didn't know that much about assistant pastors and all that stuff you know and so she said, "Oh, that's Reverend Yancy, he's Reverend Boddie's assistant." I said, "Oh yeah," and so then one day he came up and we were sitting eating--and well we were going to eat, we wanted to eat. We were counting our money she and I (laughter), and so he came up and told us that we could--he said, "Order you something, I'll buy it." This was in the church dining room. He said, "I'll pay for it," and so he paid for it and then he started talking to us, he sat there and talked a while and then he got up and left, and he said, "I wanna talk to you," before, before he left he said, "I wanna talk to you." I said, "Okay," like that you know and I just you know, I just looked. It was a long time before I would talk, really talk to him you know until I saw him talking to another girl one night, and after that the next time he (laughter) showed up to talk to me I talked to him (laughter) and so you know I would, he would take me out to dinner and different things and stuff. He went to my house, he met my mom, my sisters [Pauline Blair Durr and Georgia Butler] and everything you know and then he would take me out and then--oh, well that was in 1947 and we married April 3rd of 1948.
Speaker 1: And tell me about the wedding?
Speaker 2: It--you know what, we met at Reverend Boddie's house. It was just my mom and my sister and me and him and Reverend Boddie and Reverend Boddie's nephew, Sonny Williams [ph.], and then after that Mrs. Boddie [Sylvia Boddie] gave me a wedding dinner and the people were so nice. We had so much stuff we had to have two cars to take it in. They were so lovely to me, and then Reverend Boddie announced it in the pulpit that Sunday before this, before the, you know the dinner, 'cause didn't nobody know until the dinner, and so he got up and told--he said, "Come here girl," and I got up and went to the pulpit. I was so nervous my feet felt like wood and my legs I should say. And he said, "Come here," he begged for Reverend Yancy. He said, "I wanna introduce to you all this morning Reverend Yancy's wife," and you could hear--nobody said nothing, and, and I, I almost cried I said, "Nobody said nothing." So I told Ms. Boddie afterwards and she said, "Well that's the way it's gonna be, that's the way it was with me when I married Reverend Boddie (laughter)," and so anyway she told them that you know she was going to look after me. Well, I was singing with her anyway you know and then she said, "We're gonna have a, a wedding party for them," a bridal party you know for them whatever, and they did and it was beautiful. We had so much stuff you know and you know everything was beautiful.

Speaker 1: What was gospel music, what was the history, the feeling of gospel music during that time? Greater Harvest [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], I'd like for you to talk about that and Greater Harvest because that was one of the--considered one of the main churches in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right. If you could sing, at you know First Church [First Church of Deliverance, Chicago, Illinois], you know was the first one and Greater Harvest was next but then it got--you know you couldn't go to First Church and sing. You know like groups come from out of town, the--oh, I can't call their name. Clara Ward and her singers and those girls that came from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], can't call their name now, but anyway, whenever they would come in town if they could get to sing at Greater Harvest, they thought it was the best--it was the best thing. You know if the people received you at Greater Harvest, you could sing anywhere and that's the way it was. So they all would come to Greater Harvest, we would have so many--Mahalia Jackson, she would come all the time you know, she was close to Reverend [Louis Boddie] and she would come all the time. She would sing sometime, sometime she would talk to us you know and The Caravans, the--I can't call all of those folks name right now but it was just--all the well-known singers, the singers that became well known you know they come to Greater Harvest, we and we had one of the greatest choirs in the nation, Robert Anderson was our director, Ms. Boddie [Sylvia Boddie] started us you know and then this other guy from First Church, I can't think of his name right now, but Robert Anderson and Willie Webb, you know Willie Webb taught us and we had the best and the anointing, that's--a gospel music--you know, ooh, it's--.

Opal said, "Me either (laughter)." She didn't have a husband (laughter) and so that's what it was like you know and (laughter), I couldn't be with my friends you know that--I had to think about that so Reverend Boddie said, "I tell you what, you come up and see me tomorrow." I--you know when he say that we know he want to really talk to you, you know so I said, "Okay." (Laughter) So we didn't--needless to say we didn't get a chance to go the movies, we had to go back and go into the dining room to eat (laughter) or wait until the night service you know, and so Reverend Yancy just laughed, he laughed and he laughed, so anyway he you know he was very good to me.

Well of course I hadn't had no children yet (laughter) so that's where we lived and--oh, after that we, we moved from there and went and moved to other places and then we came back to 3725 Indiana.

Speaker 1: So you were very in- very, very involved with the church, with Greater Harvest [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was, I was one of the soloists at Greater Harvest, I always was the first soloist they would put up to sing if we had some guest singers. Then they would put Opal [Opal Stewart] up and then they would put the guest singers up (laughter), and I always started it off you know, always I would sing 'Yield Not to Temptation.'
Speaker 1: That was the song that you always sang?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Just give us a little bit of that.
Speaker 2: Oh, (singing) "Yield not to temptation for yielding is sin, yes, each victory will help you some others to win, oh yes, fight manfully onward, dark passion subdue. Oh, just look, look ever to Jesus. I know Jesus he will carry you through." You sing the chorus.
Speaker 1: So that was like the opening song for th- for any type of special program?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, you know like say for instance you know they'd have, we'd sing the hymn songs until we got you know ready to go with the choir, you know for the choir to sing the gospel songs and that was the first song if we, especially if we had guest singers and I would sing, then Opal and then they'd call the guest, that's was Robert Anderson (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now in 1948, gospel was really starting to take--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Come into its own.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And First Church of Deliverance [Chicago, Illinois] and Greater Harvest were like the two main churches in the city.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how did Greater Harvest feel about Dorsey's music?
Speaker 2: Thomas A. Dorsey?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, my god, we loved it you know 'cause you know it was just so beautiful. It was just so beautiful, that song 'Precious Lord' ['Take My Hand, Precious Lord'], well you know now you can't sing that. It's just, the people just get so filled up you know from singing it. I--when I do funerals I try not to sing 'Precious Lord' unless they ask me to and then I'll sing it, but if they don't ask me for it I won't because I know how it is, and then they had another little song that I sing sometime and I've learned to like that. There's so many songs that he had, you know gospel music was--you know whenever--you know he had a group and they would have a convention every year and whenever they had their convention in Chicago [Illinois] at Pilgrim Baptist Church, that's where he belonged. People would come from everywhere to hear that group I tell you.
Speaker 1: Did he ever perform, did he ever make guest appearances at Greater Harvest?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, no he didn't but we sang his songs you know, and I can't think of a lot of 'em that we did sing. We sang a lot of, we sang Roberta Martin's stuff, we sang Boosters [ph.] from Memphis, Tennessee, then we sang--Ms. Boddie [Sylvia Boddie] wrote a lot of songs you know 'Calling Jesus My Rock' [sic. 'I Call Him Jesus, My Rock']. Reverend Evans [HistoryMaker Reverend Clay Evans] wrote--I can't think of the name (unclear), "This old soul of mine going home to live with God," 'By and By,' he wrote that, and you know we were, we were just on it.
Story_ID: 482030
Speaker 1: And you know Greater Harvest [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] was--Reverend Boddie [Louis Boddie] would teach us, so on Friday nights and sometime if you sitting in the dining room eating and he pass by, and you speak to him and everything then he'd come back and say, "You know God said so in so, so in so, so in so," and it would be a class right there (laughter). He didn't care where we--you know. Sometimes he'd make us sit down on the steps you know from the pulpit, we'd sit down there and he--when choir rehearsal was over with and he'd teach us there. He, he was just a word man, he was a word preacher and we got--he taught us so much about how to live, how to be good wives, how to be good husbands.
Speaker 2: What are some of the things he taught you about being a good wife?
Speaker 1: About being a good wife? "Don't come to church, or don't go nowhere unless you have made sure your husband, if he's not going with you, make sure that he has had a nice dinner, you know, the house is clean, the children are all clean and they're quiet, and then you go out." He said, "Don't come here unless you have taken care of your home first." He said, "That's the more important thing," and he said, "keep yourself clean and looking nice and pretty. Don't be looking any kind of way when he come home from work. So he's tired and he wants to see something that will make him happy and all, and make sure all the children is in the house when he come home and the food is on the table, ready or either it's cooked and ready for him." He taught us so much, he taught women how to you know keep their--keep themselves up. He said, "Some of you all walk around in the house with your house robe on or your gown on all night and your hair standing all over your head." He said, "Fix yourself up so that--for yourself first," he said, "and then for your husband when he come in. Do you think he wanna come in to something like that? Dishes all in the sink and the children running all around the house and you sitting, standing there looking crazy (laughter)," that's how he talked to us and you know also he would allow people to come and if they didn't have places to stay, they didn't have food he would give 'em--you know they could stay in the church and we had to see about them. That's how come the people at Greater Harvest was so loving and kind, we had to come and see about em' and he said, "And make sure that you are," you know he'd say, "if you wanna take 'em to your house, if you want to, you can," you know what I mean and he said you know. He taught us how to love, that's, that's what I'm saying here and most of us do love but you know sometimes you have not been taught, you didn't have to deal with people, you just look, see them and love 'em, either just deal with the people in your surroundings, but we had to deal with the people that came to the church, the drunks, the people that was on alcohol and all that. He let them stay in the church and all and he would have classes, and another one thing that he always said, "Feed 'em first." He said when they--a person come in the church hungry he said it wouldn't be right for us to sit up and have church and, and teaching and preaching and they hungry, they're not hearing what you're saying, feed 'em first and then preach to them, and that's how he did, and they did not feed people any kind of, any old thing, they feed 'em good food 'cause we would sit, we didn't eat until after they ate, and we bought ours, fifty cents, that's how much the dinners would cost, and they had break- I mean they would have meat, vegetables and potatoes and whatever you know, full complete meal in the church. Clothes, people came to church and needed their rent paid and all kind of (unclear). Preachers didn't make enough, get enough money at church and they needed to pay they rent for the church or whatever, he did it for them, and that's what, why people loved him so. He was so kind. I saw one day I was standing out there and it was, like the weather like it is now, and a lady passed by the church and she didn't--she had on high heel open toe shoes and he said, "Miss," he said, and she turned around, "You talking to me?" He said, "Yes," he said, "don't you have no boots?" She said, "No I don't," you know she didn't know where he was coming from, and he told Reverend Bracket [ph.], he said take her over to South Center [Chicago, Illinois] and get her some boots.
Speaker 2: And South Center was?
Speaker 1: It's a department store on 47th Street and that's where a lot of--most of them you know people would go at that time to South Center.

Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And was he over a particular ministry or?
Speaker 2: No, he just worked completely--you know with Reverend and he would have to be--like when Reverend was tired or something, well he'd stay there during the daytime and make sure everything was run right you know, and then he you know would--Reverend Boddie [Louis Boddie] would leave you know have to go someplace, he was always in charge of the services and so forth, like the average minister is now and he was there to help distribute food, whatever the people need. There was a list he had to write down and tell who it was, address and telephone number and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now, where was Reverend Yancy [Robert Yancy, Sr.] born?
Speaker 2: Memphis, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Did you know his family there (simultaneous)?

Speaker 1: And what year was Reverend Yancy born?
Speaker 2: He was born February the 7th, 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay--children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he could sing whenever he would sing a song in that church, anywhere it was just awesome.
Speaker 1: Was he known for one particular song, and by that I meant if he went to visit another church or was he always asked to sing one particular song?
Speaker 2: Not really 'cause you know he--a lot of, a lot of people liked to hear him sing, "All night all day angels keep watching over me my Lord" ['Angels Watching Over Me'; 'All Night, All Day'].
Speaker 1: And that's a--who wrote that song?
Speaker 2: I don't know--Dorsey, yes, Dorsey wrote that, um-hm. Thomas A. Dorsey, um-hm, and that's the only one I can think of right now and I think he use to sing all the time, 'I'm Going Through,' but he was gonna sing something. After he preached, you can rest assured either he's gonna sing it before and then sing it after too, and he loved singing, he could sing.
Speaker 1: How--
Speaker 2: That's where the fellas got their singing from.
Speaker 1: How would you describe him as a preacher?
Speaker 2: He could preach too, and he loved people. He would when--after we got our church he would not, he just refused to put on them excess stuff, you know he never had an anniversary and all he said, "'Cause they can't afford it," and the deacons went to him one time and said, "Reverend quit saying that we can't afford it," he said, "We can, we can--whatever we raise you know it would be all for you. Don't do, don't stop us from showing you our love," and so from them on they started you know having anniversaries and so forth.
Speaker 1: When did you and Reverend Yancy get your own church?
Speaker 2: That was in 1954.
Speaker 1: And the name of that church (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-five [1955] or '54 [1954] was the, First Gideon, he was called to pastor First Gideon Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And when you say called to pastor?
Speaker 2: He was driving past the church and the people didn't have a pastor and they, they saw him, said, "We've been trying to get in touch with you," and they--he said, "Oh, yeah." He said we want--they said, "We want you to come and preach for us."  Said, "We don't have a pastor and we want the people to hear you," and so he went that Sunday to preach for them and then that week you know they had a meeting and decided that's who they wanted to pastor First Gideon.
Speaker 1: And he was the pastor there for how long?
Speaker 2: I think he was the pastor there for about eight, eight or nine years I think, and then he organized his own church.
Speaker 1: And that church was?
Speaker 2: Fountain of Life Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].

Speaker 1: And then where did you move after that?
Speaker 2: Where did we move after that? We moved to 3725 Indiana [Avenue].
Speaker 1: And from there?
Speaker 2: We, we moved to Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois]. After Cabrini-Green we moved to South Commons [Chicago, Illinois] and then we moved to 8300 South Hermitage [Avenue] where my husband [Robert Yancy, Sr.] before he died he told me to make sure I bought a home. He said, "I don't know why I hadn't bought one," he said, "'cause we were brought up in one and I want my kids to have their own home," and so this, this is how we you know moved there, bought that house.
Story_ID: 482033
Speaker 1: Now what year were you in Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois]; that must've been interesting?
Speaker 2: We were in Cabrini-Green nineteen--oh, 1958.
Speaker 1: And that was relatively new then? Wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was so beautiful, it was so peaceful and the kids could go and play. We lived on the fourth floor and I could sit and watch them playing you know and some of the other neighbors on that floor we would all sit there laughing and talking and watching the kids play over in the evening you know time. After they got out of school they'd play you know till bedtime and--
Speaker 1: And were you involved in any activities in Cabrini-Green as it related to the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes I was, yes when we moved to 1230 Larrabee [Street], that had four bedrooms so that's why we moved there and I became the, the leader of the building you know of the tenants there. Every, every building had a leader you know, building leader and then I was elected after the two policemen were killed.
Speaker 1: And when was that, what was that situation?
Speaker 2: You know they, they said somebody at 1150 [Larrabee Street] shot the policemen. They were coming in to, to see about some problems that were going on there and I think when they went back to their car, to their car on the way back you know somebody killed them, and then they--after that then they organized this community group, local advisory committee and I--they elected me the, the whole area elected me to be the secretary for--my name was on the list as secretary and they elected me and some other people were you know, and we would have meetings you know about the problems that exist in the area. Then they said that the mayor [Richard J. Daley] was going to give money so that you know, so that the people could have jobs in the area. So they sent us the applications for the people and we had to scale 'em down so the people could apply for the you know jobs, and then we you know we interviewed them and we had to decide on how we were going to interview them and I said, "Let 'em write a letter explaining why they want this job and the ones that write the most convincing letter we will hire them," that's how we did it and after that we hired them, you know after we interviewed so many. You know it was so many people 'cause so many people needed work and I, I was the--they made me the what is chairman I guess you could say over the hiring and I, you know I did all the hiring of the people and until there became some serious problems with the gangs.
Speaker 1: And that was 1958?
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959] through?
Speaker 2: To '70 [1970] to 1970.
Speaker 1: So the whole family lived in Cabrini-Green?
Speaker 2: My family?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: All your whole family lived there?
Speaker 2: The kids was going to school, the kids--the reason why we moved 'cause the kids said they didn't, they were afraid you know after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed--I mean after you know the thing they had over there so then no he hadn't died yet, but you know they, they started to moving over in--moving the people, oh when they had that riot like on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois]. Where they burned down so much stuff and houses and stuff, they sent a lot of people over to Cabrini-Green and it became a real serious problem.
Speaker 1: But up until then it was a wonderful place to live?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhat, yeah because you know my husband [Robert Yancy, Sr.] did not understand about the new situation and the people next door, the young men next door said he doesn't know Ms. Yancy [HistoryMaker Ann Yancy]. So he go out there and he tell them to get out of the, you know the stairwell, and he said somebody might hurt him (laughter) and we're not here during the day and so that's what caused us to move.
Speaker 1: And what school did the--your children go to?
Speaker 2: They went to Schiller [Schiller Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], they went to--what's the name of the big school where they did the movie? I can't think of it, Cooley, 'Cooley High.' Marvin [Marvin Yancy] went to Cooley High [Edwin Gilbert Cooley Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] and he was one of the--he was the pianist for the Watusi situation (laughter) and then Judy [Judith Yancy] went--I think Judy went there some and then she went to Waller [Robert A. Waller High School; Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois]. Kevin [Kevin Yancy] went to Waller too.
Story_ID: 482034
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any of the parent activities in the schools that your children attended?
Speaker 2: You know I would go to the, you know, the parent meeting, you know the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meetings some, and either my husband [Robert Yancy, Sr.] would go, but I became real involved when I was hired at Holy Family Head Start [Chicago, Illinois]. That was on--down the street from where we lived, I became one of the teachers, I was going to school to get my di- my high school diploma and then I became--after that I became one of the--I became the social worker for the school even during the time I was teaching (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what school was that?
Speaker 2: Holy Family--that was the head start you know and--
Speaker 1: And was that through Catholic Charities [Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago], was that under Catholic Charities or under?
Speaker 2: No, this is Lutheran.
Speaker 1: Lutheran, okay.
Speaker 2: Lutheran Welfare Service of Illinois and during the time--I enjoyed being a teacher. I love children and I would make up songs and we would just have a ball. I would, you know make up little games to play and all. One time I took some beans and they--you know they have the food coloring and we put the food coloring over the beans and then we'd you know let 'em write their, write their name and put the beans, roll the beans over the name and just all kind of little things. I even made up songs about Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] when it was time for us to have you know the birthday thing, and when they put me in the office the kids would come to the door and say, "Come on Mrs. Yancy [HistoryMaker Ann Yancy], come on and play with us (laughter)." My director would look at them and say, "She works in here now," and they would look up to him and say, "She don't work in there, she work out here with us (laughter)," and then Bob made me the social worker.
Speaker 1: Bob is?
Speaker 2: He's the director of the school at that time.
Speaker 1: And his name is?
Speaker 2: Bob Skipper [ph.].
Speaker 1: Bob Skipper, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was so motivating to me, I learned how to do, when you solicit for extra monies and stuff like that, you know I learned how to write the letters myself. If you gave me the first sentence I could take it from there you know and then afterwards I got--you know I could do it all by myself and so he made me the--he told me I could be the--he wanted me to be the social worker. He said, "'Cause you have such a great relationship with the parents and you can get them to do more than anybody here," he said, "so I want you to be the social worker." I had 133 children and families and I went, we--I worked so hard with clothing and food and toys for the children. Although Lutheran Welfare Services would give them toys, I thought it would be good, a good idea if I--we gave them some toys plus their sisters and brothers, so when I would get stuff I would get enough where the parents could take some home for the children, and I got great stuff. I advertised in the newspaper--they had a write up, I can't find the write up about it in the newspaper, but I would go to Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], so many times I would have so much stuff all way up to the ceiling and every--I was just, I enjoyed it. If they didn't have food or something I would find it. If they didn't--if they needed clothes, if they needed to go to the hospital, the children I would set up appointments for them at--you know the hospital, I loved it with a passion (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what year was this?
Speaker 2: This was in nineteen, what '60 [1960], 1959 or '69 [1969], '59 [1959] I think to 1970- '71 [1971] and that's when we moved you know from there.
Speaker 1: So your involvement at that time was with the tenants association at Cabrini [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the Lutheran Welfare?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Service of Illinois (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Services, and then also be involved in the different parental associations with the schools?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That your children attended and--
Speaker 2: And also with the children there because when they, when it was time for them to (unclear) like five years old, they you know would go five or six I think, they would go have to--you know they'd go to the regular school. Well I had to do follow-up you know on that too so became--I had established a relationship with the teachers at Jenner High School [sic. Edward Jenner Elementary School; Edward Jenner Elementary Academy of the Arts, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And you said you were still working on finishing your, your high school.
Speaker 2: I did--
Speaker 1: You finished your GED [General Educational Development].
Speaker 2: I did that and then I was going to college before you know I had finished. After I went to college--started to college and after I got my, my GED they--you know I could get my grades you know and so you know that helped you know me I didn't have to worry about that anymore. I could go, and so Bob said and I had--I was doing--
Speaker 1: Bob is Bob--
Speaker 2: Skipper.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, he said, "Now I think you should change your, you know your classes, and you know do social work."  He said, "Go on and get your social worker's degree," and so that's what I was doing you know when my husband became ill and passed away.
Story_ID: 482035
Speaker 1: I want to--want you to tell us about your children and their musical talents?
Speaker 2: Well at that time they were, they were all in the choir at the church, Butch [Sherwin Yancy] was--Marvin [Marvin Yancy] was a musician then, and Butch was going, he was taking lessons. When I--
Speaker 1: Now, we're at Fountain of Life [Fountain of Life Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're at Fountain of Life, and Marvin was taking lessons at that time, but he was taking them at Lyon and Healy [Lyon and Healy Harps, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and the man told us, he cannot, "We cannot teach him, he has to do it himself. He's, he's good all by himself."  He said, "We, we can't teach him," 'cause he could--see that little boy with the--on the TV that played the Charlie Brown and that other little boy [Schroeder] that played the piano, anything that he played Marvin would stand there and watch him and then sit down and play it, and so when he was a little boy he wanted a piano. I think he was about three years old, three or four. He said he wanted a piano so we would, wading through the snow and everything and trying to find him a real nice piano, and the one we bought we thought we had done something you know, we thought that was it. Oh, he'll love this, and when he saw it he says, "It's not real, it's not real, I don't that," and he just hollered and cried, and you know we didn't understand even after he said that to us. So Kevin he sat down and played it (laughter), so it was a lot of years that we--it come to me he meant he wanted a real piano and he could've been playing at that time, and so he would look he--whenever anybody would come to church that could play the piano organ, he would stand there and watch 'em, watch them play and then when they'd leave he would play and--
Speaker 1: And this is Marvin?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how old was he then?
Speaker 2: I think he was about what twelve or thirteen, it's hard to say 'cause Marvin been playing for so long and I told him one day I said, "Marvin you wanna play the piano?" He said, "Yes I do." And I told him this. I said, "Well you have to have faith."  I said, "Now what mama's talking about, let me explain it to you." I said, "When you go the pop machine to buy a pop you put your money in and you know you believe with everything, you just know that that pop is going to come, that bottle of pop is gonna come down, and, and you'll have your pop." He said, "Yes ma'am."  I said, "That's what faith is."  I said, "Faith is knowing that whatever I want from God he'll give it to me." I said, "That's what faith is," see like I said before you have to explain things to children in the way they understand it. Even to adults, even to senior people like me you know, explain it in the way they understand it and from then on he just played, you know whatever songs he saw somebody playing and that Sunday that we, the young man wanted to go be with his mother, the musician, Marvin went to the piano. You know and the members would tell him, "Get off that piano boy," and he'd look at me, "Mama?" I said, "Go on and play," you know that's after the service you know and that particular Sunday we would not have had nobody to play if Marvin hadn't of been there, 'cause he sat down to the piano and played everything that--
Speaker 1: And was this the first time everybody really heard him play?
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am, yes ma'am and he from then he played, taught the songs, he and Kevin, taught the songs to the choir and you know that's how that you know Joy Choir [Fountain of Life Joy Choir] started.
Speaker 1: Now all of your children sing?
Speaker 2: Every one of 'em except Derrick [Derrick Yancy], isn't that something (laughter)?
Story_ID: 482036
Speaker 1: Now do you have any ministers in the family?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes Kevin [Kevin Yancy], you know Marvin [Marvin Yancy] was a minister, he was a pastor.
Speaker 1: Tell us about Marvin?
Speaker 2: Marvin was a pa- his daddy [Robert Yancy, Sr.] was sick, daddy had had a stroke and he wanted to give up the church you know he said 'cause you he just couldn't, you know couldn't handle it you know, and 'cause he would have seizures too you know and so he talked to Marvin. He talked to me first and I said, "He's too young." I said, "Wait 'til he get--wait another two years and then you know he'll be old enough." I said, "But right now he's too young. There may be things that he want to do." Well, one Sunday, Marvin was singing and all of a sudden he just started to preaching. When he knew anything, he was preaching and he turned around to his daddy and said, "Daddy?" And his daddy you know hugged him and pulled him to himself and he just wept, and from that day on Marvin decided preaching, was preaching and so his daddy wanted him to take the church, but I didn't. I was just, I just didn't want him to do it then, but he did it. He said he knew eventually that he was gonna have to take the church you know, but he said he didn't know that soon, he said, "But it's okay with me." So I said, "Long as you are sure that it's--that you can handle it," and he handled it. He handled it, you, you understand what I'm saying, he talked to people--right now if you talked to anybody that came from Fountain of Life [Fountain of Life Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], they would tell you about the pastor and they have told the pastors where they are now, "Well our pastor," they called him pastor, preacher, "preacher didn't do it like that," and (laughter) you know, and I said, "Now you don't tell your pastor what--."  "Well, we're not use to it like that." I said, "That's not the way to do, you in somebody else's church now." They tell me that all the time.

Speaker 2: He, yes he--
Speaker 1: Or was nominated?
Speaker 2: He was nominated for a Grammy. Kevin was nominated too for a Grammy and I, I need, I wanna tell you about how 'Heavy Load' came into existence. One night about two or three o'clock in the morning, Marvin called me from California. At this time he was married to Natalie Cole and he called me and he said, "Mama, I want you to hear this," and he started to playing, "Heavy load, God's gonna lighten your heavy load," and I just cried and it was at that time President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was the--Reagan was the president I should say and you know the situation was the people, the low income, the low salaries that the folk was getting you know 'cause they were only getting like five and six dollars an hour you know and it was just so much going on you know, sad things you know and I prayed that the Lord would allow that song, allow him to publish that song so other people could hear it and the Lord heard my prayer. I was in the hospital and I needed I had, had open heart surgery and I needed another valve open and you know they said it was you know, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be nearly like it was and the boys came that day, and after they left the hospital they went to the studio and Marvin recorded it. He had found a company that would you know take the song. Kevin was writing the verses as Marvin was singing. When he'd get through and he would sing each line, each sentence you know and then he'd go back to 'Heavy Load' and then Kevin would write another, you know start to writing the other verse and he'd sing it, that's how it was done, and that's how they recorded it. Kevin and Marvin wrote 'Heavy Load' and, and it has been a blessing to so many people. "God's gonna lighten your heavy load," and it's wonderful. I'm not gonna sing (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) We won't ask you to sing it.

Speaker 2: Well, let's say this, he arranged them.
Speaker 1: Arranged them?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he arranged them for them. Now I can't remember all the songs that he did arrange you know. Most of the songs that he wrote was for, it wasn't gospel. It was songs for Natalie [Natalie Cole], he wrote the music to all of her first songs you know and Chuck wrote the lyrics and Marvin wrote the music (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Chuck?
Speaker 2: Chuck Jackson [Charles Jackson], sorry. Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] youngest brother, they were writing partners. They use to be at [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler's studio, that's where they met each other, and so that's when they started to writing together. Marvin played for so many other gospel singers, including Albertina [Albertina Walker], Jessy Dixon.

They were with Jessy Dixon. He has Ozzie Quidman [ph.], he recorded him. He has helped just so many, many gospel singers and ministers too, and a lot of the ministers could tell you things you know, 'cause like Reverend Meeks [James T. Meeks] when he was in theological seminary he'd come home, he knew that he was gonna preach at Fountain of Life [Fountain of Life Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and a lot of times--a lot of other preachers wouldn't, you know didn't let him preach for whatever reason, but he knew if Marvin was out of town and even if he was in town, he would let Meeks preach. Meeks took over the services. He ran the services when, when Marvin was out of town and it's just Reverend Bishop Trotter [Bishop Larry Trotter] and all those ministers. It's just so many of 'em I can't name 'em all, and we just praise God for that you know and Stevie [Stevie Yancy] sings.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now tell us a little bit about the Marvin Yancy Foundation [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The Marvin Yancy Foundation consists of--we have, we give scholarships--and for musical scholarships and educational scholarships. I'm somewhat--I, I began to get a little tired because to help, I didn't have quite the help that I you know that I wanted but now it's so much better, it's so many, the family and so many people want to work you know with us, and I'm so happy for that because we gave scholarships. As a matter of fact, you know you're not supposed to give all your money 'cause you're supposed to keep seed money. I was so happy at first, I was giving everything (laughter) away to the kids and they said, "Mama," I said, "Oh it's just wonderful, let's give it to them," and you know find somebody and I have group of young women that really you know they have taken it over and they have a--they just, it's just wonderful how they--you know they write letters to the recipients and they know--they want them to give all the information. They tell 'em how much information. If you don't get your information in time you don't get a scholarship and all, it's just beautiful. It is simply beautiful and I, I love it 'cause I love children. I love to help, that's one of my gifts, helping, you know I like to go into a church and just you know let you teach--tell you what I want you know with the pastor's permission 'cause they usually call me and ask me would I come and help do this or how can they do so and so or what. Let the leader that they selected to be over this work with that person. I don't go in trying to you know run everything myself, you know and I enjoy that such--I mean I enjoy that. One, I'm just thrilled to death about helping, if somebody need my help, pray or whatever it is, I'm there, I'm willing you know, and the Lord has blessed wonderfully in that area and he's blessed us to be able to give. I, I would like to have a building where we can house little kids up to about age twelve that their parents are unable because of you know certain things to, to take care of them and I'd like for them you know to live there in that building with the--like a father and mother, husband and wife to be over it and then social workers and so forth. Young women that are taking, majoring in social work to come and you know be there for whatever problems that they can handle, and you know I just have so many ideas and thoughts about and everything is about helping somebody, it's just so wonderful. God is so good and I'm glad he gave me that gift, I had to sing. I also do workshops with you know at various churches and things and I, it's just been a blessing you know with young people 'cause they--young women they have problems, kids in school. In this day in age it's terrible, the kids have a hard time at school and we don't--a lot of things go on that we don't know about you know so if you have some, if they have somewhere they could--somebody they can go and talk to, you know maybe mama's not home or whatever you know. What else you wanna ask me, 'cause I be running off this mouth (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Story_ID: 482041
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, we're just about finished. I just had, just wanted to talk to you just briefly about your remembrances of gospel music from the '40s [1940s] to now or maybe I should say the '30s [1930s], late '30s [1930s] when you started, really started singing at the age of nine to where you see gospel music going now, and some of the people who, like yourself are considered gospel luminaries, who are they?
Speaker 1: I see gospel music--at one time we thought that the contemporary music, church music would take over, but there's something about gospel music, you know I shouldn't say something. It, it, it reaches down into your soul and, and you know bring all the pains and all the heartaches out of you, you know just, just dissolve 'em and you just feel like a new person, you know and, and sometimes when you hear a song and you cry, that's relieving you of the pains and things as I just said from--that you've been going through. Gospel music is a, a sermon in itself and I, you know I don't think it will ever--now like The Caravans they just you know got back together and it, it, it's so soothing to your soul to hear them sing. It's something about their singing.
Speaker 2: So you mean from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's anointed.
Speaker 2: From tradition gospel music versus contemporary?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 482042
Speaker 1: You have had a great career in service (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Yeah, um-hm, sure have.
Speaker 1: From working with children to the--well, from the church to children to all of the organizations and things that you have been affiliated with.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I wanna just talk a little bit about your vision and your remembrances of gospel music from the time you started singing gospel to where it is now and you had said something about the comparison of contemporary gospel music and traditional and how traditional music is becoming very important again.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: From the time that you started singing, who were some of the luminaries that you remember, that you worked with and some of the things that you have done and how is their music being received now?
Speaker 2: I've worked with quite a few people and I'm, I'm so happy about traveling, singing and we had such, so many wonderful experiences in that sense.
Speaker 1: And who were some of the groups that you traveled with?
Speaker 2: I traveled with the Roberta Martin Singers, I also was on one of their recordings and I traveled with Robert Anderson.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember what recording you were on with them?
Speaker 2: I, I'm, I'm the song is there, but I can't--the song, one of the songs that I remember is right there, but I just can't say it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll, I'll think about it when I, I'll probably remember it before we over. I sang with Robert Anderson, he hadn't had a recording in a long--a record in a long time and he had us, Opal [Opal Stewart], Vivian [Vivian Riskey] and me we did the background on his songs. 'King Jesus Roll All Burdens Away' ['King Jesus Will Roll All Burdens Away'] was one of the beautiful songs that he sang. I use to--Robert Anderson had a music store [Good Shepherd Music House] in Gary, Indiana and I use to go there all the time to you know just 'cause my cousin worked there and one day she asked Robert Anderson, told him she wanted to him to hear me sing and I sang for him then and I was in the choir when he was directing the choir. So he asked would I go with him, travel with him to Tampa [Florida]. We went to Tampa, we went to so many places at that time down south. I sang with the Roberta Martin Singers, we started from state-to-state you know until we got to Florida. Again we went to the convention and we sang at the convention that night. It was in Key West [Florida] and I enjoyed being with the great Roberta Martin Singers and Robert Anderson Singers [Robert Anderson and the Good Shepherd Singers] and that was such a beautiful anointing. It was just fantastic and I also sang with Willie Webb, we sang with Mahalia [Mahalia Jackson]. Mahalia needed a group you know, a background group and we went to St. Louis [Missouri] and sang with her, and then we sang some songs with the--you know he had taught us as a group to sing and that was just simply wonderful you know to be with Mahalia Jackson and I've sang with Ms. Boddie [Sylvia Boddie] as I just talked about before and now a lot of times I go and I sing now by my--you know, to solos by myself you know and funerals and weddings and you name it.
Story_ID: 482043
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you are considered one of the city's most respected, traditional gospel artists, and you are considered right up there with some of these other names that, like Albertina [Albertina Walker] and you're very respected.
Speaker 2: I can appreciate that.
Speaker 1: In the gospel industry even though you may not have records out right now, you say [HistoryMaker] Ann Yancy, everybody knows of Mama Yancy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, just (laughter), that's right, well I, I did a song with Jessy Dixon not too long ago and that's gonna, you know he's recording that and I'll be on that and plus my youngest son [Terry Yancy] is doing, we're doing a recording with him. I'd like to speak about this gospel music, singers you know that we're trying to put together. I went to Bishop Trotter [Bishop Larry Trotter] and Jessy was with me and we talked about--I wanted to talk about the gospel singers coming together and just singing here, just, just singing for Chicago [Illinois] 'cause this is where gospel music originated through Thomas A. Dorsey, and Sallie Martin and why shouldn't we come together and, and just sing, just sing--have a prayer, have a just a happy, Holy Ghost time and they thought it was wonderful. I'd like for you to know that we're in the process of putting this together and I am so happy. I am just so, just--I'm just thrilled to death and also I've been talking about to the city people to some of the aldermens and some of the people that work with the mayor [Richard M. Daley] about having a walk of fame, a gospel music walk of fame or wall of fame and I'm, I'm seeing that progressing, it's really taking, has taken on and I understand that we will be working on it after the election, so I'm thankful for that. Gospel music has been a blessing to all of us. When I get weary or lonely or sad or confused at home, I just sing and then the Lord just blesses me. I have quiet time at home and I just play my--play the music and I just enjoy the presence of the Lord so wonderful. It's something that God gave us that will never die is gospel music (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you--
Story_ID: 482044
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: What stands out the most? In singing?
Speaker 1: Anything.
Speaker 2: Oh, my listening to my children singing God's praises. They don't know, everyone of 'em liked singing or writing gospel music and it just blesses me so, I tell you. They don't, they don't know, they don't even think about writing nothing else but gospel music and it just blessed me to see that you know and I know that all the teachings and the life that I have led, that I'm living even now is, is--I can see it in, in action, in progress you know and it just blesses me to see that. I'm so proud of them and I'm proud (laughter), I'm so proud to be a gospel singer, I'm so proud of the love that the people show me. I'm, I really am. Whenever I walk in the church--you know there's some choirs that say, "Mother Yancy [HistoryMaker Ann Yancy], are you gonna sing with us today?" (Laughter) And I say, "No baby I came to visit (laughter)."
Story_ID: 482045
Speaker 1: How do you wanna be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a peo- a person that loved God, loved to sing his praises and loved people and as a person that is just concerned about the welfare of whoever it is. I thank God for the opportunity of having been able to motivate some young women to go back to college, go to college which is you know it just blesses me so to see and how the Lord has blessed them you know and in their work that they're doing. I'm just happy you know, I'm just thankful and that's how I would like to be remembered.
Story_ID: 482046
Speaker 1: You had mentioned earlier about your relationship with Reverend Boddie [Louis Boddie].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that he--you learned a lot from him.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned that when you met him he went--you went to his church [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and he told you to read the 51st Psalm.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And is there something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And all of us at Great--

Then it says, "Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be whiter than snow," and it says, "make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice." It says, "Hide my, hide not thy face from my sin, hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities," and it says, "create in me a clean heart oh God and renew the right spirit within me, cast me not away from my--from thy presence and take not their holy spirit from me praise God" [Psalm 51: 1-11].
Speaker 1: We would like to thank you so much for sharing your story. Thank you so much for being a HistoryMaker and being who you are.
Speaker 2: Praise God.
Speaker 1: And how important you are to gospel and to the community, and just before we go I would like for us, for you to you share with us a song that just may mean the most to your heart.
Speaker 2: (Singing) "Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, and to take Him at his word; just to rest upon His promise, just to know, thus sayeth the Lord. Jesus, Jesus, how I trust you; how I proved you o'er and o'er; Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust thee more" ['Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus'].
