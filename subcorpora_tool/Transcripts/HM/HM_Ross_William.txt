The Midwest and East, it was the fall, in Detroit [Michigan] the leaves and the fall time--I went to school at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] called Ann Arbor, and Ann Arbor [Michigan] is because of the trees, beautiful foliage in those days.  Lived in New England, New England in the fall, the city is the prettiest of 'em all so I like the fall. Now that I've been here [Oakland, California] for thirty years, I still like the fall time, although there's no, no change in the leaves, and, but I do like that, that time of year still.

Speaker 1: That's interesting, you--
Speaker 2: That's an Ivy League, that was sort of like, that was probably during the, during the '50s [1950s] kind of a muted olive, olive drab, olive green so that became sort of what my favorite color is.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.  You travel a lot, what's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Interesting, well last year we were in Spain, we were in Southern Spain, actually we were in Madrid [Spain] and Barcelona [Spain], but Southern Spain was kind of a very nice, we had a very nice vacation, and we were there with some friends and so that was a very nice vacation.  We've been on cruises, we like to cruise so we've been on quite a few cruises but I don't, yeah that was, that was one of our favorite I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably--I guess a couple of things that I say when things are going--I say, let's roll, let's roll or sometimes in making exclamation of something that I'm saying I'll say talk about it, talk about it.
Story_ID: 278409
Speaker 1: Okay now we're gonna explore your family background a little bit.  Okay so could you please tell me something about your mother?  What was her name, where was she born, where she grew up?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Julia Josephine Jackson.  She was born in Marietta, Georgia, grew up in Georgia.  Actually her mother [Lula Jackson] died when she was young--her mother died.  So she lived in Milledgeville for a while, Milledgeville, Georgia and then she, I think she came back to Atlanta [Georgia] and went to Clark College [Clark University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So she graduated from Clark back in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then moved to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: How would you describe?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  One more, can we back up.
Speaker 1: Okay before we left you were talking, we were discussing your mother, could you please--how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: My mother (laugher) my mother was an interesting lady, she was kind of the good-Samaritan type.  She always seemed to want to help other people and people in need and that sort of thing.  So we had, when I was growing up, especially after my sister [Lula Ross] went away to school, she would take roomers in and family members and that sort of thing and people who needed a place to stay for a period of time and then, so she was always sort of giving things and doing things, and she was creative too.  She was always kind of taking classes and doing stuff and upholstery, pottery making and that sort of thing, so she was interesting.  She actually, and she taught school for a period of time, but because--in elementary school [William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] we had, we came, you came home for lunch and so I would have to go to a friend's house down the street and so apparently I, I didn't like that.  So my, so my father [Turner Ross] I guess asked my mother could she, I guess not teach so she could be home when I came home for lunch and when I came home from school so, so she didn't teach long.
Speaker 1: Was she an elementary school, elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary school teacher right.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you any stories about when she was growing up what it was like?
Speaker 2: Yeah she did, she obviously it was a segregated area and everything, she didn't like that.  One thing, one thing she didn't like was that her father [Alexander Jackson] would have to tip his hat to, to little white girls who were age, you know because that was part of what you did in the South at that time, and she always, she always resented that.  She just didn't like that whole concept.  She had a brother, an older brother who I refer to as Uncle Buddy and so--and that was, you know, those are, those are the kinda things that I remember about her.
Story_ID: 278410
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your father?  What was his name, where was he born, where he grew up?
Speaker 2: My father Turner William Ross, born in West Tennessee, a little town called Jacks Creek [Tennessee] near Henderson, Tennessee.  My father was an early renaissance man.  He was you know one of ten brothers and sisters and, and he at an early age liked poetry and none of the rest of his brothers and sisters didn't necessarily and anyway, and so he liked writing to.  So he went to Lane College [Jackson, Tennessee], he graduated from Lane and he was in, he liked drama and that sort of thing.  So (laughter) he came--so when he came to Detroit [Michigan] his older brother was here so he came here, well it wasn't any jobs available for any who graduated in drama in 1920 something, '21 [1921], '22 [1922]. So he went to the post office and then sort of in keeping with his you know writing and that skills, he later on he became--he wrote for the post alliance for the union on, and he organized a group called The West Side Human Relations Council in the late '30s [1930s] which was an organization in west side, Detroit [Michigan] that was interested in maintaining the neighborhoods, would sign petitions to get a stop sign down, or put up someplace or sign a petition not to have another beer garden or you know liquor establishment in the neighborhood and that sort of thing, and then he and members of his organization would sponsor a clean-up, fix-up, paint-up campaign every spring.  So encouraging everybody in the neighborhood to clean-up, fix-up and paint-up.  So that was kinda like what--that's what he did and then he was also, both my parents were involved, heavily involved in the C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] church.  They both had background in the C.M.E. church and both had relatives who were prominent in the C.M.E. church, and that's actually how they met.  So the church was a big part of what, what we did too and part of the whole, the whole family right.
Speaker 1: Did he tell you any stories about when he was growing up from his childhood?
Speaker 2: Father didn't tell me much, he, he had--you know it was the large family, I mean I went to visit when I was small.  He didn't really talk much about what was happening when he was growing up.  My mother [Julia Jackson Ross] did all the talking about what happened, my father didn't.  He was, he was kinda quiet about those things. But I could tell that when I would visit that he and his brothers and all would have a good time, they had a good time.  My father wasn't, he wasn't quite--my mother's loquacious, my father's kinda quiet. Although he like to act and that sort of thing, he really--but his personality wasn't one of--and he was soft spoken too, he never, he never hardly ever raised his voice and never, you couldn't tell when my father was angry because he rarely got angry and his voice would raise a little bit, and that would be it, but you know he didn't go off, he never went off.  He was always kinda cool.
Story_ID: 278411
Speaker 1: Your family background, has anyone in your family traced your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well you know on my mother's [Julia Jackson Ross] side there is one of the relatives--I know a relative from Atlanta [Georgia] who has traced the early part of our family you know, so you know there's a gap that I have to put together, the name Alexander Jackson, which is my grandfather's name which, Maynard Jackson is part of that and so there's a, there's a history of our family that's connected with those names and, and I haven't put all of it together.  I know some of the basic parts, but I don't have it all together, so, but I do know that there is some written literature, a family tree that traces part of our family.  That's on my mother's side, but not, not on my father's [Turner Ross] side.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.  Could you tell us something about your grandparents, your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Grandparents on my mother's side?  I don't know anything about my grandparents. I mean I, I know my mother's father was a gardener.  My mother's mother [Lula Jackson] died when she was little and she was raised by a stepmother. But other than that I don't know anything else.  My, my father's father [Josh Ross], really I don't know much about him at all.  The only thing I knew about my mother's mother--my father's mother [Mary Edwards Ross] who I have a picture of, is that she was part Cherokee, I think, Indian [Native American], but, that, that's about all that I knew about her.
Story_ID: 278412
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess I remember school, I mean I remember, I remember early times in school you know, I mean I can go back to the first grade. I can remember, I remember school, what I remember was I liked school.  I knew I liked school, I enjoyed school and I liked music, the music class I was in.  That was in Detroit [Michigan] at that time you had music every day, some form you know, in kindergarten, first grade you were just doing rhythm practices.  They had something called like a little stick band and that's when they would pass out red sticks to half the class and blue sticks to the other half of the class, and they would play a song like 'The Blue Danube' and he would go da, da, da.  Then the red sticks would say, do do, then the blue stick, do, do, do, do, do, do and it would go like that.  I mean something simple.  Now I liked that. And I realized that everybody in the class had a red stick or a blue stick except one person who was on a triangle, because there's a middle part of the chorus where there's the--she's playing the piano and then the triangle just plays and so what I realized what I knew then--this was the early age--I wanted to be on the triangle (laughter). Hey blue sticks, red sticks, everybody's doing that and so I just, I set out to get to the triangle and I did, yeah.  I mean it was just, so those are the kind of things.  I remember going to shop, I remember all the different things, the smells of school and so, so those are my early memories, I mean that are vivid for me of school and also I remember family too.  We use to have something called--I have, I have an older sister [Lula Ross]--we use to have something called family night would--spontaneous.  It was like you didn't know when it was gonna be.  It may be in the middle, middle of the week, it could be during a school night when everybody's finishing then.  What happened at family night then you just, we all gathered together and they played different kind of games, drop the clothespin in the bottle or some other games which was always kinda--pick-up sticks, fiddle sticks, pick-up sticks and those kinds of things, so those, I remember those, those were kinda fun.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's exciting.  I have a question to ask.  What did you have to do to get to play the triangle?
Speaker 2: Well you know it's kinda interesting, it (laughter), I don't really know what, what all I did you know.  I, all I know that it's, I got on the front row with the blue sticks and I was, you know, I was looking good I guess on the blue sticks and you know I don't, I don't remember know what all happened.  All I know is I got to the triangle (laughter), eventually I got picked for the triangle.
Story_ID: 278413
Speaker 1: I know you have a sister, can you tell us her name and something to describe (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah Lula Marie, Lula Marie Ross, Lula Marie Wilson and she was seven years older.  I used to tease my family is that, what I use to say is that my sister, they left, they gave her all the genes for athletic ability, music ability, as well as being smart.  So she was the smartest and she was the most athletic and had the most music ability, but she was very quiet, she was almost introverted, but she was very smart.  I didn't have the same skills but I was definitely extroverted so, so I use to tease my parents [Julia Jackson Ross and Turner Ross], I'd say, "You all just gave me a mouth you know" said, "Lula Marie got all, got all the good stuff."  No she was nice, she was a nice sister, I mean it was--we had, we had an excellent relationship.  She passed about ten years ago, but we--like we never argued you know I mean we just, it was just one of those relationships.  I mean we just, we just didn't.  She was always kinda cool and mellow, she was the first black nurse instructor at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]; was kinda Afrocentric before it was popular, had the first afro, yeah nobody, nobody had an afro when my sister had an afro.  So you know, she had, she went to her own drum, I mean her own beat, but had, so she was nice, she was.  So yeah, so I have you know fond memories of her and she was--she called me bruz B-R-U-Z so--but then she was, you see she so she was seven years older so she was gone you know when I was getting to be a teenager and all so she wasn't even there.  So then, so then that was sort of I'm the baby now and I'm the only one there, so everybody said I got everything you know.
Speaker 1: Did you feel like you were spoiled?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean in retrospect I probably was, but I didn't feel like it--felt I deserved it (laughter).
Story_ID: 278414
Speaker 1: Can you describe the street you lived on, the community, your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 5864 Beechwood [Street], Detroit, Michigan between Cobb [Place] and West Warren [Avenue]. Nice neighborhood.  We had, it was sort of you know middle-class striving kinda neighborhood.  Folks--working folks, people were trying trying to put their kids in school you know that sort of thing, so it was, but it was nice you know and it had a mixture of people.  What I realize now it had an unusual mixture of black people mixed with other nationalities, all in a two-block radius.  Like across the street from me were some girls called the Rayesual [ph.] girls and their father was like from Pakistan I believe and the mother is from Alabama.  Then there was another guy the Connoittons [ph.], and they're--I don't even know where they were from.  Where there was another mixture of black and Asian, the Koonze [ph.], they lived a block or so away so it was a--it was unbelievable you know.  Growing up in it you didn't think anything of it you know 'cause they were there you know and they, they obviously looked like mixtures you know and different things, but in retrospect you say, well that was unusual in--kinda like in one block or I mean in the same neighborhood to really find people you know three or four different combinations, yeah, and three of 'em were actually on my same street you know.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.  What was Detroit like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Detroit was nice you know, I think that where we lived, well I mean you know it's kinda like it's all relative to where you live.  I thought where we lived was nice you know, it was fun.  You play in the streets, you know, you play on the school grounds, you're in the Boy Scouts [of America] and the Cub Scouts, and the Boy Scouts were going to church.  The library was nearby, so it was a community where you had the different strata of the black community all living together and people were striving, you know, parents were pushing folks, pushing their kids to do things and so.  It was really nice, it was nice.  It was an excellent time. The school systems well, well in general the school system was good.  Some of the schools were excellent and I went to an excellent school, elementary school [William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: What were race relations like in Detroit then?
Speaker 2: Well you see now that's kinda interesting.  I pretty, I pretty much lived in an all-black neighborhood.  My elementary school was essentially all black.  When I went to intermediate school then that's when I saw, I was in with the white students, and then of course high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] was, was predominately--the high school I went to was predominately white.  So what--there were problems, I knew there were problems because that was kinda like what my father [Turner Ross] was involved in, in race relations in the west side community area so I knew that there were problems, although I didn't, I wasn't directly involved in a whole lot when I was growing up.
Story_ID: 278415
Speaker 1: Can you tell me are there any sights or sounds or smells when you come in contact with them that immediately remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, sometimes, if I'm someplace where I get that fall smell you know and I just--the trees are, you know there are a couple of places around here and Nevada City [California].  They got two or three blocks that kinda remind you of back to Detroit [Michigan], so every now and then when I'm in--when if I'm in a place like that then I'm reminded of the city, of Detroit.  It's been a couple of times I've been in a--was it--somebody's school, I can't remember whether it was one of my son's schools, and then I had--I got that smell, that school smell there that kinda reminded me of, of [William T.] Sampson Elementary School in Detroit, but yeah, every now and then I, I get something that kinda takes me back right.
Story_ID: 278416
Speaker 1: You mentioned your elementary school. Could you describe it for us?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Sampson. William T. Sampson Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan].  It was a school that went from kindergarten to the eighth grade.  So there was a point in time when my sister [Lula Ross Wilson] and I were in the same school (laughter), like she's in the seventh, eighth grade, I'm in the first grade or something so. But it was a good school.  It was a nice school.  I think they had--it was predominately all black students and 99 percent white teachers, yeah it's kinda interesting, and you didn't, and there was no--you didn't feel any race thing there because you know there were really no white students there, but the school, you know as I say music was an intricate part of it.  We went to--you had shop, you had--you went gym and you had auditorium so you got a chance to explore and to do a lot of different things and art--had an excellent art teacher and program so and library too.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes I remember Ms. Ruth Cunningham; that was one of my early music teachers.  Ms. Whipple [ph.] was another teacher who I had social studies teacher.  Mr. Jones [ph.] was a shop teacher; Mr. Mobley [ph.] was a gym teacher; Ms. Kingstrom [ph.] was a, was the auditorium teacher.
Speaker 1: Auditorium teacher?
Speaker 2: Auditorium, yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Auditorium?
Speaker 2: Auditorium, what you did in auditorium was this: you put on plays, you performed, you did different things in the auditorium right.
Speaker 1: What kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student, yeah, yeah I got mostly--at that times it was H, S, U, honor students and satisfactory and unsatisfactory.  I got mostly Hs.  One time I, I--one of the black teachers was called Mary E. Coates.  Ms. Coates told me that unless, unless I was more careful with my handwriting that I would get a U in handwriting.  I never had a U, never even, and so I wasn't more careful apparently and I got a U in handwriting from Ms. Coates.  Now, my attitude at that time was that you, you--something's gotta be wrong with you to give me a U, and so when I went home my attitude was to my mother [Julia Jackson Ross] was that can you imagine, look at this card.  Look what this teacher did to me.  Can you believe that?  Now I'm thinking my mother, who's an activist, I mean.  I'm thinking my mother's gonna go down there and chew Ms. Coates out.  My mother told me that if I didn't straighten up and so what she said do that I would know the reason why.  So I was kinda disappointed then, and then I realized that I'd better act right, I'd better just straighten up my writing.  So then I didn't get any more Us but it was one of those lessons where you know, you'd better do what the teacher says and you're not all that, you can get a U too.  So that was a good lesson.
Story_ID: 278417
Speaker 1: Then you went on to high school, can you tell us about your high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to a specialty high school, Cass Technical High School [Detroit, Michigan].  At one point in time it was one of the top ten high schools in the country in the early '50s [1950s] when I went there.  I went there in '52 [1952].  You had to either take a test or something to be recommended to go to this high school.  So it was people from all over the city could come to Cass Tech and then you had to major, I mean you had to come there.  You had to be in a curriculum, it was like going to college as a major.  So I was in the chem-biological curriculum, so all the people in the chem-biological were gonna be doctors you know, that was--so you started out tenth grade, so now you're taking chemistry, you're taking general chemistry, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and organic chemistry in high school.  You're taking math all the way through, you're taking--I mean it was like--it had physiology, anatomy--so it's class, so it was quite heavy, but it was nice.
Speaker 1: Sounds like a good school.
Speaker 2: And they had a good athletic, they had a good athletic program, yeah so.  It was a nice school.
Speaker 1: So were you planning--you know you wanted to be a doctor then?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I knew I wanted to be a doctor probably--I don't remember not ever wanting to be a doctor.  I mean when I was little I always said I wanted to be a doctor.  Part of it had to do probably since my sister [Lula Ross Wilson] was, was gonna be a nurse, then I wanted to be a doctor, and when I graduated from the eighth grade [at William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] somebody wrote in my little book you know your little autograph book, somebody wrote that, "And I know you're gonna be a great doctor one day," or something like that.  So, so everybody knew that I was planning to be a doctor.
Story_ID: 278418
Speaker 1: During the break you were mentioning your sixth grade teacher [at William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  What can you tell us about him?
Speaker 2: Mr. Earl K. Powers [ph.]. Mr. Powers was one of those teachers who was somewhat flamboyant and would have always interesting stories to tell about things that he had done associated with whatever we were studying.  And we were studying about firemen.  Mr. Powers had been a fireman someplace and he was telling us about his experience of being a fireman.  If we were talking about policemen, he would talk about when he was a policeman, and anyway but he was interesting and he was entertaining, and he liked green, he always wore green, so I remember him because he was somewhat flamboyant.  Now in retrospect we probably realized that he may have been making up some of those things but it was entertaining and, and we learned something from Mr. Powers.
Story_ID: 278419
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], can you tell us something about your friends?  What did you guys do after school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah well, you know my friends--let me see.  My high--my time in high school was an interesting time in that I--my family--let me backtrack a little bit.  When I was growing up my folks, my mother [Julia Jackson Ross] in particular had kind of instilled in me that I could do or be anything I wanted to do.  So, I had played several sports growing up, was never that good, but was able to get on teams you know.  So when I went to high school I just said well let me see, what's the season?  Okay, track, cross country, oh, well cross country so I made the cross country team.  I went out for basketball, didn't make the basketball team, didn't make the tennis team--ran, and I ran track.  So those are the things--I didn't make; I just missed the basketball team by one player.  So, so what I had to do was my school was like this.  From the time I started high school, went to, school was over at three o'clock and then there was some kind of athletic practice from three until about six, right, three to five-thirty.  Then I immediately had to get the bus and go to work.  I worked at the local branch library from six until nine every night.  Nine o'clock my father [Turner Ross] usually kind of dropped down and then we'd walk home, then I'd do my homework, eat my dinner and do my homework and go to bed by midnight usually. That was my routine all through high school.  So right after school it would be some kinda practice, and at six o'clock I'm at work.
Speaker 1: How did you get a job with a library?
Speaker 2: That's interesting, why I was a page at the library my father, here's how I got that job really, and the lady who gave me the job is actually--she's right here, Mrs. [Clara Stanton] Jones.  She went on to become the first black president of the [American] Library Association in the country and my father used to meet in the library with his West Side Human Relations Company [sic. The West Side Human Relations Council] use to meet there, and so I guess--he had talked to Ms. Jones about you know maybe getting a job for me or something like that so, so they needed a page and that was--I think you were supposed to be sixteen, I wasn't sixteen I think when I started, but at any rate so she gave me a trial and then I just stayed there all through all high school, so that's really how I got a job, my father's influence.
Speaker 1: And what did you do what was your?
Speaker 2: I was a page.
Speaker 1: What your duties?
Speaker 2: Pages did this, we had to shelve the books, so we had to put the books back in place, and we had to know the--at that time it was the Dewey Decimal System.  So we had to know the Dewey Decimal System and place books back in place.  Later on we had to know the--had to learn the Library of Congress system, but the Dewey Decimal is what I had to do through high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where you were in high school were there any teachers who influenced you?  You took all these science classes, were there any teachers who stand out as being more influential than others?
Speaker 2: No. That's interesting, I didn't.  The contact with the teachers in high school wasn't really personal, you know I--you, it was a whole lot different than, than elementary school [William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  It was more business, it was more college like, you know it was like hey, you, teachers, I don't even know whether some teachers even knew me or not.  I was just in there.  Now and there weren't many, there weren't that many blacks in the, in the science curriculum or the chem-biological at that time.  There were like I think six of us in our class when we graduated, six out of about sixty, and so you know we were--I was just there just trying to, trying to do, get by, do what I had to do, do my work and that sort of thing, but I didn't--none of the teachers really--I wasn't inspired by any of the teachers there and as I say, it was a situation where nobody really took a special interest you know, as far as I was concerned, which was a lot different than what I'd come from you know.
Story_ID: 278420
Speaker 1: So after you graduated from high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] you went on to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was interesting too.  I graduated from high school, my father [Turner Ross] had, my sister [Lula Ross Wilson] was ahead of me and my father said he'd put my sister through school you know and she had to go through the University of Michigan nursing school [University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and everything and so he had told me when I had--before he graduated that he really didn't have any money for me to go--to go away to school you know.  So, but I really couldn't, I didn't really believe him, so I applied to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I got accepted.  So it came time for--to send my tuition, my father said, "I told you I didn't have any money."  I said, "You've got to be kidding," and so what happened was then I went to Highland Park Community College [Highland Park, Michigan] for a year, you know and then I worked, and then I got another job, you know, 'cause now I could save some money.  So I went there for a year and then I went to the University of Michigan.  I went to the University of Michigan for two years.  My father got real sick and then I transferred to Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan] and then he passed right after I transferred, and then I finished, I finished, I went to Wayne and then I got accepted to the University of Mich--to Meharry Medical College in Nashville [Tennessee] and then I went to med school.  So there was a hiatus when I was working full-time and going to school full-time at Wayne.
Story_ID: 278421
Speaker 1: I was gonna say so that wasn't--I was kinda use to doing that, working and going to school so that wasn't really too much.
Speaker 2: And you took science classes in college?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, right, I was a pre-med, pre-med major, taking all the biology and chemistry, anatomy classes that I needed for that.  I had a job at the--I was a social worker, ADC, Aid to Dependent Children, that's what I did in Detroit [Michigan] until I went to med school [at Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  I got that job, actually they were desperate.  In there, there are different areas in Detroit obviously like all cities, and there's one area in Detroit which was bound by streets called Hastings [Street], St. Antoine [Street], Rivard [Street], and Riopelle [Street] and at that time in the '50s [1950s] those were some--that was a bad neighborhood, really bad.  It was deemed as one of the worse areas in the city for everything, crime, et cetera and apparently they'd had various ADC workers--in those days the ADC, the workers had to go into the houses and that sort of thing and walk the streets and--they had had apparently a white male there and he had been threatened with his life so he had to leave there.  They had a white female and I think they threatened her also, a lot of different ways apparently.  They had a black female who had a nervous breakdown.  So what they hadn't had was a black male.  Now there were some rules and regulations and requirements for being a social worker.  Number one, they wanted you to be twenty-one, number two they wanted you to have a car, number three they wanted you to at least be interested in social work.  Okay, I wasn't twenty-one, didn't have a car, wasn't really interested in social work--I got the job.  Took the test boom, got the job.  I did not know at that time (laughter) that the reason why I got the job I didn't know where I was gonna be assigned.  So, when they told me what my area was I said, ooh.  I mean I've been living in Detroit almost twenty years I'd never even been in these areas.  So what I decided was this, I said the area, the grapevine will know who I am, and they will decide whether they're gonna let me survive or not.  So my first move for a week or so was just to walk through the area.  See, I didn't even have a car so I'm getting off the bus in this tough area.  So I just walked through area, every day I just walked through, walked through the whole area, didn't carry anything, didn't have anything, just walking through knowing that they would know who I was, and then, then after about a couple of weeks I took my briefcase, started going to see the folks, and what happened was is they had decided that they would let me slide, they didn't bother me.  So I stayed there and I worked and then until I got ready to go to med school.   So they didn't--it was nice, I learned a lot that was--that was probably one of the most educational jobs that I've ever had in my life.  I mean I learned about people, where people, I learned people--I mean, everybody who's a prostitute doesn't necessarily have a bad heart.  People want good things for their children even though they're not doing good things or and that sort of thing.  So I mean I just I really learned a lot 'cause I never, I never had any personal contact with anybody like that, with people like that.  So it was, it was, it was an experience, it was a great experience, and then when I left actually--and then I guess I became a social worker then.  I'm taking blankets outta the house and stuff, I go get an old heater.  My mother [Julia Jackson Ross] was saying, "Where you going with that?"  I said, "Mom, we got more stuff here than the law allows," you know, and then she use to give stuff away and everything so you know I mean, I'm just, I'm just following what you use to do all the time.  So anyway, so I would take stuff around and if people didn't have shoes you know, and I'm taking stuff and, and so when I left they gave me a little party, kinda the block folks did.  So it was nice, I mean that was kinda like my reward, but, it was very enjoyable.  I learned a lot, I learned a lot about people.  I learned how to get along too.
Story_ID: 278422
Speaker 1: Must've been a contrast when you went to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah right.
Speaker 1: From Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you describe your experience in Meharry?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm great experience, as my first experience at a black college, all black.  Also there were--Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] was right across the street, Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] was down the street.  Both were loaded with a lot of beautiful young ladies which was quite interesting.  I had--my current wife [Etna Ross] and I were--we had had a stormy relationship, and actually before I went to Meharry we broke up.  Partly because my friends told me, "Don't come down here attached," you know.  So I just said, well fine, that's easy.  One thing I learned when I got down there that most of the people were from the South and so people from Detroit, Chicago [Illinois] and New York [New York] were not necessarily--they were looked at kinda suspiciously sometime, because you're from a big city and so you know it's kinda like you know, they either think you're kinda half slick or what have you.  So the girls--so it wasn't really in your interest necessarily to be from a big city.  So what I did was I took on a whole different affect.  My father [Turner Ross] was from this small town in Tennessee which is not too far from Meharry, and so I just quickly adapted, adopted sort of a half southern accent, and told the people I was from Jacks Creek, Tennessee, so that was good, so I didn't have to--you know I didn't, I didn't put that Detroit stuff 'cause that wasn't noting you couldn't get over with Detroit; but now if you're saying, "Well I'm from Jacks Creek" that's not too far away, yeah that's near Henderson [Tennessee], not too far from Jackson [Tennessee].  So, oh yeah, I'm from so-and-so you know, the girls would be from some little town some place.  So anyway it was just a nice experience, it was just, it was just, it was a great experience.  And what happened there is that I graduated from Meharry forty years ago, and right now I have four friends that I'm still in contact with all the time, that we've remained friends all the years.
Speaker 1: What was the, the academics like there, what kind of classes did you take?
Speaker 2: Well we took you know, see med school's kinda standard every place, everybody takes the same thing every place else.  So there wasn't you know there wasn't different any place else.  What was different was though I think what, what I learned most and the thing that was probably most valuable for me at Meharry, I learned what it was like to care for patients, to be concerned about patients and to be a patient advocate, you know I mean I saw that time and time again.  I remember making rounds when I was a student with Dr. [Wallace T.] Dooley who happened to be an orthopedist, and somebody came up and whispered to him that one his patients, a little girl, had died.  Dr. Dooley just took his handkerchief out, just kind just kinda boo-hooed right there in front of the class and all and then he just wiped his face you know and then kinda went on you know, and I was saying man it was, he was--but I saw that kind of thing time and time again, where, where the doctors were really concerned about their patients, went out of their way, people were making house calls, doing a lot of different things, and so that was kinda like what was in my mindset you know.  You know I'd say when I start practicing, that's the kinda doctor I wanna be.  So that's what I learned at Meharry and I think that--and I'm thankful I went to Meharry as opposed to some other schools because I'm not so sure you got that same kind of thing.  Everybody has the academic stuff you know, but I'm not so sure you get that same kinda personal kind of interaction with the doctors to that extent as you got at Meharry, and that's what I appreciate Meharry for.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you were there did you know you wanted to specialize or you--?
Speaker 2: No, no I didn't know, I didn't even know about specialties.  I mean I was a senior I didn't--I had no idea about what a specialty was, so I was just happy to graduate.
Story_ID: 278423
Speaker 1: So after you graduated can you tell us what you did?
Speaker 2: Well now you had to go, everybody had to do an internship in those days.  Now what I had done was when I got accepted to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] I joined a program that the [U.S.] Navy had called the Ensign 1915 Program, and it was a program that you could join and each summer you can go to one of the naval hospitals or research and so some work with, with the Navy, and so what happened is all my summers I was stationed at Bethesda Naval Hospital [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland] my first summer.  My second summer we were at St. Alban's [Naval Hospital] in New York [New York], and my third summer we were in Washington [D.C].  We were in Washington again and that was during the March '60 [1960], '63 [1963], the March on Washington with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  So we were there, my wife [Etna Ross] and I were there, carrying signs.  So we were there for that and that was--and so now when it became time for my internship you know I said, well I'm gonna apply for a Navy internship.  So that's what I did and I got in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: You went on the March on Washington?  I'm so happy and so impressed, can you tell us some of your feelings what when you were going to--did it change your life or?
Speaker 2: The March on Washington, no it didn't change my life but it was just so impressive.  I mean it's hard to explain.  Now the interesting thing about it, now the I Have A Dream speech was actually--I've heard that speech before and I mean it's--maybe that was the time that I'd heard it in the March on Washington, because a lot of people didn't realize he, that was one of his theme speeches, so a lot of people have heard I Have A Dream.  I heard it in Detroit [Michigan] at Tabernacle [Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan], and I heard it through someplace else you know so, but what was impressive were the number of people there, everybody of like mind and it was the spirit and the whole communication thing that was impressive.  I mean that's, that whole feeling I will never forget, my wife and I.  We talk about that, we will just never forget the march and hearing, and even though we had heard the I Dream, the I Have A Dream speech before hearing it there was even more impressive, yeah, it was unbelievable.  It was one of the truly great, great moments that we have shared you know in terms of being someplace, being part of history, and not realizing that we're a part of history per se then, but just being there and sharing the moment, and being inspired to just you know do things, yeah we need to be involved and that sort of thing.  So that was, that's what that was about.
Story_ID: 278424
Speaker 1: You went to the summer program [Ensign 1915 Program] for the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you graduated from Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and then?
Speaker 2: Then we did the internship in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: It was a rotating internship in Philadelphia.  It was at--one of the--and that, that was a good internship too, I learned different things and there we went from different--one specialty to another, you were in urology, you were in your orthopedics, anesthesiology, and everything, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, actually they were delivering a lot of babies in Philadelphia at that time and so I wanted to join the century club.  That is be involved in a hundred deliveries, so not everybody wasn't interested in doing that so, but I was 'cause that sounded like something to do so.  A resident, like we were, interns were sleeping in the room and the baby was delivered the residents would come in and usually pick one of the interns.  Well what happened is I told the residents, "Look, just call me, you know, let them sleep," 'cause I'm trying to get the numbers.  So I finally did I think after a couple of months I didn't have one hundred deliveries, but it was an excellent internship mainly because there are you know five medical schools in the Philadelphia area and so the Navy would hire, as a consultant, many of the professors and their department chairs to come down to the Navy as consultants.  So that means, so we're, we're there and we're talking to one of the men who wrote the book on anesthesiology, or we're talking to somebody else whose done some papers in orthopedics and that sort of thing so it was really an excellent internship.
Speaker 1: What hospital was this?
Speaker 2: This was at the [Philadelphia] Naval Hospital [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: At the Naval Hospital.
Speaker 2: Which is no longer in existence that's been torn down, and that was in 1964, 1965.  It was during one of these summer programs that I--when I was in Bethesda [Maryland] I ran into a black steward who, who was on a submarine and I was talking to him you know and I was--and he was just telling me about the submarines and I was saying oh, yeah, that sounds interesting, and so the first thing I asked him I said, "Have you ever seen a black doctor around anyplace?"  He said, "Yeah, yeah there was one in New London [Connecticut]." He said there was a black doctor in the hospital you know so I just said okay, and so after my internship then I had to decide you know what I wanted to do.  Well I decided that I was gonna go to the submarines.  So it was, it was, and that and it was a six-month training program. So I went there and you know it was really kinda, it was, it was tough in some extent because I didn't realize and lot of guys didn't realize that they wanted us to be kinda hard-hat trained and scuba trained so we needed to be in shape.  So I had been, I was half way in shape, but at least it didn't take much for me to get in shape 'cause some of the guys were struggling, but we had to run every morning, you know and because some of the gear that we had to--the hard-hat gear was kinda heavy.  I think those of us that who've seen Cuba Gooding [Jr.] in the picture ['Men of Honor']--well that's exactly the same kinda gear that we had to use, although the one we trained with is two hundred pounds.  The one he had to use in the courtroom is the gas-hard hat which weighs three hundred pounds actually.  So you know if, when you're lugging two hundred pounds just for a short distance and even when you are coming outta the water with two hundred pounds that's heavy, that's heavy, so anyway.  So we had to be in some kinda shape, our legs had to be in shape and that sort of thing for our training for that. And then we learned all about the subs.  I mean, that was fascinating so I mean we learned everything about the submarines and we stayed over there in six months.  We learned about gas, gasses, exchange of gasses, we learned about the bends.  We had to take the bends watch, bends is a situation where divers are down too long and they develop gas in their blood stream and they have to be decompressed in a chamber, so we learned how to work the chamber and to do that.  So that part was that was fascinating and that was--then after that it's when they got assigned to a submarine and that's when, and that's when Ebony got hold of the fact that there had never been a black officer on a submarine in the United States Navy.
Story_ID: 278425
Speaker 1: At that time how many, about how many black officers were there in the [U.S.] Navy?  Do you know or have an idea?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know I don't know how many.  There weren't that many total in the Navy.  There weren't that many line officers, I mean there were only--the first, the first seven or so came in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s] there'd been another, another group that'd come in twelve or so.  So by '64 [1964], '65 [1965] I'd be willing to be to bet there weren't over three dozen black officers in all the Navy and that includes doctors, chaplains and line officers.  So there weren't, just weren't that many.
Speaker 1: I know some people have been in the [U.S.] Army said there was a lot of resistance from the white soldiers with black officers.  Did you find that to be true in the Navy also?
Speaker 2: Well you know I was in such a selective area, I didn't really, I didn't really find a lot of, I didn't encounter a lot of that.  You know like in the internship I mean I was the only black out of the eighteen, but you know we're just all doing our thing so there was--I didn't, I didn't notice anything really there, maybe I just wasn't even paying attention.  What I did notice though is when I went to find a house in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], 1964.  My wife [Etna Ross] is pregnant.  We couldn't live where the rest of the interns lived which they lived right across over in, in New Jersey because it wasn't integrated, and although I'm stepping up there in my officer's uniform, I couldn't stay there.  There was another area where some of the white interns stayed, I couldn't stay there either.  So what happened was I told the commanding officer that I wasn't gonna start, I wasn't gonna start my internship on the 1st of July because I didn't have a place to go, and I told him exactly what happened, said sir I went there, I mean three different places where other guys are.  Everybody's all settled and I couldn't, they wouldn't, they wouldn't rent to me.  So they got--then he and the secretary and all they got together and found me a place near the Tinicum Wildlife Preserve [John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is near the Walt Whitman Bridge some, some area that's kinda away from everything, but that's where I stayed for a year.  So that was, that was kind of a rude awakening--Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the City of Brotherly Love, 1964?  Whoa. So anyway so that, but other than that you know I didn't-- there really wasn't much you know, there was little subtle things that would happen but I was too busy doing, doing my stuff so it didn't bother me.
Story_ID: 278426
Speaker 1: By the time I got to the subs [submarines] now--I mean sub school, not, not really much there.  Then I got sent--my sub was in Newport News, Virginia.  Now things are a little different there, not the [U.S.] Navy per se, but the shipyard was under one of those--you know consent decrees you know to integrate.  The shipyard had not, they, they hadn't done too well.  They were, they had--they hadn't really hired many blacks in the shipyard and all.  So what they usually do is the doctors who came down on the subs they would usually hire them to do the physical exams, and they did that all the time except when I got there.  They didn't hire me, so later on eventually somebody said, okay yeah you can work.  I mean it's like they sent some tech to tell me I could work.
Speaker 2: So what did you do if you couldn't do the physical exams?
Speaker 1: Oh no, I mean see that was just outside, that was just outside work.  You see in other words it wasn't the Navy work.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: Where they would just hire the doctors for in the Navy to do, do exams see, and that was just extra pay.  So it was just like gravy for the doctors who were there on the subs, so I said so they didn't do that to me.  So now what happened was though--so I finally got hired and so one of the reasons they and one of the ways they were getting away or getting around hiring blacks was you had a card, you had-your card for application for employment and on the front of the application for employment, in pencil was either C or W for colored or white, and so that way they'd know who you were so they could hire whoever they wanted and then they could erase that off, see so then it could look like, "Well we just, you know we hired this and that," but on that application card, when the back was the physical exam.  So I had all the cards and so what I did was on the physical exam all the people who were Cs, I made them Ws and I took a corresponding number of Ws and made them Cs.  So they tell me in the 1967 Newport News Shipyard [Newport News, Virginia] hired more blacks than they ever had in the history of their shipyard, but anyway, but so that was, but that was kinda interesting you know, and then I did--you know, I did exams like everybody else did.
Story_ID: 278427
Speaker 1: Before we left you were talking a little bit about some of the training that you had to go through to be on the sub.  So could you tell us something else?  We've been talking a lot during our break about the sub.  Can you tell us what life was like, how you--you know, what the training was, the psychological--being on the sub for so long?
Speaker 2: Well one of the things too, and part of the training too you had to qualify doing the hard-hat diving and also qualify doing scuba diving also and then, and working with the chamber, being able to breathe oxygen and the decompression chamber and all those things were, were tests that we had to go through and had to pass in order to continue.  One of the tests, too that was kind of interesting that happened to me, in wearing the hard-hat suit there is a button on your chest, or there's a valve that lets the air in, and there's another chin button that lets the air out, and so what you have to do is when you're under the water, you have to equalize so that you've got enough air in your suit and you're pushing enough air out so that's equal so you stay buoyant so your suit keeps air in it and you can walk around and do what you have to do.  Now if something happens and you put more air in your suit, more air than what you can push out, the suit fills up with air and takes your hand away from the valve so you can't cut the valve off, and you can't keep up with it by pushing your chin button.  So what happens is you have what they call a blow up.  Now they give you all the instructions.  If you have a blow up you have to breathe out as you're coming to the surface otherwise your lungs expand and burst and you die.  So the doctor before me--now they're talking to you all the time too, you're either a red diver or a blue diver, so they're communicating with you and you can hear the communications going on.  So they're talking to the doctor in front me, you know, "Blue diver I want you to do this and that," and then he was and you could hear him say, "Well I'm getting a lot of air in my suit here."  "Okay blue diver are you keeping up with it, you got your chin button?"  He said, "No, no I can't touch the valve any more" and all of a sudden the next thing we know he's spread eagle at the top of the water.
Speaker 1: Oh!
Speaker 2: So they call the Frogman, "Blow up, blow up, blow up," everybody jumps in the water and brings my man in, all right?  Take his helmet off, play if off he's okay, he did the right thing, so he's not--he's all right.  So I'm next, so now I'm in the bottom of this lake, I'm making sure that I got everything on.  I got the rhythm going--schoop, schoop.  I got the air coming in, air going out.  I'm bouncing around, I've been down there they tell me to go here, go there, put this over here, do--I'm just, I'm working, I'm working.  All of a sudden, I fall in a hole, boom about four feet deep.  So now I got dirt and sand all over my face plate.  I'm down in this little hole and they--so they're talking to me, "Red diver you all right?"  "Red diver's fine."  "Well what happened red?"  "Well I just, I fell in a hole here."  "Okay, red diver you gotta get outta there you know you got make yourself buoyant to get out."  "Okay."  "Okay red diver, you gotta let a little more air in your suit."  "Uh, okay," (sound).  "How you doing red diver?"  "Naw' I'm not good let's--."  "Can you bounce?"  "Yeah, but I can't get out."  "A little more air in your suit, red diver."  Well, I'm you know I'm must letting a little bit air in, 'cause I just saw my man blow up.  So about a half an hour later, finally I got enough nerve to put enough air in to be buoyant to jump outta this hole.  I got outta the hole, they were, "Oh red diver, great, great, you did a great job here you know," and no, I'm standing there, I'm perspiring, it's water in the suit that shouldn't be in there that came from somewhere and so now they said, "Red diver all you have to do is one thing, and we're all through.  Walk over to the table, do something, something."  I said, "Red diver's not moving."  "Red diver, red diver you all right?"  "I'm fine, I'm not moving."  "Okay red diver that's good, you did a good job come on up."  So then I come on up you know and they take a picture of me and I have a picture here of what I looked like after all that incident.  You know it was kinda like guys was look like, "Kinda well, I don't know about all this and that," but anyway, but that was, that was kind of a scary moment you know and I just said it was just hard for me to put enough air into my suit so that I could bounce outta the hole, but I finally did and then everything was all right and then they said I did a good and all that, but that was kinda interesting.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 278428
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your assignment on the submarine (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the submarine--now let me tell you about the submarine.  The doctors on the submarine--the reason why they had doctors on the submarine is because Admiral [Hyman G.] Rickover had indicated to the--since this was a whole new concept.  Now we got a nuclear power, we can stay down forever you know the nuclear, the nuclear fuel can last for five years, you can stay down, you can store food for at least six months, at least. Good food for six months.  What they didn't realize initially is that but you--men can't stay down without the sunshine for longer than three months at a time because you can't be deprived of sunlight without having psychological problems after a period of time, and if you're longer, if you're deprived of sunlight for longer than three months at a time, a significant number, numbers of the crew would have psychological problems.  So they had to kinda revamp how long a patrol would last for the nuclear subs that I was on.  So they designed it so that no, no continuous patrol would last anywhere near three months and most of them were between sixty and seventy days.  My first patrol was sixty-two days, my second was sixty-seven days.  So before you go out the doctor's role had been varied, it depend.  Sometimes he would run the movies or something you know, so I, you know I told them I'm not running the movies, I'll go help pick the movies, but I'm not running (laughter) the movies so.  I didn't run the movies, but my captain asked me and I, I mentioned before when we started my captain liked me for some reason.  So anyway he asked me.
Speaker 1: And his--I'm sorry, what's the name of the ship?
Speaker 2: The [U.S.S.] George C. Marshall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The George C. Marshall was the submarine, it was the--it was a fleet ballistic missile.  It was part of the Forty-one for Freedom, it was one of the last ones of the forty-one, and so.
Speaker 1: You captain's name was?
Speaker 2: Captain Johnson, Captain William Johnson, and so he, he knew I'd had kinda this religious background and family and everything so he asked me would I be the Protestant lay leader.  So I said yes.  So that means I had to get together with the chaplain before we go on patrol, plan all the Sundays, make bulletins, figure out what the sermon or the homily was gonna be, the scriptures and the songs for all the, for the number of Sundays we were gone.  And so I did that, so that's what I had, so I actually, so I conducted the Sunday services for the Protestants on the submarine, and, and then my roommate also was the Catholic lay leader and he conducted the services for the Catholics.  Now there's was one hour before ours, so it was a contest to see who could get the most people out.  Well, since my was a little later I got more people out than he did, but now there, now the other--the officers gave me another job.  The officers decided since I seemed to have more time than they did, they assigned me to be the pornographic procurement officer.  So that meant that I had to go and find all The Dudes, Nuggets and Playboy magazines as well as any other kind of magazine that I thought would be you know to their liking down in New York [New York] 'cause you couldn't find them a lot of places anyway, so I had all those.  So now I have two jobs that are kind of not exactly the same, diametrically opposed.  So in the top drawer in my state room, I have the Bibles, there were Bibles, the Daily Word and other Christian literature.  In the bottom drawer of my state room, I have Dude, Nugget, Playboy and other magazines.  So when they came to see me I had to figure which drawer I had to go to, whether I had to go to the top drawer or the bottom drawer and so that was just, that was part of what, that was my job.

Speaker 1: My captain [Captain William Johnson] he--he said, "Doc you, you need to know something about how to rig the submarine for dive." And that this was a process where every compartment an officer was in charge of rigging that compartment for dive, doing whatever had to make sure things were secure and that sort of thing.  One of the easiest compartments to rig for dive was the topside.  Topside was just being up on top and all you had to do was the cleats that the tug pulled you out on, you had to make sure the cleats were fastened, make sure all the hatches were closed and it was really, you had a life line.  It was really kind of a simple you know, it was a step thing to do.  So I went up there to one of the junior officers to, to learn how to do top--rig topside for dive.  Because I was a new construction so we had to do a couple of several dives and do some other things prior to going on patrol.  So we got ready to, we got ready to do our first, our first dive and the officer who had been trained for the topside, rig topside got transferred. So the captain said, "You got it," told me I had it, I said, "All right."  So now I'm in charge of topside rigging for dive.  We getting, we're going diving for real now.  So it was great, so I took them and told the guys what they had to do, took on the tugs, and then captain's in the con, he looks at me, I salute him.  I go down the, dog the hatch, call the one on one MC [Mass Communication Specialist], tell him that topside is rigged for dive, he comes down, boom, boom and then we dive.  So that was a, that was a great job for me I mean I enjoyed that.  Probably the most interesting thing that happened to me on the sub [U.S.S. George C. Marshall] was Admiral [Hyman G.] Rickover who was the father of the nuclear submarine went out on every Alpha [Assault Support Patrol Boat], there's the first time any submarine nuclear submarine, Admiral Rickover himself went and he demanded all the department heads of the shipyard [Newport News Shipyard, Newport News, Virginia] go out also.  Not the people who built the sub, the people who are in charge of the people who built the sub.  So before you go out on your Alpha Patrol you see a lot of men in hard-hat shoes and shirts and ties coming around looking, making sure that it's all right, because they're the ones that have to go and that's the way Admiral Rickover did it.  I mean that was, it was great.
Story_ID: 278430
Speaker 1: One thing, Admiral [Hyman G.] Rickover was, is a genius.  There's no question he was a genius.  He knew a lot about a lot of different things and he absolutely controlled the nuclear submarine fleet.  Everybody was on the submarine [U.S.S. George C. Marshall] had to come by Admiral Rickover.  You know officers couldn't get on unless he approved you.  At one point in time he would even (unclear) the doctors but they--Rickover got there they decided he didn't have to do that. But sometimes he would ridicule.  He would just kinda have little smart things to say and apparently the last sub he was on there was kinda of a timid doctor, and they say that Admiral Rickover was just chewed him up, just chewed him up, oh yeah.  And so they usually they have that doctor who was assigned that the-- Rickover watch or something where you had to--you had to get all the things that he liked together.  He never had the uniform you know so you had to have this twenty-nine-size waist in the pants and his S.S. Pierce cough drops or something like that, Crest toothpaste and all the things that you had to have for Admiral Rickover, and so what happened is because both captains, there was a blue and a gold crew, both captains have to go out on this patrol and they told me they said, "You know Doc, this is, this is our livelihood you know so we want you to just be easy you know, we, we understand that you're outspoken and that sort of thing," but he told me to be easy with the Admiral.  I said look, "I'm not gonna change.  If the Admiral's nice to me I'll be nice to the Admiral, I said if he's not nice to me he's gonna catch it."  "Aw, Doc please, please just for us?"  I said, "Okay. I mean, we'll just see."  So soon as the Admiral got on board, he said I wanna see the doctor.  Both captains said, "Oh Lord what in the world?"  And so there was another doctor too, there were both of us so we went to see the Admiral and I said, I asked him did he have a radium dye watch, 'cause that's part of his Rickover stuff, you know you gotta ask everybody, so I asked him.  He kinda chuckled, no he didn't have one.  So anyway I looked at him and everything and we looked at him and checked his chest out and he had a cold, actually he had the flu so we gave him some medicine, and I asked him, I said, "Is there anything else I can do for you Admiral?"  He said, "No nothing but shoot me, you know so."  I said, "Aw no, no you're gonna be all right."  So now in the wardroom table now you got all these officers, these captains and everything and Admiral Rickover was sitting at the head of the table, and he commands the whole conversation, and since he's such a brilliant man he knows about everything, I mean he's well read, so he knows about tropical medicine and he knows about hurricanes, he knows about this and that he knows about everything.  I mean he really knows. And so he just starts a conversation about something and he'll ask some of the officers you know.  Well what happened was the officers were just, they just, they didn't know, didn't say anything and so I ended up he said, "Well what do you think Doc?"  So, I took the pressure off of most 'em most of the time when we ate 'cause it was just me and the Admiral, we just back and forth you know, hey.  I said, "No I don't think so Admiral Rickover, you know so and so and so."  "No, no that's not right."  "Where'd you get that from," you know, I mean so anyway so that was fun, you know.  We were, we just, we rolled.  So afterwards, first of all both captains said thank you, you know for you know kinda taking the slack and being nice to the Admiral.  I said well the Admiral was nice to me.  But we got ready to leave, we're standing on top side at attention, Admiral Rickover came by, stopped, shook my hand and said, "Thank you for taking care of me."  I said, "It was a pleasure sir," gave him a salute.  Everybody said, Admiral Rickover has never in his life stopped for anybody, so that was a--I said, "I needed a picture of that," that was the only time that the Rick- but anyway he was actually nice, he was a brilliant man, I mean.  So I learned a lot from the Admiral, I mean not only I, I mean I knew some things you know, but other things I'm learning, so it was great.  I mean I like to talk, he Admiral was talking and stuff and so, they said, "Aw man, thank you, thank you."  So that's the, that's, that was my Admiral Rickover encounter, but the patrol itself was nice--
Story_ID: 278431
Speaker 1: The patrol is not, it wasn't a whole lot to do and so you kinda got into a routine [on board the U.S.S. George C. Marshall].  You got up, I had a corpsman, so not too many people got sick and the corpsman would take care of them, but you know you ate breakfast, then I did a lot of reading, and then played games, played--it's kinda interesting too and I played, we played a game the [U.S.] Navy calls it acey-deucey it's called backgammon, the difference is the Navy you, you instead of putting your men on board, initially, you come on board, everything is off, but it's a big thing and on the submarine it's really big 'cause, you know.  So there's a contest, you know you got the officers, you got the enlisted men and you got the chief training officers. So it's--and then they have a championship and then what they do is whoever wins gets a chance to get thirty days of free leave.  I mean so you just get some more vacation, free, you can go anyplace you wanna go, you know so anyway.  So it's a big thing, so I played, I was fairly good at acey-deucey, and but there was a young officer who was actually better, and so he won for the wardroom.  I mean he and I were battling back and forth, he won for the wardroom, and so what I told him I said, "Well, you may have won for the wardroom but I'm still the man."  So he says, "I don't understand Doc, what do you mean you're still the man?"  I said, "I'm still the man, you just won here, I'm still the man."  So it got to him to the extent that one day in the wardroom when we're eating, he tells the captain, he says, "Captain, didn't I win the championship for the wardroom?"  The captain says, "Yes."  He says, "Well Doc says he's the man."  The Captain says, "Well if Doc says he's the man, I guess he's the man." (Laughter) The rest of the officers were just saying, "Ooh."  Yeah, so it was funny, it was funny. I mean as I said a lot of things happened, the guys were, the guys were very nice and we had, we got along very well so.
Story_ID: 278432
Speaker 1: You have all these wonderful jobs, and you're the doctor, did you ever give anybody a pill (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I said we had the corpsmen you know so we didn't, I really didn't, I don't think I did anything for anybody.  I had other jobs too [on board the U.S.S. George C. Marshall].  See I had to check the, part of the gasses that are used in these, in these missiles.  There's a poison or something called tritium so I had to, there's a tritium monitor.  I had to go check the monitor to make sure that we, that nothing was being spilled into, into the submarine itself 'cause that's poisonous you know, so anyway.  So I had other jobs, I had to check what the oxygen concentration was and that sort of thing.  So there are various monitors throughout and that was part of my job too.  One of the things that was kind of interesting too is that we were trained for escape to, to help people if we had to escape outta the submarine.  Although you only could escape if you were four hundred feet or above, if you were below that you couldn't escape 'cause there's no way for you to come out and come up you know so, so you'd had to be kinda perched on a ledge somewhere you know I mean theoretically so it's kinda like the chances of that happening, if anything happened to yourself, you're not gonna be perched somewhere where you can come up so, but to make a long story short, we went on out for trials that was part of the mission of the sub, is to, is to be, remain undetected.  So that means you gotta be silent, you can't have stuff rattling around and everything.  So we went out and the escape hatch was rattling so they tried to fix it and everything and came back.  I'm sitting in the wardroom and the captain said, "Seal it!"  I just kinda looked down and said ooh.  They sealed the escape hatch in the submarine.  This is before we made our patrol, just sealed it.  So those were some instructions I didn't have to use.  I didn't need all that training I had for escaping and that sort of--I didn't need that anymore because we had already, we'd sealed the hatch so that it's not rattling and that's the way it went, we just went on.
Speaker 1: Well I'm glad you didn't have to use it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah well, you're right.  One of the things too they had to do is this.  Initially they didn't know how they were gonna handle messages.  See we can't, we can't send messages.  We can receive messages, we had the trailing wire so we could receive messages, but we couldn't send.  Initially what they thought they would do is that they would not let anybody know if bad things--if bad messages came through.  They had to stop that immediately because messages would come in and they wouldn't tell anybody anything so everybody's worried.  Is it me, is it me, what's happening?  So then they had to adopt the policy no matter what happened, if the messages come for you, you had to be told.  So now a man's, a guy's baby died, another guy's mother died while you're on patrol and you can't do anything about it.  You can't get off, you can't send a message, you can't do anything.  So part of what I had to do was to console those people who were having problems you know having problems with that and it depends on when you were on patrol, the guy's baby died, his baby died shortly after we started on patrol. It's three months before he goes home.
Speaker 1: That would be hard.
Speaker 2: It's tough, that is tough, that's a tough, but everybody knows that.  You know it's just, it's one of those things everybody knows before you go, that you can't get off--the only way you can get off the sub, unless it's something happens to you where the doctor has to say okay, you need to be, we need to abort this patrol and, and  get off.
Story_ID: 278433
Speaker 1: Just before we started you showed me an award and it's named for the Dolphin?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's called, yeah, the dolphins [Submarine Warfare Insignia].  What happens in submarine service you, you wanna earn your dolphins and the officers--the dolphins are gold listed, and dolphins are silver, and so to get dolphins for the doctor you have to pass a test that involves knowing something about the submarine as well as knowing something about the gasses and et cetera as well as you have to do a project.  I had, I did a project on something about tooth decay and something I did with the dental department where I had to set the--another thing, we had to, we had to actually act as the dentist too in case something happened.  So we had to go to the, over to the dental clinic and get trained and we had what they called the universal extractors. 150 and 151, I do remember those numbers, and actually I had to do something one time.  I had to do what they call a drill and fill.  There was a guy who his filling got infected, so I had to take it out, drill it out, I gave him the anesthesia and I pack it with a temporary, what they called zinc oxide. Zinc oxide and eugenol. I don't even know if they use it anymore, Z-O-E. And so I packed it with that, gave him the antibiotics and he did all right.  We got back to base, the dentist looked at it and said, "Well let's wait until this kinda chips off," yeah he didn't even take the temporary out, he just let it stay there.  He said, "Aw this looks good we'll let it stay there for a while."  So I did a project and then I don't remember all the project but I know I had to, everybody had to, I had to look at everybody's teeth and do something, but anyway, that was part, that was part of what my project was, and then after that, after passing the test and all I got my dolphins, so.
Speaker 1: So do--are there are lot of people with medical dolphins?
Speaker 2: Not a lot of black people (laughter).
Speaker 1: Not how many (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't--you know, I don't know if there's anybody else.  There was, there was another black doctor who came on the subs after me, but he didn't get his dolphins, and I don't know how many came after that.
Story_ID: 278434
Speaker 1: Because after a while they decided they didn't need doctors, I mean they really didn't need 'em in the beginning but it was a, it was a public--it was something to show for appearance and all--to public relations kinda thing so that parents would feel comfortable that their sons were under the water and there was a doctor there too in case they needed them.
Speaker 2: Right, that's understandable.
Speaker 1: See after a while they said we don't really--they got a corpsman there too you know so, and if it's really bad the doctor's not gonna do anything anyway.  Although we were equipped to do a lot of things, see we could convert--the cafeteria could be converted into an operating room and we could bore holes in if you had a hematoma--subdural hematoma underneath your head, in your head and skull we could drill that out, we could so some minor other procedures.  Actually we could do, theoretically we could do an appendectomy but the problem was most of us hadn't done residencies yet so we're just passing internships.  So we didn't have any skills for that, so they had a lot of instruments and lot of things there available, that we were nowhere near being able to use, so if anything happened to anybody or needed anything, we'd have to abort the patrol.  Which means we got to go someplace else and, and, and come up.  We had one emergency when something, somebody's clothes caught on fire in the laundry room, so there's smoke all over the submarine [U.S.S. George C. Marshall].  Now we're some place where you know we're not supposed to be well, that we can't surface really.  So my job is to figure out how much air do we have before we have to surface and then, and then we got instruments all along and there was some--a math problem and so then the captain would know how far he could go in which direction to get outta the area where we are so that we could come and stick a stack-up and get some air, fresh air into the sub.  So that was kinda exciting you know 'cause it you know 'cause then the captain had to call me to the con and then I had to run around and get all these figures and everything and then tell the captain how long we had you know, we had four hours and sixty minutes or four hours and fifty some odd minutes, boom, boom and so then we hightailed it outta there so that was interesting.  Another time a Russian [Soviet] trawler pinged us.  It's like the movies, so and that what, and see that's a no-no I mean 'cause we're not supposed to be detected, so the Russian trawler pinged us and that means and we're trying to get away but it's on us, we can't get away.  So we go, we have what they call a quiet mode and that's when you cut down all the unnecessary machinery.  He still was on us, so then when he called for the ultra quiet mode and that's when you're not talking and not walking.  I mean that's like you're barely breathing.  I mean this is really like the movies.  So they finally went to the ultra quiet mode, he did some maneuvers and then we got away from the trawler, but, but that was kinda exciting, that was kinda interesting, you know to have to do that, but other than that it was not really a whole lot of things exciting going on, you know.  You had one month before the patrols.  Fortunately my patrols were in two different places.  One was in Holy Loch, Scotland and one was in Rota, Spain.  Holy Loch, Scotland, that's when I realized that my name Ross is a Scot name, so they were--the town where, Gourock [Scotland], small towns and I had walked the streets and I'd go in different shops and stuff, people knew my name, it was kinda great though this small town.  So I was a kinda oddity, you know they saw me.  So that was kinda fun, that kinda fun.  In Rota, Spain we were--actually we were in Rota which is right near the sherry capitol the world Jerez de la Frontera [Spain], so in the daytime we're drinking sangria, in the evening drinking sherry.  So that was kinda nice every, and then also we got a chance to go to bullfights too, so I saw the great El Cordobes [Manuel Benitez Perez] when I was there.  He was one of the kinda the Joe Namath-type of bullfighter.  He was quite famous during those times, so I got a chance to see him.  So those--it was quite nice you know my, 'cause I didn't have a whole lot of responsibility while we were getting ready for patrol--a month to get ready and so I just, I was just kinda just there.  I helped picked the movies and just kinda taking it easy.
Story_ID: 278435
Speaker 1: Just before we left you were talking about you had gone to Scotland and found out the Ross name was very prominent there and everybody loved you, you found your home your family, and then you went to Spain right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, meanwhile I forgot to ask you was, how did you join the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Well that's interesting. I joined the Navy mainly because I liked their uniform, the starch white uniform I thought was just the best uniform in the world, next to the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and the Marines have really have the uniform, but the Navy's starch white, and so actually I didn't even know whether the [U.S.] Army had this program or not.  Once I discovered it was the Navy's program I just went and applied, 'cause I, I didn't care if anybody else had it.  Actually I asked, I, asked them is this, do the Marines have the program, that's what I asked about and they said no, the Navy take--is the same the Marines but so that's why, that's basically why I joined.  That was one of the first uniforms I bought too which is a dress uniform and that's not what you're supposed to, you don't need that to work, but I just, I wanted one so when I was in those clinical clerkship times in between med school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]--was in Washington, D.C. and so I wanted the high white.
Story_ID: 278436
Speaker 1: Well you became very famous.  You were in a magazine, in Ebony.  Can you tell us about that experience when the reporters and photographers came on board [the U.S.S. George C. Marshall]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that was kinda interesting.  What happened is I don't remember how they got the whole story anyway I think, I think my wife [Etna Ross] had identified that I was on a submarine or something you know and anyway one day I guess they came to check it out to see what was going on and then once they got the story the boat was being commissioned in Newport News [Virginia] and so they decided to come down there during the commissioning and to, and to do the whole story.
Speaker 1: And commissioning for those of us who don't know?
Speaker 2: Commissioning the submarine, yeah the, that means it was being christened and put into use about it being put into use and that's--and so actually they had Mrs. George C. Marshall [Katherine Boyce Tupper] there, who's the wife of the late George C. Marshall it was named after.  My mother [Julia Jackson Ross] was there, my mother, oh my mother loved that, aw my mother, bless her heart she just, she was so proud, and so Ebony and they were just around you know they were taking pictures and taking pictures of the admirals and this and that and they got a chance to go into the sub and aw, aw it was great, it was great.  Oh, I loved it, I loved it, it was nice.  It worked out very nice and they were very nice and people and everybody was gracious so.  It was a nice experience.  The thing that I didn't--a lot of people who have done--a lot of, a lot of black pioneers have suffered you know, have really gone through a lot.  Now classmates at Annapolis [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] or what have you not speaking to you, going through harassment, hazing, obvious prejudice and so I, I didn't really feel that I was a pioneer per se in that I really didn't have to go through a lot.  In other words, I just kinda, I kinda showed up.  Actually, I didn't think and had I know that I was gonna be first, I may not have gone.  When had I talked to the steward on the submarine he said he had seen a doctor in New London [Connecticut].  He was correct, there had been another doctor who had been stationed at the New London Groton Hospital [Naval Branch Health Clinic, Groton, Connecticut], but he wasn't on a submarine and so he's thinking--I'm thinking that he's been on the submarine, so I didn't, I was you know, I didn't want to be a pioneer but as I say, but as it turns out it wasn't really a struggle you know there were some things that were going on but they were not, it wasn't a big, a big issue, and so I didn't, I didn't really feel that, and I still don't feel that it's, that big a thing.  I mean I just happened to be there, I mean in all honesty you know, I just happened, I just happened to be lucky.  I just signed up for something I wanted to do and I was there and just kinda went through and didn't have a whole lot of things going on, whereas there are a lot of people who I mean have really suffered you know I mean going through a lot and have had to overcome a whole lot and so those are the, I mean those are the real heroes. I mean those are the people who really deserve all the accolades and that sort of thing, I just happened to be--fall into a spot and had a good time, enjoyed it and didn't have too much, too much flack.
Story_ID: 278437
Speaker 1: So after you left the sub [U.S.S. George C. Marshall] you went to do your internship, and this is kind of interesting you're--?
Speaker 2: Yeah what happened now after I left the subs, once you, once you--I made two patrols--after my second, after each patrol you can do whatever you wanna do, and so by this time I knew that I was interested in orthopedics.  I had been the team physician for the New London Whalers football team, so the New London [Connecticut], Groton, Connecticut is just a small little area so now I'm there with the football team and so they treated that like you know Friday night everybody in town is out to those games, so that's really big time in those areas and they would, and I mean it's so big that they would interview the doctor, you know.  "Well is everybody all well, I mean who's so-and-so"; "what so-and-so, he's the halfback here he had."  "No, no he's good he's gonna play you know."  "What do you think about so-and-so, he's a senior, you think--is he gonna be a good college player, prospect?"  So I mean that's the kind of, so that was the intensity, but anyway I liked that and so what happened was I applied, I applied for a fellowship at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and so I got accepted to go down there and since I could do pretty much what I wanted to do, so the [U.S.] Navy said yeah and Yale said yeah so that was great.  I went down there and did a fellowship and that actually was sort of like a resi-term, a intern resident, where I didn't have to--it wasn't a real residency but it gave me a chance to get some insight into orthopedics before I actually started my residence and then I started my residency after I left the subs in San Diego [California].  Interesting too why I choose San Diego, number one, I had just been in a couple of the worst storms that the Northeast had had and I when I went down to Virginia, I went down to Virginia and they had one of the--a big storm down there so I came back to Connecticut I'm in another storm, got snowed in two or three times.  Well one time I couldn't leave the hospital, another time I couldn't leave the house and I decided that you know what, that's enough of this.  I just didn't want any more of this, I was you know, I've been living--I'm from Detroit [Michigan] and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I mean I've been in the snow and below zero stuff all the time.  I had two classmates that were in residency in San Diego in orthopedics.  I'm talking to them one time during Christmastime, I'm freezing, snowed in.  They down there talking about their seventy something degrees, so I told the Navy I said look, I'm due to get out of the Navy, but I'm applying for a residency in San Diego and they wrote me back and said you have to apply for three things.  You have to have three. What's your second and third choice?  I wrote back, I said my second and third choice are to get out 'cause my time is up, so either I get San Diego or, or I'm gone.  So I got San Diego and then when, after I finished in San Diego I never came, never lived back east, Midwest again.  I've always been out here since that time, to live.
Story_ID: 278438
Speaker 1: You became an orthopedic surgeon right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, then when I went to--when I went to San Diego [California] then I went four years of orthopedic training, to be an orthopedic surgeon and then after that then I went to [Marine Corps Base] Camp Pendleton [San Diego County, California] with the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] for one year.
Speaker 1: Did you get to wear your uniform, your white uniform?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh, I, I by this time see anytime it's dress up I'd been wearing my white uniform.  Actually because, because our boat was in new construction we had commissioning, I had a sword too, I actually had a sword and I still have a sword as a matter of fact yeah, which is kind of interesting.  The swords, the best swords are made two different places, one is German steel blade and the other is in Spain. Toledo [Spain], Toledo steel blade.  So when I was in Spain I got a Toledo steel blade sword which is sweet, sweet.
Speaker 1: Is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it's nice, so anyway so, yeah so I actually had that and the Marines now, the interesting thing about the Marines, obviously the Marines are spit and polish and it was the time of [Admiral Elmo R.] Zumwalt [Jr.].   Zumwalt wouldn't allow you to have a beard you know so it'd be neat and that sort of thing and so since I was sort of a maverick to some extent I had a beard.  So now a beard on the Marine base is kinda strange.  The CO [Clinical Officer] of the hospital and he said he knew it was within regulations, but you know he didn't know what the commandant and the base was gonna do and say and so I said well, we'll just see.  Anyway, and I was kinda, I was a little cocky anyway because it wasn't like I just got out you know come in there, I mean I had some stuff on my chest now I got a couple of ribbons.  I got the dolphins [Submarine Warfare Insignia], I got patrol pins with two stars in it you know I mean so it's kinda like all right, I got some stuff up here.  I'm a lieutenant commander and I was and I always I dress, I like to dress so I mean I wasn't slovenly and I had a neat beard and everything, but to make a long story short what happened one day the CO--the commandant of the Marines twisted his ankle and had to come to the hospital.  I was on call of all the doctors, so I had to take care of him.  So I took care of him you know and put him in a cast, gave him a splint and everything and so they wanted to know what happened, what did he say? He didn't say a word.  And then later on I saw--he asked me to come down anyway, to make a long story short, he didn't care.  In fact he invited me there for something else you know he had some other officers and things there and so he invited me to this--so it turned out to be all right you know he didn't say anything he didn't care, so they were upset and worried about it needlessly, but that was an interesting experience too.  That was kinda spit and polish.
Story_ID: 278439
Speaker 1: How'd you come to live in Oakland [California]?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  One of my best friends who still lives here, William Darryl Oden, a guy I grew up with in Detroit [Michigan], we were Cub Scouts together, Boy Scouts [of America], went to the same church, sang in the same choir, joined a fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] together, best man at my wedding: he was here.  So I said I'd come up and look and then another friend of mine was thinking about coming here also.  Another guy I'd known in Detroit, Michigan--in Detroit and the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] was here, another physician and so it turned out there were three or four folks who were around and I knew and so I came up and I looked around and I said okay, yeah.  I like this.  I had a lot of offers I could've gone to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], could've to Compton [California] could've gone a lot of places, but I decided to come here and that was one of the best decisions I think I ever made.
Speaker 1: I think so, and where did you work, could you tell us about what you've been doing here, your practice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well what I've been doing I came--I had a great residency in San Diego [California] and so it was a great general orthopedic residency.  Now we were in the age of super specialization where you learn more and more about less and less so orthopedists--there are branches of orthopedic surgery now where you may be a hand surgeon, you may just be an upper extremity surgeon, you may just be putting in total joints, knees and hips or you may just be a foot and ankle specialist.  My son specializes, he's an orthopedist, but he's a foot and ankle specialist in Atlanta, Georgia.  So that's, that's sort of the trend now--or you just may be doing athletics you know, but in those--when I came out here, you just, you did everything.  You did, you worked and now guys are just children orthopedics you know.  So we did everything, I mean they didn't have a neurosurgery residency program in San Diego so we had to, we had to substitute for the neurosurgeon so we, we felt comfortable doing cervical spines, lumbar spines, there was no problem with that, and so it's interesting.  So when I came out I was a general orthopedist and I did everything and it turned out that I had an interesting practice, a great practice, a lot of people. Twenty-five years or so doing surgery. And now I have what I call my reward practice.  What I have done now, I don't do any surgery.  I haven't done any surgery in seven years or so.  I don't do any surgery, I don't have any night call and at home I practice down to the patients that I like.  So now I only see the people that I like. And they see me, I mean maybe you know fifty or sixty folks that see me every three months and they come and see me and I don't belong to any of these HMOs [Health Maintenance Organization] or anything so they pay twenty dollars or whatever it is my nurse charges or they bring me some food or something in kind.  So I have a country practice and they come and we talk about things that have nothing to do with orthopedics, so this is kinda fun.  I'm sitting here talking to folks and I'm enjoying it, this is nice, this is nice.  So I call this my reward, this is my reward because I told my son, William [Alexander Jackson Ross, Jr.] the only thing that you really get when it's all said and done, you want a few people to say and to testify that you tried to make them better, because that's what it's all about.  The few folks can say that you tried to help them and hopefully some can say that you helped them, but the idea is that when it's all over, it's not the money, it's not this, it's not that, it's that you were able to help some people who appreciate it and can say thank you.  So this is, I say I'm enjoying this as much as anything I've done.

Speaker 1: Your practice, were you, were you with Children's Hospital [and Research Center Oakland; UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, Oakland, California], right, in Oakland?
Speaker 2: I did work at Children's Hospital; I was on staff at Children's Hospital and helped to train the residents there at some point in time.  I worked with the Arlington Medical Group [Inc., Oakland, California] for twenty years, which was a black multi-specialty group.  They started in the early '50s [1950s] and I was the orthopedist with them for twenty years, so that was a great experience, and [Dr.] James [A.] Watson was sort of my mentor and someone who I really looked up to and admired and was kind of who I wanted to pattern myself after, the ultimate gentlemen.
Speaker 1: Oh was he?
Speaker 2: Just classic.
Speaker 1: Was he?  Can you tell me are there a lot of black orthopedic surgeons or are you one?
Speaker 2: Oh no there are quite a few now, there were in 1969 there were less than twenty-five black orthopedists in the world.  Now, I don't know, I think somebody said over three hundred. But it's growing, growing, growing.  There was a time when I was at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] doing that fellowship I did go to an orthopedic meeting in New York [New York].  That's before I even started my residency and that's when I met some of the black orthopedists and that's when I was told at that time there were people there who could name all of the black orthopedists.  So there were, as I said I think there were less than twenty-five in 1969.  In this area there are quite a few, there are quite a few black orthopedics in Oakland [California].  At one time I think we had about ten, right now we have a few but some of 'em retired or doing less and less you know.  All those guys who are near my age are not doing as much as they, as they use to.  So they're slowing down.  There are still three or four who are really working real hard, but there are only about I guess maybe about no more than four who are really working, one, two, three, four--six, no more than six right now that are working.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Pretty hard right.
Story_ID: 278441
Speaker 1: You've mentioned that one of your sons was a foot--ankle, foot specialist.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your children? And your oldest is?
Speaker 2: My oldest is William Alexander Jackson Ross, Jr., Allie, we call him Allie.  I didn't want to call him junior or Big Jackson, Little Jackson, Big Bill, Little Bill I didn't like that so we call him Allie, so he has his own separate name identity, and his son is William Alexander Jackson Ross III, and they call him Jax, J-A-X, so he has his own name identity.  My oldest son is probably, he--I didn't know he was gonna go into medicine, but he probably has followed me as close as any, any of my sons, in other words he's in the same field, he has kinda the same demeanor and you know he's gonna do all right, he's gonna do all right.
Speaker 1: And where does he practice?
Speaker 2: He practices in Atlanta, Georgia and he's, as I said he's an orthopedic surgeon.  He's a foot and ankle specialist, but he's doing everything right now.  He's only been in practice, in this particular practice for a couple of years so.  He's doing all that.  My second son is Peter Ford Ross.  Peter is the son who looks more like me at this point in time.  So the greatest compliment is that, "Oh are you all brothers?" (Laughter) So Peter, Peter is a civil engineer for PG&E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company, San Francisco, California] and he's a--I mean all my boys I love my boys everybody says that. And then my third son is Benjamin Scott Ross, my birthday son.  He was born on my birthday, 26th November, and people who knew me then say that he is, he is what I used to be.  So he's jumping around trying to do a lot of different things.  They're all interested in music to some extent.  He's most, most interested in music and worked with [M.C.] Hammer for a while and was on 'The Arsenio Hall Show' with Hammer and he's on the, he's on Hammer's album, one of these albums I forgot which one it is but.
Speaker 1: What does he do?
Speaker 2: He did some announcing on one, he did one, one of the songs on one but you know, so he's kinda producer sort of thing, that's what, that's what he and he has his own little company.  He hasn't done anything with it yet, but I mean he does have his own company, and then my daughter, Roxanne Marie Ross, who before she was born I christened her the Fox so she was--before she was born she Foxy Roxy Ross.  So that's my baby. She's spoiled, she knows it.  My boys tease me because they say that when they went away to college I gave them a manual Brothers typewriter, when Roxy went away she has a computer, everything, the works.  So but anyway she's in Atlanta, she teaching in Atlanta.  All my boys are married, my oldest son has three children, my second son Peter he has no children yet and Benji [Benjamin Ross] has one son.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So they're all surviving, they're all doing something and we've been, we've been blessed; my wife [Etna Ross] and I have been blessed.
Story_ID: 278442
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your wife?
Speaker 2: Etna Laura Ford, my, my, my.  I've know my wife since we were about nine or ten years old.  We didn't like each other at all in the early days.  She thought I was kind of a church boy, kind of half nerd, that was the way the kinda thought of me, wearing glasses running around there.  Actually and then when I was in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] I use to--I liked one of her friends, one friends, a little girl called Peaches [ph.] and so that was kind of a, but anyway so we didn't and then we, and what happened is when I went away to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I got into dressing, I mean I just all of a sudden right before that time actually I be--I just went Ivy League crazy.  I just, I loved the button downs, I mean and every--the whole thing, crew neck sweaters, dusty bucks, and so I dressed. I mean I spent money on clothes.  So when I came, when my father [Turner Ross] died I transferred to Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan].  Wayne State cafeteria had a little elevation part right there and then all the black kids would sit on one side, one section and so I was a member of Alpha Phi [Alpha] Fraternity, and my wife was a AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  So I would come and kinda look over the, the whole scene, the cafeteria scene, course since I was new I came like in the middle of the semester or you know at the end, so they would--people were like, "Who is that," and "who is that" so Etna my wife to be would say, "Oh that's Jackson Ross [HistoryMaker Dr. William Alexander Jackson Ross], oh, church boy."  So anyway, so they kept asking who that was, so finally she took another interest and thought maybe I would look again, let me just look again, everybody's asking.  So anyway that's what happened, so we got together and we started going out.  Now what's interesting is we had a very stormy, stormy relationship.  I mean for a couple of years it was just off and on.  Going together, not going together, broke up, not, then we go to the school, broke up you know so it was kinda like--when I, when I got engaged my one of my friends I told him I was getting married, he said to who?  So anyway, so I when I heard, we heard from the grapevine that some people thought that we weren't, this wasn't gonna last 'cause we'd had such a stormy romance, but that was forty-two years ago, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Something worked.
Speaker 2: So it did, did last a little bit.
Story_ID: 278443
Speaker 1: There's this wonderful piano in your home and your wife [Etna Ross] plays and there's a lovely story about the piano.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the baby grand piano was purchased for my sister [Lula Ross Wilson] in approximately 1941, 1942.  My sister at that time was, what, ten years old and she was taking lessons at the conservatory, the Detroit Conservatory [of Music, Detroit, Michigan].  She could play.  We had a cousin who was about the same age named Tommy Flanagan who went on to become a great jazz pianist and who recently died.  Tommy and his family would come to visit us, a lot of, a lot of memories of the Flanagan family.  Tommy would play on this piano, this baby grand, and I remember I guess when I was maybe I'm gonna say about ten or eleven years old my sister was playing classical things and all of a sudden Tommy was playing something that was--that I hadn't heard.  I didn't, a different whole beat and it was jazz, I, and then from then on I started becoming more aware of jazz and by the time I got to high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] I--then I was you know I knew who Miles Davis was.  I was dying to see Charlie Parker who I never saw, but by this time the Detroit [Michigan] musicians, the jazz musicians were becoming more and more prominent you know and then so then I started seeing them and understanding Roy Brooks was a drummer who was actually went to [William T.] Sampson [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] and the other guy a trombone player, named George Bohanon, so Curtis Fuller was another trombone player.  I was in high school with, a guy who became one of the great bass players, Ron Carter and so it goes on and on, Kenny Burrell was playing for wedding receptions, so it was, it was just a great time to be kind of involved or at least listening to jazz and that's basically how I got, how I got involved by listening to Tommy.  So before Tommy died when he used to come to the house to play at Yoshi's [Oakland, California], he would come by the house and he would actually, he'd play on this piano.  So I'm sorry I didn't, I was gonna have him take some pictures of him, but he actually passed before the--I didn't get a chance to see him the last time 'cause he had to do a recording but, but at any rate that was, so that was, so there are a lot of memories of that.  I started taking piano lessons too, but I was playing a little softball and I was going to a teacher who used to crack your knuckles with a ruler when you didn't--I was memorizing my lessons, so I told my mother [Julia Jackson Ross] I said you know, look she's messing up my hand, I can't believe, you know I can't play, I can't play ball when she is cracking me on these knuckles, so I'm have to put this, I'm gonna have to stop this piano stuff.  So I stopped piano and I played drums, and then for some ungodly reason I thought I was a singer, tried to sing. So, anyway, but it was all fun, it was all fun.
Speaker 1: It's a wonderful, wonderful story.  Is there something that you've always thought in the back of your mind, I'd like to do, and you still wanna do it, something you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: No, when I was growing up there were several things I wanted to be.  I always wanted to be a doctor but I always wanted to be a basketball player and a singer.  Those are the things that I liked, I mean those are the things that I enjoyed, singing and playing basketball.
Story_ID: 278444
Speaker 1: Could you tell me is--you have another story you'd like to tell me about your father [Turner Ross]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah one of the things that was kinda interesting, I said my father was kind of a renaissance man.  He loved poetry, I remember the book of 101 poems was one of his favorite and, and so he had me learning poems early--trees if be strong--all those things I knew when I was young and then he would coach me on how to, how to say them.  He, he always thought that you needed to speak loudly, loud enough so everybody can hear and you needed to be distinct in your pronunciation, so one of the little practices that he had he thought that you should be able to speak with your mouth, with your teeth closed so that people can understand and you can be distinct in what you're saying so that they can understand what you're saying.  So I use to practice that a lot of times you know, just with my teeth closed, just my tongue can move, but my teeth closed so that you could practice being distinct.  Anyway, to make a long story short when I, as my voice changed and Detroit [Michigan] and like in other cities it was tradition of learning or doing different orations, some humorous and then the James Weldon Johnson 'God's Trombones[: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse]' were quite popular during and 'The Prodigal Son' and '[The] Creation' [James Weldon Johnson] where there were a lot of role models around who could do those and then, so eventually I kinda honed in on 'The Prodigal Son.'  My father what usually when that was before me his orations he would sit kind of about half way back in the row kinda, his arms folded, his eyes kinda closed kinda nodding his head approving of me doing what I'm doing. And I--it was, it turned out to be very nice when I got some scholarship money and that sort of thing. But I was in one big contest one time, where five hundred dollars was the top prize, a lot of money in those days, the biggest contest I'd ever been in, and I was toward the end of the competition and I did 'The Prodigal Son,' one of my best.  I mean it was no question.  They were spellbound.  At the end you know there was just a thunderous applause, so I sat back, somebody else came on and they weren't doing anything and so now I'm counting my money, five hundred dollars, I get paid and I have my tuition, buy some more button down shirts.  I needed another blazer, and another crewneck sweater and some more shoes.  I'm spending the money, toward the last--was a little girl who also was doing some James Weldon Johnson, she was doing 'The Crucifixion.'  'The Crucifixion,' I didn't like 'The Crucifixion.'  'The Crucifixion' was what, what girls did.  I mean you know that was kinda. So anyway she was doing it but she had a little weak voice and she was saying, "My Jesus, my Jesus, they nailed him to the cross."  I kept counting my money, her voice got a little stronger though and I think, they brought a mic in for her.  Anyway she, she kinda half started again, more forceful.  About halfway through she was dramatic, "My Jesus" and she was crying when they nailed my Jesus to the cross and she said the blood, she jumped back like the blood and she was into it.  Everybody was still and everything and people, grown people were crying and she, I mean she had--so now I stopped counting 'cause I'm looking, then the coup de grace was I looked back at my father, he had his handkerchief out.  So now I'm saying ooh, ooh.  I'm in trouble and I was. She won, she won there's no question, no question.  I mean she did it, she absolutely did it.  So from there--so I won some more after that but every time I looked on the program to see if there were any girls were on it (laughter), but no that was good experience.  I think that was a one of my things that my father enjoyed that we did together and that he appreciated, and I appreciated, you know, him being there, and we--that was one of the things that we shared up until the time he died.
Story_ID: 278445
Speaker 1: We were talking about the things that you would like to do in the future.  You haven't mentioned becoming a better barbecuer.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, well that's been one of my hobbies (laughter), barbecuing--a friend of mine Mike Lenore [ph.], one of my best friends oh about in the late '80s [1980s], we were sharing--we'd come to dinner, he came here and I'd serve something that wasn't so good.  So he decided that the three of us, another guy named Herb Harrison [ph.] we should take a course over in San Francisco [California].  So we took a course, cooking course, Judith-et-Hokins [San Francisco, California], who's now part of something else.  Anyway it was a great course, it was six months, we went every Wednesday night, we learned a lot.  I mean we learned, I mean, French cooking, Italian cooking, we did pastries, we did, I mean it was very good, we learned a lot.  So what happened is Mike and Herb basically kinda stayed indoors and I went outdoors with whatever I knew and so then I started doing things on just a regular Weber and a grill, even doing pastries like peach cobbler on a regular Weber, or cake, 7-up lemon cake on a Weber, so those are just kinda things and then I have a collection of grills, maybe ten grills that I functionally use for different things, so it's kind of a hobby.  Recently I was in a barbecue contest, it was Pacific Coast championship.  Now we'd never been in a contest before.  Actually we had never really formed a group so we hurriedly got a group together, called ourselves High on the Hoggers, Oakland, California.  Now some people may not know what, where that term comes from, High on the Hog.  It's a term from the South and it denotes that you're doing pretty good, because the low end of the hog is where things are pretty cheap or free in the old days, you know, so chitterlings, and pig feet, pig tails, all those things were free.  As you got higher up on the hog where the hams, that was kind of expensive see, so high on the hog meant that you're doing better, you're doing good.  So that's the name of our team, so we hurriedly got that together.  I had my son draw a picture of a pig with a chef's cap on it, we decided the colors were black and red. Red aprons with a black emblem on it.  We went up to this contest, had no idea what the real rules were, it's Kansas City [Missouri] sanctioned.  We got in the contest, our stuff was tender, falling of the bone, good and we lost.  We were last 'cause that's not the way it's supposed to be in a contest.  Our presentation wasn't right.  We're gonna do that again, we'll be ready, but I enjoyed that.  I enjoyed going out there and I'm experimenting and doing different things on the grill and it's kinda fun and it's--and so that's kinda what I do.
Story_ID: 278446
Speaker 1: And you have one other thing you do to relax?
Speaker 2: I fish, I like fishing.  I've been fishing with a group of guys, same guys for almost thirty years and we've done different fishing. Mexico, Sea of Cortez--fish for, we fish for marlin, stripe marlin.  Mahi-Mahi, tuna, steelhead, salmon, trout.  Recently in the Amazon we were fishing for peacock bass, beautiful fish, world record twenty-eight pounds.  We all got near twenty pounds, catch and release.  Also piranha; piranha get on the hook, red-belly piranha.  Interesting thing about piranha is their natural habitat where we were, they don't bother the people unless you're bleeding.  So it took me two or three days to stop taking pictures of people swimming in the water, mother in the water with a baby is about twelve, about maybe twelve months, fourteen months old.  Kinda splashing him around in the water, two kids on either side jumping around, and I'm twenty yards away catching a piranha.  Crocodiles on the beach, a guy stopped to get a crocodile, baby crocodile, brought it over to the boat.  Asked us if we wanted to take a picture with it, the friend I was fishing with at that time said no, he didn't any parts of that.  So I said, yes, I'll take a picture with the crocodile.  So the guy gave me the crocodile, it's two feet long.  Told me how to hold it behind his neck although it's only a little baby, still had six inches of teeth there.  You had to hold that kinda behind his neck and hold it in front of his feet, and so I was taking pictures and I was, I held the crocodile up to my face and facing the sun away from the sun, that sort of thing.  When I give the crocodile back to the guy, the crocodile wasn't moving.  So the guy had to put it in the water to revive it.  It finally came around, what happened I inadvertently was choking the crocodile.  I was making sure that the crocodile would not bite and I, I choked the crocodile.  So the pictures of the crocodile, his eyes are bulging, his mouth is open and everybody, they're still laughing about that, but he came back around so it was, it became funny, but I did, I did have a little bit too much pressure on it, and maybe that was the reason it was so still when I was taking the pictures, it just--
Speaker 1: It--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it just, it was great, I'm holding it, it just no problem, and then he came back around so that was, that's my, that's my Amazon story, that was, that was a funny thing.  But I enjoy that, fishing for us is very relaxing.  We go out there between two or three days in different places and have a lot of fun, and I think that cuts down on a lot of the stress without taking medication or anything.
Story_ID: 278447
Speaker 1: Could you tell me how you feel about your life, what's important to you?
Speaker 2: Well you know I, the one thing that I, what the [U.S.] Navy taught me was this.  The Navy you know you had a set pay and that thing so you weren't, didn't have to you know hustle for things and so you know you had vacations and that sort of thing and so what I did was when I started practice knowing that I really, my practicing depended on what I did, I still had that Navy mindset.  So that meant you know when it was Christmastime I took time off you know with the kids and that sort of thing and so I sort of set my vacations with the kids' vacations and as it turns out that's maybe one of the best moves I ever made.  Obviously, they cut down on your income and that sort of thing but I think the most important thing to me has been family, and being able to participate and enjoy all the activities of my children and I didn't miss anything.  I didn't--they are--my kids, all my boys play football and they were involved in the combination of, they were all involved in over a hundred football games and I didn't miss any.  They were in programs, they were playing instruments in bands and dancing and everything.  I did, I just made, I just decided that I wasn't going to miss that and I didn't.  So I'm happy and that's the, and I think that's the thing when it's all said and done, the thing that is most important to me and the thing that I'm, that I'm the proudest of or happiest about has been my family, my wife [Etna Ross] and my children, and now my grandchildren.
Story_ID: 278448
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your hopes and your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, having lived as long as I've lived and have seen some progress you know, it just, it seems like at times that we're not making a lot of progress.  It seems like that we're back to where we were at various times, you know what I mean.  It's no question that racism is still alive and well here in the United States and that this country is divided regardless of how we try to think about it and do about it, and it's still tough, it's still tough for black males in particular, more people incarcerated than in college and that sort of thing, so it's, it's still a tough situation.  I'm the eternal optimist and I always believe that in the end it's gonna be better but it's still a struggle and I think that some of us have forgotten that it's still a struggle, that it you know, you still, you still have to fight.  It's not equal, it's not equal across the board and that you still have to stri- you still have to fight for it.
Story_ID: 278449
Speaker 1: Could you tell us your thoughts, you're a doctor, about medical care for blacks and, and just kind of a general overall?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I think that what happens a lot of time blacks are--wait the longest to get treatment.  Many times they don't check on the signals or don't adheed to them--adhere to them.  I think a lot of times black women are so concerned about other people, other members of their family that they're not thinking about themselves.  There are certain diseases where we have a high incidence of--for reasons we don't exactly know, prostate cancer you know, breast cancer and all those things.  So that's one aspect of the problem is that we are not seeking.  Another aspect is that even in this day and age black people are treated in general different than white people.  I have a friend that says look, if he's someplace and he gets sick and has to go to the emergency room, the first thing he's gonna do is put suit on, shirt and tie and a briefcase, because he knows if he goes in there like that, he's likely to get different kind of treatment that if he doesn't, and I think that's true, I think that's true and that's unfortunate that they're different standards of treatment for, for blacks in general.
Story_ID: 278450
Speaker 1: What values are most important to you?
Speaker 2: Well I think we touched on it before you know in terms of family values and those sort of things.  I think that that's very important and I think religion or having a belief is important too.  I think that, that helps to sustain you.  I know a lot of my patients will ask that you know, are you a believer, are you a Christian?  And my answer would always be yes I am and that's why you're gonna get well because He is helping me to help you, and so I think that's important you know.  I'm not an evangelist, I'm not out there beating the bushes about it and I haven't necessarily been a churchgoer every Sunday, but I've always believed and I've always tried to adhere to the attendance of Christianity and those things that my parents [Julia Jackson Ross and Turner Ross] taught me.
Story_ID: 278451
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets, is there something you wished you had not done or done?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wish I had of made the basketball team when I was in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], it was a great team too.  I wish I could've made that.
Speaker 1: It was a great team?
Speaker 2: It turned out to be a good team, yeah.  Actually, I tell my best friends that still you we're members of the team they're still good friends now so.  Let me see and I also wished that I could've, I wished the Chandeliers [ph.] group that I sang with had really become popular or made a hit record, but no I don't have any you know.  I don't have any regrets.  You know and people ask all the time, what would you do over?  I don't know what I'd do over you know I, I don't know what. I would've studied hard at some places maybe you know, but then again I think the way things turned out it's, it's been all right, it's been all right, so I don't--I've been lucky to have been lucky and blessed.  I mean I think probably the best thing that has happened to me in all honesty is my wife [Etna Ross].  That may be the single best thing that has happened to me is my wife, because that's what, you know, that's what makes it roll, that's what, that's what gives the kids all their stuff and everything and that's what makes the family the family and that's what makes me you know so, yeah.  That's the best thing of all the things that happened to wife, that's the best thing.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful, thank you. Is there a message or lesson you'd like to give to your children or grandchildren?

How I've interacted with my wife, how I've interacted with them.  So I don't have anything really to tell them, I just hope that what they have seen will be sufficient to, to give them some guidelines on how things should be.

The guide caught the crocodile and actually was giving me instructions on how to hold it and after I got through holding it and taking these pictures the crocodile wasn't moving and had to be revived in that.  I was holding it a little too tight around the neck and apparently was choking it a little bit but it did come back around so.
