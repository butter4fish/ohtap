Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2:  	Willie Frank Logan [HistoryMaker Willie Logan], W-I-L-L-I-E, L- F-R-A-N-K, L-O-G-A-N.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2:  	February 16th, 1957.  I was born in Miami Beach, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I'm the CEO of a community based organization.  It's hard to define what my occupation is beyond being a manager and executive of a community based organization that is involved in both development as well as services as well as financial matters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me point out also, correct me if I'm wrong, you are the youngest mayor in America, at age twenty-three, right?
Speaker 2:  	At the time, yes, in 1980.
Speaker 1: And you also were a state representative or, or were. Are you still (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes.  I served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1982 until 2000.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	For eighteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2:  	March 8, 2017, I believe.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2:  	We're at the offices of the Opa-locka Community Development Corporation which is in downtown Opa-locka [Florida].
Story_ID: 657064
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I have several favorite foods, but mangoes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  That's a good one.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2:  	A favorite--yes, blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2:  	In Miami [Florida] in February.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2:  	Multiple.  That's very difficult.  I, I love the mountains as well as I love the sea.  I love rain forests just as well as I love urban cities, so that is very, very difficult to say.  But if I had to pick one I would say New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2:  	That takes some thought.  I'm, I'm sure I do.  My parents [Ruther Brown Logan and Willie Logan, Sr.] are from the South and grew up in a time where paraphrases and parables and things were used a lot and I often find my time--often find myself repeating many of those.  I'll have to come back to that question.
Story_ID: 657065
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Willie Logan, Sr.] side but we'll start with your mother.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2:  	Her name was Ruther Mae Brown (background noise), R-U-T-H-E-R, M-A-E, B-R-O-W-N [Ruther Brown Logan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2:  	August 24th, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2:  	She was born in Mitchell County, Georgia.  I, I'm not sure whether she was actually born in Pelham, that's my assumption, which is the city, or the town that she grew up in.  But I would assume it was Pelham, Georgia or some area within Mitchell County near Pelham, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can they be traced by you and what stories are passed down on that side of the family?
Speaker 2:  	Well I--I think probably what's most significant the things that I recall about my mother's family is the conversations that she shared with me regarding why she came first to Jacksonville [Florida] and Miami [Florida] and her sisters followed her versus many of her first cousins and other aunts and uncles, siblings of her parents went to the, mostly and mainly to the Northeast.  And so, the entire migration conversation that, that took place.  Quite frankly in the nineteen teens [1910s] all through the 1940s and '50s [1950s] are probably some of the most remarkable things I recall about the history of my family.  My, my, my mother though, who was an only child, had me very late in life and so consequently I was one of the younger kids of that generation and, and therefore, really experienced both family history from the perspective of the early 1900s all the way up to now.  I, I didn't--we've never done any research to my knowledge on our--my family history but I know my mother telling me about a great-grandfather of hers actually being a slave as a child and having met him.  And, and therefore I assume without much effort I can go back to the mid-nine--1800s.  I've gone to, in Mitchell County, Camilla [Georgia] and Meigs [Georgia] and other places in that area, I've gone to cemeteries and, and family churches and family properties where I've seen tombstones back in the 1800s, but I've never put together a family tree.  And so, most of my history goes back to my grandparents who were born in 1897 and 1900.
Story_ID: 657066
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Ruther Brown Logan] talk about what it was like in Mitchell County, Georgia or, or in Pelham [Georgia]?
Speaker 2:  	I--I mean I think she did.  I mean the stories that I remember was the fact that she really did not like working in the cotton fields and what horrible and terrible work it was, that she--how productive she was in, more of in a, a manufacturing and self-motivating environment in her work in the peanut mill for example.  Or I can remember stories about how she was closer to her father's folks more so than her mother's folks and the interesting dynamic that was in the, in the family.  And I can also remember when she first met my father [Willie Logan, Sr.] when she was a teenager and how he courted her and the things that he did and so those are the things that, that jump out at me.  I can recall her saying that she went off to college and having to return back because her father had a stroke.  And, and so there's some incidents and activities in her life and in, in her sibling lifes, my aunts and uncles life that, that I can recall almost vividly as if I was a part of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, what college did she go to, do you know?
Speaker 2:  	I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: You know what college she went to?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  Oh my god, now it just--Fort--right outside of Macon [Georgia], oh my--
Speaker 1: Fort Valley State (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Fort Valley, I'm sorry, Jesus Christ--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--how can't I remember Fort Valley?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Fort, Fort Valley College [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], just south of Macon.
Speaker 1: Fort Valley State, it's a state--
Speaker 2:  	It was a nursing school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, she wanted to be a nurse?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she had to come back and so what did she do for a living, I mean for (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, she, she did several things.  I mean I, I think when she first came to Miami [Florida], I remember seeing a photo of her in the late 1940s where she won some award being the most productive dry cleaner presser.  I don't know if it was The Miami News or the Miami Herald, actually I still have that article somewhere, which she seemed to take a great deal of pride.  And, and, and so I say that part of it she really had very, a good work ethic.  I would say during the child--my father, who was a World War II [WWII] veteran--and my mother always used to say she lost two good men to the [U.S.] military in her life and she was not going to lose a third so she was adamantly opposed to me being in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] which I was, as well as going to the military because both her father and mother--father and husband who she said were healthy prior to go to war came back with ailments that were never really addressed by, by the hospitals or--but, but she, she, you know she did all kind of work.  She actually did day work you know housekeeping.  She did nurse's aide work.  She eventually became an LPN [licensed practical nurse] and, and did some work in hospitals.  As I--once my--when my father died and it was time for me to go to college, she actually did what they called live in nursing work where she actually was a, you know, caretaker for someone twenty-four hours a day or for any number of days.  You know during those days folks always had side businesses you know some you know above board and some weren't and so both her and my father--my father could build, make anything.  And, and my mother also you know had skills that, that, that were available that she used to bring in side money and small businesses.  And so, they were very, very hard workers and, and generally had more than one occupation or an occupation and a business.
Story_ID: 657067
Speaker 1: I think you said earlier her father was a, a war veteran too?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it like World War I [WWI], I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) World War I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And as my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] said he was a very healthy man when he came back in, in, in--I mean before he left.  Now I'm not sure how she knows that since she wasn't really born.  I guess that's the story passed down from her mother but she was the oldest child.  She was born right after he returned from World War I.  But he was very sickly as a young man and it therefore, was very difficult--though they had a farm and he did some work.  He had a difficult time holding a, a fulltime job, doing hard labor let's say.
Speaker 1: Now this is World War I, including the use of chemical weapons, mustard gas and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and things would paralyze you--
Speaker 2:  	Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and kill you chemically.
Speaker 2:  	Exactly.
Speaker 1: If not--I mean they experimented with everything you know.
Speaker 2:  	With everything.
Speaker 1: The machine guns were new.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Airplanes were new.  Mustard gas was new.  I mean they would do electric (unclear) on wires.
Speaker 2:  	And, and it, and it was clear my, my grandfather was a very intelligent man which is so interesting about you know learning about black history is that you had people who had third, fourth, fifth grade educations like my father [Willie Logan, Sr.], but he was a whiz in math.  I mean I, I learned how to do ratios or fractions or percentages by doing baseb- baseball score, you know box scores or, or keeping up with statistics in, in--for the basketball players--
Speaker 1: And averages of--
Speaker 2:  	--or knowing how many games backed by and what their odds were, you know winning a division in, in football.  And so, at four and five years old, I was doing math that is expected at ten and eleven years old.  And this is taught by my father who had a fifth grade education.  He could draw a blueprint you know and, and my grandfather was the same way.  So, they had, they had innate skills and intelligence from both experience and just seeing stuff that they learned and picked up without any formal education.  And my grandfather was the same way.  He just was sickly and died very young and my mother always blamed it on the war.  And I assumed she had to take that from her mother because she wasn't born when he went to the war.  Or maybe her father talked about it or the family members.
Story_ID: 657068
Speaker 1: Now let, let me go to your father's side then, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2:  	I'm a junior, so it's Willie Frank Logan [Willie Logan, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's his birthday?
Speaker 2:  	Twelve--December 4th, 2000, two--(laughter) 2000.  December 4th, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2:  	He, he was born also in Mitchell County [Georgia].  I think his folks were more from Meigs [Georgia] and, and, and the surrounding--same county but you know the rural area, maybe the unincorporated area in Mitchell County.  Part of his family though was from Albany [Georgia] so I think--and I really never met his father or his father's people other than--well, I met one of his father's brothers.  And I think he only had one brother, but I think they were from Albany and his mother's side was from Meigs which is Mitchell County.  Albany is about thirty, forty miles north of Mitchell County.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2:  	So they all were from southwest, southwest, Central Georgia.
Speaker 1: So, again, like what are the stories on your father's side?  What, what, what were they known (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well you know it's interesting, my father's side I don't know as well.  And I, and I think there were a couple of reasons.  One is, is that my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] came from a large family.  Her grandmother, her mother had thirteen, it was thirteen of them and her father, there was sixteen of them and so there were twenty-nine aunts and uncles that my mother had.  And you know tens and tens of first cousins, et cetera.  On my father's side, he had one sister.  His, his mother--I never knew any of his mother's siblings and I never knew any of his grandmother's siblings were the two folks that, that I met.  I met his--I don't remember his grandmother but I do remember his, his mother.  I never met his father.  I never heard much about his father.  I met his uncle who's a brother of his father but you know those were the times when, when black men were often separated from their families and, and they were separated with or without cause.  For example, my, my father's uncle was accused of inappropriately speaking or looking at a white woman and was sentenced to hard labor on the chain gang in a different state, shipped down to Apalachicola [Florida] area.  Whether he had a trial or not you know it wasn't fair obviously and, and the sentence certainly doesn't you know coincide with somebody saying or looking a certain way.  And so when he escaped, he escaped to Oklahoma which at that time was you know sort of bare territory and ended up marrying three or four different Native American women which was allowed and had you know three or four sets of families.  And I never recalled back in the '80s [1980s] when I first went to Tulsa [Oklahoma] and met my uncle which my father and his sister, my aunt had told me about, it was the first time I ever saw a male that was a bloodline of mine and my father's side that was anywhere close to my age.  And all of a sudden I saw you know tens of young, black men that were 6'3", 6'4" that looked just like me you know.  And it was an amazing experience to, to, to reconnect with a family that for no cause of our own had been separated.  So, I, I think--and my mother had all girls.  The--I mean my mother had all sisters.  The one boy, brother was killed in Miami [Florida] in Overtown when they came here in the '20s [1920s].  And so, black males have, have always had a very difficult time in, in this country and, and have for many years been forced to be separated from their families to have to start over to have no real connection to their family because if returned back or made it known that they were alive could you know face difficult or tough times for no cause of their own.  So, I don't know my father's folks that well.  I, I was very close to my father until he passed.  Matter of fact it's interesting, as much as I was a mother's boy people say, I don't remember my mother until after my father passed.  And so, though I didn't know his folks that well, I was very close to him and, and I was very close to his sister.  He had one sister, his on- he only had one sibling and she lived in Daytona [Florida] and, and she had three kids.  But I don't really know my father's people that well.
Story_ID: 657069
Speaker 1: You said that he didn't get a chance to have much formal schooling, right?
Speaker 2:  	No, no, no.  He actually only went to fifth grade.  But I mean he was one of the smartest men I've known. I mean I could tell you any significant event that happened in the '60s [1960s].  I can tell you where I was 'cause I was always with my father [Willie Logan, Sr.] or shortly thereafter I was with my father.  And I can, you know I mean when people talk about when Walter Cronkite came on and talked about that Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had died or when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been shot, I can remember my father telling me, "I think they killed him this time."  I mean I--so he was very much involved in, in current events.  He was very much involved in--and when I say current events, not just political or social, civic and sports, entertainment.  He, he was, you know he, he was interesting for a person who had grew up on a farm, who up until he went to the, in the [U.S.] military and went to Italy and Germany, probably had very little exposure to anything beyond his immediate surroundings.  And, and that was limited given the way of life and cultural and laws at that time to have, have been such a sponge and had such an interest in, in so many things and had such insight.  And, and was willing thankfully to share it with his son and his child.  So, I felt that my father was brilliant you know.  He, he, he had a boat, he could fish, he could build, I mean he could, you know he, he played golf, I mean, and this is a man with a fifth grade education.  And, and clearly had difficult times in World War II [WWII] because he died in his fifties.  On his death certificate, they put no cause.  No, natural causes, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Natural cause- okay.
Speaker 2:  	And who dies in their fifties with natural causes?  And before he died he had several legs amputated, he--you know it seems like it was diabetes but given what probably went on in World War II, only God knows what it was and what sort of caused that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now this is, now, now did he got to the war, was he drafted before he got married or after?
Speaker 2:  	He--my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] married him right before he went off to war.  So, my assumption was he was drafted, they went to Jacksonville [Florida], got married, he went off to the war and she came to Miami [Florida].  They were married January 2nd of 2000--1941, and he was discharged in nine--the, early 1945 after serving four years.  So, my assumption is that he had already been drafted or knew he was on his way to being drafted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Or was about to volunteer, I'm not sure.  But I think he, I think it was clear what was happening.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Because it seems like, that she married him right before he left.
Story_ID: 657070
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met? 'Cause I know they're around the same area, living around the same area but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.  You know, the, the big story I had is my mother said that every day after school, he [Logan's father, Willie Logan, Sr.] would wait for her on the corner with a Baby Ruth, and her name is Ruth [Ruther Brown Logan], and he would give it to her and walk her home.  And until he got the nerve to ask my grandfather's permission to come visit her on Sundays which I guess was the custom then.  And, and so I, I think they met because he saw her walking home from school.  He was four years older.  He was working at the time.  Or not working and you could imagine and, and, and courted her by walking her from school you know for months or for a period of time before I guess they thought it was appropriate, or she felt it was appropriate or was willing for him to meet her parents.  And, and so, she--he is the only boyfriend that I have ever heard her talk about.  And my assumption is that since they got married at twenty-one, and it was after she had went off to school [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] and came back, that it may have been the only serious relationship she had prior to marrying.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But it was--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --those times too (laughter), you know, you marry who you meet.
Story_ID: 657071
Speaker 1: When he [Logan's father, Willie Logan, Sr.] went off to the war [World War II, WWII] I mean you said he went to Italy.  He was in--where else did he go, do you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) He went to Italy and he went to Germany.  And, and I know these things because he spoke a little bit of both languages.  And I heard him tell stories though.  I was only an adolescent so it's hard for me to--but I know for example when I finished college, I was so interested in going to Europe and I got a Europass because of him talking about the Rhine River and places that you know I had heard about and read about you know as I got older and learned about as you know we had more information coming both through TV and, and, and through books, et cetera, but you know movies.  But I can't remember the specifics other than the fact that I know he was in Italy and I know he was in Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And, and he spoke both, he--I guess he spoke both languages but he knew phrases in both languages.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about how he was treated in the [U.S.] Army?  And this is during the segregated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) You know I, I can't, I can't ever recall--you know the only--I can't ever recall my parents talking to me about segregation, racism, being treated as--not as a child.  Now when I became a little bit older the stories my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] would tell and, and, and the things that she would share was a lot different.  But as a child I can't ever recall really them putting a, either putting a negative light on it or, or really editorializing it.  You know, it, it is what it is and, and you know this is the way things are.  And so I didn't really--the first time I really felt the bite of racism is we were going up to Georgia you know summer or Christmas and we stopped to a restroom near Lake County [Florida] and I wanted to use the restroom and my mother told me I couldn't use that restroom and I was able to read.  And I said, "Why does it have that sign there?" And she explained to me that you know--but not in a very negative way.  That, that, "The people here choose not to allow us to use the same restroom that they use.  And that since we don't own it, it's not ours.  We have to respect that until when we get to our place we use whatever restroom we choose to."  So, it was always you know said in a very cordial and nonthreatening--and so I never felt that I was limited or that there were things that I couldn't do or places I couldn't go.  Though in retrospect I real- realize how segregated a world I grew up in until I was a teenager.
Speaker 1: (Pause) Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, they were protecting you in some ways.
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I mean I remember going to Virginia Key Beach [Miami, Florida].  I don't remember ever wanting to go to Crandon Park Beach [Key Biscayne, Florida] which was right down the street which is a much better beach because I remember knowing about it, you know.  And it had never dawned on me why everybody at the beach was black.  You know it's just the way things were.  And everybody in my neighborhood was black.  Everybody at my school was black.  Everybody at my church was black.  It's just the way--even though I saw white folks on TV you know, and maybe seen them in the newspaper.  It didn't dawn on me why we weren't together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But I was a child.
Story_ID: 657072
Speaker 1: So your father [Willie Logan, Sr.] became a carpenter but basically is that what he--I mean how--?
Speaker 2:  	I, I would say he was a jack of all trades.  But yeah, he was a carpenter.  He could build anything.  He could do blueprints.  He could, you know he was a carpenter.  He--a painter.  I mean he did roofs, he, I mean he could build a house (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, so, he was a general contractor in a lot of ways?
Speaker 2:  	He, he was--exactly.  He had the skillsets of a general contractor and the house that I still own that now my--that I grew up in, probably one third of the house was addition, if not more were additions that he added on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And I still have the blueprints and, and things.  And he did a heck of a job because I--the house has had renovation since then and people have never complained about his work compared to some of the other work that's been done.
Speaker 1: Did, did he go to any schools on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] when he came out [of the U.S. Army]?
Speaker 2:  	Not that I'm aware of.  If he did I'm, I'm not aware of that.  I know they used the G.I. Bill to buy the house that I just was referring to.  I don't know what other opportunities were given to him.  But you know, you know some people--you know I really believe that we are all born with some innate skill sets and if we have the opportunity we pursue them or some interests or some talents you know that, that are God given or you know just the way it is.  And, and, and, and, and I, and I think you know he was able to nourish and, and, and maybe have an opportunity to practice or learn from those skills.  And so whether it was the [U.S.] military, whether it was just growing up you know and, and building onto the house or doing work into the, you know the family or on the farm, et cetera, I have no idea where he learned that skillset, but he clearly was good at it.  And, and it was learned not in a formal sense I'm almost for sure.  And I doubt very seriously the military spent any real time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) teaching him anything that was useful.
Story_ID: 657073
Speaker 1: So, he was in--did he talk about what kind of unit he was in, in the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2:  	He, he did.  I, I really don't recall.  I, I have some information, a couple of letters and his dog tag and, and some things related to that period.  So, if interested, I probably could do some research and, and learn exactly where he was assigned and when he was assigned and what he did, et cetera.  I, I'll be honest with you, I probably been too busy living than I have being (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I understand.  I understand.  I, I ask these questions not because I think you ought to know.
Speaker 2:  	No, no--
Speaker 1: Just because of--
Speaker 2:  	--no, but I mean in, in some ways I would like to know and, and I think if circumstances were a little different you know, if, if I had kids for example I think I would want to know because I'd want them to have that legacy.  But for me personally how important it is, and I felt like I knew my father [Willie Logan, Sr.] and I knew many of his experiences and, and so getting details of this is just not necessary for me.
Story_ID: 657074
Speaker 1: When you--oh let me ask you--I didn't ask this.  But they moved, so, they were married in Jacksonville [Florida].
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were saying earlier that the move to Jacksonville was a major story in your family, right?
Speaker 2:  	Well, my, my, my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] had a half-sister who had--well, first of all, everybody would sit around--I asked my mother one day, several times actually as I began to learn about history and, and both from reading it and from the work of many artists, particularly artists, African American artists that spoke to and talked about the whole migration issue of, of the population of urban centers in, in the Midwest and Northeast and for that matter even in California that I asked my mother you know, "Why did you come Miami [Florida]?  Why didn't you go to New York [New York]?"  Oh, I would meet cousins as I went to college or finished college that were living in the Northeast, et cetera.  "Then why you chose Miami?  I mean why didn't you go to New York or Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?"  And, and, and, and she would say that you know there were real conversations that aunts and uncles and cousins and parents would sit around oftentimes late at night under the cover of darkness and, and decide on who would go where, who would join who, who was where, how would they get there, when would they leave, who would go first, who would follow them, et cetera.  And, and most, and most folks once they turned--the boys sometimes sixteen, seventeen, the girls generally eighteen or so.  But--unless they got married younger.  But most folks could choose where they want to go, you know.  There was no pressure that you got to go to New York or you got to go to Chicago [Illinois] or you got to go to Jacksonville.  And, and part of that was people made the decision when they were adults.  You know it wasn't parents saying, "I'm taking all--," entire family.  Oftentimes it was the--kids of the parents who were leaving and the parents may have come--like my grandparents did, they came afterwards.  And it was often time the oldest sibling or some aunt or uncle who was the trailblazer and then someone in a different generation followed.  And in my mother's case, her half-sister who was her mother's old, oldest child, she was her mother's and father's oldest child, had went to Jacksonville and she followed her oldest sister to Jacksonville 'cause it was better work. And, and her oldest sister had happened to work for the owner of the largest bank in Jacksonville at the time as a cook.  And therefore, you know it was in an environment where there were other opportunities because of the families and friends of the owners and because she was part of the entertainment of this owner that she often could learn things and interact with other servants or, or service workers of these families.  And so, my mother was able to find good work you know good paying work, should I say, relative to what she was doing in Georgia which was either working in the field or working in a peanut factory which was the two industries there, cotton and peanut--peanuts.  And so--and she went there but, but she decided she wanted more and she had a couple of aunts on my father's side that were living in Miami.  And so, soon after she married my father [Willie Logan, Sr.], she left Jacksonville.  I don't know if she was in Jacksonville for a year or six months.  She got married in '41 [1941], she was here in '41 [1941] in Miami and I'm not sure she went to Jacksonville before '41 [1941] or late '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, just kind of a place to--?
Speaker 2:  	It was, it was, it was, it was a way out of Pelham [Georgia] on her way to Miami I think.  I think she didn't want to come to Miami with no money so I think, I think the idea was she went to Jacksonville to make a little money so when she came here she had something.  It would be actually because of her aunt. Plus, when she married my father you know, then all of a sudden, he was getting paid so she had even additional money because I think during those days most of the men let the money come home.  And you know, and she saved and when he got out they were able to buy a house and start a business and (unclear).
Speaker 1: That, that's probably--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --why they got married just before he left, you know.
Speaker 2:  	Exactly.
Speaker 1: Make sure that she had--
Speaker 2:  	Ex- exactly.  And, and the other thing too is, is that--when I asked my mother--and I didn't answer this question why she chose to come to Miami versus going to New York?  She said there were two issues.  She says one is that she never figured out how when it was cold she was going to be able to get up and go to work and get to work.  That, that really, really troubled her.  She said but the second thing is that her relatives particularly aunts and uncles who would come from New York you know they would look good, they would have fancy cars, they would have fancy things, mainly clothes.  They would tell wonderful stories about what a great time they were having, but they didn't have anything else.  They didn't--they never brought money, they never brought food, they never brought help home.  They generally didn't have a place that you could go and stay with them because they were staying in such small, apparently, such small facilities whereas the folks who were in, down in the South would send money home, would send food home, would send clothes home, would send things home.  Would come home and wouldn't talk about all the great times they had but had things and were saving you know.  In, in other words she said it seemed to be more conducive for a life of achievement versus a life of good times.  And I think she distinguished the two.

Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their sense of humor, their talents, how they look, how they walk, how they talk, who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2:  	Both.  I, I would like to think that I'm a lot like my father [Willie Logan, Sr.], but I clearly have a lot of mother's personality.  My father, people saw him as being an introvert, you know not really being opinionated, easy to get along with, being you know in control.  And my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] on the other hand is an extrovert.  She gets her energy from interacting and talking and being engaged.  She loves to share her opinion.  She, she's certainly a leader in the sense that you know she will speak up, she will stand up.  You know she doesn't have a problem in asking folks to participate.  She doesn't have a problem in joining anything that's going on and being actively engaged.  And she you know, she just, she enjoyed people.  I mean she got her energy from people.  I, I, I fall somewhere in between.  I love my alone time.  I think I'm generally quiet you know, and, and an introvert.  I've learned to be an extrovert but I do think I'm opinionated and people say that I'm more polished than my mother in the sense that I learned when and how to share my opinion.  But opinion still is forthright and forthcoming as hers, which some people find harsh, even arrogant.  I think it has a lot more to do with you know, sort of impatient and more so than, than any other attributes.  But, so, so I'm a mix.  I, I'm, I'm tall like my father, but my mother was also tall.  I took a picture when I was thirty and I put it next to a picture of my mother and father when he was thirty, and people look at it and they don't really know which is which, which shows the resemblance.  But then when they look at the bottom half of my face they say, "Oh but I can see your mother all over you also."  But my eyes and forehead and skin color, and probably my personality without engaging me you would probably think I'm my father.  Once engaging me then you see my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah, you are a combination of being like kind of calm on the outside but you, you do have an opinion, I can tell that you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so, now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: Okay, none.  So, you're the only child.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--okay, so that's--all right.  So--
Speaker 2:  	You know, but, but a wonderful experience I had and I like to share this because you know my mother had six living siblings and five of them were in the same geographical area that she was in and there were thirteen offsprings from those seven kids.  And even the two that grew up outside of Miami [Florida], we all grew up like sisters and brothers.  You know we went to the same schools.  We would eat, be together on Sunday you know, we played at the same parks you know, we'd Easter egg hunt together, we--there were two different churches.  Most of my family were A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] because that's what my grandfather was an A.M.E. minister.  But my mother was the only Baptist but they went to churches, they were sister churches right next to each other.  So, though I didn't have a sibling produced by my parents, I had very close first cousins that in many ways I felt like sibling, like, like they were my siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's important now--
Story_ID: 657076
Speaker 1: Your father's father was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] pastor?
Speaker 2:  	My mother's--
Speaker 1: Mother's father.
Speaker 2:  	--father was an A.M.E. pastor (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.  Okay, all right.  So, who was the Baptist--I, I missed that for some reason.
Speaker 2:  	See, that's what--my, my, my father's [Willie Logan, Sr.] side were Baptist.  My mother's side were A.M.E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	My mother's father was an A.M.E. and she was his--he was--she was his oldest child.  So, all her siblings are A.M.E.
Speaker 1: Oh, but she was the only Baptist because of--
Speaker 2:  	Right, and that's, that was my point saying that unlike her siblings, my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] spent more time with her father's people.  Her siblings spent more time with her mother's people so when my mother came to Miami [Florida], she followed her father's people whereas her mother's people mostly went to New York and New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	And, and that was part of what I was alluding to when I said that my father--even though she's the oldest child she was sort of the rebellious child.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2:  	Hm?
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.  You know, it, it was but my mother once again and I don't know where my parents get this insight from.  My mother always believed that you're saved by your own belief which is one of my sayings, saved by your own belief, that she thought that nobody had the key to religion, that she never felt that one denomination or one belief was any more significant than the other, that everybody had to choose for themselves, that you weren't saved because you were a Baptist or you were a Christian or you were a Jew.  And she really questioned this whole definition of what saved is.  She certainly subscribed to, to Christianity and brought me up as a Christian.  But she also gave me an opportunity to go to synagogues and then go to Jewish camps and, and didn't frown when I told her I was interested in Hinduism and in Islam and I wanted to learn more about those religions and she encouraged it.  Even when I studied Christian Science, when I was in college, she thought it was a wonderful thing.  So, even though I grew up in the church and you know I was a choir boy and I was an usher and I did the Easter programs and I went to Sunday school, then when I--and when I was old enough to, to teach Sunday school I taught Sunday school and, and up until probably you know a senior in high school [Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida], eleventh grade, and so I was in the church every Sunday.  But, once I became an adult, I mean she made it perfectly clear that was my choice, you know.  And, and that you know she just thought that you were saved by your own beliefs and, and actions were more, a lot more important in life she felt than words, words.  And so, you can believe in all the goodness you want to.  If you weren't doing good things or providing an opportunity for good things to happen (background noise) or being a force for good then what you believed in was to her, unimportant.  And, and so--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1:  	And so, though I grew up in the church (background noise)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: --and, and, and stayed in the church most of my adult life, I always had a perspective that it wasn't the church where I got my sense of faith or my sense of right and wrong as much as it was you know sort of my own moral compass and, and, and what I had been taught as a kid.
Story_ID: 657077
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Ruther Brown Logan] work for Jewish households or--?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yes, a lot.  I would say almost exclusively in the mid and late '70s [1970s].  Well, she worked until I finished college [University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida], which was in '77 [1977], then she retired.  But I would say the '70s [1970s], particularly the time I was in college when she was doing private duty work.  It was exclusive Jewish families and as I recall now, even in high school [Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida], she worked for Jewish families or she worked in a nursing home or a hospital that--I was born in Mount Sinai [Mount Sinai Hospital; Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida] and that was the Jewish hospital.  So, that says it all.
Speaker 1: I just kind of thought that might be the case.  I, you know I have relatives that they, they worked with the Jewish people, and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, and, and that's what--in, in Dade County [Miami-Dade County, Florida] you were either from Georgia, from the Bahamas or you were Jewish or you were Anglo-Saxon and you just came--and you could be from almost anywhere.  But the ethnic groups were two blacks, one Caribbean, one South Georgia and, and Jews.  There were very little Hispanics there until the '60s [1960s].  And so, and then they really--the Spanish people didn't get power until the '80s [1980s] and so when my mother worked for us, you either worked for a white family or you worked for a Jewish family.  And because she was in the medical field, may of the doctors were Jews.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right.  So, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) As well as many retirees who needed--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2:  	--round the clock care were Jewish.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Um-hm. Good point.
Story_ID: 657078
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I have quite a few.
Speaker 1: An earliest.  An early--
Speaker 2:  	An earliest.  That means one, huh?  Well, well when I say I have quite a few, I'm trying to figure out which was the--which age I was youngest.  I could, I could remember--probably the most significant--see, I, I can remember graduating from kindergarten at either three or four years old and I can act--but I have pictures of this and I can actually remember my father [Willie Logan, Sr.] taking pictures of me when I walked down that hallway and I can remember the cap and gown and the diploma, but I have pictures of it.  So, I don't know whether I remember it or whether I recall it from the pictures.  But, but I, but I can distinctly remember you know my fifth birthday and when my uncle drove up on a motorcycle, my [maternal] grandmother got on him, which she had on him, and when my cousin who was a first cousin what she--you know, I can distinctly remember.  I can remember one of my friends from, from preschool came two hours early 'cause she thought the party was at one instead of three.  So, I mean I can remember those things.  But I think the most significant memory, not the earliest memory but the most significant memory, is when they announced that Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had been assassinated.  And, and I, and I was six then and I was in school and they announced it.  The teachers told us but then they let school out earlier and that's the most significant memory.  But I can remember, I can remember my grandparents--my grandmother's funeral and that we all had on white, the grandkids, just sitting on the first pew of the church and so I probably was five.  So, the there--there're things around four, five, six that, that I can remember but I can't tell you which was the earliest.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Story_ID: 657079
Speaker 1: You said, you were talking earlier about your, being with your father [Willie Logan, Sr.] when you heard that JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had been killed, I guess, or--
Speaker 2:  	Well I, what, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or his--?
Speaker 2:  	When, when I heard that MLK [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been shot I was actually living with my father 'cause that was at night and we were home.  When Kennedy got, was assassinated it was early afternoon eastern time and I was in school.  But, but when they let us out of school my aunt happened to pick me up early and took me home and my father came home a couple of hours later and I can remember sitting through the news and, and, and listening to you know, I'm seeing Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] being sworn in, seeing the body being carried back to Washington [D.C.].  I remember the funeral procession.  I can remember Oswald [Lee Harvey Oswald] being shot.  I could--I mean I remember significant events during that five, ten day period, including the day of.  And all those experiences outside of when I first heard it and when my aunt picked me up was with my father.  I can't remember anybody else, anything else about those weeks that preceded that assassination other than the conversations with my father and some things on TV.
Speaker 1: I think for a lot of people, I mean especially kids they had their first sense of a national polity or national politics when Kennedy was killed, you know.  I don't think some kids couldn't envision what the United States is and what the pres- who the president was until that happened.  But that, then it's on like 24/7, everybody's talking about it.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  I, and I think, I think also because you know TV was recent and you know I, I don't, I don't know quite frankly if I remember anything about national politics or politics prior to, prior to Kennedy's assassination.  I, I just can't recall.  I can just remember how traumatic, how all encompassing, I mean I, I remember my father he just was, he was glued to information about that and I can remember seeing everything, you know.  I mean probably kept me home from school to, to watch the proceedings, you know.  I mean I, I can, I can remember that being a significant time in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And, and though I was an accounting major I think it, it had a lot to do with why I ended up in public service.
Story_ID: 657080
Speaker 1: Where or--what was your first school?  What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2:  	Kindergarten or reg- regular sch- grade school?
Speaker 1: Well maybe before we ask that I should ask like now where did you grow up?
Speaker 2:  	Okay, so I grew up a couple, about, about a mile from here.  It--I thought it was the City of Opa-locka [Florida] but it ended up being unincorporated Opa-locka. Unincorporated Dade County [Miami-Dade County, Florida].  We received city services but we weren't able to vote.  We weren't in the official boundaries of the city.  And, and so I attended you know kindergartens and preschool and nurseries within that geographical area generally with folks who my other, I won't say siblings but my other cousins had, had gone.  The first grade school I went to was Holy Redeemer [Holy Redeemer Catholic School] which was in Liberty City [Miami, Florida], it was a Catholic school.  But you know they believe in corporal punishment and my mother did not, and so I didn't last very long there.  And then I went on to Bunche Park Elementary School [Miami Gardens, Florida], which is a neighborhood public school.
Speaker 1: So, what is this again, what's the name?
Speaker 2:  	Bunche Park.
Speaker 1: Bunche Park?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And I went there, I finished first grade there and went there through fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, were you a serious student?
Speaker 2:  	I think I was a obedient student and I was an accomplished student.  I can't say that I was a serious student and, and I think there were a couple of things where I probably wasn't. I think I, I think the latter two, the former two was because of the fact that my parents [Ruther Brown Logan and Willie Logan, Sr.] brought me up to be respectful of adults.  And you know there's a time and place for all things.  And so, I, I--there were no behavior issues.  I think I was a, an accomplished student because I came in with skillsets that a lot of kids didn't have and I had the support at home that probably many kids didn't have, being just one.  And I had older siblings who had gone through--not siblings, first cousins, see I think about them--who had gone through, had some of the same teachers and had gone through what I had gone through so, I also learned from them.  And so, it didn't take much effort.  But I don't think there was anything about school that I found interesting and therefore, I didn't work hard at it or really didn't apply myself well at it.  And those things I was good at I did without any effort.  And those things that I weren't good at which was mainly English and writing because you know my parents didn't speak Queen's English because they didn't have a formal education.  So--and, and they weren't the best of writers because obviously the vocabulary and you know verb, noun usage were--wasn't proper. That, that's the area that I probably could have really, if I had applied myself, done much better at, at an earlier time but I didn't.  But I did well in school.  I mean I was an A, B student.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) And the teachers liked me and so I mean I was always involved in various activities 'cause I was mannerable, plus my parents were engaged.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's part of--that's half the battle is being coachable I guess (laughter), in the school.
Story_ID: 657081
Speaker 1: So if you have like, if you can conduct yourself--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, was, was your school like a, I mean was it--was the atmosphere in school like, were most of the students like you or was it a--
Speaker 2:  	I, I, I--
Speaker 1: --in, in terms of their respect for the teacher and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  I, I don't recall the chaos that I see in schools now, we--the, the organization that I work with, work for [Opa-locka Community Development Corporation, Opa-locka, Florida].  We have some afterschool programs and, and matter of fact we were over to a high school yesterday and just seeing you know the young ladies come from a gym class and what they wear in the afterschool program or coming from cheerleading and what they would wear in the classroom and how the young men would carry on.  We didn't do that in elementary school.  It, it, I think middle school [North Dade Middle School, Miami Gardens, Florida], it got a little worse but that was I think a lot because of integration and taking folks who we knew all our lives from church or from the neighborhood who we had absolute respect for or who you knew, knew your parents to bringing in folks who you didn't like, didn't like you, necessarily didn't know you, you didn't know or because there was already some dislike for because of you know, the environment, it created an environment of more disrespect.  But it was more verbal disrespect than it was I would say visual disrespect.  And it was more I think about bitterness than it was just about me, which is I think is that we have a lot of today within our schools, just not lack of respect for culture or for place, for adults, for rules, but whatever makes me happy or whatever I need right at the time.  So, no I, I thought that most kids were like me in the sense that most kids were respectful of the adults and there were consequences because you know even though my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] didn't believe in corporal punishment, the school system allowed corporal punishment at that time and, and so those parents that would allow it, those kids were, were punished and punished swiftly.  In addition to that, you know they would call your parents and often time they would know your parents 'cause the teachers lived in the same neighborhood that you lived in, and so there was really no hiding and there was no distance because the parent didn't have to come to the school to find out what's going, happening, they would find out from you know the neighbor's kid or from the grocery store or from church, et cetera.  So, I think we were a lot more respectful and cognizant of the consequences and so I, I thought through elementary school kids were pretty obedient.
Story_ID: 657082
Speaker 1: One thing I, I want to go back and ask about because it's--the more I think about it as I hear you talk, it's, it's different, it- it's a different concept.  Your parent--you say your mother [Ruther Brown Logan] was not into corporal punishment, which is something that so many black households cling to even now.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: People you--almost anybody you, you talk to is going to say that they, the best way to whoop you--raise your children--
Speaker 2:  	My--
Speaker 1: --is to whoop them.
Speaker 2:  	(Shakes head) My parents--
Speaker 1: And those who don't are people who have like, were whooped themselves usually and--but have come to a conclusion this is no longer the best way to do it.  But--so, it's a--is it--if, if you were to raise this issue with any black household now there would be a lively debate about it and usually people with (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh, no absolutely and all of, and all of my aunts and all of my siblings, first cousins outside of one experienced corporal punishment.
Speaker 1: And so why did your--is there a story about how your mother [Ruther Brown], and your parents--?
Speaker 2:  	You know, she, she never raised a hand at me, neither did my father [Willie Logan, Sr.].  My mother, she you know she had a, she had my father's .45 [.45 caliber] from World War II [WWII], she had a .38 [.38 caliber], you know.  I got a car when I was young so she had other means of saying, you know I mean I, I had my own room, I had TVs, I had the--so she had her own ways of bringing about punishment and discipline without physically hitting me.  Though, as I got older she made it perfectly clear that life wasn't worth living if I wasn't going to be appropriate and, and, and, and be responsible.  And so, I always knew that, that you know there was always this threat that if, you know if I was out there acting foolish that she and I may end up in the same funeral home because I, I believed her and I took it very seriously when she said that life wasn't worth living.  And I--'cause I would always say that--, "You're not going to do anything to me 'cause you'll go to jail."  She said, "Oh no I won't, we'll just go, both go to hell."  So, I mean she was perfectly clear about that extreme punishment but she never ever raised her hand at, a hand, no kind at no age and would not let anyone else hit me.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2:  	And I have no idea why she believed that.  She, I think she just thought that I could be motivated more by the carrot kind of thing, versus the carrot and the stick.  And, and I think because as a kid relative to kids from my neighborhood, I had a lot, you know.  And so, there was a lot to be taken or the consequences, particularly when I became a teenager.
Speaker 1: Being an only child though I guess play- plays a role in this and, and makes it more, or may, makes it easier to, to do that I guess.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) You have more patience, more time to focus.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	You know, you don't have to just do something right quick or rabidly--rapidly. And, and it's easy to, to take away TV if you're taking it away from one kid versus it maybe affecting two or three kids.  So, I, I would assume--but most of my first cousins were only kids or lived in only kids environments 'cause there was such a separation between the oldest, the two kids that maybe one parent had.  So, but some just believed in corporal punishment and for whatever reason I never understood why, never really asked but she never believed in it and would dare anyone to raise their hand to hit me.  And as I, as I got older you know she put me in like karate and, and things of that nature and, and so I could protect myself, but didn't really believe in fighting, you know.  And, and did a lot to avoid me from being in environments where I would get in fights as a kid so like always took me and picked me up from school so I rarely walked to school.  And as I got older you know I was a little bit more mature and obviously I knew how to protect myself and so nobody was really--and I was a big kid in terms of height and I was an athlete so nobody really messed with me.  And by the time I was on my own kids were not fighting like that anymore, you know.  So, she really just didn't believe in physical punishment or activity, I guess.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2:  	North Dade [North Dade Middle School, Miami Gardens, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay, now is this when integration starts?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  North Dade used to b- was a high school [North Dade Junior Senior High School]. It was a segregated high school.  When they decided integrate, integrating like they did, most high schools in the black communities they converted them to middle schools and then bussed all the kids to newly built or to schools in white neighborhoods for high school.  And then they bussed middle school kids oftentimes or kids that were close to our neighborhood into the middle school.  And they first brought in teachers and then a year later they brought in students and what a chaos, what a mess.
Speaker 1: Really?  What--describe this for us.
Speaker 2:  	I would say it was probably the most traumatic years of my life.  I had never experienced kids being disrespectful to adults before and I'll never forget my seventh grade teacher, she was a science teacher, she was right out of college.  She was so innocent and so sweet and she was so excited about you know being in the world of education and shaping minds and the kids were so ugly.  I mean just, I mean it was just, it was, it was horrible and so that was the first experience I, I had of that.  And then when, when they integrated the school you know with--there were fights, there were riots in the cafeteria, in the hallway, kids would jump on kids.  I mean I never experienced that before and I found that very troubling.
Story_ID: 657084
Speaker 1: You were talking about the integration of--at North Dade Middle School [Miami Gardens, Florida], I guess?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2:  	Those were very difficult times and they were shocking because I had seen the likes of what I was experiencing on TV, you know, because I mean I had lived through the '67 [1967] and '68 [1968] riots, I had lived through the Vietnam [Vietnam War] protest.  I had lived through you know, women rights and, and, and all kinds of things as related to civil rights that had occurred in the late, the mid, late '60s [1960s], but it was in '71 [1971] when I first experienced it--or '70 [1970] firsthand, of what this whole issue about integration--
Speaker 1: Now were the, were parents involved in terms of--?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, there were parents involved and actually a lady whose picture is on the wall who was the first chairman of our board [of Opa-locka Community Development Corporation, Opa-locka, Florida] was the mother of a very close friend of mine.  And you had parents like that, that were walking the halls.  We had parents that were acting as monitors that were you know, trying to be vigilant in, in, in, in--and, and keep things calm.  But the reality of it is you had a thousand kids and so the, there wasn't enough parents and coverage in the world that if kids want to create chaos and there was some animosity to take advantage of it.  And, and you had, and you had kids who had older siblings who you know had had tough times and, and, and therefore, a lot of that hatred was passed on.  And so it was clear when, when white kids came to my particular middle school that there were kids who didn't want them there and treated them as such. And this is not to say that, that the white kids were innocent in this but you know in my mind they represented 10 percent of the population. We were 90 percent of the population.  We were the host and, and I saw the way we had done the teachers and so it just seemed to me that, that, that the kids had not been properly prepared for what adults and society had decided to, to make happen.
Speaker 1: So, what you're describing is something that I don't think I heard this story before of a black school basically being integrated by white kids, you know?  Because usually it's the black kids that are bussed or the, the people--
Speaker 2:  	Well, that happened when I got to high school [Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida].  But in middle--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--school--and, and, and see also what happened you take a city like Opa-locka [Florida], the, the kids in, in Opa-locka were going to, in the white side of Opa-locka were going to a different middle school.  They weren't necessarily going to the middle school that was closest to them but they were going to a different middle school.
Speaker 1: Oh, so--oh.
Speaker 2:  	And, and so when integration came, they went to the middle school that was closest to them to fill those numbers and, and--but for high school they bussed us all out, outside of our neighborhood to an all-white school.  Matter of fact they built two new schools in two white communities after they closed the black high schools so the white kids wouldn't have to go to a high school in a black community that, that they had their own schools in their own communities.  And so, therefore, Opa-locka kids for example all bussed to North Miami Beach [Florida] and Miami Lakes [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well what you're describing is, I see it as two stages of this.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: You said the--they integrated the teaching staff first.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: And so were, where you had probably had all black teachers is that true?
Speaker 2:  	Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Now you had integrated teachers--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --integrated--were, was, was it mostly white?
Speaker 2:  	No, no, no, it was mostly black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But unfortunately most of the white teachers that came there were young, right out of college, had very little experience and it was their first job.  Or they had no seniority and so therefore, they had no choice but to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what--
Speaker 2:  	I--
Speaker 1: --you were referring to before is they may not have even wanted to be there--
Speaker 2:  	Or they may not have had the experience.
Speaker 1: --to deal with it.
Speaker 2:  	And, and so all of a sudden they get into an environment and a kid is hostile or disrespect and they're trying to figure out this kid is about six, seven years younger than me, almost the same size I am, how do I handle this?  Maybe a seasoned teacher would have been able to deal with it differently.  I don't know.  But the kids were very hostile towards the teachers.  I didn't--the experience that I had the teachers weren't necessarily hostile toward the kids.  Now, when I got in high school, I found a different situation.  I found that, that we were not--I mean those of us who were athletes were treated a certain way.  Those of us who weren't athletes were treated a different way that the support certainly was not there, and that the level of comfortness wasn't there and then there were this big thing of have and have-nots.  I mean most black kids were at best low or middle income.  We were sent to a neighborhood that was upper income, you know.  And, and so you can begin to understand the friction with parents not wanting their kids to be engaged with us.  Some of the kids being interested in us and we're being interested in them.  You know hormones are kicking up at that, at that, at that age and so, there were lots of friction.  I think overall it was an okay experience and for me, for me, it was a good experience in, in the sense that I got access to information, experiences that I would have never otherwise probably would have had the opportunity to.  And I didn't need the kind of support that some kids may have needed in terms of this academic work and I was an athlete.
Story_ID: 657085
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what did you play?  I mean what--?
Speaker 2:  	I, I played football, I played basketball, I ran a little track but mostly football and basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And, and I left high school and sports because of what I thought was a racist situation that the coach today denies. His perspective is one way, my perspective is another.
Speaker 1: Now what--I don't want to get this yet necessarily but--'cause we're like speeding through it.  But what, what high school was it?
Speaker 2:  	Hialeah-Miami Lakes [Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Hi--
Speaker 2:  	Hialeah--
Speaker 1: Hialeah, okay.
Speaker 2:  	--Miami Lakes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Hialeah like the racetrack?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, like Hialeah racetrack [Hialeah Park Race Track], like the City of Hialeah [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Miami Lakes [Florida], okay.
Speaker 2:  	It was a brand new school that was opened--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	--in 1972 [sic. 1971].  It was part of the, the Graham family development.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the Graham family is--?
Speaker 2:  	Former governor [Bob Graham], senator [Ernest R. Graham] Graham family, former captain, Washington Post owner [Philip L. Graham] Graham family, vice president, Graham family, cattle owner.
Speaker 1: Oh, The Washington Post, Graham, oh yeah, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	They were very wealthy, very influential family over the centuries.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2:  	But most of their property and wealth came from agriculture in South and Central Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--well, let's talk about--now so, so you're, you go there. You, you're already an, an athlete when you show up in high school, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: You played in middle school [North Dade Middle School, Miami Gardens, Florida].
Speaker 2:  	And--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2:  	And Optimist, yes.
Speaker 1: And for, for the Optimist you said?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, Optimist league [Optimist International] you know, at the park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So--and, and my father [Willie Logan, Sr.] was a, was a coach before he died you know when I was in elementary school.  So--and I grew up as I told you before loving sports.  I mean I went to the Dolphin [Miami Dolphins] first game.  I mean I used to go to my--the Baltimore Orioles spring training game.  So, I mean I grew up in a house that, that followed and loved sports as well as having to experience sports firsthand as a young, young child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Which, you know, is--was pretty rare I think for a black child in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So, the Orioles had a, a spring training (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes, we had spring training--
Speaker 1: --in Opa-locka [Florida]?
Speaker 2:  	--in Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: No, in Mi- Miami, okay.
Speaker 2:  	In Miami, in Miami Stadium [Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	Until probably the late '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. So, but you didn't play baseball.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  I played--
Speaker 1: You did play, okay.
Speaker 2:  	--played baseball but I was much better at football and basketball.  Well, I was tall so, people thought I should play basketball and I was good at football so people thought I should play football.  Baseball though profess- though professionally in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], baseball probably was the biggest sports for African Americans.  When I grew up in the believe it or not, beyond--when I grew up in the, in the '60s [1960s] it was but in the '70s [1970s] it started turning to football and basketball.  And so, you know, that's, that was popular and that's what the kids pursued, that's the--what kids wanted to play on the street.  And so, I became much more better at football than I was baseball so I pursued football.
Speaker 1: Was it, were there baseball facilities?  I know yesterday we were talking to Jimmie Solomon [HistoryMaker Jimmie Lee Solomon] about you know how--
Speaker 2:  	No, and that, and that was one of the reasons that you, you played more football than basketball because you can play football in the streets you can play the little sand lot park, the little strip.  You can just, you can play basketball in your backyard, you can put up hoops anywhere.  Baseball you need more space, you need more players.
Speaker 1: Glove, bat.
Speaker 2:  	Right, right.  It, it took a lot more organization.  So, though I played organized baseball at the parks, that was for a short period of time.  On a day to day basis I could play football, I could play basketball.  And then football, if nothing but you know, two against two and you still could play.  Baseball is a little difficult to do two against two.  I mean you could pitch, you could hit but who's going to field the ball?  And you, you couldn't be in the neighborhood 'cause there are windows and cars and people et cetera.  So, it was a little bit more difficult to do at, at your leisure versus the other two sports which is probably why I pursued those and became much better at those two.
Story_ID: 657086
Speaker 1: What position did you play in--?
Speaker 2:  	Well, the position I was interested in playing was quarterback.  The position that I ended up playing was offensive end which is, which is what led to me--to stop playing football.  And, and I'll say this, I had a couple of cousins, one older, one younger that actually went to--and played and had great careers at the NFL [National Football League].  And we all grew up together, played football together.
Speaker 1: Who are they if you (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	The first cousin the one that I mentioned is John Swain.  He played for the Minnesota Vikings.  He went to University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] like I did.  He's three years younger than me.  But, but, but getting back to my point, I wanted to play quarterback, I, and I was very good at playing quarterback.  I understood the game as I've already told you, you know earlier on that I was you know watching it at the, you know in my father's  [Willie Logan, Sr.] lap for, for--from the time I can remember life and played it.  And, but I played offensive end and lettered you know as a sophomore on to varsity.  And that spring I wanted to play, I thought I would move up to first string varsity football and I didn't.  And then I played offensive end again and then going into twelfth grade, I knew that I would play first string quarterback 'cause that's what I wanted to play.  I wasn't interested in playing offensive receiver.  But I played because you know I wanted to start and I--and in the spring training the coach put his son who was a year younger than me, he was a junior at first string quarterback and changed the entire offense to be more of a T bone running offense.  And I thought that was to accommodate his son who was shorter, stockier, more of a runner than a passer.  And when I approached the coach about it, basically the response I got was you know, you--, "There are some interesting colleges in you playing offensive end.  If you want to go to college this is what you need to do."  And I was insulted because I didn't have to play sports to go to college you know and that's not why--I always wanted to go to college.  I mean I, I, I was on that same track as most black young men that I wouldn't mind playing football but my parents, my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] was absolutely opposed to it.  You know, she understood the trauma that was caused from such a violent sport early on.  And so she was actually opposed to it and had already said to me that if I did not go to college playing sports that she would you know make sure that I had all the financial resources I need to, to go to college without it being a burden.  And she proved me right by doing live in service or whatever it took to be able to help me to make it through college without coming up in a lot of debt.  And so, I actually dropped out of high school [Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida], quit the football team, quit the basketball team that spring because of the fact that I wasn't--I was really in high school because I was interested in playing sports.  Once I couldn't play what I wanted to play there was no reason for me to stay in high school and so I dual enrolled in college and I haven't been in high school since then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so you didn't need to graduate from high school to go to college?
Speaker 2:  	Unh-uh (shakes head). I just enrolled in Miami-Dade [Miami-Dade Community College; Miami Dade College, Miami, Florida] immediately.
Speaker 1: Did--and so they, there's no, there's no legal--
Speaker 2:  	It is now but it wasn't then.
Speaker 1: Oh but--okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	Community colleges were open colleges, open enrollment.  Anybody can go take courses.  So, I start--I had--all I needed, I needed one high school course to finish high school other than a couple of electives.  And that was a government course.  I took it at night at a different school.  And then I took all my electives at Miami Dade and so I was working on my A.A. degree at the same time I was working on my high school diploma and the year that I was supposed to finish high school in '75 [1975], I actually--that--actually finished my A.A. degree.
Story_ID: 657087
Speaker 1: That's quite th--very--did--was, did you have a model for that from anybody?  Did--
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: --did you know anybody else that did that?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	No, but I mean I, I mean I think clearly I was, had been raised to be an independent thinker to be confident to be willing to color outside the lines, just follow the rules, you know.  And, and I mean I, I always understood that for some reason I knew about open enrollment at, at the community college [Miami-Dade Community College; Miami Dade College, Miami, Florida].  I knew I was smart enough to do it. I knew I really wasn't interested in high school.  I mean I was in high school [at Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida].  I was seventeen years old.  I was in high school because that's what you're supposed to do and I was interested in playing sports.  Well once sports was not part of it, I couldn't figure out, ehy would I want to be in high school when I can be in college?  I mean that's just how I thought about it.  And I also recognized that my mother had--my parents [Ruther Brown Logan and Willie Logan, Sr.] had worked very hard and I was very much interested in them not having quite frankly to go work for other people, particularly the type of work that they were doing because even though it was, you know LPN [licensed practical nurse], nurse's assistant, I mean she basically was cleaning and taking care of somebody else's mess be it the dishes or the, or the waste and, and I didn't want my mother doing that.  And so, once--and there was no reason for me to prolong my educational process once football and sports was out, out the factor.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, I take it basketball was like secondary to football (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	It, it was.  I was very good at football.  I played basketball because I was tall. I was not that good a basketball player, in my mind.
Story_ID: 657088
Speaker 1: Were there any--we always ask this question, were there any teach- special teachers or, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Of course there were.
Speaker 1: --or mentors in, at the high school level [at Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida] or, or college level, I mean at, at the junior college level where you were--the community college?
Speaker 2:  	There certainly was at the elementary school level let me say that, and there certainly was at the middle school level [North Dade Middle School, Miami Gardens, Florida].  I, I wouldn't say as much at the high school level.  There were probably more students who were mentors at the high school level.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	People who, when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do, who had insights to professions and life from their own parents' experience I didn't have.  But I, I think the community college right away--
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back to elementary school 'cause you mentioned--we didn't mention them and they're, they're, they, they're important those elementary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes, and they're very important.
Speaker 1: --school.  So, let's go back to them--
Speaker 2:  	I mean--
Speaker 1: --and go all the way maybe through.
Speaker 2:  	I, I, I'll do it quickly.  I mean my first grade teacher clearly adored me.  She--and, and, and the reason I say that was because that was the first time that I was you know put in contests.  She wanted to promote me, she wanted me to skip second grade.  I mean she did all kinds of things to advance my educational opportunities and, and educational standing.  And, and, and she, you know I could tell she really loved me.  She really--I inspired her to do what she did and, and maybe in some ways she found me to be an ideal student.  I had similar experiences with my third grade teacher but I think the one that was most impactful was my sixth grade teacher because she was the one that did things for me outside the classroom.  Like for example, my parents [Ruther Brown Logan and Willie Logan, Sr.] were not the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] kind of parents.  You know they weren't Links [The Links, Incorporated], they weren't, you know. And so, all of a sudden I got exposure to institutions and organizations because of her status that I would not have gotten through my parents' status in society which was you know more of a sort of an elite professional black status.  And so she, she opened opportunities and introduced me to spaces, places and people that I had never gone to.  So, the first time I ever went to a play, a live play or the first time I saw a ballet or the first time I saw things that you know I hadn't gotten from my parents was really through her.  I mean going to a, sort of a formal dinner where I got to put on a tuxedo, you know was through her.  And, and, and, and so I, I think she opened up a world and it gave me exposure to a world that, that 'til that date I didn't know existed, particularly amongst black folks.  I mean I may have seen some of it on TV, but not right in my own community that there was this society so to speak that we're living like people I saw on TV or doing the things that I saw.  And so, she, she was very, very impactful.  And then along the way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was her name?  What was her name?
Speaker 2:  	Her name was Murray, Valdez Murray-Murray (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 657089
Speaker 1: And along the way there were always you know someone that gave me some insights, some opportunity, et cetera.  But, but I think what made, what helped me to survive and what gave me a perspective of you know keeping your mouth closed and, and being, and listening and, and seeing before you develop opinions was, was a mentor at Miami-Dade College [Miami-Dade Community College; Miami Dade College, Miami, Florida].  He, he happened to--you know I don't really remember what Mr. Terry's [ph.] role was.  I don't know whether he was a student counselor or was he career service or whether he had certain positions that helped black students, et cetera, I really don't remember.  But all I do remember was, was that he gave me a job working in his office.  And it was through that job that I all of a sudden had a father figure that I hadn't had for about six years who was capable and willing and took the time to mentor me.  And so, be it with classes, be it with school projects, be it when Jimmy Carter [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] decided that in 1975 he was going to, to seek the Democratic nomination and he came to the campus with overalls and a plaid shirt and I thought it was a joke that a man with, with a southern twing like that, dressed like that could be the president of the United States 'cause my model was John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], so to speak.  And, and, and I can remember how he helped me to understand you know why this man had a shot, you know, and, and giving--and I had watched Watergate so I knew how the country felt about Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].  I knew how the country felt about Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] and being an, an empty suit and, and how the timing and hearing him saying how the timing for someone like Jimmy Carter you know could be perfect.  So, he you know he--so it wasn't just not in the classroom, it was not just about life, but it was also about, you know, how to come to an opinion, how do you evaluate?  How do you, you know, you take a close look at things before you jump to assumptions.  You know, how are you gonna judge a book by the cover?  How do--you have to know the facts and you have to understand in this day and time how that may affect something that ten years from now could never happen or ten years ago, it may not never happen but it's because of the circumstances now that, that has an impact.  So, it's not just a person, it's just not the reason, but it's also all the other things that, that come into play.  And you have to take those things into consideration as you make choices and decisions and evaluate stuff in life.  And so, he, he gave--he was an older man and so he gave me that, the sort of wisdom you know to just take, take a step back you know.  And like my mother say, "You can't judge a book by a cover," or you know, well, "Be a book but not an open book and therefore, it takes time to understand a book."  You know, it, it was, it was reiterating those things that she may have said but I was learning in real time in real life experiences because I was on a college campus.
Story_ID: 657090
Speaker 1: Your mother [Ruther Brown Logan] should of--should have, you should compile these (laughter) sayings of hers.  She's--
Speaker 2:  	I, I, I--if you stayed around the office for about three hours you will hear them all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I mean it's amazing how often I use them.  It's just that you know I'm being asked what they are now because they, they're natural.  They come in response to the situation that I'm dealing with.  And, and, and many of them are very, very true, and very, very insightful and very meaningful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, now you went on to the University of Miami in Coral Gables [Florida], right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And, now why did you choose that one or?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I mean I, I think it was a couple of reasons.  I mean my first choices probably may have been out of my academic financial reach but they certainly were opposed to by my mother.  My, my first two choices was NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and Berkeley--and U Cal at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and I mean it doesn't take a brain science to understand why in the '70s [1970s] a kid would want to go to NYU and Berkeley.  But you know, from my mother's perspective once again it just shows you how ingenious she was because I had never been to New York [New York] at this time.  I had never been to Berkeley [California] or San Francisco [California] for that matter, Oakland [California].  And--but she knew these were urban colleges that were in urban cities, that did not have the traditional campus and, and that it was an environment that, that they required lots of discipline, lots of responsibility amongst all the other things in choosing schools like that and not being a state resident or for that matter, I mean NYU doesn't matter.  But I mean, but--and, and so she was very much opposed to me going to those schools.  And then my next two choices were UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and University of Miami and it was simply because UCLA had--Lew Alcindor [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] had a great basketball team and I followed them and University of Miami was Sunshine U and I had followed them all of my life.  And, and so it was because of the sports, because UM was local, because it was known for the reputation of being a great place to have fun and go to school and it was sunny.  And so once I couldn't get my first two choices and choice (unclear) UCLA and UM, the cost you know.  And, and, and I don't, and I don't think that I probably really was interested in going too far from my place of birth and relatives, even though I thought I did.  New York probably yes, UCLA no.  Berkeley would have been worth it.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) In my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Because so much was happening at Berkeley at the time.
Story_ID: 657091
Speaker 1: Nineteen--I guess '75 [1975], is that, that when you started?
Speaker 2:  	I actually started in seventy--UM [University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida], yeah '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you majored in accounting, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: That's what you said?  And was there a black student organization there on campus?
Speaker 2:  	There was.  There was the United Black Students association.  I was very active in it.  My roommate was the--became the UBS president.  We, just this past weekend, we had the first 100 graduate celebration at UM and I was shocked to know that I was in that number even though I finished in '77 [1977], and shocked to know the folks in my, what would have been my class which was '79 [1979] were also in that number.  And it's just amazing to me that in the late end of the '70s [1970s] we still were graduating the first 100 graduates from UM.  I find that absolutely amazing.  But when I think back in retrospect, I can't remember one white student, one--I can't remember not one non-black student, not one non-black professor or instructor other than a literature teacher I had and I only remember her because she was--we saw it as almost being a joke.  But that probably was disrespectful but we were young kids and she had some issues and, and she was very, very elderly and you know it was, you couldn't understand why she would still be teaching.  And, and--but I remember her because--not because of anything positive but, but just because of her age and just sort of her personality at the time, but I did very well in her class.  But I didn't--I integrated two fraternities.  That black boy, my roommate who ended up becoming U, UBS president, there were two service fraternities and forced our way into the student government council and integrated what they called the (unclear) what they called the fraternity council, you know the organization of fraternities.
Speaker 1: Now, now what frater- fraternity were you in?
Speaker 2:  	I pledged Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But I integrated Alpha, Alpha Phi Omega, which were on black campuses [HBCUs]--are black service thing.  And then I, and it was a business fraternity and I can't think of the name of it that I integrated and we had to force our way in on both occasions.  And some occasions we had to make an appeal to a, a student body and then the, to the, the school's, whatever board the school had at the time that, that dealt with issues like that, so--
Story_ID: 657092
Speaker 1: So there were civil rights issues but it's really sad when I think about the fact that I was on the campus [University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida] where there were very few blacks and I don't--the only students I can remember and the only faculty and the only staff I can remember were blacks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	Only.  I found that absolutely amazing that you could be on a campus in a class that's 95 percent white students, all white professors and you don't remember one single one of them, which meant we had no relationships.  It was, it was an integrated situation that was very segregated.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1:  	Even though the dorms were integrated, the classrooms were integrated, the cafeteria was integrated, you know the intramural parks, everything was--the clubs, the student lounge--everything was integrated.  I had no, no white relationships whatsoever.
Speaker 2: Well that's often the case in integrated colleges.  I mean it's--
Speaker 1:  	But it's a sad state you know.  And, and you have to wonder--I mean it has to be both of us, I mean I just can't imagine it's just one sided that that's the case.  That, that birds of the same feather I guess flock together and maybe we were more comfortable (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know they always, they always ask the question, "Why do all the black students sit together in the cafeteria?"
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then 'til somebody black asks the question well, "Why are all the whites sitting together?"
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: Even though we're a smaller group.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: They're sitting together too.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.  And, and you were there before we were there and so why weren't there some mentoring or something?  You know, so, so, so, so, so you know I, I, I'm not, at this age I'm not pointing a finger because I could have just easily got up and, and went to their table.  But I do realize that when I, each time I tried to do that, there was a battle.  I was not welcome.  And we had to force our way in to the extent that we were in the beginning.  And when you're young like that when you have choices, if I could be happy hanging out with you versus I got to fight to hang out with somebody who don't want to hang out with me, I'm just doing that fight just to have the right to do it.  But that's not what I'm going to do when it's all said and done.  I got in the fraternity [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity].  You think I was active in that fraternity when they didn't first want me there?  No.  And I didn't like them and they didn't like me?  No.  I just went back and I was active in my own fraternity.

Speaker 1: What aspect of, of accounting did you focus on?
Speaker 2:  	Well, first of all I didn't know what an accountant was until some young lady who happened to be white in high school [Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School, Hialeah, Florida] sat me down and says, "Willie [HistoryMaker Willie Logan] you know if you don't want to be a doctor 'cause you don't like science, you really should tell your mother [Ruther Brown Logan] there are other things you can be besides a doctor, lawyer and a teacher," which is all I knew.  She says, "You can be an engineer."  She says, "You can be an accountant."  She says, "You're really good in math.  You should really think about being a CPA [certified public accountant] one day.  You could work for yourself.  You always can get a job. You always can do stuff."  And I said, "What's an accountant?"  She says, "My father is an accountant.  Why don't you go--we'll go by his office one day and you can talk to him and see what he does."  And that's how I learned about what an accountant did and was and decided I would major in accounting.  And, and so I didn't specialize in any particular field.  I just have a bachelor of businesses, of administration degree with a concentration in accounting [from the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida].  It was done towards a career in accounting with the goal of getting a master's in accounting and eventually sitting for the CPA exam and that was the path that I was on.
Story_ID: 657094
Speaker 1: When you're on the verge of graduation what were your, your thoughts?
Speaker 2:  	I, I, I think my first thought was the fact that the thing that made me most happiest were two things.  One is that I was no longer dependent upon my mother [Ruther Brown Logan].  You know that I was in a position to take care of myself, make my own decisions.  And I think the second thing was that she no longer had to go out and work for anyone else.  And, and so those were the things that I was most excited about.  I really hadn't thought much about a career at that point because it was always my thought that I were going to, I would just get a job, that--because I finished in December instead of May.  So, my thought was that I would go get a job but by that fall I would go back to graduate school and find a part time job or somehow own a bookkeeping business or something in order to help me through graduate school so, I could sit for the CPA [certified public accountant] exam.  And that was, I mean that's where I was headed.  So, I--in my mind I still was a couple of years away from my profession.  But this was a first step that I could make a little money and put myself in position where I could at least take care of myself.
Speaker 1: Now, now were you--had you interned anywhere or, or, or worked for any accounting firms or--
Speaker 2:  	I, I--well--
Speaker 1: --business?
Speaker 2:  	--well, now remember I was at University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] and if the white folks weren't, teachers weren't and counselors weren't talking to me then I wasn't getting no internships.  But yet (unclear), and I don't even know if we knew those things exist.  I don't recall ever being recruited or having the opportunity to talk to anybody about a job when I--I, I, I always worked when I was in college.  And so, when I left Miami-Dade [Miami-Dade Community College; Miami Dade College, Miami, Florida] and, and start working for Mr. Terry [ph.] which is an administrative position, I--the financial aid director of, at UM at the time was a Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] and he had two sons that were on campus who actually pledged under me but we were friends.  And he did a very good job in helping black students. And the student service director was a, also a black man, young black man who had played there.  And so, I got assigned working as a bookkeeper in the fiscal office at UM early on when I was there.  And, and then also I took a second job working for--and it was an exotic animal company in Coral Gables [Florida] that I was doing bookkeeping services for.  And I was so, more so freelance.  You know and we didn't have office hours.  I had about fifteen, twenty hours' worth of work to do their books and then I had the twenty hours on campus.  But as you know, campus jobs you can do work study and other things too so it wasn't really like an intense job.  So, I was working thirty to forty hours a week for part of my college career doing mostly bookkeeping type of services so, I had some experience.  But to say I had corporate experience or the type of experience that you would think in terms of real internships and mentoring, no.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Didn't even know those things exist.
Story_ID: 657095
Speaker 1: Did you get a job someplace right, right afterwards?
Speaker 2:  	I, I did.  I got a job working as an accountant.  I can't think of the name of the company.  I worked for a week.  I realized I hated it, I mean literally hated it.  The idea that my life will be spent working with numbers in an office not interacting with people, being as mundane as you know making entries into a general ledger and reconciling financial statements and bank statements was tedious and absolutely boring and I felt like I was making no contribution to anything, other than maybe helping someone to understand what their profits and losses were or expenses and revenues were.  And, and that wasn't how I wanted to spend my life.  So, after the first week I quit without having a second job.  And, you know, I, I pursued a couple opportunities, including AT&T [AT&T Inc.] had a management program that a--my college roommate's brother-in-law had just graduated from out of New York [New York] that I got accepted in. But I decided to take a job with an insurance company.  No, I decided to take a job with the, the insurance agency at the time and that was Bill Gunter who was the commissioner of edu- commissioner of insurance.  And, and what I did not talk about was my involvement in politics when I was at UM.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And, and how that was a bridge to the second job I got which is the second week after I finished college, as well as a bridge into politics.  Michael Abrams [Mike Abrams] who, who was the then chairman of the Democratic Party who had been the former president of the student body at UM was part of the draft Kennedy movement, Edward Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] that challenged then Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.]--well, he--our first--okay, let me back up.  So, he was active in campus and he was active in making sure we had a democratic club at University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] and he was active with the local DNC [Democratic National Committee], and that's how I got involved in politics (background noise).  And--in local politics and, and got engaged in politics.  And I had helped the then candidate for the commissioner of in, insurance.  I had worked with his campaign.  And when he won that November and I finished college in that December which is how I got the bridge to the job working as a field director in the insurance commissioner's office.  And so, I did that right after I quit the job as an accountant and I stayed there for about a year.  And I liked that because I got to work outside the office.  I got to help people who had complaints who insurance were being nonresponsive or unresponsive or not responding correctly to you know, to look into those cases.  And, and it helped people re- you know resolve those matters and so I was a bridge between you know clients and, and businesses enforcing laws of the State of Florida representing a public official, and I liked that job. The only thing I didn't like about it was that I, I really was an entrepreneur by, by nature.  And so, the idea of clocking hours, the idea of having you know sort of a set job description that, that you, you know this is what you do every day, even though I liked more of what I was doing, 'cause I thought I was making somewhat of a difference wasn't what I was looking for and the other thing was, is that it didn't use my, what I thought was my strongest skillset which was my quantitative skills.
Story_ID: 657096
Speaker 1: I then decided that I would go work for a local business that was an insurance agency and it was the largest black owned insurance agency in the Southeast United States.  And what was interesting to me about that was that his brother had been an executive with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and they were attempting to modernize all of their nineteen or so offices throughout the Southeast United States, by--at the time, sort of interconnecting them to whatever was the computer system then.  And because his brother had been an executive at IBM, he sort of understood what computers were in 1979, I think this was.  And so, I was hired for two reasons.  I was hired to work with his--'cause I had did, I had minored in computer science [at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida].  And when I went over to get my, when I was taking graduate courses during this time for my master's in accounting which I switched to master's in finance, I was taking computer science courses at the time.  So, I had some background in computer science.  I took this job and you know, this job allowed me to make money on my work because I was selling insurance and I was very good at it.  But it also allowed me to do something that was innovative and new and took me outside of just selling insurance to the fact that I had this dual responsibility of, of, of installing--and it wasn't called software and hardware then, but installing the, the, the, the computer, the technology at the time into that Miami [Florida] office.  And I did such a good job doing it, his brother wanted me to do it for the rest of the companies throughout the Southeast United States.  So, I moved to Atlanta [Georgia] and I did that for about six months but I took a significant pay cut because I couldn't make the commission.  I was just running around on the salary I had, which was interesting because I got to live in Atlanta, I got to see cities in the south United States, I got to meet folks.  And one of the things that was most revealing to me then was I realized in most places I was going to was no better off than what I had seen in Miami in terms of where the black community was.  There were no black elected officials.  If you wanted to find a person in power you either went to the church, the funeral home or the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] offices, oftentimes it was one and the same.  You know, there could have been a doctor or dentist that were sort of the prominent people.  But I mean if you were to find the real core political power, you know you need to go to the newspaper, black newspaper or the funeral home.  I mean, and, and in general that's where their powers sort of stopped and ended at.  And, and I found that very troubling that there really weren't any centers of power or influence within black communities as related to the greater, greater community.  And I found that all over the Southeast as I would go places, you know.  And, so when I got back home I decided I was going to come home and I was going to get involved and I was going to do something about my community and work, et cetera, and probably three months later I ended up running for mayor [of Opa-locka, Florida].  And, and it was, and it was quite frankly because of what I had seen over that year or so or six or seven months working throughout the Southeast, installing this new system in these insurance agencies.
Speaker 2: Now what, what, what agency was this that you worked for?
Speaker 1:  	It was George Green insurance agency.
Speaker 2: George Green, okay.
Speaker 1:  	His son, George Green, Jr., interesting enough, works for the Federal Reserve out of Atlanta [Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia], who I recently ran into.  But, but it was George Green insurance agency.  He was, and he had about seventeen agencies throughout the Southeast.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And his brother, Lambert Green [ph.] who had been an executive with IBM and who had left and had joined his brother for the purpose of installing this new technology, that in some ways allowed you know sort of data collection or communication or op, some sort of operational system, clearly nothing that we ended up getting in the 1990s, but it was the beginning of it.
Story_ID: 657097
Speaker 1: You focus on Opa-locka [Florida], now you, you were running for mayor of Opa-locka, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And Opa- tell us something about Opa-locka.  And when you were growing up, what was it like and--?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I mean Opa-locka was a wonderful place.  The--the only thing that I, I have to really distinguish is, is that I always thought I lived in Opa-locka, but I didn't because the boundaries stopped two streets south of where our home was and so that was one thing, even though I really believed I grew up and still consider myself growing up in Opa-locka.  The second thing, I never knew Opa-locka was segregated until it was time to integrate the parks and I was part of those kids to integrate the parks and learn about the segregation at that time and the evilness about racism.  When we were in seventh grade or so, right at the same time we integrate, the schools were integrated, we in--the west side of Opa-locka was white, the east side was black.  27th Avenue was the dividing line which is the big major north-south street.  This side, which is now the west side that we're currently sitting on, blacks, unless they had a reason, work or they had to go pay the water bill or something could not come to this side.  The biggest park was on this side, still is.  And so, Ms. Brown's husband, Frank Brown [ph.] who was a coach of the black park and other parents, Mr. Pimmerton [ph.], former chairman of this organization, one of the first basketball players in the Negro Basketball League in the late '40s [1940s] helped to integrate this park.  They would bring the kids over.  They would you know for--they couldn't stop us from playing, et cetera.  But we couldn't walk home because they would shoot at us.  They would ride by and throw rocks at us.  They would call us names, et cetera.  So, it was very, very dangerous the first year or two in integrating the parks.  And so those were some of the first memories I have of Opa-locka being more than just a place I grew up as a kid.
Story_ID: 657098
Speaker 1: We were saying when we- when I came in and with--the--Opa-locka [Florida] was founded in 1920?
Speaker 2:  	Twenty-six [1926].
Speaker 1: Twenty-six [1926]?
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: Now that's a--makes it a lot younger than most places in the United States.
Speaker 2:  	But a lot older than most places in South Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  South Florida is a new development in a lot of ways (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right.  Miami [Florida] is founded in the 1890s and so was Palm Beach [Florida].  And then most of the other cities were founded in the '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s], and subsequently.  So, this is one of the oldest cities in South Florida.
Speaker 1: And it has an interesting motif, right?
Speaker 2:  	It, it does.  It has a Moorish motif.  It was one of three cities in Dade County, in the Miami-Dade County [Florida] that were built on some type of theme in order to attract northerners to come to get on the Flagler rail track and to come to this swamp to live a life of a fairy tale.  And so Opa-locka was Moorish, Miami Springs [Florida] was Mediterranean and Coral Gables [Florida] was Spanish and they were all built on those themes.  And so, when you go to those cities, not only do you see the names of roads that reflect those geographical areas but you see buildings with that architect and, and motif and you had events that actually celebrated those motifs.
Speaker 1: Now, this is what, this is, it may sound like I'm stretching here but in the 1920s, one of the most popular movies, silent films was 'The Sheik'--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --with Rudolph Valentino.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And there were--and I know there are theaters in Chicago [Illinois] and other places that have this Arabic theme, you know.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: And I would guess that this city (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) And that's exactly why it was, it was 'The Arabian Night and the Seven Thieves' [sic.].  It was, 'Seven Thieves,' it was that movie--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	--that led to this development.  And so, you can--actually names of people, characters, et cetera.
Speaker 1: There's an Ali Baba Street [sic. Ali Baba Avenue]--
Speaker 2:  	Exactly.
Speaker 1: --Sesame Street--
Speaker 2:  	Sinbad [Avenue], exactly.
Speaker 1: --Sinbad, yeah.
Speaker 2:  	That's what--those, those were--and, and, and so there used to be festivals with the flying carpet and, and those kinds of activities that--belly dancers, et cetera, that reflected activities and scenes in that movie that, that actually was the, the theme, the motif of the city (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's interesting when I, when we first arrived here at the Opa-locka Development Corporation [Opa-locka Community Development Corporation, Opa-locka, Florida], I looked across and I saw what I thought was a mosque.  And, on further reflection, it's the, it's the former city hall--
Speaker 2:  	Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of Opa-locka, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  And it used to be the former administrative building to sell property.  So, the owner had an apartment up on the third floor and the first and second floor was the administration building of the owner to sell lots and, and stuff.  And it managed all of the public spaces like the golf course and the archery facility, et cetera.  And, and so it was, it always had sort of been the center of activity.  And it was city--it was the city hall until I guess the early 2000s and, and it's been under renovation for quite a long time now.  And the city quite, hadn't quite said what it's new use will be. The assumption is that it will be some public purpose and--because it quite frankly is a jewel and what makes the city in many ways very unique.
Speaker 1: Yeah, very--it's an in- interesting looking--
Speaker 2:  	Yes(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) place. And it makes--yeah, this is, this is a unique city layout.
Story_ID: 657099
Speaker 1: This part of town I guess started turning more African American as, as you were growing older, right?
Speaker 2:  Well, it, it--only, I think the first African Americans probably didn't move over here until the mid-'70s [1970s]. But then you had an exodus, a white exodus.  I mean, and it was--I mean none of the kids ever came back.  You know, so the kids that I may have gone to high school with and middle school with that grew up here, none of them ever would come back.  When they would turn eighteen, they would leave.  And it was only the parents who couldn't afford to leave but just were unwilling to leave because they had power or businesses, et cetera, stayed.  But generally, when they got to retirement age they left and--or died out and never were replaced by white families.  And so, blacks did come here in the late '70s [1970s].  But what was remarkable in 1980, during the Mariel boatlift, Opa-locka Airport [Miami Opa-locka Executive Airport, Opa-locka, Florida] was used as, as the major processing station so you had a couple hundred thousand refugees from Cuba that were processed at Opa-locka Airport and the federal government did not secure the fences and so you saw refugees just walking from the airport into the neighborhood and now this west part of Opa-locka [Florida] is mostly Hispanic.  But what also was interesting, it started off being Cuban, then it became more and more Dominican and repub- Puerto Rican and other types of Hispanic, and now it's really, really heavy mulatto, blacks mixed with Caribbean Hispanics.  And a lot of non-Cuban. So, over the last thirty years, though it's become more and more ethnic, first black, then Hispanics, now much more Spanish, black mix.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Or black Spanish (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and let me say, just say in '75 [1975], this is when you were still in college [at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida].
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Story_ID: 657100
Speaker 1: Opa-locka [Florida] elected its first black mayor, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that correct?  Albert W. Tresvant [Albert W. Tresvant, Sr.].
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so, well tell us about that.  Now, what did you, was that, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, well the Tresvant--
Speaker 1: --that, that was exciting around here wasn't it?
Speaker 2:  	Well, well you know, I was in college at the time [at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida] and I wasn't as cognizant of, of what was going on in Opa-locka.  Virginia Tresvant, Mayor Tresvant's wife and my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] were very close friends.  We all went to the same church.  I knew his kids but I was not that familiar with what was going on in Opa-locka politics.  And Mr. Tresvant served I think one term before he got in trouble and, and, and, and I--it--was removed from office.  And so what I remember most, to be honest with you most about Tresvant was when I got ready to run for office, people telling me about his story and his legacy and what happened to him and what to be cognizant of. It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'cause he didn't have a good end, right?
Speaker 2:  	No, no.  And, and then I learned more about--and then once I was elected, his wife was very active in my campaign and was very protective of me, Ms. Tresvant.  And, and then I only served one term as mayor, then I got elected to the legislature [Florida House of Representatives] and was immediately put on the corrections committee [Florida House of Representatives Committee on Corrections].  And all I remember at that point trying to help him to get out of prison at that point.  And--
Speaker 1: So, what, what happened to him?  What, what, what, what is your--?
Speaker 2:  	A bribe.
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2:  	A bribe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And, and, and what occurred in Opa-locka during the late '70s [1970s] which, which you still see a lot of, when you had white flight, the elected officials who mostly were white, four out of five other than Tresvant at the time and then you eventually got reverend, I can't think of his name at the moment.  But you had a second mayor that was elected for a short period of time but he died in office.
Speaker 1: This is Willie Young?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, Reverend Young.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Mayor Young.  And my mother was also close to his wife, not as close as she was to the Tresvants but, but we knew the family very well also.  What you have was, was a change in zoning laws which basically rezoned property where people could make lots of money but in many cases were inappropriate for the neighborhood.  And so you have one area that was zoned for a park, a regional park.  All of a sudden it became an industrial park.  And you had some that was for residential, all of a sudden because heavy duty industrial.  I mean you had all kind of crazy zoning laws and so people made money off of it and there was lots of you know cash amongst the commission [Opa-locka City Commission].  So, you had--when Tresvant went down you had two other commissioners, the majority of the commission went down with it.  So--and that was because of, of, of folks who no longer had a vested interest in the city was trying to see how they could milk they city as they depart.  And, and the, the, the, the legacy of that is still here because you have lots of inappropriate zoning and environmental issues because of that.
Story_ID: 657101
Speaker 1: Our outline has you founding the Opa-locka Development Corp- Corporation [Opa-locka Community Development Corporation, Opa-locka, Florida] around the same time?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: In 1980?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: So, did you found it first before you ran for mayor or--?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	No.  One of the thing--the, the two things that occurred that led to the founding of the Opa-locka CDC, one, one is I, I had only been elected for two months and had had three jobs, and the reason I had those three jobs was because every job I had wanted me to use my position as mayor to help my employer and that just you know, I wasn't going down that road.
Speaker 1: 'Cause being mayor doesn't pay enough for, for a living.
Speaker 2:  	No.  No, it paid six hundred dollars a month I think at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So, I had to eat.  And, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let, let me just stop--let's talk about the mayoral campaign first, then we'll get to that since that happens next, okay?
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: So, we, we'll just pick--
Speaker 2:  	So, I, I decided to run for mayor on two things.  One is, is that we had had a former chief of police who had been removed for police brutality by the mayor, I mean by the governor, Graham [Bob Graham], or had been sanctioned by Graham and--for police brutality on blacks.  And he was running for mayor and there were twelve candidates and there were no black challenging him.  And I just couldn't fathom that and so I decided to run.  But I also decided to run because the same person in this same commission had voted that they didn't want the transit, the public transit coming up 27th Avenue because they didn't want those people coming to the community.  And so, though I had fought very hard back in '78 [1978] and '79 [1979] to get the sales tax passed to bring metra rail to Miami-Dade County [Florida] and up 27th Avenue, 'cause I can remember standing on 27th Avenue to get a bus down to Miami-Dade College [Miami-Dade Community College; Miami Dade College, Miami, Florida] versus being able to get a, a train, the train ended up going out to Hialeah [Florida] because they didn't want folks from Liberty City [Miami, Florida] having access to Opa-locka [Florida], which is ridiculous.  And, and so I ran based upon those two things, the fact that you had a commission [Opa-locka City Commission] voting 'cause they didn't want blacks having access to the city and therefore, they denied access to public transportation coming into the city for its residents, nor was someone who had committed police brutality was being challenged for mayor in a city that's majority black.  I just couldn't fathom either one of those.  And, and I think the old guard was a little bit bitten because they had two elected officials, one who had gone to prison [Albert W. Tresvant, Sr.] and one who had died in office [Willie Young] and just, nobody had the, you know wanted to I guess to take that route.  But anyway, nobody was running and I went to qualify and I was told I didn't live in the city because I lived two streets outside the city and so my mother [Ruther Brown Logan] told me "No problem.  You go call Helen Miller.  You tell her--I'll call Helen Miller, you go see her.  She'll rent a room from you."  You use her address and you go back down there and qualify and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, I imagine the black politicians were probably afraid that they would get caught up in some kind of a scandal--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --if they were elected?
Speaker 2:  	I think the older guard, yes.
Speaker 1: Older guys, yeah.
Speaker 2:  	I was too young to--
Speaker 1: Have a lot of baggage I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  And to be afraid.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: A lot of people would say had they only known when they were younger would they have done it, you know what I mean?  A lot of people would say, we don't know.  But--
Speaker 2:  	Well you know, in, in retrospect I don't think I would have done anything differently because of the experience and I think what I was able to contribute and what I, what I've learned I, I couldn't have done that in any other way that I could think of and--because it really, really was insightful and, and, and, and--I mean I was elected a week and in that one week I had an opportunity to go to the White House [Washington, D.C.].  I had to deal with certain services, which is the McDuffie riots and I had an international crisis with the Mariel boatlift and that all happened in the first two weeks that I was elected as mayor.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't want to skip over the, the impact of a twenty-three year old running for mayor though.
Speaker 2:  	Right.  But, but I'm saying to you so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, how, how did you get--yeah you had a lot.
Speaker 2:  	And so, I wouldn't, in retrospect I wouldn't change it because of the experiences that I had.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Just the first two weeks were life changing and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	--dynamic experiences.  But--
Speaker 1: But you're a twenty-three year old running for mayor of a--
Speaker 2:  	Well, I was twenty-two, running.
Speaker 1: Twenty-two, okay.
Speaker 2:  	And I had just turned twenty-three, when I--when the election had occurred.
Story_ID: 657102
Speaker 1: How did you convince the community to vote for you when you're twenty-two (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) I think there was just a sense of pride.  Here I was a young, black man who grew up in the community, he went off and went to college [at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida] and came back, who wanted to live in the community, who wanted to serve the community, who was willing to step out and run for public office.  And I said I think every mother or father for that matter that had a child around my age in my generation you know felt like I was their child and felt some akin, 'cause remember it, it--segregation had only occurred seven or eight years ago so we all knew each other.  I mean my father [Willie Logan, Sr.] fished with Mrs. Helen Miller's husband, and I went to school with one of her kids.  My mother [Ruther Brown Logan] and she were close.  She used, she was a seamstress so she used to sew for my mother you know what I mean?  So, everybody knew each other.  You know it was a very close knit community.  So, it wasn't like, like you know I'm in Baltimore [Maryland] and I decide I'm going to run for mayor at twenty-two years old and nobody wouldn't know me.  I mean I was in Opa-locka [Florida].  There were three thousand adults, blacks who were registered to vote and we all went to the same church and you know, I mean, so we all knew each other.  And so, I was--
Speaker 1: How many whites were in--
Speaker 2:  	I was their kid.
Speaker 1: --were in town?
Speaker 2:  	I think when I ran it was, the city was about 65 percent black and the voting probably was about 50, 52.
Speaker 1: Oaky.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	We were barely majority registered voters but we were the overwhelming majority citizens.
Speaker 1: Now was the fact that the, your opponent was probably a disliked you know--
Speaker 2:  	By black folks, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	But you know at the time they still were intimidating black folks, you know who got the job, who got the public works, who, who you know I mean whatever.  You know who got the zoning thing, who got the--I mean whatever.  I mean, so there was still a lot of intimidation, there was still a lot of payoff.  And so there were blacks who I think were reluctant to support me publicly who I think in the end went in the voting booth and voted for me.  Otherwise, how in the hell could I have won?  And it was so clear, I mean I won like 99 percent of the black votes on the black side and like 1 percent on the white side and that's an exaggeration.  But I mean it was clear that I was elected because of the black community.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you have any white or Hispanic support?
Speaker 2:  	There really--no, not that I know of.  Not that I know of, none, zero.  Matter of fact I'll never forget during an interview I was invited over to the west side to someone's house and they set me around a room like a horseshoe and they had all these bright lights on me, more so than this set up here.  I mean they were bright so it caused me to sweat.  And it was like an interrogation, you know it was an intimidation.  And I mean and the room was very crowded, they were loud I mean, and I was the only black there.  And it was, it was almost scary.  And--other than the sense that I didn't have enough sense to be scary at that time or enough experience to be scary-- scared.
Story_ID: 657103
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, when you found out you won, what was it like?
Speaker 2:  	You know, (pause) I think there were two things that, I think one is that I had won by twelve votes, but there had to be a recount because it was less than 1 percent or whatever the case may be, and absentee ballots hadn't come in yet.  So, I didn't really know that night of the election that I had really won.  But what I did, what I did realize 'cause it was the top vote become mayor, the second most vote getter become vice mayor.  I knew I had got elected to the commission [Opa-locka City Commission] so I knew I had got elected to public office and it was just a question whether I was serving as mayor or vice mayor.  I wasn't running for mayor, I was just running for a commission seat.  So, in that light there were three seats open.  I was the highest tote--vote getter the night of the election.  And at worst, I would be the second highest vote getter 'cause there weren't that many absentee ballots out.  When I learned that I had won by nine votes when it was all said and done, I, I think there was some euphoria but I can't remember that because what I remember most is getting a call from then mayor, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry who was the mayor of Washington, D.C. saying, "Congratulations.  I hear you're the youngest elected mayor in the country and I would like to invite you to a meeting in the White House, a meeting in Washington with the president and tomorrow, with some mayors to talk about urban policies."  All of a sudden I was in a meeting with Jane Byrne and Bradley [Tom Bradley] and Marion Barry and folks who I may or may not had heard from, they're meeting with the president [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] talking about--
Speaker 1: That's the next day?
Speaker 2:  	It was the next day talking about urban policy and, and, and here I was working on the draft Kennedy movement to oust this man from getting the Democratic nomination and to be reelected president of the United States.  And so, just, just the fact that here I am, got elected as pres- mayor [of Opa-locka, Florida], now in the White House talking about urban policy and I'm working on the opposition of this man's reelection campaign said to me how great America was, that you could have political disagreements and you can be young, that--I mean it, it, it was amazing to me that how close, you know--but I mean realistically I look back on that and say well, what I--you know being in that meeting did that give me any influence?  No, other than the fact that when we had the problem with the refugees I did have a card that I could call to Washington saying, "Look, we got thousands of immigrants walking across our street and the county is doing nothing.  Help us."  You know, but, but I mean realistically no, I had no influence on urban policy at the time, but it, it was--it, it said volumes to me about possibilities, you know.  And, and, and, and, and so I thought, I thought it was very meaningful.  And so, that's what I remember first about getting elected was just that, that opportunity.  I had never been to Washington.  I had never to my knowledge ever sat around the table with elected officials, better yet the president and big city mayors talking about urban policy using terms I had no idea what they meant and what they were talking about.  And you know, I mean I, I was way out of my league.  But--
Story_ID: 657104
Speaker 1: But do you think, when you look back at it in retrospect, I'm thinking about the mayor that got in trouble--
Speaker 2:  	Marion.
Speaker 1: --Reverend Young [Willie Young].  Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mayor Tresvant [Albert W. Tresvant, Sr.], Mayor Young, do you think that, that they were any more qualified than you in terms of policy and--?
Speaker 2:  	That they were--?
Speaker 1: Were they any more qualified than you were in terms of public policy and--?
Speaker 2:  	I would say [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry certainly was.
Speaker 1: No, not Marion Barry.
Speaker 2:  	Oh.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the two predecessors, Tresvant and, and Young?  You think they were any more--
Speaker 2:  	I, I, I think, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) sophisticated than you actually when they were elected?
Speaker 2:  	No, not sophisticated but I, but I have to give difference to the fact that they had raised families, that they had lived as adults you know, and I hadn't, that they had lived two, three times the amount of years that I had lived.  And so, I think life experience and wisdom had to give them insight and knowledge that I did not have.  Now, did they have a formal education as well as me?  No.  Were they as articulate as I was at the time?  No.  Was they probably as a quick study as I was? No.  Did they have the energy level I had? No.  Were they open to learning as I was?  No.  But I don't think it made me any better prepared to handle that situation than they did.  From a policy, policy perspective, I think there were two things happened.  I think they, they got into the office not because necessarily the black community--not, not necessarily just because of the black community but I imagine in their cases there were white folks who said, "You know it's time we put a black on the commission [Opa-locka City Commission] and we're choosing you," and then they got the most votes.  And so, consequently they ended up being mayor [of Opa-locka, Florida].  But, but the mayor just was a figurehead and ran their meetings, they had no other power.  And, and, and then I think they were probably more easily influenced and, and also they were older and, and they probably was a lot more accepted in the '70s [1970s] and '60s [1960s] and '50s [1950s] of you know, taking bribes and, and politicians doing things like that, than it is in today's society.  And so, they--and, and, and so I think not only did they thought that it was what people do, but they probably used the influence because they were older, end of life, you know how am I going to help my kids, leave something for them.  How am I going to get (unclear)?  I mean they, they, they just, their financial situation and their ability to, to, to meet the financial needs were probably much less than what I thought mine were at the age of twenty-two, twenty-three years old.  So, not that I'm making excuses, but I just think the circumstances were different in terms of me getting there and then the influence and the environment that they happened to be in when they were there were a lot different than what, in today's time or what my circumstances were when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  That's a good--yeah, that's a good analysis of it.
Story_ID: 657105
Speaker 1: As you said the first week you had the Cuban boatlift re- refugees here.
Speaker 2:  	(Nods head).
Speaker 1: And what, what were some of the other crises?
Speaker 2:  	Well, we had two big crises.  We had the Mariel boatlift which is the two hundred and some odd thousand immigrants that Castro [Fidel Castro] supposedly opened his prisons and, and mental health institutions and other people who were not as productive in Cuban society and put them on boats and sent them to Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: So, they all come here.  Oh, they, they're walking around Opa-locka [Florida]?
Speaker 2:  	Right.  They came into--they came mostly to Key West [Florida] and the Keys [Florida Keys] but the federal government used Opa-locka Airport [Miami Opa-locka Executive Airport, Opa-locka, Florida] as a processing station.  And they had a big blimp hangar there but there was no security.  There was no fence, there's no nothing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so, that--yeah.  When you just explained that now it becomes, now I understand why people are complaining.  Here are people that come here that--you know Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] complained about criminals from other countries coming here.  But here the Cuban boatlift--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, but we welcomed them though, in this case.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	And we, we didn't--I mean we welcomed them, literally.  And we did no screening.  Matter of fact we passed a law that said, wet foot, dry foot so, if you put your foot on here we didn't care what your damn background was.  If you're from Cuba, you're welcome.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	And, and so I mean it's--don't get me--
Speaker 1: Well what other--
Speaker 2:  	Don't get me started on international policy as it relates to how we treated immigrants and various immigrants in our society.  But this is one case where we weren't concerned about crime or we weren't concerned about terrorism or we weren't concerned about the cost of, of these immigrants in society.  We were mostly concerned about these folks having an opportunity to have a life and a new life in our country.
Story_ID: 657106
Speaker 1: When you called the White House or, or called the federal government, you were concerned about--?
Speaker 2:  	About security.  And they eventually built a fence, they eventually put some security.  But by the time, the cat had been out the bag and anybody who really wanted to be in Opa-locka [Florida] was already here.  And you saw overnight the transition of going from majority, maybe half black, half white to almost 30, 40, 50 percent Hispanic, overnight.  And it just--now, I would say it's probably 60, 70 percent Hispanic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But that happened overnight.
Speaker 1: Could they vote right away?
Speaker 2:  	No.  They weren't citizens.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	But, Cubans had a path to citizenship that other folks don't.  I would say you had more Cuban American Spanish voters in Opa-locka in the late '80s [1980s] than you probably have--well that, that may be an exaggeration.  But, but you may have Hispanic voters now because a lot of Hispanic voters now--well no, they're Dominican so I guess they get their rights pretty quickly.  But we rec- recognize that there's a huge drop off because Hispanic population and Hispanic voters and we assume that a lot of it has to do with citizenship.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right.  All right.  So, it--
Speaker 2:  	The path is not as easy if you're--
Speaker 1: So, they didn't affect the, the, the polic- politics as much--
Speaker 2:  	No, they had one is--the, the--we--when, when I, right after I was elected we had, when I was elected we had a Hispanic--right after I was elected we had a Hispanic elected, a Cuban American and he served for about two terms, maybe four or eight years.  But we have not had another Hispanic until 2012, and he was Dominican, he won.  But he lost in 2016.  Not because he probably couldn't have gotten elected with some Hispanic votes and some black votes but he got into trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	Or at least accused.  No, he pleaded guilty so he got into trouble.
Story_ID: 657107
Speaker 1: Nineteen--ei- eighty [1980], you're the youngest black mayor in the--the youngest mayor in the country, you know, in the history of the country.  And so, did the magazines cover, did Ebony and Jet and that sort of thing cover it?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.  No, there's, there's a room full of you know coverage over the decades, in particularly the first couple of years.  I mean any black, Jet, Ebony, you know all the black publications, a lot of black newspapers across the country covered it by election or some other activity that related.  And we're the first city to create a Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] holiday, legal holiday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And so we did a couple of things that got some attention nationally.  But yeah, there was lots of coverage by black institutions.
Story_ID: 657108
Speaker 1: What was your agenda as mayor [of Opa-locka, Florida] when you start off?  I mean--
Speaker 2:  	Well I, I, I think there were, there were a couple of things that, that I was interested in.  One, one is, when I first was elected the, the first action of the city commission [Opa-locka City Commission] was to defund the mayor's office.  So, they took away my office, the mayor's budget, everything.  So, I had no place to work, no secretary, no nothing.  That's the first action they took.
Speaker 1: 'Cause the city now--explain the composition of the city council?
Speaker 2:  	At the time it was four whites.
Speaker 1: Four whites--all, all?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just, just four white men?
Speaker 2:  	Well, there was one white woman.  I think she had--I think it was one white woman or four white men and--either three white men and a woman or four white men and me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, but they're all white?
Speaker 2:  	Eventually a woman came and eventually a Hispanic came.  But they were all white at the beginning.
