Story_ID: 223975
Speaker 1: Now if you will, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert B.] Hill, let's talk a little bit about your mother starting with her name and where she was born and where she grew up.
Speaker 2: My mother is Marie Brown at that time she's Marie Brown Hill.  She was born in Florence, South Carolina.  Actually her mother [Mary Swinton] was in kind of Williamsburg County [South Carolina] which is--they call it Kingstree [South Carolina] of South Carolina--but she was born in the city in Florence.  So she grew up actually in the city as opposed to a rural area where everyone else grew up. She--and there were other relatives who moved--who lived around her.  It was interesting they lived with other--close to other--her cousins and so she grew up in Florence and went to school and pretty much she stayed in Florence until--in the '30s [1930s] and she came to--got married and came to Brooklyn, New York [New York].  She followed her older sister who had already been to New York earlier.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like growing up in Florence?
Speaker 2: It was--yeah she did.  It was--and of course her mother, she always talked about her mother in terms of being a kind of chore woman who was cleaning the clothes of the white families but she kind of enjoyed a lot in terms of the--in the urban area--a lot of her other relatives were in Kingstree, South Carolina which is rural and so she did go back and forth even while growing up because our other aunts--her aunts were there as well.  So she was able to contrast the urban with the rural.  But she kind of enjoyed--she was more of a city person and she liked it and in terms of again they were a close-knit family who lived next to each other so they gave each other--our extended family.  She had an extended family both in Florence and in Kingstree, so they gave support, and she just enjoyed herself very much.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about, just like what it was like when she went to the farm or to the rural area, that kind of thing?  Did she ever share any particular stories?
Speaker 2: Well it was more--in the rural area we had the cotton and there they really had much more arduous work there, you know, and 'cause a number of them were sharecroppers and so--there she was really talking more about the kind of work that they were participating in and sometimes she would also participate in with them particularly tobacco and cotton in terms of picking which was very difficult.  I--in fact, she took me down when we were younger to the rural area and I got a taste of that cotton which you get sticky, and your hands and stuff like that, it's difficult work, too.  But it was interesting--it was a contrast again with the urban and the rural.  But she mostly talked about--and also the support, the extended family support that she got down--a lot in the rural areas because we had many more of our relatives there.  And, you know, people--so it was both places, but she mostly talked about it in terms of some of the work type of situations that they had to indulge in--
Story_ID: 223976
Speaker 1: What kind of work did your mother [Marie Brown Hill] do when she moved to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: She was a domestic, she was a domestic.  She--so she did clean houses for--she had several families--white families.  She became though--she also worked in a--she was very good at sewing.  She worked in a sewing machine factory which was right--we're in Brooklyn [New York, New York]--right behind our house interestingly.  So she did that for a number of years, was in the sewing machine, and then she became a chore woman in the courts--in the Brooklyn court system cleaning in the government.  So she really kind of got--ended up getting her pension--her state pension as a result of that.  But she ended--that was her last job as more of a chore woman for the courts.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: A very aggressive individual.  She was born in May, she calls herself Taurus the Bull and she is Taurus the Bull.  It was interesting, she worked in white people's houses so she kind of wanted to emulate how you--things that you can have and so she just kind of pressed on us to study and to do things.  And she was a very aggressive individual, was and is.  She wanted to get ahead, she bought houses, and she bought property in Brooklyn.  She bought a lot of property in South Carolina 'til today.  So she really was one who put a lot of emphasis on achievement and getting--trying to get ahead even though she was just--she only went to the eighth grade for her schooling.
Story_ID: 223977
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father starting with his name and where he was born and how he grew up.
Speaker 2: He's Curtis Hill, he was born in St. George, South Carolina which is pretty close, not too far from Charleston, South Carolina.  It was interesting--he was--his family also lived in Florence [South Carolina] and that's how he and my mother [Marie Brown Hill] met.  They didn't live too far apart from each other.  So they met when they were very young, they were kids and my father played with my uncle, you know, 'cause they were pretty much the same age and so--and they did things a lot.  So she knew him for a very long time.  Kind of interesting. And that--but he was--his area was a cook; he was a cook that was his primary avocation was a cook.  He actually ended up in Brooklyn [New York, New York], he cooked at a very fancy restaurant called Lundy's [Restaurant; Lundy Brothers Restaurant, New York, New York] at that time; it still exists today in Brooklyn, it's a very famous restaurant.  So yeah he did that and he was more mild-mannered, I'd say, he was more mild-mannered, he wasn't as aggressive as my mother was.  Very nice and, you know, he was very smart.  He graduated high school and he was very good in math and so he kind of tutored me a little bit, a lot.  He helped me with my homework and, you know--but he was nice, he just was a nice person and he went to work, did his thing, of course he died in 1989.
Speaker 1: Did he ever teach you how to cook?
Speaker 2: No, my mother taught a little bit.  It's interesting, no, not my father but my mother showed me little tricks, little things to cook.  I'm kind of getting into it more and more now, some of the things.
Speaker 1: And did your father ever cook, you know, really neat and different things for the family?
Speaker 2: He did cook, actually you're right he, of course he was a cook so he actually cooked much better than my mother and so he did--you know did a lot of different kind of dishes for us which was quite good, you know we enjoyed it very much.
Story_ID: 223978
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert B.] Hill you were telling me a little about how far back you all had traced your ancestry.
Speaker 2: Yeah I've become the historian for our family reunion, we meet each year, and so I kind of went to the [U.S.] Census Bureau and went to the archives and I was able to trace back that my great-great-great-grandfather [sic. great-great grandfather, Ned Dukes], anyway, was in Williamsburg County [South Carolina], he was a slave in 1820.  The census showed where he was and then his son, we're kind of descended from one of his sons, Lawrence Dukes.  But he was born in 1820 but recently what I did--there was a firm that had been connected with Howard University [Washington, D.C.] on African ancestry.  If you send in swabs of--from your gums, they will trace your African ancestry and I did that last year.  And males--the male can send in and he can trace his mother's line and his father's line.  Females can only trace their mother's line so if there is a male in your family they can trace both sides.  So I submitted that and they did say that on my mother's [Marie Brown Hill] side we're from Sierra Leone, the Mende people.  On my father's side [Curtis Hill] it's the Yoruba in Nigeria.  So we could go back to Africa which is a really good route with the DNA now in terms of that match.  So yes on my mother's it's the Sierra Leone and my father's it's Nigeria.  Most of my--most of my connections have been on my mother's side stretching through our families--
Story_ID: 223979
Speaker 1: Do you know much about, or were you ever told any stories about your relative who you know was in fact a slave?
Speaker 2: No, not about him but about his son.  Let me just say the one who did--was a slave somehow I'm going to do some research on him.  Apparently his name was Ned Dukes, he was born in 1820 but somehow he--I don't know how he got property, he got a lot of land and he divided his land and it was oh, twenty-two acres each between his two sons [Lawrence Dukes and Centrie Dukes].  So on my mother's [Marie Brown Hill] side one of his sons is Lawrence Dukes, they had twenty-two acres and they ended up dividing it among his twelve children, which was my mother.  So one of the things I wanted to try to find out is how he acquired so much land coming out of slavery and then he was able to pass that on to both of his sons.  But I hear much more about his son which is who we call Lawrence Dukes because some of the relatives are more closer to him.  I hear a lot of stories about him.  He was very stern, and he put--he was a businessman and he just--he put emphasis on business and crops and he had twelve children.  He had eight daughters and four sons.
Speaker 1: And this was your grandfather? Your pat--
Speaker 2: This was my great-grandfather--
Speaker 1: Your mother's grandfather.
Speaker 2: That's right, my mother's grandfather. That's right.
Speaker 1: Now what else can you tell us about him?
Speaker 2: Well we had a lot--he just seemed like he just was, again, an aggressive individual who just put--he seemed like he had good relationship with the white people.  They didn't--they respected him, he didn't have trouble with them but he just was very stern, let me just say that.  One of the stories is that one of his sons--he didn't--the son didn't feel that he paid him for some of what his work was so he stole a chicken or whatever the thing was.  He said if he caught that son--the son actually had to leave from Williamsburg, South Carolina and go to Sumter [Charleston, South Carolina].  He went to--he changed his name so that son had to change his name so that his father couldn't find him and so--although the other relatives could eventually be able to--but to me that showed what his demeanor was.  This was his own son and it was but a chicken or whatever he was taking but he was a taskmaster.  So the son changed his name and stayed connected with the other relatives and then he left and his will he left, he divided his estate to his twelve children equally.  I mean, I think that was impressive the map and my mother, you know, being one of the--from her mother got the property and a lot of it passed on--a lot of it has been sold.  My mother was one of the few who held onto her southern land, she refuses to give it up; in fact she's bought more land.  But he was--I think she's in his spirit (laughter)--her grandfather's spirit.  And--but he just was, he was a businessman to me, you know, he was right in the rural areas but he had so much property and he just was determined to succeed.
Story_ID: 223980
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your grandparents starting with your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yeah my maternal--the only--when I say grandparents I can only know about the mother--my mother's [Marie Brown Hill] mother, my--and she was the one--she was born of course in Williamsburg Country [South Carolina] and she moved to Florence [South Carolina] and that's when her children--all of her four children were born, they were born in Florence.  She was a mild-mannered lady, she was very quiet.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mary Swinton.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Swinton?
Speaker 2: S-W-I-N-T-O-N, Mary Dukes Swinton 'cause all of them were Dukes, all of that descendant was from the Dukes side so she was Mary Dukes Swinton.  And--she was very quiet some of my other aunts who were around--you know, again I think we kind of split, we've got these aggressive ones and mild mannered.  They've told me that the people who are aggressive are really in the Dukes tradition--that great-grandfather [Lawrence Dukes] tradition.  The others are mild-mannered, she was one of the mild-mannered ones.  So she was quiet--she was a very quiet person, very nice but again in Florence she lived with some other--her other sisters actually.  One who lived very close with her and so she was able to--they supported each other.  In fact, that's why they babysit for each other while each of them maybe worked or did some other thing.  So they did have some of that support of each other.  She really was just a very quiet person, you know, and kind of just determined to try and make a better life for her children and to at least provide a way for them.
Speaker 1: Did you have the opportunity to spend a lot of time with her growing up?
Speaker 2: No I never because she died before I was born--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She died in 1935, yeah, so I never saw her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were just pictures and people were talking--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --a lot about her.
Story_ID: 223981
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Again I only know my grandmother [Lizzie Hill]--my paternal grandmother.  I think the father had died.  Her husband had died so--before I was born again but we did know her very well.  She was in Florence [South Carolina] so when we would--my mother [Marie Brown Hill] was determined that we would always go south.  Our vacations were always going from New York [New York] to the South so most of our time we spent with her.  We spent time with her, in fact we lived in her house--my paternal grandmother's house in Florence and then we would spend during that same trip, we would go down to rural areas.  She was determined we were not going to neglect our relatives in the rural areas.  So we stayed some time with them in the rural area but most of our time was in the city in Florence.  She was a very--she was kind of assertive herself, my paternal grandmother, very nice.  She liked taking in children. She informally adopted--she took in--she had her kids but she took in other kids around, in fact one of the stories was she wanted to take my oldest son--I mean not my oldest--my oldest brother [Curtis Hill, Jr.].  My mother let--because she was young at the time so she had just moved to New York so she was letting my oldest son--her son stay with my grandmother and then when she got her job she said, alright I'm going to get ready for my son to come.  She said, "No, no," she fought her on that; she wanted to keep my brother but my mother, you know, took them but she was a very loving person.
Story_ID: 223982
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess when you say my earliest somehow I remember again, it was, we lived in Brooklyn [New York, New York], it was called kind of Pacific Street was the street which was next to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn.  My earliest that I can kind of remember is the contact I had with my aunt really in one sense because she didn't live too far from us and she loved for us to stay in her house.  She was a kind of a dancer, she--we had all this music, she had all kinds of records and stuff like that and she would let us stay in her house.  I guess I just remember that music, I remember dancing and the contact we had with her and then of course, with my brothers and sisters, you know, let me say with my brothers and sisters, I'm the second (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Give us your siblings' names--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let me give you my siblings.  My oldest brother is Curtis Hill, he was born in 1936 two years before me.  Me--was the second in 1938.  My sister is Marilyn [Hill] Evans who was born a year after me--1939. And my youngest brother Dexter Hill was born in 1943, he's five years younger than I am so it was us four children although the three oldest my youngest years we were kind of close in age so a lot of my early memories are between the three of us and then he came along a little later.  So--and I was pretty close with my older brother and my sister.  I guess you say what is my memory, I'm stealing her dolls, I'm breaking her dolls and little things between--actually it was more between me and her.  I kind of got along pretty much with my older brother since he was bigger and stronger, we never--I never kind of tussled with him, I guess I picked on my sister more. I kind of remember a lot of those--we did go out. The other thing that I do remember is my aunt, I go back to my aunt she took us on trips.  She took us on parks, took us everywhere.  The Bronx [New York, New York], she loved taking photographs that's one of the things all of her photographs.  She took us on trips and then sometime we would go with our cousins who didn't live--who were our similar ages.  And we went to parks, we went to a lot of different places and that's one of the things that I remember very much is going out--a lot of different outings, and just having a good time, having a good time.
Story_ID: 223983
Speaker 1: Tell us--what was a typical day like in your house?  What was a typical day like for you?  You'd wake up in the morning and--
Speaker 2: You've got to deal with the age though.  I mean what I really--I guess when I was younger let me just say this, I'd go to school--when you say typical day, I mean you go to school and I guess what I most remember is what we call junior high school, I remember that much more.
Speaker 1: Well do you remember like during the very early elementary school years [at P.S. 42, New York, New York] like you'd wake up in the morning, eat your breakfast, go to school--
Speaker 2: Yes in the elementary school I would eat the breakfast, I'm trying to think of what we'd do during the week.  Go to school; let me say that I was kind of more the studious one in the household.  I mean, so we would come back and we might play and stuff like that but I did do my homework, I liked it more so I would spend more time on my homework or to the library also going to the library.  I went to the library and playing out in the street.  Again, in Brooklyn [New York, New York] you had to play on the street and actually it was kind of interesting, the house that we lived in became a convening place.  For some reason they liked to convene where we lived.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So your house was kind of like the convening place?
Speaker 1: Yes and it was kind of interesting see Brooklyn has brownstones, it's not like Harlem [New York, New York] where you have all these high tenements so you really lived in houses that you almost--people almost thought you owned but you actually rented.  The house that we were in actually we rented, it was two stories but it had a big stoop and we had one of the few stoops so everybody would like to convene on our stoop.  We played in the streets, ball and skully and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What's skully?
Speaker 1: Skully is--you--again you have to talk about in New York, you draw a chalk, you make a circle and then you divide them into pies and then you take the top of a soda bottle and turn it upside down and you are supposed to hit it to land in one of those slices of the pie and the one who could do it most consistently wins.  That was a very popular game that we played.  Of course stickball, everybody played stickball and also we developed our own scooters from bicycles.  We'd put the wheels of bicycles onto the box into a crate box and you put handles on it and you scootered, you had your own scooter and so we did a lot of that.
Story_ID: 223984
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe your block [in Brooklyn, New York, New York] for us?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  The block that I grew up on was a very interesting block.  It was--you didn't have a lot of families on our block, you had more commercial businesses, in fact the area we were in was an automobile repair and stuff so our block was taken up mostly with these auto places, dealers, too.  Some of them--one of them was a Cadillac place which was--rich people would come by to get their cars.  But our block was a--half of the block was taken up with these commercial things so you had a small, knit group of people who lived there, kind of stuck together; it was a very interesting block.  I say that because we've had a forty year reunion of people who lived on that block--they spread all over, we came back forty years later and we stay in contact with a number of those people, we developed very close relationship.  So you had the big families, it was working class--everything was working class because everybody--and most of the women--the mothers worked for--you know, they were housekeepers, domestics most of them or sewing machine type of operators and the men were delivery or whatever, they were all working class individuals.  I was either developed good close friendships so that in school, you're talking about even elementary school yes except it was interesting when we moved on the block I do have to transition--the demographic transition, it was white on that block.  This was in the late '40s [1940s] that we moved well the mid-'40s [1940s] that we moved to that block and then quickly the whites moved out and the blacks moved in.  So when I first got there, we had a lot of white neighbors and then it became black.  It was interesting in my elementary school [P.S. 42, New York, New York], yet in my elementary school, most of my classmates were white in elementary school.  I was very close to a lot of--they were Italian, most of them were Italian, it was a Italian neighborhood and of course as I moved--got older the school became more black and especially from junior high school but we were at the time of kind of transition at least into that area, it was a predominantly white area, again working class whites.  There were no middle class whites, they were working class.  So that--the composition was changing but we were very close and we did a lot of things together and we remain as I said kind of a close knit--people on that block remained very close.
Speaker 1: And were things really busy during the day and then they kind of settle down at night because of the commercial aspect of the block?
Speaker 2: Yes because of the commercial it did settle down more but actually that meant later on that they weren't there which means, all the families were there so you really were able to connect more--you know it was also after school so you were able to connect more with each other.
Story_ID: 223985
Speaker 1: --What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: P.S. 42 [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Do you remember some of your teachers from there?
Speaker 2: My mother [Marie Brown Hill]--it was interesting yes I do remember--it was a black teacher although again the school was actually predominantly white.  Ms. Finley [ph.] well no let me get those two teachers.  Ms. Finley, I think was the youngest--was when I was younger, she could have been like third or fourth grade, she was white Ms. Finley and then Ms. Schwartz [ph.] was black and she--both of them I was very close to.
Story_ID: 223986
Speaker 1: So do you have any--do you remember Mrs. Finley [ph.] or Mrs. Schwartz [ph.], any stories about them [from P.S. 42, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: All right, let me get it straight; let me get the ethnicity straight.  Schwartz is white--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Ms. Finley is black.
Speaker 1: I was wondering about that.
Speaker 2: Yes, Ms. Schwartz was white, Ms. Finley is black.  It seemed like Ms. Schwartz is close like either third grade.  My mother [Marie Brown Hill], again when you say what I remember, it seems and those are the only two that I remember in elementary school but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you this what type of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was more of a studious student.  I was more studious than my other friends they played more than I did and I guess I kind of like books and what could have happened, I don't know but my mother when we were growing up, I didn't--she always had books around and I liked to read that's right.  In fact, it was interesting she tells a story that I was in the hospital; I think it was whooping cough and she says, oh--well and how old was I, maybe five--but he's got to have his newspapers, he's got to read his newspapers so you have to provide him with his newspapers and so the hospital provided me with newspapers.
Speaker 1: So you read newspapers at age of five?
Speaker 2: Yes what it was though, it was a comic strips but you do have the little bubbles there, I don't know if I made out what was happening but--and she also gave me a lot.  I didn't go to kindergarten because my sister [Marilyn Hill Evans] was too young so she always says she kind of cheated me but she gave me extra things.  So I went to the first grade.  So--by the first grade I could read a whole lot, she gave me a lot of things.  She looked like she was trying to make up for the fact that I didn't go to kindergarten.  So she gave me a lot--she knew I liked reading so I was ahead of a lot of the other kids.  So I think that kind of--you know, the teacher Ms. Schwartz I think that was more like third grade and as I said I think Ms. Finley was more like the fifth grade.  Ms. Schwartz--she just kind of took to me and again she probably took to me, I guess at that point there weren't that many blacks in that school, we were--the numbers were lower so I think she kind of was impressed with this little black student that seemed like he was trying to study and so she just kind of--she encouraged me and gave me little assignments to do.  I enjoyed that and I just remember her name, I remember her name and I remember the kind of interactions that I had with her.  Ms. Finley was the first black teacher that I had and again that was about the fifth grade.  She again really took me under her wing.  She would give me assignments; she would do little things and gave me different little assignments to do and things like that, you know, for her.  And so, again I think both of them were struck that you know you had this student, this person who looked like he tried to behave, and--but they were very both encouraging and stimulating, both of them encouraging and stimulating--
Story_ID: 223987
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert B.] Hill let's go back for a second, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up [in Brooklyn, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting, well what sights would be in the streets, ball, stickball.  I mean--everything in New York [New York] you were out in the streets so I mean the sights were people riding bicycles, I mean those were my sights that I knew growing up.  Playing games, the girls playing Double Dutch and those were the sights that I saw most.  Interestingly smells were kind of interesting because when I say smells, I said I grew up very close to an Italian neighborhood, well they used to have very frequent Italian festivals and so that you ate--that's the smells that I remember much more.  You had all those kinds of knishes, all the foods and stuff and so that was really more of the smell that I recall going to those festivals and they even had little rides.  You could go on rides and stuff like that.  So the sights were whatever it was in the street, playing in the streets those were the sights that were more frequent to me.
Speaker 1: And what sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter) New York I'll tell you what sounds, horns, noise.  They say New York is a place that doesn't sleep--it doesn't sleep.  In fact you get worried if you're from New York you get worried when you have silence.  You--yes it's always noise; it's always noise, sirens, something, and that's endless.  That's why it was interesting when I would go south, I'd get a little concerned it's so quiet you just hear crickets and you don't hear these sounds that I heard in New York--
Story_ID: 223988
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your church and what was those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Yes, I don't know how I left those out.  My mother [Marie Brown Hill] was very religious. Called Antioch Baptist Church [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay Antioch Baptist Church?
Speaker 1: Yes Antioch Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: What were your experiences like there?
Speaker 1: It was wonderful, let me say Antioch--my mother was in the choir so when she came to New York [New York] she got attached to the church before we were born so she was in the choir.  So, of course, when we were born we would go to the same church that she went to.  It had a very dynamic old minister who was--[Reverend] Moses [Prophet] Paylor his name was.  Well he lived up to ninety-five years old.  He was a tall, kind of strong person.  It was interesting in church; of course we were in church so of course in churches you become part of everything in other words the clubs.  From the Sunday school to the ushers to the--so, you know growing--I never was in the choir 'cause I couldn't sing so I never went out for that, my sister [Marilyn Hill Evans] did.  That was an experience--the church.  First of all it was a church that people expressed themselves so that there would be shouting.  And, you know, it was an emotional church, of course, as kids you're looking around at these people jumping around so that's what always strikes you there the singing and the shouting.  It was actually--let me say when she grew up it was in what we call downtown Brooklyn [New York, New York], it was Brooklyn Bridge and most blacks they kind of left from Manhattan [New York, New York] but they grew--the Brooklyn community started at the end of Brooklyn Bridge so a lot of our churches started down what we call downtown Brooklyn.  Eventually they begin to move to the middle part of Brooklyn which we called Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Initially they weren't any in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bedford-Stuyvesant used to be white but then most of them moved from downtown so our church moved from downtown to right in the middle of the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant, in fact, it was between Stuyvesant [Avenue] and Lewis [Avenue], so couldn't even get any closer to Stuyvesant.
Story_ID: 223989
Speaker 1: Let me just say about this, this minister [Reverend Moses Prophet Paylor at Antioch Baptist Church, New York, New York], I don't know it must have been about, seemed like twenty some odd miles, all the church members walked.  Not all of them, but he walked from downtown Brooklyn [New York, New York] all the way to this new location.  It was a big parade and I said that this man is something, he walked the whole way.  I don't know what I did, I walked part of the way, but I don't believe I walked that whole way.  So it was a beautiful edifice, in fact, it was an edifice that the Rockefeller family had given stain glass windows, you know it was white previously and became black but it was in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York, New York].  But the church was very good and now that's where I guess I got more of my aspirations because in Sunday school you had to do things, they gave you responsibilities.  The other thing that I think was the main thing with the church was that they'd give you an opportunity to speak, Mother's Day whatever those holidays you would do recitations and so then you got to learn how to speak before audiences.  A lot of people were afraid to speak before audiences but I had a lot of practice.  You know, you spoke when you were young, I was very young so I liked that so I was comfortable speaking before an audience and also they encouraged you--they gave you a little money for scholarships to help you go into college.  They emphasized education a lot so that's really where I think my real aspirations came from the church it was stimulated more through the church.  And so I became--you know I grew up in the church and was very active, head of the youth group and everything else in the church, it really became a major part of--almost 'til I--when I entered college because what happened was that minister died and we got a new minister [Reverend George Lawrence] who was one of the key lieutenants of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  He was a northern representative for Martin Luther King.  So when Dr. King would come north, he would always go to our church so we saw Dr. King--we saw he and his wife [Coretta Scott King], we would just see them just every time.
Story_ID: 223990
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Oh those were fantastic experiences, fantastic--[Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  He was like his brother [Alfred Daniel Williams King; A. D. King], they were similar age and also the other person was [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Wyatt Tee Walker.  Wyatt Tee Walker was the head of--was one of the first lieutenants of Martin Luther King and he Wyatt Tee Walker and my minister [Reverend George Lawrence] really grew up in New Jersey, they were like brothers, they really grew up like brothers.  So Wyatt Walker would always come to our church [Antioch Baptist Church, New York, New York] and I think it was because Wyatt Walker was heading with King, he connected my minister with Dr. King.  So--Dr. King, one time you might recall he was stabbed.  He was signing his book ['Strive Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story,' Martin Luther King, Jr.] in Harlem [New York, New York] and he was stabbed by this crazed woman [Izola Curry]--the knife was in him--well he recuperated in Brooklyn [New York, New York] and as a result of that he was in Brooklyn-- Coretta [Scott] King--and he would come by our church while he was recuperating.  So we saw them an awful lot and we raised money--this minister would raise money for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  I was very much attached to the church, it was a very activist church and that's what really stimulated me.
Speaker 1: Did Dr. King ever speak when he came to your church or was he there as a member of the congregation?
Speaker 2: When he usually came he did speak, he would--yeah, when he came most times he would also speak, his wife would be in the audience but he would speak.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how you would feel listening to him speak?
Speaker 2: He's everything that everybody says.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So he would speak.  Do you remember how that would make you feel when you heard him speak, was it invigorating and exciting?
Speaker 1: It was--he was a kind of mild-mannered person, Dr. King.  I mean he was strong from the pulpit but he was very sociable.  Also my minister Reverend George Lawrence let me get that name in Reverend George Lawrence was my minister and he and King--I would hear them--I worked with the church like in the evening, I did a lot of stuff.  So he would call him on the phone and they would be laughing, he would tell a joke, Dr. King told a lot of jokes.  But he was mild-mannered but of course when he spoke he spoke from a very serious tone but he was always uplifting, he was always trying to inspire people.  And in one sense, we saw him so often, he was almost like part of our family so we really didn't--you kind of took some of that for granted but you knew he was Dr. King and he, you know, just was very inspiring.  You know he would write his speeches but it didn't look like he ever read 'em to me.  I mean, he looked at you most of the time, he had a speech but he looked--you didn't see him look down at his papers.
Story_ID: 223991
Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Now it's interesting my junior high school, I guess that's the other place that stimulated my achievement.  My junior high school was called P.S. 9 [Teunis G. Bergen School, New York, New York].  It was located though, very interestingly, it was located in Brooklyn [New York, New York] there is an avenue called Grand Army Plaza where the botanical gardens [Brooklyn Botanic Garden, New York, New York], the Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] all of these edifices, very historic edifices are there.  The Grand Army Plaza has the statue which was copied after the Champs-Elysees in--the Arch of Triumph [Arc de Triomphe] in Paris, France.  So very wealthy people--this school is in a very wealthy area of Brooklyn and they kind of recommended me to go there because I was high achievement so very few blacks were in that school.  It wasn't really a distance from me but it was a further distance for most of us.  So in that school you really--I mean, I was in class with millionaire kids, I didn't kind of realize that, but I knew they had money.  So when you got in that school--I only went there for my seventh, eighth and ninth grade, no seventh and eighth, it was just two grades it was seventh and eighth I went there.  That school was very achievement oriented.  They expected you to go to--now the high schools that--New York [New York] had some of the greatest--it was called Stuyvesant High School [New York, New York], Brooklyn Tech [Brooklyn Technical High School, New York, New York] and [The] Bronx High School of Science [New York, New York], those--you'd take competitive exams to go there.  So they expected almost all of their graduates to go into one of those three schools usually--for engineers, sciences--in the sciences.  So I went there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your experiences there.  Did you ever feel like you were out of place there or did you fit in?
Speaker 2: It's interesting, it's interesting. And I have to go back to my mother [Marie Brown Hill] on that one 'cause she kind of--she knew what was happening and so she said don't feel that they're any better than you, just do your study.  She kind of prepared me not to think inferior and really in a sense in my elementary school [P.S. 42, New York, New York] that helped me a lot, too, because I was with white kids there.  Sometimes when blacks are only with blacks and so they think that these whites are smarter but in my elementary school I was one of the smartest kids, I was smarter than most of those white kids.
Speaker 1: But sometimes the difference between being with working class whites and then being with affluent whites--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --did you ever notice a difference, or were you--
Speaker 2: Not--I only knew it may be slightly in the money--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, sure.
Speaker 2: --but that was--because I also--you're right, you're right.
Story_ID: 223992
Speaker 1: So you were talking a little bit about what it was like going to this junior high school [P.S. 9, Teunis G. Bergen School, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--see the difference--yeah you're right I was with working class--let me just say this I didn't make that distinction between class at that time I didn't make that distinction, I knew they were white and so I--the class thing didn't quite hit me until afterwards that I realized where I was.  It really wasn't--it's just that at this other school they had more achievement so I really didn't pick up so much on the class difference.  So to me it was more that I could achieve with whites and I could achieve with whites and so--and they were friendly, the kids were friendly.  You know, I had good relations with them so it wasn't that and the teachers said do what you can do.  The only distinction, though, came when we took the test, though, to go in these schools.  It was interesting, very interesting this should show you where my background was, I was in this school this junior high school and they said oh you're going to [The] Bronx High School of Science [New York, New York] and Stuyvesant [High School, New York, New York] and I said I never heard of those schools, I said, I don't know those schools--they were top in the nation and I said no I'm not going to apply to them.  I said I'm going to apply to Brooklyn Tech [Brooklyn Technical High School, New York, New York], I've heard of Brooklyn Tech but I'm not going to apply--I don't know what those schools are but all these other ones had known what those schools were.  Again, I didn't know really until later what the significance was.
Story_ID: 223993
Speaker 1: Tell me a little about what type of young man you were becoming around this time. The junior high school  years [at P.S. 9, Teunis G. Bergen School, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Well I mean there I think I really was--I was kind of, you know--again I told you I was studious so I really--you know, my friends tended to be more studious.  Like I related 'cause I'm back in my neighborhood, I still live in my neighborhood.  More of my friends were not as studious although there were a few of them who were--a few of them were.  So I guess I began to develop a close relationship with some of the more studious kids because you'd homework and things together so it was that.  The other thing in junior high school which I can't live out is sports.  In my recreation in the junior high school they had a recreation area--you could play pool or you could play table tennis well then I decided--I couldn't get to the pool table so I played table tennis and this is very interesting because--so I was a very good table tennis player.  So after school I played table tennis, I would play table tennis endlessly.  They had a tournament in our school, table tennis they had for boys and girls and I won the table tennis tournament for boys but they had Jackie Robinson to come to give me my trophy.  So Jackie Robinson, Jackie Robinson--he gave both of us our trophies.  Jackie Robinson came 'cause he lived in Brooklyn [New York, New York] in the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers], Jackie Robinson came and my uncle they thought he was a photographer from the newspapers and he took my picture, me and Jackie Robinson and Jackie Robinson gave me this trophy.  And so that is an unforgettable moment but it was interesting for them to take this picture somehow we had to stand at each other and look at each other's eye for a long time.  Of course, he has such a gracious smile, but I'm saying when are they going to take this picture and he was shaking my hand, we took this picture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Were just in awe?
Speaker 2: I was kind of in awe 'cause it was Jackie Robinson everybody knew Jackie Robinson that he would take his time and everybody would talk about him and this school wasn't all that far from Ebbets Field [New York, New York] either.  But since he lived in Brooklyn and stuff like that, he was in Brooklyn.  For him to take his time to come to a school but that also showed me later on that school had those connections because they just--and Jackie Robinson showed up.  And so that was a very, very awe experiencing, you know, moment in terms of that.
Story_ID: 223994
Speaker 1: Who was influencing you at this particular point in your life?
Speaker 2: My mother [Marie Brown Hill] always kind of behind the scenes, she would push, push.  But junior high school [P.S. 9, Teunis G. Bergen School, New York, New York], my minister [Reverend] George Lawrence, George Lawrence was a real motivator, my minister was the motivator and my other-- like my uncles and stuff, they would reinforce the learning thing, in fact one of my uncles, he used to give me money if I get A's.  He'd say if you get A's I will give you more money so again he was trying to get me to keep getting good grades and stuff like that.  But I would think--I would say my minister probably had the greatest influence on me.
Speaker 1: And your parents divorced when you were a young boy?
Speaker 2: Separated they never actually divorced.  They separated but we were kind of old though at the time.  They separated, you know, I might have been what, fifteen years old so pretty much we grew up with him [Hill's father, Curtis Hill], I grew up with him I guess my younger brother [Dexter Hill] did not as much but, you know, most of us grew up with him in the household.  So it was separate, he lived in Brooklyn [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 223995
Speaker 1: Tell me who some of your friends were during junior high school [P.S. 9, Teunis G. Bergen School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: It's kind of hard, you know, it's kind of hard when you say during junior high school because you know I had friends but I really don't remember--yes I had some friends and they were again looking back they were wealthy.
Speaker 1: It's fine if you don't remember their names, that's fine.
Speaker 2: But their parents--again I really didn't quite realize it then, you know I mean how really wealthy they were but they were nice and they were also encouraging me. You know, we would study together.  I don't remember their names and such.  See the people who I still remember are in the streets that lived on my block.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: I had a very close friend, he didn't live on my block he lived on the next block from me and we went to school, he was very smart.  He was one of my best friends--Cleveland, his name was Cleveland Figures [ph.].  But it's kind of interesting, he's an interesting person but he didn't have to study and he got good grades but somehow he got connected with the, again I didn't realize it at the time but the drug culture and you would say this person got in trouble so they got arrested, he would get in trouble.  And, 'cause to me he didn't say drugs, but--trouble. So he ended up getting caught in that and so we kind of lost contact although what happened was I lost contact with him and he eventually died.  He died because of--it could have been an overdose at some point and I'm talking about in the '50s [1950s] now, we're going back--I'm not talking about later this was in the '50s [1950s].  So he was one of my closest friends.  I had some others who also were--who didn't get in trouble who were really--another friend was Robert Lindsey [ph.].  He was from a big family and we were of similar age and we did a lot of things together and he was very--he was kind of studious, too.  He would be supportive and I would so--so really my closer connections were still those who were on the block although I did associate with those in class on class projects.
Story_ID: 223996
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Boys High School [Boys and Girls High School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And how--
Speaker 2: The high school.
Speaker 1: --how did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: It was easy because what happened was again I keep using the word studious.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So Boys High School and how did you make the decision to attend Boys?
Speaker 1: I start with the word studious.  There are different high schools that you went to the more studious ones went to certain high schools.  The ones who were not went to vocational schools they called manuals and a lot of my colleagues from the block did not go to Boys High School.  My brother--older brother [Curtis Hill, Jr.] did go to Boys High School.  So clearly you like the books, you've got to go to Boys High School, he went there so I went there, that's the only reason I went there.
Speaker 2: So why not Brooklyn Tech [Brooklyn Technical High School, New York, New York] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I didn't tell you that, I didn't make it in Brooklyn Tech.  I took the test but I didn't make it in Tech.  I was kind of hurt and I said gosh that was the only one that applied for that you had to take a competitive exam and that was the other reason, you're right because I didn't make it in Tech they said, "Well you didn't make it in Tech, go to Boys High School," you know, and everybody encouraged that.  So Boys was the next level which was not competitive.
Story_ID: 223997
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at Boys [High School; Boys and Girls High School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Wonderful, wonderful. That--the Boys High really put me on my--the plateau.  First there was a Boys High School right in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York, New York], the building still stands today.  It's interesting; in New York [New York] there were schools that went through the demographic transitions.  Boys High was a very aristocratic school, it was formed right in the 1800s so you had Protestant whites when the neighborhood was white.  Again it's in Bedford-Stuyvesant but Bedford-Stuyvesant was white.  So you had Protestant whites but then you had--which transitioned to Jews so the Jews became--very studious and they went to Boys High.  So you had the strong tradition of the Jews now coming in not only being students but professors.  So I'm going there in the '50s [1950s], in fact I started in '52 [1952] so most of my professors were Jewish and a lot of our students who were there were Jewish, so--and at the time I was going, it really was beginning to make its transition from predominantly white to predominantly black.  In other words I would say that the school when I first entered might have been about 40 percent black at the time that I entered.  By the time I left it could have been 50/50 after the four years when I graduated.  So it was making a real transition and so now that's the place where I clearly hung out with the studious students. I hung out--and I also was on every club.
Speaker 1: Tell us--just rattle of a few for us.
Speaker 2: Well the newspaper number one, it was The Reporter newspaper [sic. The Red and Black] and I was one of the editors of the newspaper, I--of course student government, student government.  I was always secretary of things, student government, the math club, there was something else--oh, the history club; I was very good in history.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Boys?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], I graduated in 1956.  Let me say though when we were making the transition for Boys High, Boys High was known when I was going there was known for basketball and track.  They won all the awards for track and basketball.  In fact, I mean really high-level awards across the country, they were very good--
Story_ID: 223998
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert B.] Hill you were talking a little bit about Boys High School [Boys and Girls High School, New York, New York] and it being known for its athletics.
Speaker 2: Actually let me--it was a combination, it was a very good academic school so you went there because you were studious but also at that time people went there who were very good in track and in basketball.  So they were both, they were studious and they also were very good in sports.
Speaker 1: Did you play any sports?
Speaker 2: I used to play--I used to run track, but it was the long cross country track.  I didn't run those short distances, we had people that beat the hundred yards, I never ran short distances but I could run very long distances.  I was more of a cross country type of runner but I really couldn't get on the team because I had to work after school and so I couldn't come for, you know, in terms of those rehearsals.
Speaker 1: What kind of job did you have?
Speaker 2: A hardware store, I worked at a hardware store and again it was kind of interesting, I inherited that job from my brother [Curtis Hill, Jr.].  But it was a hardware store, that's right, this is the proper time because it was during my high school that I really was into that, it was this hardware in Brooklyn [New York, New York] that my brother had.  So he moved on and he said well I'll send my brother, my younger brother so I just took over, Jewish owners--it was very good.  One thing I want to say about my job which was very interesting, the job that I worked for there were two brothers.  One brother was in Brooklyn who was my main one, but he had a brother in Manhattan [New York, New York] and so that they would sometimes send me to do some work for his brother in Manhattan.  Well the brother in Manhattan, his store which was called Triangle, his store was located at the foot of where the World Trade Center [New York, New York] is before the World Trade Center was built.  And I was--so I would see all these derelict 'cause they were letting places go down because they were going to build the World Trade Center.  I said why are these places closing?  It was a fish market there and they said, well they're going to build something.   I didn't know what it was but we were literally--so when I saw the World Trade Center--I went back to the World Trade Center and I saw where my--the store used to be they still didn't destroy that corner.  So anyway so in other words I had experienced both in New York [New York] and I took the subway to Manhattan in the hardware store, in both of those.  So that's what pretty much got me through high school was working in the hardware store.  You learned a lot in the hardware store because you know what these different tools were and you had to explain to people what they were so that's the job that I did most often.
Story_ID: 223999
Speaker 1: And what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well again in Boys High [School; Boys and Girls High School, New York, New York] they pushed you, you know, so I mean there, you know, I was in the clubs I said and I did hang out with some of the very smart students there, black students. Although there were some whites but I was closest with some of the smart blacks.  There you just knew the sky was the limit, I mean for example, my closest friend who became the valedictorian his name was Daniel Frost [ph.], and he went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He got scholarships from every university in the world and so he took Harvard, why not.  I had another friend he got a lot of scholarships as well but we stayed together, we ended up going to [The] City College [of New York (CCNY), New York, New York].  So there at Boys High you knew that you were going to college, you knew that you were going to do something else, you know, I mean so it really had a very achievement focus.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking about college financially?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, see now that was a difference, that's a very good question.  Again I come from a low income family, you're exactly right so what happened was if I'm going to college and I had very good grades, but--and I got admitted at a lot of places but I didn't get the scholarship, the financial support.  In fact, I applied even to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and several--NYU [New York University, New York, New York]; I did a lot of places but I didn't get the financial support.  So I said alright I'm going to have to go to school that I can afford which CCNY, City College of New York.  City College was kind of interesting because it almost mirrored Boys High School.  City College was a very aristocratic school so the elite went to that and then over the years it became Jewish it was almost a thing like with Boys High it became Jewish.  The Jews went to City College and it was kind of open, so that if you had good grades you would get into City College--your grades from the high school--so good students would automatically be eligible to go to City College and I had very good grades.  So I said yes I would go to City College and it's interesting City College as I was going there was all predominantly white when I was there especially they had a day session and an evening session and I was admitted in the day session with very few blacks.  And so you know the day session might have been five percent black, I mean this is City College.  Those City College graduates now couldn't believe that because it's all--it's predominantly black and Hispanic.
Story_ID: 224000
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: Now that's interesting let me say, now I can be very specific on that.  I mentioned I was in the history club, in Boys High [School; Boys and Girls High School, New York, New York] they had a contest--a current events contest and so I went for--I applied--I entered it and at any rate I ended up coming in second in the current event contest they were very popular.  I just was very good in history so I wanted to be a history professor, put that straight, I was very good.  In fact, it's kind of interesting I just love history, I love current events and stuff like that.  So I told my professor I wanted--in college I wanted to be a history professor so this professor said, "No you're not going to make any money being a history professor, no that's wrong you've got to go into engineering because you're good in math, you have to go into engineering like electrical engineering," and so I said, "alright," just like that, I said, alright.  I wanted to be a history professor but I said no he said I should go into engineering.  So that's the thing. [The] City College [of New York (CCNY), New York, New York] even though it was a public institution and one of the top engineering schools in the country--public--very high--so I went to their school of engineering.  Like he said, I wanted to study engineering. So that turned out to be very interesting because I went kind of far in engineering.  I went to my lower junior year but I didn't like it, I was getting good grades but I didn't like it.  Interestingly in City College they had this professor who was a sociology professor who taught what was called history for engineers, it was interesting.  So you had a course of all engineers that had to take this history course so I said history, I love history.  But it was taught by a sociologist, when he went taught that class and I went up to him afterwards and I said, "I want to be what you are," 'cause I didn't know what sociology was so he said, "alright," because he was talking about--this was the desegregation--the Board [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]--he was talking about all these current event things that I was interested in sociology, he put (unclear)--it really wasn't history it was sociology.  So he took me under his wing and then I transferred, I left engineering.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Lawrence Podell.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: P-O-D-E-L-L, Lawrence Podell.
Speaker 1: And so he kind of took you under his wing and then what happened then?
Speaker 2: See the way City College is arranged north campus--there are two campuses right next to each other, north campus was for science, engineers, south campus was liberal arts so when I made that transfer I left the north campus to go to the south campus and you had liberal arts.  So you had more people in other liberal arts that you were able to interact with so sociology was one of those and also I'm just talking about other friends that I developed as a result of that.  So yeah he took me under his wing and he said, "Alright, I'll show you," and that's how I got into sociology and so I graduated actually with honors in sociology as a result of him.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from City College?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Story_ID: 224001
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill you were mentioning that you had met Malcolm X in 1960.
Speaker 2: Yes that's very important.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Well what happened was I was at [The] City College [of New York (CCNY), New York, New York]--I was telling you about how few blacks were in the--you've got to make the distinction between day session and evening session, most blacks went to evening City College at the time I went there--very few blacks were in day session so the numbers of blacks were very small.  I decided to reorganize the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] youth chapter because the NAACP had different youth chapters on different campuses and they had one in City College but interestingly it became operated by whites who were not black but they called it NAACP, so they closed it down.  So I went and I said I wanted to reopen the City College youth chapter, and so I did and I was the president of the City College youth chapter and I recruited almost every black who was in the day session so I knew almost every black.  There was one person who I couldn't get to at that point and that was [HistoryMaker General] Colin [L.] Powell because Colin Powell was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] so he did not--he was not connected with us even though he was on the campus but I had all the--the other blacks who were, you know, in the day session.  So we would sponsor events, in other words we would sponsor speakers to come to the campus.  Now I had always admired Malcolm X and so since it was in Harlem [New York, New York] I would go to hear Malcolm speak.  After school I would go right into Harlem and hear--he spoke on the street corner, Malcolm would speak right on the street corner so I would hear all his speeches on the street corner. So then I decided, why don't I ask Malcolm to come to our college to be one of our speakers.  So I said, well you've got to go to Malcolm, he's not easy to get to.  So one Sunday I went to the mosque--Mosque sixteen [sic. Mosque No. 7, New York, New York] in Lenox [Avenue] and I heard his service--his sermon and at the end I walked up to him, I said, "Minister Malcolm, I'm a student at City College and I'd like you to"--and I was approaching him and all his bodyguards and they--he said, "let him come through, let him come through."  I said, "I'd like you to be one of our speakers at City College for our NAACP," he said, "I'd be very pleased to do that."  Now let me say this, this was very interesting because at the time other colleges were not inviting him, he just was a persona non grata, he tried to get in certain places and he couldn't.  I think Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] finally let him come through but at that time they just were--the university refused to let him go.  I had to speak to my president at City College.  I said, "Well, look I want to invite Malcolm."  It happens though my president who was white was a board member of the NAACP, Buell [G.] Gallagher and he was also a minister actually when he was president of City College, Buell Gallagher he was very liberal.  He said, "No, Malcolm can come," he said, "but you'd have to get somebody to oppose Malcolm, you couldn't--we can't have Malcolm come by himself."
Story_ID: 224002
Speaker 1: I said, "Alright I'll get somebody." I said, "I can do it," and that's when I invited Malcolm [X] and Malcolm gave me his home number in East Elmhurst [Queens, New York, New York], I said, "Elmhurst?" 'Cause that's where they had his home--out in East Elmhurst.  So I would call him back--I called him and he called me, in fact one time he called I wasn't home my mother [Marie Brown Hill] was home and my mother said, "Malcolm X!" She kept him on the phone for an hour and a half 'cause she liked him, too.  He said, well tell him to call me back and stuff like that.  Because it was hard for me to get the second person, in other words who was going to debate him-- I asked my minister Reverend [George] Lawrence and he said, "But you know I really can't do it 'cause I agree with everything the man says, I just can't do it."  My minister was an excellent debater; he used to be a newspaper man. So, "No, I couldn't do that."  I went to Kenneth Clark, Kenneth Clark at [The] City College [of New York (CCNY), New York, New York] he was one of the--over youth affairs, in fact actually I had to report to him because we had a youth (unclear) so he was really the faculty person responsible for them.  So I said, "Dr. Clark would you be willing"--he said he'd chew me up like mincemeat, "no I'm sorry I just can't do it."  So what happened was NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had an individual in the New York [New York] office who said, "I will come to debate him," he says, "because I debated him at Yale [University, New York, New York], he chewed me up but I'll do it for you," since I was the NAACP.  So he came down and he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Who was it?
Speaker 1: A very gracious gentleman--
Speaker 2: Well if it comes to you--
Speaker 1: --I'll think of his name but he was head of youth affairs for all the youth chapters across the country but again he was in New York, so that was very easy--we're in New York and very easy for him to come down.  So what happened--the other thing which was very interesting because they kept prolonging it I had these meetings with Malcolm and we would meet at his mosque [Mosque No. 7, New York, New York] and he had a restaurant--they had a restaurant and Malcolm when I'm talking to him, he would say--I said, "I'm trying to get somebody," 'cause he kept saying he was willing but I said, "I've got to get somebody else," and he said, "alright, alright, go ahead and do it."  But he would say, "Sir, sir," and I would say, "I'm just a student why would you call"--he was just so respectful.  And so--"Alright,"--he would keep encouraging me and he said, "alright I'm willing to do it whenever you get it; I'm going to do it."  I had several meetings with him because they kept prolonging it.  And he just was--so the day came it was the biggest place on campus, everybody turned out.  The one thing, I said, "Minister Malcolm, we can't search people, we can't search our students," and he said, no problem with that--"alright, no searching."  We just can't search him, because you know they always patted down people. And so he said, "The only thing I would like to do, though, is I want to bring my tape recorder 'cause I want to record this," and I said, "you can bring your tape recorder."  So he came on the campus and it was an event, of course he stole the limelight.  It went off very well, all the newspapers had it and there is a picture that I have with Malcolm which I cannot find now, you know, he posed with me.  But the thing that I like most was my interaction with him; he was just such a gracious person.  Again, you get these people who are big figures, he wasn't stuck up, he wasn't--and he just related and so I always just liked having that opportunity with him as well.  So it was City College, he came and he was very gracious and I was very pleased, and you know, so that was one of the most monumental event that I can remember certainly at City College.
Speaker 2: And that was in 1960?
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], um-hm. And then other universities began letting him come after we did it other ones began letting him speak on their campuses.
Speaker 2: And did you all maintain your relationship after that?
Speaker 1: Not really, no I didn't maintain a relationship with him.  I didn't really--I mean kept up with him but I didn't try because I knew he was, you know he's busy, he was doing--so no I did not maintain the relationship with him.
Story_ID: 224003
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from [The] City College [of New York (CCNY), New York, New York] what were you thinking you were going to do next?
Speaker 2: Now this is interesting, I almost got in the situation like this one with this history, I wanted to be the history professor and I became a sociology--because actually by going into sociology I could incorporate my history skills as well.  I could look at things from a historical perspective than most sociologists, 'cause most sociologists are not historical.  So I had that dimension but it was very interesting this [Lawrence] Podell again, he said--I said I wanted to go to college--I wanted to do research 'cause he was a researcher.  I said I wanted to go to New School of Social Research [sic. The New School for Social Research, New York, New York].  He said, "New School of Social Research? That's just a name of a school, and I said, "it's the only school that I know of that's got research in its name." He said, "No, you have to go to Columbia [University, New York, New York]; you can't go to New School."  He says, "Columbia is where you get research," so he sent in his reference for me to get into Columbia and I got in there with flying colors.  So I went to Columbia--that's how I got to Columbia and then Columbia had a research--the sociologist had a research institute where students could work, and since I knew again that each place I have to work, I became a research assistant in that sociological institute to pay my way for college, in other words I had to pay my way and at times take some loans.  In fact, even City College I could go there pretty much for free in admissions so it was really no debt in City College.  Columbia I had--again I got in there but I didn't get the financial--as much financial support.  I was able to get some and then I worked so I was able to work on campus and because I was working with researchers, the top researchers, I became--that's what convinced me to go into research full-time, it was Columbia (unclear).  But Podell he was a strong researcher.  After I was at Columbia I stayed in contact with him a lot.  He became the head of research at the New York City welfare department, and so we would always share, I would send him my material, and he knew I was at the [National] Urban League research institute, he was very proud of me and I would send him material.  I stayed in contact with him over the years, he's died.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Actually it was 1961 to '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was the six years that my schooling was there through '67 [1967] because I defended my thesis in '67 [1967].  But what happened was again because I was connected with the research so you defended--you made your defense but they asked you to do little editorial kind of things and because I was working on projects, actually it was the riot commission [Kerner Commission; The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders]--the civil rights commission on riots--the--one of my professors (unclear)--so I was working on the riots commission, and I never got around to submitting my final thesis until two years later in '69 [1969].  So that's why I wasn't going to school then and I said look I'd better--and actually that was--what stimulated that was the Urban League. At that time Whitney Young [Jr.] had opened up his research department in [Washington] D.C., and so I said, no I better get this done before--you know because it was very minor.  So I submitted it in '69 [1969].  So my degree was in '69 [1969] even though my classes ended in '67 [1967].
Story_ID: 224004
Speaker 1: And in 1965 the Moynihan Report ['The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,' Daniel Patrick Moynihan] was published or issued, and can you tell us a little bit about what that was and what your reaction to it was as a sociologist? And an African American--
Speaker 2: Yeah the Moynihan Report because I know a lot about it afterwards, I just read about it in the newspaper 'cause I was still going to school at Columbia [University, New York, New York] at the time but I knew what the report was.  The report I thought was very devastating on black families and the main thing that we felt was that it was--the real problem with black families is black families, you know, and especially the female head of household.  And so, you know, the people--so a number of scholars wrote rebuttals to it, white and black scholars, white and black scholars wrote rebuttals to the Moynihan--essentially he [Daniel Patrick Moynihan] was with the [U.S.] Department of Labor at the time.  He was assistant secretary of labor and some of his intentions were somewhat honorable in that [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson was the president of the United States at the time and Lyndon Johnson was going to make a speech at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  So what Moynihan decided--well he was going to--he wanted Johnson to address the issue of the black family.  So he kind of prepared this report, which could be incorporated into Johnson's speech at Howard, but it was--it backfired completely because it got such an uproar Johnson said he didn't want to have anything to do with that report, you know, and of course he did not mention it when he came to Howard University.  Essentially what he was trying to say was that black families had a lot of problems, we had a lot of--racism--it reached the stage where racism--white racism really was not the major factor that it was the internal weakness of the black family because it had so many single parent households.  So he kind of turned it around, and that's really what the criticism was.  If you read his analysis, it's not that bad because he's talking about unemployment and talking about slavery and he also quoted [E. Franklin] Frazier and Kenneth Clark, but he also turned some of their findings upside down.  And so--so it was what we call the--blaming the victim--black families and that black families were pretty much problem oriented and deficit driven.  That kind of stuck out to me, just being in school of saying that I thought this was kind of not correct, but I was going through my own schooling so I didn't pay much more attention to that than what I was reading, but I read a lot of other responses.  [Andrew] Billingsley wrote a response, a lot of other scholars had written a rebuttal to it.  I didn't get a chance to join that until I got with the [National] Urban League.
Story_ID: 224005
Speaker 1: --And you joined the [National] Urban League in 1969--
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about what you were doing with the Urban League in 1969?
Speaker 2: First of all I really have got to say Whitney Young [Jr.]. Whitney Young was the one who was there; he was the head of the Urban League.  He had a young--not a young lady, he had an older woman who was a white woman who had been with the labor department--it was interesting this lady whose name was Dr. Dorothy Newman; she was a consultant to the Urban League.  She was kind of semi-retired from the labor department [U.S. Department of Labor] but she--it was her data that [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan used to write 'The Black Family' ['The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,' Daniel Patrick Moynihan].  She had been there for years and she hated him because he misconstrued her data, she really--she didn't like him at all.  Because it was her data, she was responsible for collecting black data at the labor department.  For years she collected--they had a special booklet that she was responsible for pulling together.  So he took her data and he made these interpretations and he added this other stuff to it. So--but she was a consultant to Whitney Young.  Whitney Young told her that he wanted to establish his research department but he wanted to be in [Washington] D.C. where we were close to the [U.S.] Census Bureau and the labor department because the headquarters is in New York [New York] and has always been in New York.  So they were going to move the research department to Washington, D.C. so they needed staff.  So--and I admired the Urban League at the time.  So this young lady--I keep calling her young, she was old, she was a retired woman.  The reason I'm saying that is because she was a short lady, but she was very powerful.  She interviewed me and she said you were at Columbia [University, New York, New York] and my professor sent my name in to them and said we're going to establish the Urban League research.  It was interesting, when she caught me I was going to go to--I had already committed to go to Columbia [University] School of Public Health [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York].  There was another professor at the research who was going to school of public health and he wanted me to come along with him and I agreed.  I said alright I'm going to go, and they were prepared for me to go up, and so when I got this interview I said I'll go to this interview but I said, "Look Miss, I've made this commitment to go to this public health--school of public health," and she was so strong she says, "don't you want to make a contribution to your people?"  She pulled all that blackness out.  And I said, "Yes," and I certainly liked the Urban League.  She said, "You can do your research for black people," and so I gave notice to the other people I wasn't coming.  I mean this was really like almost a week or so that I was supposed to report to this other place.  So I said I'll go with the Urban League.
Story_ID: 224006
Speaker 1: I became her [Dr. Dorothy Newman] deputy, it [National Urban League research department] was just a two-person operation--she didn't--'cause they were trying to get an office space and stuff like that.  So I moved from New York [New York] to Washington [D.C.] almost on a part basis because I was--first it was a hotel and then I had another rooming place because I wasn't clear whether I was going to stay in [Washington] D.C. so I really didn't want a permanent--I was married, I had my children, they were in New York.  And so it was kind of interesting because at any rate--so the more--then I met Whitney Young [Jr.], that man is charismatic, he's infectious.  He got me--my meeting with him was just fantastic.  He's always underrated, Whitney Young is.  He believed in training people, he saw Urban League as training ground.  They would say, "Oh you've got this Urban League executive and the corporations done took him from you," he said, "well, I'm going to give them another one to take from me, I'm going to train somebody else."  He believed in upward mobility.  And so he let me do--I was his representative like meeting with Malcolm [X].  He was in New York and he was associated with a lot of groups in D.C.  Urban Institute [Washington, D.C.]--he was on their board and he was concerned about whether he didn't like some of the things they were doing and he wanted me to be his eyes and ears.  So I would go to the meetings for him, I'd do these high powered meetings, the National Urban Coalition when they were first starting that, I would go to the meeting for him.  And I would report back to him so I had a lot of contact with Whitney Young because he gave me these assignments in D.C. to interact with him.  Of course, he didn't last--you know, he drowned, he drowned in '71 [1971].  So it was just two years, but he got me into the census, because he was concerned about the undercount in the census and he said, we're going to determine that we're going to reduce this undercount and he ended up forming what we call, make black count.  It was a special project with Urban Leagues to get people to--blacks to participate in the census and he ended up naming me the head of it.  So I took a leave from the research department to head--and we met with the census people in D.C., all their staff, their regional staff.  This was for the 1970 census so we had meeting in the fall--so I came to the Urban League like in November of '69 [1969].  I already--by January he had me heading the census project.
Speaker 2: And what had you discovered in terms of African Americans--the representation of African Americans in the census--process?
Speaker 1: Well the groups were left out in other words the [U.S.] Census Bureau was trying to count people but they were afraid--let me put it another way they used to say the reason you had the undercount among blacks is because black people are running away from the census, and I looked over their shoulders and said, well, you're running away from black people, that's why they're undercounted.
Story_ID: 224007
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill, what were you discovering in terms of the [U.S.] census and the representation of African Americans?
Speaker 2: You know, what it shows--you know every census you have to do a census every ten years and that what we were finding, and it was reporting that they would say, oh well we counted all these people but we left out the millions of people and they were disproportionately black people and we were--and Whitney Young [Jr.] was concerned.  He says, "Well why do they keep having--why do they keep letting us"--well one reason we knew was that black people were distrustful of the government.  You did have to have them educated why they should be in the census.  So Whitney said when he pulled together this coalition it was called make black count [Coalition for A Black Count] and I was the head of it and this was also done in cooperation with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], even Hispanics--we had a few Hispanic groups that were part of this coalition, it was a national coalition of civil rights groups but it was spearheaded by the [National] Urban League and we had our affiliates in different regions of the country.  We had regional directors and they met with the [U.S.] Census Bureau regional directors.  It was primarily an educational campaign to say why we should be counted--why it's important to be counted because they never did this before, they would just say be counted and people said, "Well why should I be counted?" "I don't know," and they didn't really reach out.  They didn't work with the groups that were closest to the problem.  So we decided--Whitney Young said we're going to do it this time, we're going to try to get it right and so I was the head of that.  And we--in that process in information I decided that it was a lot of deficiencies on the census bureau.  I mean, again, they were trying to do the best they could but they didn't know how to relate to black people and they didn't use black people, for example if they're going to hire people, you had to go to an office way outside in the suburbs and they should have set them up--the hiring places for enumerators right there in the city.  There are churches there, there are other community based--they didn't use those groups, we said well use those groups, use Urban Leagues we're right in the inner city.  You know, they didn't think of those things so this was--it was interesting the project was to educate black people but we ended up having to educate the census bureau.
Story_ID: 224008
Speaker 1: So it [Coalition for a Black Count] was a very interesting project, it was a very interesting project across the country.  We had about ten, no, it was thirty or so affiliates--Urban Leagues that really did things to try to increase it, hiring people because you could get jobs.  See that's another thing in the [U.S.] Census Bureau at that time the party in power would determine--census was patronage in a lot of places.  So the Republicans--[President Richard Milhous] Nixon was in office at that time so it meant that the first people who get jobs would be Republicans, blacks weren't Republican, we said, "No, we can't deal with this process," and so we had to break that rule.  So we got black people who knew the city [Washington, D.C.] these people didn't know anything about who were these places they were counting.  So we realized that and I think we also dealt with--let me just say this the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] this is again in 1970--the census is in April 1970 prior to that time we had to deal with the Black Panthers especially in Oakland [California], the Nation of Islam was against it, but they said--they agreed not to get in my way, the Nation of Islam and the Panthers.  In fact we got a few groups of Panthers in California to distribute our leaflets.
Speaker 2: Why was the Nation against it?
Speaker 1: Distrustful of the government, both of them were distrustful of the government.  They said the government was trying to pry into our family affairs; they're trying to locate us.  We always responded, they don't have any trouble locating us, first of all we're black, we're not invisible and they have all these credit cards and all these other things that keep--they don't have to wait ten years to find out where black people are located they know exactly where black people are located everyday throughout the year.  So they kind of realized that argument didn't make sense and the census data wasn't going to be helpful for that reason, you know, and that we could benefit from it more.
Speaker 2: And was the education campaign successful in your opinion?
Speaker 1: Yes I think it was.  First of all you get money, for every person who is counted means money to your community--
Speaker 2: And that's what a lot of African Americans don't realize.
Speaker 1: That's right because--and that was what was motivating Whitney [Young, Jr.].  Whitney realized right away, he said, look, there is money--every person who is counted, your community loses thousands of dollars for every person who is missed and we're the ones who need it most and what happens is the white communities, which are more affluent, are counted better than us and they need the money less.  So that our money is going to them because they are counted more than we are, and we're the ones who really need the money.  So that money argument was very strong and then politically if you have more blacks politically, you can have more representatives in apportionment, in the state legislature as well as in [U.S.] Congress.  Those numbers are used for legislative districts, you see, so that between money and political representation they--most people--we made that case very effectively.
Story_ID: 224009
Speaker 1: Now let's talk, two years later in 1972, you wrote and published your book, '[The] Strength[s] of Black Families,' [Robert B. Hill], which was somewhat of a counter to the Moynihan Report ['The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,' Daniel Patrick Moynihan].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What was the driving force behind the need to write this book?
Speaker 2: It came from two sources and--very simple sources.  I guess the most direct source was Dr. [Dorothy] Newman--my--she was the interim director of research.  I told you that she very much hated the way [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan distorted that.  And so then we're--what the [National] Urban League did was that each conference we had an arrangement where the research department would release a report on a different topic.  So she kind of said, "Look, why don't we write on the black family--why don't you release a report on the black family?"  So, "All right." And then of course--but--you know I wanted to talk about the strengths of black families not about the weaknesses of black families.  So she kind of molded that--the other person who molded me was Andrew Billingsley. Andrew Billingsley was a consultant to the Urban League.  He had already written a rebuttal and he had already written 'Black Families in White America,' [Andrew Billingsley], which talks about strengths.  So I (unclear)--my book was building on what Billingsley was saying about strengths in his book but I got into it more specifically 'cause I identified specific strengths.
Story_ID: 224010
Speaker 1: What were some of the things you discovered?
Speaker 2: Well let me say my strengths because that's the whole--you know, the strong achievement--that blacks had a strong achievement orientation, a strong work orientation, flexible family roles, strong kinship bonds and strong religious orientation.  My book ['The Strengths of Black Families,' Robert B. Hill] used data to show how these five strengths are exemplified among not only middle income blacks but around working class low income blacks.  And I used a lot of government data; I used [U.S.] Census Bureau data, labor department and other researchers to say their specific strengths.  These weren't the only strengths but these were the strengths that I wanted to focus on to say that if you're talking about black families there's an omission, you never talk about any of these strengths that we are an achievement oriented people, we're work oriented.  And so that pretty much--but let me just say that report, that book--that came out as a report not as a book, I've got to put that in context.  That was released in 1971 at a conference in Saint--in Detroit, Michigan.  But what happened was, let me say how it got such publicity, the newspapers--they released--the bureau at that time--the Census Bureau was releasing a report on black families but it was in the Moynihan [Report; 'The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,' Daniel Patrick Moynihan] tradition.  Each year it would release it on black--but talk about the weaknesses. And apparently some of my people told me that the bureau was trying to undercut my report so they decided to release their report the same day as mine.  They thought they would get more publicity, but it backfired.  What happened was the newspapers picked up both reports.  So this was [The] New York Times--both reports. My report was talking about strengths; the Census Bureau was talking about weaknesses, in the Moynihan tradition.  So people across the country wanted to get copies of this report, it just got all over the whole world.  So the Bureau--the [National] Urban League said look the only way we can do it is to make it a book.  So they made it into a book, so it's a very small tiny book because it wasn't meant to be a book initially, it was to be a report.  So the Urban League, you know, made it a book, it became a book quickly and that it was disseminated across the country but as a counter valance to the--to that Moynihan tradition.
Story_ID: 224011
Speaker 1: How was that report ['The Strengths of Black Families,' Robert B. Hill] received, I mean did some people feel like you were really romanticizing--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's interesting, you are right, you're right.  It's interesting--you know, yes, I got the criticism from some people and some black people said you're just romanticizing.  The way they came out was that if you say that we have strengths that means you're saying we don't have any weaknesses.  I call it the fallacy of dichotomist thinking.  If I say we have strengths that means I don't believe we have any weaknesses.  I know we've got weaknesses, we're experts on weaknesses but we also have strengths that nobody wants to talk about them, and I think they should be a balance treatment of black family.  You should talk about their weaknesses and their strengths, now we're only talking about their weaknesses and I wanted to say that you should have a balanced treatment of saying well what their strengths are because it's the strengths that will get us over.  So that's the way I kind of responded to that but a lot of people did say, oh, but most blacks, let me just say--I got that response but blacks across this country especially those in schools--oh boy, even today I get, "Your book saved my life," because they didn't have anything positive to say about black people.  You know, [Andrew] Billingsley was the only one at that time and then mine came out that talked about those strengths and so I get--you know, all universities gobbled it up, they just--and a lot of social workers 'cause it was also a lot of social work implications in my report which I did write for them and a lot of social workers have used it in their training sessions and cultural sensitivity and things like that.  And so it really has gotten a lot--it really made a major impact.  Now of course we have a lot of other people writing some of these things now which is good.  You know, so we have more company, we were pretty much alone at that time and that's why Billingsley wrote my preface to the strengths and [HistoryMaker] Vernon [E.] Jordan [Jr.] at that time.  Even though Whitney [Young, Jr.] had stimulated it, he had died and Vernon Jordan came--who then elevated me to director of research [at National Urban League] because this Dr. [Dorothy] Newman had resigned at that point.  She was really grooming me, I didn't realize what she was doing-- she was grooming me to take her place.  And so after Whitney died she left and then Vernon elevated me to be director of research.  So it came out under his leadership and then he wrote the foreword in the book as well.
Story_ID: 224012
Speaker 1: Let me just say some achievements though at the [National Urban] League that I think are very--
Speaker 2: Okay, sure.
Speaker 1: --to me, some things that happened in the League that I think were very important.  One very important thing that I think at the League was my relationship with Ron Brown; I've got to say Ron Brown, tremendous individual.  Ron Brown was just out of law school [St. John's University School of Law, New York, New York] and he was in New York and Whitney Young [Jr.] had hired him almost--I came to the Urban League right after Ron Brown, and so Ron and I became very good friends.  I was in Washington [D.C.], he was in New York but when [HistoryMaker] Vernon [E. Jordan, Jr.] became head he wanted Ron to be his legislative head in Washington so he moved Ron from New York to Washington to be on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  And so what happened was Ron and I, they had the Washington bureau and the research department, two units of national in [Washington] D.C. and we were in the same building.  They found space for us, the bureau so Ron was in the same building with me.  So to do testimony he needed research data and so he would call me to get research data.  It was just--he just was a brilliant person.  So we worked very good together.  With the [U.S.] census--'cause I did testimony for Whitney Young.  At the end of the census--Whitney had to testify what happened at our events and Whitney did testify, I left that point out.  Whitney testified and said how can we improve future censuses, he said what the [U.S.] Census Bureau should do is to set up advisory committees of minority groups, minority advisory committees that's the thing.  They should be advised by the people who are undercounted and that was the recommendation that--Whitney and I sat together, he testified and that's the recommendation he made.  The [U.S. Census] Bureau in '74 [1974] developed their first minority advisory.  They have one for the Hispanics, Asians, Indians [Native Americans] all the different groups, the black was the first one formed and I was the first head of it.  So Ronald Brown knew about my interest with the census--about a lot of other things but he relied on us for the data.  I've just got to talk about Ron Brown because--Ted Kennedy [Senator Edward M. Kennedy] wanted to run for president, he then left the Urban League to be his campaign person and then he went on and became secretary of commerce, you know.  So I just want to say that he would move fast, he was a brilliant person.  The relationship that I had with him was just fantastic.  So that was a highlight to me of the Urban League and then, you know, we did a lot of other finer things but I do want to indicate that was a, that experience that I had with him was very, I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 224013
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to leave the [National] Urban League?
Speaker 2: I was there almost twelve years.  Whitney Young [Jr.] was really cool.  Whitney says, he said, "Leaders shouldn't be in their position more than about ten years; we should move out and let young people."  He didn't believe in staying in his positions.  Now of course he died in '71 [1971], it was almost exactly ten years, although I don't think he meant going out like that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He affected me, he still affects me.
Speaker 1: So you felt it was time to move on.
Speaker 2: Yes I had done a lot of things--I had done a lot of things with the research and I just felt that--I had a huge staff, I had about forty people and we had projects and I wanted to do something in a different arena.  I just felt it was time for me to move on, I just felt that I wanted to do something--I still want to do some research but I wanted to do it in a different arena.
Story_ID: 224014
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I ended up--
Speaker 1: After you left the [National] Urban League?
Speaker 2: --actually what happened was I went with a research outfit called the Bureau of Social Science Research [BSSR].
Speaker 1: And what were your responsibilities there?
Speaker 2: I was a senior researcher--in fact it's kind of similar in some respects although it's a very small operation, I was a senior researcher.  What happened was, let me say the connection why I got connected with that.  That bureau was a research bureau that was founded in [Washington] D.C. by researchers from Columbia University [New York, New York], in other words, they had tried to hire me before I went to the Urban League.  They knew about me because they were Columbia. They had--and I came for an interview, it was really interesting just to see.  So before I went to the Urban League they had contacted me and they formed this research institute here.  I said, "No I'm not ready to leave New York [New York], I'm not ready to leave New York."  So they knew I was at the Urban League so I said--but I did come with the Urban League and so after I left the Urban League I was looking around and they were still there and they said we still want you to come here and so I came and I was a senior researcher.  We did kind of different grants.  I did some things--a number of projects with Andrew Billingsley, projects that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What was the main focus of a lot of the projects?
Speaker 2: Again it was kind of employment.  They did projects on--it varied.  The projects that I was connected with, some of it was job employment, criminal justice.  We did a number of criminal justice and then with Billingsley I did some things on families.  We did some analyses in terms of family support systems and different family issues.  So--it was--I mean to say that maybe the size was about fifty people, it was a small operation but they did projects in a lot of different areas and I--as I said, I kind of worked more on some of the things with criminal justice and family issues.
Speaker 1: And who used most of the research that you all did? Was it--
Speaker 2: Government.
Speaker 1: Government.
Speaker 2: Yes it was usually government agencies.  We did some research for foundations, too, so some foundations also benefited from that.
Speaker 1: So you were there for five years until 1986?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really. I took a leave.  I was there from--yes five years, five years, 1981 to '86 [1986], it was after that.
Story_ID: 224015
Speaker 1: What did you do before you went to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] to teach?
Speaker 2: I was a consultant at the White House [Washington, D.C.].  It was interesting, it was interesting--it was kind of an interesting turn of events.  I do have some--I have a colleague who is a Republican and we met at the [National] Urban League, he was at the Urban League and he kind of--we've maintained a close relationship and he wanted--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill you were talking about you were a consultant at the White House.  What kind of work were you doing at the White House and that was in 1986?
Speaker 1: That was in '86 [1986], that's right, that was pretty much '86 [1986], I think it was until '89 [1989] under the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan administration.  My colleague, his name was [HistoryMaker] Robert Woodson.  He had been with the Urban League.  When I was director of research, he was head of criminal justice.  One thing about Bob Woodson, he's kind of controversial but he believes in self-help and we had developed a relationship--and strengths of black families.  He believes wholly in the strengths of black families.  He's done everything to market the strengths.  He believes that black families--black communities have strengths, so what happened--and he believes that low income people--he tries to deal with criminal justice, gangs, public housing people, he's done a lot to help them to build on their strengths and I've spoken at a lot of his conferences.  At any rate, he said that he wanted the White House to focus on self-help.  He wanted them to do some work--so he gave them my name to hire me to help direct this project on--to document self-help groups around the country so they hired me.  He was a Republican with Reagan.  They hired me as a consultant and my major project was twofold, I had two major projects.  One was the self-help inventory, to study--to do the study.  It was done really by telephone and came out with a book.  It became what they call a self-help directory.  The second thing was very interesting.  It was at the time that the welfare reform was going on and they needed to have--states had to submit a request for a waiver to experiment with different ways of reforming welfare.  So the unit that I was attached to was the waiver board.  It was a board to receive state waivers and people would come in and I would do research related to what they may have done on other things.  So my research related to welfare reform.  I was a consultant to that board and so most of our time was reviewing applications.  The state officials would come in and then they would grant this--the waiver for them to experiment with welfare reform.  This was before the big welfare reform took place.
Story_ID: 224016
Speaker 1: Do you ever have the opportunity to report directly to President [Ronald Wilson] Reagan or work directly with him [as a White House consultant]?
Speaker 2: No I really did not.  I was--we were pretty close to the White House [Washington, D.C.], we would have a lot of meetings--we met with Reagan, let me just say this, initially when he came in.  Bob Woodson [HistoryMaker Robert Woodson] pulled a group of black people right after he became president.  We had several meetings with Reagan.  He had about twenty of us he pulled together and we sat--he had his secretaries across the table and so he would talk about things.  Again he kept emphasizing self-help, they should do more to support self-help.  So I was there and I met all those top officials and Reagan was there.  And, you know, Reagan was Reagan, he nods and nods, he doesn't say too much.  But we had several meetings with him so I met with him.  When I was working there I really didn't meet with him although we had to go--a lot of his staff--White House staff--and then of course at the--I stayed there to the end of his administration so we got that photo op [opportunity], I don't show that picture.  But anyway it's a photo op with him.  You know, he was a gracious person and he said, "Hi" you know and such and such.  All the staff people who were leaving 'cause that's the end of the administration.
Story_ID: 224017
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill as someone who was and is a huge proponent of the black family, what were some of your thoughts about the impact that welfare reform was going to have on some African American families?
Speaker 2: Well let me say--that--some of that, I mean again the welfare system, I always had some problems with the welfare system just in general and this is across any administration because welfare--usually said that for black people to get welfare the husbands had to leave the household so the mothers could get welfare.  My studies, let me just say this, that's an area that I'm really--I know a whole lot about.  My studies also show--so I asked the question why don't white fathers have to leave the household and my research shows that they do have a special program for two parent families to get welfare.  Most black people think I'm crazy but [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy started it in '61 [1961].  It's a program where you can get welfare for two people who are working but whites end up getting it and not blacks, and so--
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: They had rules that they--first of all you have to have consistent--a long history of working, blacks don't have a long history of working.  We work but we get different jobs and in terms of consistency of it and also you have to qualify for unemployment insurance which means you have to have a consistent period and those rules screen out blacks--fathers even though we're unemployed more than white fathers.  So that's one of the factors and the other that most people don't know the program exists they only know about the mothers.  So they don't even push--they hadn't pushed for that.  So a lot of my writings were telling people about the unemployed--AFDC [Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program]--unemployed parent program which they give money to two people.  So more and more became kind of aware of that.  But--so I was very distrustful of the whole welfare system before this welfare reform.  Let me say during this time, though, under the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan administration they were permitting states to experiment and I thought that was good, I thought that how they could do things--they are permitting states to try giving them child care, different--so I liked that.  I liked states trying to experiment to be more humane to them.  But of course the welfare reform under [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.]--[President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton the 1996 which I think is a very horrendous one that passed him, I think has made things worse not better.  So most of my writings really have been that I don't care who was the administration, even Carter, in fact a lot of his staff resigned because he passed that welfare reform act [Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996] and I think the data is showing that it's not been--it's been more devastating especially to black families than to many white.
Story_ID: 224018
Speaker 1: After the White House [Washington, D.C.] you left there and went to Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: That's right--I went to Morgan State, again to research, my whole career has been in research.  I've never really been in an academic appointment in the traditional sense.  In two years--between '85 [1985] and '86 [1986] I was a visiting professor, I've--let me put it another way, I've always been an adjunct professor, I love to teach so my whole career, I've never been a full-time, let me put that--I've never been a full-time professor but I've been a part-time professor.
Speaker 1: Where (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I've taught at--everywhere, Fordham [University, New York, New York], NYU [New York University, New York, New York], Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  My longest term was at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I was there for two years--I was a visiting scholar at the University of Maryland in the sociology department.  So I lived on campus that year and it was '85 [1985]/'86 [1986].  So there, I was there for a long--but in other words I always liked teaching but I always preferred to do in on an adjunct basis rather than full-time basis.
Speaker 1: So what were your primary responsibilities at Morgan and what kind of research were you doing?
Speaker 2: Again it was directing a research institute.  The difference at the [National] Urban League was it was a national research, I was doing research for the nation, a lot of [U.S.] Congress people, a lot of people asked me for data whereas I was doing it for, pretty much for a city and state the State of Maryland and also for the university.  It was kind of community orientated research.  We tried to help community groups do research and we even wrote proposals for community groups that were trying to get money and we would build some evaluation components.  Like it might have been the elderly, teenage pregnancy, AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] was coming out at that time, criminal justice, it cut across--early head start programs.  They had some very innovative projects to get mothers in public housing to read early to their kids.  It was really kind of 'Sesame Street' type of thing.  Where--but we did research on all topics, health, education.  I had a nice size staff there; I had about thirty-five or forty people.  I had some very good people backing me up.  So we would do the--the community would ask us to do research, the president might ask us to do research and then I would research that we would initiate ourselves but it was always for the help of the community.  We set up a unit at Morgan where we called--it was a community research center--resource center--to help the community use data and to train them how to use the computer, how to write proposals, we even had labs on that.  So the community people would come in and we would train them in research techniques.
Speaker 1: Which did you like best--the more community based research or the national research?
Speaker 2: I really don't want to say which one I liked most because both of them to me fitted me at the time.  I liked the national but for the time it became a drain.  I mean I was asked all over the place.  You know, I liked what I was doing; I liked both of them really because they met my need at a different time.  I really didn't want national when I was at the Urban League, I mean when I was at Morgan State.  At that point I didn't really want to be a national person and so it really--and I wanted to be community.  So that route worked very good for me, both of them filled a need that I needed at that point.
Story_ID: 224019
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill we were talking a little bit about the work that you were doing at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Morgan State, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, after you left Morgan what did you do next and what year did you leave Morgan?
Speaker 2: I was there ten years, let me say that because that was a good period of time.  I came to Westat (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were at Morgan from 1986 until 1996?
Speaker 2: No, no. I was at Morgan from 1989--
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989], I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --until 1998, through the end of 1998.
Speaker 1: Okay now when did you republish 'The Strength of Black Families' [Robert B. Hill] was that in '99 [1999]?
Speaker 2: No last year.
Speaker 1: Okay so we'll get to that as we move along.
Speaker 2: That's right, it came out last year.
Speaker 1: So in 1999 you came to Westat [Rockville, Maryland] and so tell us a little about what Westat is.
Speaker 2: Westat is a large research firm but it specializes in conducting surveys for government agencies.  It does something like people know about RAND [Corporation, Santa Monica, California] and some of those--it's very large--it's based in Rockville, Maryland and it collects data.  In other words it's a very heavy survey research team where a lot of household--they do household surveys and telephone surveys.  In fact we have almost a special building where we have telephone interviewers to come here and be trained--and they call across the country.  We also have units of people in different locations to do household interviews as well.  But it's--a lot of our work is in health on AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], clinical trials, asthma, mental health issues, criminal justice.  We do a lot with the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], housing almost all the agencies, education we do a lot in the area of education.  Head Start--we have very huge Head Start program project.
Speaker 1: And what are your primary focuses at Westat?
Speaker 2: I'm in what's called a human services division of Westat which I would characterize as focusing more on family issues, more around family issues.  My area has been closer to child welfare, children in foster care, grandmothers raising their grandchildren and nieces and nephews either in the foster care system.  Welfare reform has been some of my area of work.  So it's really more around those aspects of family issues I have been more concentrating on.
Story_ID: 224020
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill you republished your book 'The Strength[s] of Black Families,' [Robert B. Hill], the strength of African American families [sic.] last year, so 2003?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Why did you republish it?
Speaker 2: It was interesting, first of all it's been out of print for almost ten years now.  Let me just preface this, I did do a sequel to 'The Strengths' which came out in 1999 called 'The Strengths of African American Families: 25 Years Later,' [Robert B. Hill].
Speaker 1: Okay I'm sorry that's where--I thought that was the republished book.  Well let's talk about the one in 1999, the sequel.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's a sequel, it's a new book but it is the sequel twenty-five years later.
Speaker 1: What had you discovered twenty-five years later?
Speaker 2: On the one hand I kind of discovered we had some of our old problems.  Unemployment was still disproportionately higher and the poverty really hadn't gone down tremendously, but the real discovery were kind of new problems.  We never had HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] before, the crack cocaine epidemic and related to the crack cocaine when I say crack cocaine now; we had a problem with drugs before which was heroin which was largely among black men.  The crack cocaine extended to black women and mothers.
Speaker 1: And what impact was that having on the family?
Speaker 2: Yes because see before we were talking about the impact of the male but the crack cocaine was used by women and so--they were mothers--many of them disproportionately.  That combined with HIV/AIDS and some of this was the relationship because of their unclean needles they could also get HIV/AIDS but the point is it expanded to the mothers of our children and many of them were unable to care for their children as well which meant that many of their relatives had to step in to care for the children and that's when the number of families in which grandparents and aunts and uncles started rearing their children more.  It was related to this--the AIDS epidemic and the crack cocaine.  Those are new problems that we didn't have of that magnitude when I wrote twenty-five years ago.  The other thing is though we still--there's a good side--there's a good point educationally, we have made tremendous progress.  Occupationally blacks are in jobs that they were never in before so we had a real expansion of both our middle class and upper class that was very positive.  The size of our middle class--and they're living in places they never lived before.  So you had--I describe it as the tale of two cities.  You had the positive increase in middle and upper-income families and yet at the same time you still had an increase of the poor who were left behind.  So that became a split, in other words we had the upward movement but then we still had those who did not move up.
Story_ID: 224021
Speaker 1: And some would argue that the gap is just far too great.  That, you know, you have this number of African Americans who are upwardly mobile and then such a large number of those who are suffering in poverty.
Speaker 2: Yeah let me say one--we describe a gap but I think I'd like to be a little careful.  Yes, statistically there is a gap, in other words you have people who've moved up and then you still have the people who were left behind.  The kind of caution I would say is that many of these people who moved up have relatives who are still left behind.  Their mothers are living in these same communities, in other words their kin--I mean so they have moved up but they have other people who are part of their extended family network left behind, in other words not the whole extended family moved up, in other words.  Many of them still have to relate to their brothers and sisters, their mothers--in other words there is a connection.  It's not like the whole family moved up, there were other people who were connected to them who have not moved up.  So I think that some of the people move up do look back--they can relate because some of them are still connected to that.  So I think that some of that there is an issue of to what extent the people who move up care for those who are left behind.  Well if you have some connections that may help that somewhat but there is a connection in a lot of cases with respect to the mobility.  In other words it's not just that people moved out and then a lot of those who moved back are still--some of them are concerned.  There is a group who are not concerned as well.
Speaker 1: And did you find that the strengths--you had listed five strengths earlier, did you find that those strengths still exist twenty-five years later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes I still find those strengths again the achievement orientation, work orientation, the flexible family roles, the kinship bond and the spiritual.  I consider those factors still functional, certainly the achievement.  All of our achievement both in terms of going to college and a lot of the other and also high school grades are increased they're still strong.  There have been some nuances for example on the kinship.  I mentioned the relatives; relatives have always looked after our kids regardless of whether they are from Africa or right now.  Except that right now many of our grandparents are much younger than they used to be, some of them are thirty-five and forty.  That was not twenty-five years ago, we didn't have these younger grandparents.  So in other words we have--that structure is there but it is not often able to function as effectively as it once was because of the changing demographics.  So that was a nuance that we had, you know, in relationship to that.  But I think basically, for example those who are spiritually oriented, there is also a relationship with the church.  Many of our young people are not as close and our community is not as close as it used to be with the church and I think that's negative.  I think that some of those young people--research has shown those who are connected with religion and the church tend to advance more than those who are not.  So there is a role that the church has to play.  Many of them have moved out of those neighborhoods and they're not reaching back as close to some of the areas in which they should be.  So there are some nuances that we have to deal with that was not true before.  So yes, they do have an effect but there've been some changes with respect to their impact as they once were.
Story_ID: 224022
Speaker 1: What about the impact of crime and just poverty in general.  How had that changed in twenty-five years?
Speaker 2: The only thing--the worst thing I think about the crime is that we have access to guns to young people--that's a new phenomenon.  In the past only adults had weapons. The crack cocaine started recruiting young people and so that our young people now have guns, they can get a gun quicker than they can get an ice cream cone, and so that we have drive-by shootings, people are afraid to leave their homes, people are shot sitting inside your house looking at TV, shot dead.  So when you say you're in the wrong place; you can't be in the wrong place if in your own house and so I think that's the most devastating thing is that the accessibility of weapons to our young people--used to fight, when we were young we used to fight with our fists now they fight with guns and they fight over anything a pair of sneakers.  You know, so that's one of the most devastating, I think it's the access of weapons to our young people which is a new phenomenon.
Speaker 1: And what about teenage pregnancies and single parent households was that the same or did that change?
Speaker 2: It changed, it's interesting first of all it's a little fluke let me just say about teenage pregnancy.  Teenage pregnancy had been going down even in the '60s [1960s]--black teenage pregnancies it was actually white teenage pregnancies which was going up more than black so that has gone down although it's still higher among blacks than whites but that's going in the right direction.
Speaker 1: So was that lower twenty-five years later? Teenage--
Speaker 2: Yes that's right the level of that is lower, the rates of it is lower.  That had definitely been going down.
Speaker 1: But is it because that twenty-five years ago girls married younger as well?
Speaker 2: Well that was part of it, that was part of it--but I think it was also--I think now--the other thing obviously is access to other contraceptives which you did not have before and they certainly are making them easily more available.  So I think it's a combination of that as well.  I mean you do have contraceptives which are and then of course obviously you can have an abortion more, which was not true earlier before.  So I think that some of those factors do--have attributed to it.  The other thing is that on single parents which is really interesting over the past--from 1995 there's been a decline in the single proportion of black single parents and there's been an increase in the proportion of black two parent households, research is showing that.  That there's a slight--it's an increase so it looks like for some reason we haven't explained why this has happened, but there's been a plateauing of the single parent household and there's beginning to be a slight increase of two parent black households which is certainly a good signal.
Story_ID: 224023
Speaker 1: While you've said that you felt the Moynihan Report ['The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,' Daniel Patrick Moynihan] in 1965 kind of blamed the victim, some could argue that your approach doesn't make the victim take responsibility, or be responsible--
Speaker 2: Yeah that's a good point.  The thing though--you know I mentioned that I have a colleague who is a Republican that's a thing Republicans say--"responsibility"--although I think that's a cheap shot in that--I was brought up in the church and all these other places, if you hear our leaders speak every single day to black people they talk about responsibility, that's not a new message.  Somehow white people say, "Oh we don't say responsibility," everything you're responsible.  [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson you are responsible, you may not put yourself down but you're responsible for picking yourself up, that is drilled into us every day and so that when white say, "Oh it's not on the front page of The New York Times," we say that.  The thing is that I've always said too black families have weaknesses, but it also has strengths.  You have to do balance--you have to be balanced.  Racism is always around so you have to be concerned with the external but you all have to realize that you have in your responsibility to do better, and you can do better so we always emphasize both that's how I came along.  I say look you have to do better, racism was still there when I was there, but--and to say that it doesn't exists is not true but you can achieve in spite of racism.  In most--in fact, when I speak to young people I say the major contribution of Black History Month and whatever it is--black history--is people who've achieved against and in spite of racism.  All of these people are stories of people who have achieved.  So you do have to emphasize what you have to do in terms of your responsibility.  And that's another thing about the strengths--this is why the strengths says you have strengths, you can do something on yourself, you can pick yourself up.  That's one of the motivating things about it because when you talk about weaknesses it doesn't tell you how to solve the problem.  When you talk about strengths, strengths points to solutions.  This is how I can succeed by being--achievement, studying hard, working hard all of those personal values of spiritual oriented and those are on a personal level all of those are on a personal level.  So it says you can achieve if you try to emulate achievement. Study hard and yes you will come in contact with barriers but you can overcome them.  So I think to me that's--it's the balance message that yes racism is there but people we can achieve in spite of racism.
Speaker 1: But you're not arguing that all that ails us in the African American community is due to racism are you?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not except that when you reach certain levels you will face it.  The point is to prepare people--that's why you can achieve.  Not everything that you come in contact with will be racism, but you should prepare.  Young people--the worst thing for them, you tell these young people there is no racism and when they hit that ceiling they are not prepared for it.  The point is to prepare people so that when they come, but to tell them that you can achieve.  Yes it's out there, don't look for it, it will find you.  Don't look for it, don't put a chip on your shoulder, you can achieve.  But when you come in contact with it well they already told me this was going to happen so I'll deal with it, I'm prepared for it.

Speaker 1: So [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill, do you think the media has it all wrong because unfortunately when we open up the newspaper, when we look at television news we do see a lot of stories about black-on-black crime--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --young African American males, the high rate of incarceration among young African American males and unfortunately many of these young people are coming from homes--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --that are headed by single families.  So does the media have it all wrong?
Speaker 2: Well again I know a lot of with the media--I worked with the media a lot recently.  They attempt to do some things in what they call balance but it's unbalanced when it comes to the black community.  In other words actually if you look at the media you will find some positive stories but they are usually buried (laughter).  They're not as visible as the negative stories.
Speaker 1: But they're not making these stories up about the black on black crime and you even talked about sitting in your house getting shot.  In Washington, D.C. we have a case where a young girl sitting in her house and was shot and two young African American males were arrested for that so the media didn't make that up.
Speaker 2: No they don't make it up.  The thing though I guess with my orientation has been--what is the black community doing about it?  Now what I don't see for example I mentioned there are some colleagues that I have.  In [Washington] D.C. there is a housing project where they had that violence.  These were former gang members themselves, they went into these young people--they transformed that over five years there hasn't been one violence, the newspaper has not reported that.  I mean, there are positive elements of how people are dealing with these that don't get the same report as what we see every day in the newspapers and that's why part of my strengths--my book ['The Strengths of Black Families: 25 Years Later,' Robert B. Hill] always says what are we trying to do, let's give people some examples that the crime can be dealt with.  The--teenage pregnancy and there are people who are doing it but we don't talk about them.  Shouldn't we also show them?  That's where--I'm dealing with the unbalance.  It's not that they should not show these negatives they should show them, but there are also some positive things that people are doing to address and it would encourage more people to say, oh this problem can be dealt with, it's not unsolvable.  But they've got it now where these problems can't be solved because they think that nobody can do anything.  There are some very positive things going in the black community to address a lot of these issues that doesn't get the same play as the negative and that's what my point is. It's not that they shouldn't show it but they should show it more balanced.

Speaker 1: What advice do you have for African American parents today in 2004 in terms of raising their families and their children?
Speaker 2: I guess we can kind of--to me, kind of go back.  We keep struggling with this in terms of internal and external.  I guess I just don't see a difference in that--except that many of these kids are coming up in single parent households so that it calls for other people in the community to also augment this.  Some of this we used to get like in our church and a lot of other places.
Speaker 1: And the community has changed, too,--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because, you know, like many people talk about knowing everyone on the street and if you misbehave--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --but the community has changed so that really doesn't exist.
Speaker 2: That's right, there's been a dispersal you're exactly right and also there's norms where you can look after--other people can scold your kid and other things like that and that transformation has been kind of--is negative.  But in terms of messages of children, I think it's that twofold message.  Always keep your eyes on the prize, you can be whatever you want to be, that's what kids should be told, but you've got to work hard for whatever you want to be.  Listen to your teachers; go to the school, listen. In other words you can achieve.  You have it within you no matter where you live, no matter what your background is you can achieve.  That's what I think they should be telling the kids.  Then there's a second thing, you will come across barriers, there will be barriers--be prepared for it.  But when you come across it, you'll know that it's going to be there and there are ways to get over those barriers, and so you still keep achieving.  So you don't stop when you come with these barriers and people are trying to hold you back or whatever the--the teachers don't call on you or whatever it is, you still deal with those issues.  So that you have it within yourself to achieve, in other words to inspire them that they do have it within them to be able to get their dreams and when they come across barriers they just overcome--try to deal with it in other ways and other kinds of support but they would be able to achieve because other people have done it with less. They are told that story. This is why again with the people in Black History Month all these people who achieved had nothing, they had less than you have, you have a lot more.  So in other words it's personal responsibility I think is the number one message--that they should--that you should (unclear)--and aim for what your goals are.  Don't have low goals because people say you can't achieve something higher, you know.  So I think that's the main message that I think--
Story_ID: 224026
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in general?
Speaker 2: I guess it's a similar thing where I think now--I think there needs to be more of us who are in the middle class and upper class to reach back, to somehow contribute, not to--to be responsive and to contribute to those who are left behind.  I think that--I remember Jackie Robinson said--I never--his book was 'I Never Had it Made' [Jackie Robinson].  He never had it made, he says, "Until everybody else can achieve then I will never have it made," and I believe that we need more people who think like that.  Who cares and who is concerned about looking back and being responsive.  In other words I think we can contribute--we have a lot of skills and a lot of things that we can help people who are not there to a lot of different ways and so I think more of the onus is on the people who are outside of the community but those in the community.  I think there are people who are trying to do things in the community but they need other kinds of supports and they could maybe get some of this supports if some of our more affluent or educated individuals would also be supportive of them.  They are doing some positive things in our community to fight crime, teenage pregnancy.  It's a lot of positive things that are going on in our community across this country but they are doing it with very little resources and I think that with other prominent individuals and other persons who are not prominent to help them, they could--we could be much more effective.
Speaker 1: Other than racism what do you think is the biggest challenge facing the African American community?
Speaker 2: I guess I would have to probably say at this stage it might be classism.  In other words I think that there are too many blacks who I think want to get away mentally, physically there's no problem with that but I think that classism--I think that the more wealth we have there's a gap that I think is increasing and that they're not thinking about what they can contribute back.  I think that's probably the biggest problem that we have is classism.  That there's too many--let me also say however, I know many of them who are there who do think consciously.  You know, Magic Johnson you can rattle off those who are really concerned but I think there are a lot more who could be and I think that there's a gulf mentally, I don't care where they live.  They can live anyplace but I think where do you contribute back and there's ways that you can make a contribution.  I think that that needs to be more reinforced and I think that we are losing some of that with the progress that we're making into this, the upper class.

Speaker 1: Tell me, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Robert B.] Hill how do you want to be remembered, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess I will always--I guess remembered for '[The] Strengths [of Black Families,' Robert B. Hill].  In other words, that every person, no matter what your background, you have something positive, you have an asset and that you should be able to see within yourself that you can achieve, you have strengths.  And I think that I would want to be remembered that you all, you can achieve against the odds.
Story_ID: 224028
Speaker 1: And what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: I think more people are, would probably talk about my things about strengths--my research to help people.  'Cause it's beyond strengths, it's community, it's trying to be more of an activist researcher who has done research and tries to pave the way to improve the lives of all blacks in different stages.  I think that's more--would be more--my legacy, I believe.  I try to inspire people, give them hope that they can do better than they're doing.
