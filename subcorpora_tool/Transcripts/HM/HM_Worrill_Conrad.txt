Story_ID: 20410
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early years.  What were your parents names and can you spell those for them and if you know the date of their birth?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father whose name is Walter Fleming Worrill, W-A-L-T-E-R, Fleming, F-L-E-M-I-N-G, Worrill, W-O-R-R-I-L-L.  He was born on May 12th, 1914 in Covington, Georgia.  My mother, AnnaBell Worrill.  It's A-N-N-A, Capital B-E-L-L, W-O-R-R-I-L-L.  And she was born in 1920 in Lafayette [Louisiana].  And it's a lot of controversy over her birthday.  It's so much controversy that I can't even remember what it is because of, of the fact that, when she was born in 1920, it was the famous pneumonia epidemic that occurred in that region, where over 200 black people died as the result of the epidemic.  And her parents perished in that epidemic.  And as a result, there was a lot of controversy over the records of her birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this Lafayette, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Lafayette, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Louisiana, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what are the family traditions?  I mean what are your--do your parents, did they talk about--did you know your grandparents (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, you know, first all my grandfather, Oscar Worrill and my grandmother, Mary [Fleming] Worrill, had--there were nine boys and three girls that--on my father's side.  I think I'll talk about that side first--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -- because it's an interesting history that's been uncovered in our family because the question was and the curiosity is why, how did, how did I end up in Pasadena, California?  How did I, how did Conrad Worrill end up being born in Pasadena?  Well, the--what has been revealed in our family documentation and genealogy is that several years ago, during a family reunion in Atlanta [Georgia], my cousins who are retired schoolteachers and nurses and what have you, went to Covington.  And they--it was a small town, and they talked to a lot of people, and they found out through oral history that my grandfather's life was threatened in 1920 because he was selling moonshine.  And the white men who kind of controlled the town found out that my grandfather was making a lot of money.  And so, I guess the word went out that they were gonna do some harm to him.  And clandestinely, they were able to organize to get my grandfather out of Covington, on a train with some chicken baskets and food on the back of a freight train.  And they knew someone apparently that was connected to the family in Covington who worked in a barber shop in Pasadena, California, sweeping the floor.  And they got word to this person that my grandfather would be there on the train.  And over a period of six years, the family--his siblings of Mary and Oscar Worrill that remained in, in Georgia, over a period of six years, they relocated in shifts, through money saved and whatever resources that they could garner.  So my father was on the last shift.  So my father ended up in Pasadena, California in 1926 with his mother.  So my grandfather and grandmother were separated during this period, while they were putting resources together to relocate my father's sisters and the brothers who remained at home.  My father was a younger brother.  Some of the other brothers had already left home and gone to other places in the country.  And so that's sort of the origin of, of the family in Georgia.  My father talks about (unclear) Georgia--so my father ended up in Pasadena, California when he was thirteen years old.  And he talked a lot about growing up, about some of the incidents that occurred, a few incidents that occurred in his lifetime.  But unbeknowing to our family, when my family got to Pasadena, Jackie Robinson's family was--the baseball player, family was also in Pasadena, California and also come out of Georgia, close by.  I don't know if it was Covington or Cairo, Georgia.  And so they lived in a similar neighborhood.  So as time went on--my father talks about his experiences of when he first went to school in Pasadena.  And they, they put him in the fifth grade.  And here he was thirteen, hovering over, height-wise, the other children.  And how incensed he was by that.  And how he sort of committed and dedicated himself to getting up to par academically so he wouldn't be in a class with little kids where he was thirteen.  They put him in the fifth grade.  And so finally, over a period of time he was able to meet the standards for, for his grade level.  So he went to Washington Junior High School [Washington Middle School, Pasadena, California].  And at Washington Junior High School is where he met Jackie Robinson's oldest brother, [Matthew] Mack Robinson.  And eventually they went to John Muir High School, the famous track school there in Pasadena, California.  And so my father went from Washington Elementary [School] to Washington Junior High School to John Muir High School there in Pasadena, California.  And this is--by now, we're looking at 1930, 1931, '32 [1932].  And he talked, my father talked a lot about growing up in Pasadena and, and the athletics that he was engaged in and, and particularly, track and field because in 1932, my father had a picture of the State, members of the State track team.  He, he drilled this in me so much, I can almost remember some of the names of the participants on this 1932 John Muir High School track team that won the state championship in Palo Alto, California.  And my father talked about the coach who was a white man, and I can't remember his name, and how they drove from Pasadena, Palo Alto in a Model T [Ford automobile], and they were all packed in this car.  And they won the state championship by a few points.  But on that team was Mack Robinson, my uncle, Brainard Worrill, a man by the name of Darryl Cunningham, a white fellow by the name of William Sankster, and my father.  And I think there was one other person.  But my father kept this picture in a frame on his--everywhere we lived.  And for winning the state track meet, the, the coach and the school gave them a gold chain with a miniature track around the track shoes that said, "John Muir High School State Champs, 1932."  So I grew up knowing this history about, about my father and the, the men, particularly, that he grew up and their involvement in athletics.  And so as a very young person, for some reason or another, you know, I had developed to read my father's yearbooks.  So, you know, I used to get his yearbooks and go through the yearbooks, particularly, the sports sections and look at what they were doing in 1931, 1932, etc., etc.  My mother, as I indicated, her family was from Lafayette, Louisiana.  And as I pointed out, her, she never knew her parents because it, it--two weeks after her birth, they perished in the pneumonia epidemic.  And somehow there were some family members that were in Southern California.  I'm not quite clear on how they got there, why they went there, but her, one of her older brothers--my mother's maiden name was Gravenburg.  And one of her older brothers, Conrad Gravenburg, took my mother in.  And his wife that he was married to at that time, they raised my mother in Los Angeles, California.  And so that's kind--that's why, when I was born, my mother, I guess wanted to name me after the, her uncle because she was so indebted to him because he took her in as a, as a baby and raised her.
Story_ID: 20411
Speaker 1: Now, are you the oldest or--
Speaker 2: I'm--there are two of us.
Speaker 1: Can you name your siblings in birth order for us?
Speaker 2: My siblings?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My--I, I have a older daughter, Michelle, whose--
Speaker 1: You mean sister--
Speaker 2: No, you're talking about my brothers and sisters?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I only have one brother, Oscar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, I thought you wanted me to rattle off the list of mine.  Okay, no, my brother is Oscar.  That's an interesting story about him.
Speaker 1: He's younger than you, right?
Speaker 2: Ten years.  He was born in 1951.
Story_ID: 20412
Speaker 1: So my mother [AnnaBell Gravenburg Worrill] and father [Walter Fleming Worrill], when my mother was twelve or thirteen, there was lady over in Pasadena [California] who raised, who was a, a person who took in young girls who needed a place to stay, like a foster mother-type.  And somehow they found out about Mrs. Pearsall.  And I don't know all the details of how my mother ended up, but she moved over to Pasadena, and she lived with Mr. and Mrs. Pearsall.  And my mother too ended up going to John Muir High School [Pasadena, California] and then on to Pasadena City College.  But my mother and father met in the First AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church in Pasadena.  My father was very involved in, in the church activities there in Pasadena, in the small black community.  And my mother was involved in the church.  And, so they met through the church activities.  That's how they--because my father was six years older than my mother.  So they didn't really know each other in school.  They met in, in the church.  And so they were married in 1940.  Now, what's interesting about my father is that he, when he finished John Muir High School, he--I guess maybe he was nineteen, close to twenty [years old], he worked a lot of different jobs.  But he didn't have any--and he went on to Pasadena Junior College [later Pasadena City College].  It's one thing when you study the development of the junior college system in, in this country, you find that California was, was sort of a forerunner of the junior college system.  They had six years of elementary school, two years in junior high, which in some instances, the language is middle school, and three years of high school, and two years of free junior college.  This was the California system.  So my father was just almost part of the educational process in California for many students when they finished high school, they just went right on to a junior college in their local area.  So in Pasadena, there was Pasadena Junior College.  So my father went on to Pasadena Junior College.  And he, he worked and so forth.  My father was not a great athlete.  He was a, a pretty good track man.  My father ran the 440 [meter race], but my uncle [Brainard Worrill], my uncle was a speed burner.  And, you know, they talk about the fact that my uncle--they would dig holes.  They didn't even run out of starting blocks.  And he was running a 100 [yard dash] in 9.6, 9.7 [seconds], back in 1934 and 1935.  And they--in the community, my father always talked about the competition that was going on in the black community among the athletes who ran track, "Who was the fastest?  Was it [Matthew] Mack Robinson?  Was it Brainard Worrill?  Was it Tommy somebody?"  And so they had great conversations and great competition about that.  And my uncle also was a football player.  He, he was an end.  And they say he was quite a defensive end.  He was, he had sort of broad shoulders, he was built very sturdily and they said he was very, very strong.  So my father was a, an average quarter-miler.  He ran his time, back during that time, he said he ran around a 51-something [seconds] and so forth.  And he talked a, he talked a lot about what it took, when I was growing up to run the 440 cause when you finished the 440, often you would vomit because you were so exhausted, if you ran the whole distance.  So I grew up in that kind of a family background.  They say that my grandfather [Oscar Worrill], for whatever reason, when I was born, used to hold me in the, in the swing in the backyard on--I can't remember the street in Pasadena.  There was two or three streets that black people lived on in Pasadena, California.  Now, Pas--now, granted, if you can imagine Pasadena, you know, the home of the Rose Bowl [stadium and football game], the Tournament of Roses Parade.  Well, where the black community was, was right up a dirt road from the Rose Bowl.  That's where the black folk lived.  That's where the poor people in Pasadena, California lived.  And so they say that when I was born, a lot of other of my father's sisters had children who--so my grandfather and grandmother [Mary Fleming Worrill] had other grandchildren who were born before me, but for some reason, since my father--now, my father's married my mother, which is a whole nother story in and of itself, but he would hold me, they say, in this swing, in the backyard everyday for the first six months of my life until he passed.  And they said he would spend the afternoons or a good portion of the day just talking to me.  And they said he was obsessed with this.  And he would just talk and talk and hold and coo me or whatever my grandfather was doing.  So that was the story I grew up on, about how this, my grandfather seemed to have favored me out of all the grandchildren that were coming in the world.  And I guess--maybe it was because my mother and father actually lived in his house.
Story_ID: 20413
Speaker 1: So my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] went on to [Pasadena] Junior College [later Pasadena City College, Pasadena, California].  He was working and this, that and the other.  And he started--I guess he was going with my mother [AnnaBell Gravenburg Worrill], and he started--he didn't have money to go on to finish a 4-year degree.  And I remember--for some reason or another, my father was a very meticulous record keeper.  And he was, he had a very legible handwriting.  This is the total opposite of me.  But at any rate, somehow he had to write a paper when he was in junior college about what he wanted to be.  It was sort of like a final paper.  What do you want to do in life-type paper.  And he said he wanted to go into Sociology.  Well, he didn't have any money to go to a four-year school, so he started a gardening business.  Now, in Pasadena [California], there were a lot of wealthy white families who owned estates with swimming pools and tennis courts and so forth.  And this one particular family of this one lady, her name was Ms. Fleming. (laughs)  And my father's mother's [Mary Fleming Worrill] maiden name was Fleming.  And my father used to do her lawn.  And his brother [Brainard Worrill] would help him.  He got a truck.  He got, managed to get equipment.  And he was doing pretty good at earning an income doing the landscaping really of some of these large mansions in the Pasadena area.  And so one day, my father told me this story, I don't know how many times, but Ms. Fleming used to ask my father, "When are you going to go to college?"  And, "When are you gonna go finish your degree, Walt?"  And my father said that, you know, he, he would be angered by this white woman asking him when is he going to college, knowing he doesn't have any money to go to college.  He's here working, cutting her grass.  "What do--how in the hell am I gonna go to college?"  So my father to get Ms. Fleming up off of him--from asking him that question, he went somewhere, and he found some college applications, just to derail her from asking him this question every time he went to do her, her lawn and do her, her property.  And he gave her these applications.  The way my father describes it, several months later he received a letter from Whittier College [Whittier, California] saying that he had been admitted to Whittier College and that his tuition had been paid.  And the person who paid his tuition was Mrs. Fleming.  So my father went to Whittier College.  This is a white lady and this--some of--.
Speaker 2: That's where [U.S. President] Richard [Milhous] Nixon went to school too.
Speaker 1: Where Nixon went to college.  It's a Quaker school there in Southern California.  So, I guess as a result of this, Ms. Fleming sort of--I guess she wanted to help a black person, kind of attitude.  And so my mother, my mother and father often were invited to come, while he was in school, to come to her house on a Sunday for dinner or whatever.  And Ms. Fleming, somehow--this must have been 1940--whatever, 1941, something like that--1942, really.  She took pictures of, of--she documented me in film.  She had a camera.  And they used to show pictures of me at the family gatherings of films that Ms. Fleming had taken of me on her property.  So I--Ms. Fleming was--I don't know who has that footage now, but Ms. Fleming was sort of a story, the white story in our family because she was, in fact, responsible for paying my father's tuition.  So upon completion--and the other interesting thing, my grandmother, who was involved with the, with the, the female wing of the Masonics [fraternity], the--I've forgotten--
Speaker 2: Eastern Star?
Speaker 1: My grandmother was a Eastern Star.  They said she was a leader.  She was a, kind of a tall, brown-skinned black woman, very proud type black woman.  But she was kind of a pillar from what they say.  But she told my father--she got very ill toward the end of his college, going to college.  Now, my father was going to college, working.  He was married.  He had an old beat-up car.  Whittier must have been seventy miles or fifty miles from Pasadena, and he was doing all of this studying at night, burning the midnight oil and all the--but she told him that she wasn't gonna die until he got his degree, until he--it was officially known that he had completed his requirements for his bachelors degree.  And when it, that was announced, and my father graduated, my grandmother died.  And my grand, my grandfather [Oscar Worrill] died six months later.  And, of course, I told you the story about him.  So my family history is, from that standpoint, was drilled into me.  I mean, I, I grew up on my father talking about this and, and so the question became now, what was my father gonna do after--a black man in 1941 or '42 [1942] having a degree in Pasadena, California?  Where was he gonna work?  And he wanted to be a soc-, he majored in Sociology at Whitter College, (laughs) which was a pretty--in those days, which was a precursor to social work, so--a the undergraduate level.
Story_ID: 20414
Speaker 1: So my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] somehow ended up working--I guess he had done some part-time work at the colored Y [Young Men's Christian Association] in Pasadena [California].  And so when he graduated from, from Whittier [College, Whittier, California], he was offered a position at the 28th Street YMCA, which was the black YMCA in Los Angeles, California.  Now, you know, this is the build-up of World War II, right?  So, you know, the question is, did my father go to the [U.S.] Army?  No, he did not go to the Army because when he was drafted, the YMCA intervened on his behalf because the 28th--the YMCA of Los Angeles, 28th Street branch had a contract with the Armed Forces.  And it was an overseas replacement station.  So it was a YMCA that had residents' rooms.  And they were using--renting out the resident rooms to people who were either going overseas or coming back from overseas.  So they said, "That if this was the case, then Walt Worrill should not have to go into the military," because he was performing a military duty, administering the YMCA, etc., etc., so he got a deferment.  And during the war years, my father was the head of the 28th Street YMCA in Pasadena.  Now, when the war ended, he was offered a position, and I guess the first black professional to be hired in the Pasadena YMCA because the (unclear)--it was a little, small black community.  There were some Mexican people, Spanish-speaking people as I remember.  And there was this section of Pasadena that had this black community.  So they said, "Look, we're gonna have it--rent out some space in an agency, Walt, and we want you to be the Program Director up on the hill where the, where the colored folks are.  And you do programming for the, for them at the Y."  So my father took this position, and he was the Program Director.  And so as a little boy, I remember going with my father to all, to all of these outings.  He was very, he, he was really--he really would fire me up.  I would just love to go with my father because we would go on trips.  And we would go to the Y, and we would have all these activities, these outings and this, that and the other.  But also, by 1946 or '47 [1947], I don't know how--why I was so interested in what my father was doing, but by this time, I think--well, during the war years, my father rented a house.  There were no apartments in Pasadena.  Everybody lived in a house or families lived in a house.  But during the war years, my father rented a home from somebody who was in the service.  And when the person came back, when the war was over, you know, he wanted his house back.  So we moved in with Ms. Pearsall and her husband.  And I can remember my father having what appeared to be, in hindsight, secret meetings, you know, where these men would sit around.  And they were talking about this, that and the other.  And they were, they were in deep conversation.  Well, I found out in years later that my father was the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Pasadena.  And there were some racial issues that they were organizing about.
Story_ID: 20415
Speaker 1: You were discussing your father's [Walter Fleming Worrill] involvement in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 2: Sitting around with the men in these, what appeared to be clandestine, secret meetings of a small group of men.  The issues--now, this is all hindsight.  I'm six or seven years old, okay.  But what they were doing and what was revealed to me as I grew, grew older was that, one, my father was the head of NAACP in Pasadena [California].  And there were, it was an issue in Brookside Park [Pasadena, California].  Brookside Park was the park where the Rose Bowl [stadium] was.  And they had a big outside, Olympic-sized swimming pool.  And black people--this is, this is a public park--black people were not allowed to swim in the pool.  And when they did allow black people to swim in the pool, they would drain the pool, put some more water in it, and then when the black people were finished, they would re-drain--take the water out and put the water back in for the white people.  And there were only two days a week that the black people could swim--the colored folks, as they were called then.  So this was an issue that the NAACP of Pasadena took on.  And they protested and demonstrated this policy and were successful in getting the, the city officials or I guess it must have been some kind of park department in Pasadena, to stop that policy that would enrage and insulted black people.  The other issues that there were no black--there was now a substantial black population in Pasadena.  We're talking about 1947, 1948.  So they decided--.
Speaker 1: What percentage of the population would you say was black?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, it was maybe 70, 80, 100--90,000 people in Pasadena at that particular time.  And there might have been 8 percent, 7 to 8 percent black people in, in Pasadena.  But there were no, there was no representation of that percentage.  There were no blacks on the police department, no black firefighters, no blacks in civil service in the post office, etc.  So they took on this issue of--because there was--black people, of course, lived in their own little community, and there were no black police officers to do the policing in the black community.  So they made that an issue.  And they fought to get the first black policemen on the police department in Pasadena.  And it turned out to be one of my daddy's classmates named [Raymond] Ray Bartlett.  Ray Bartlett became the first black man on the police department, and then following Ray Bartlett was my father's other schoolmate Ralph Riddle.  Now, I remember these guys because they were athletes.  They ran track and football.  As a matter of fact, Ray Bartlett was one of Jackie Robinson's best friends.  So from there they, they fought the fire department, and then they fought for the fair testing in civil service so somebody could be a postal worker and this kind of thing.  So my father was a, I guess you could say, as I reflect back on it, he was a leader, a civic leader in, in the black community and in all of Pasadena.  I can even remember going to some churches, some white churches where my father was the keynote speaker to talk about race relations in Pasadena.  And in my older years, I indicated to you that my father kept his speeches and he was very meticulous.  And I would read these things and so forth and so on.  So that was the background or the environment in which I was raised.  And I, my--I forgot to point out, my mother [AnnaBell Gravenburg Worrill] was a singer.  My mother was the first black person to sing in the Pasadena Philharmonic Opera in Pasadena at the famous Pasadena Philharmonic Orchestra [sic, Pasadena Civic Auditorium].  It was kind of like the Orchestra Hall of Pasadena.  It was the classical music auditorium, and my mother was a part of this.  And my mother sang in different languages.  She was a soprano, and she had a very powerful--anybody who got married or at funerals in Pasadena, she was one of the more popular persons that was asked to sing.  And she had such a powerful voice, I even remember crying when my mother would sing 'The Lord's Prayer'.  And then the Classical, the famous Classical song, 'Avé Maria' and so forth.  So my mother was, was into music and a singer.  So I remember that as a little kid because my, my, you know, the--she put in a lot of time practicing and, and so forth and so on.  So by 1949, now, my father--they had relocated my father from his little colored branch, and he actually had an office in the main YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Pasadena.  And, and that was a big deal because he was the first black.  And so he was the Program Director--he was what they called the Boys Work Secretary.  That was his title.  I never will forget it because he was over all of the programming for males, which included in the summertime, being the Camp Director.  And the Y owned two camps, one in Mount Wilson, up in the mountains of California and the other was Camp Catalina, which was on the Catalina Islands.  So I had the experience as a little boy, going with my father two summers to camp, one on Catalina Island and one up in the mountains at Mount Wilson.
Speaker 1: And he was in charge of it?
Speaker 2: He was in charge of all white, all white children, all white boys.  I was the only little black kid in the camp, maybe one or two, but I don't remember it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know that made you feel special.
Speaker 2: No, I, I was just, I didn't feel anything.  I mean this was just Pasadena.  As a matter of fact--.
Speaker 1: It didn't affect you in any way?  It didn't make you--.
Speaker 2: Maybe in hindsight--I'm gonna tell you how it affected me, but that's--this, we're getting ahead because I also went to the Pacific Oaks Nursery School [sic, Pacific Oaks Friends School, now Pacific Oaks Children's School, Pasadena, California], which was the elite nursery school of Southern California that the Quakers--I was the only black in this nursery school.  And the instructors and the student teachers at that school were graduate--undergraduate students from UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles, California].  And they were doing studies on children and so forth.  And they--so, and my mother taught at this school.  My mother did not complete her degree, but it was a nursery school.  And she had training in education or whatever.  So I went to Pacific Oaks Nursery School.
Story_ID: 20416
Speaker 1: In 1949, my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] was offered a job to come to Chicago [Illinois] to, to be the head of the famous Wabash [Avenue] YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  And my father had never flown on a plane.  This was a big deal, you know, and he came out here to Chicago.  And every plane I heard fly over in the house we were living in, I thought it was my daddy, you know, going to Chicago.  So I'm eight years old or so.  So my father accepted the job.  And on August 15th, 1950, we went down to the train station on the [Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway] Super Chief [passenger train] because the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago paid for my father to come to Chicago on the Super Chief, which was Pullman--.
Speaker 2: That's your birthday too?
Speaker 1: That was my birthday.  It was the, my birthday.  That's why I remember it so well.  It was my ninth birthday.  And there were thousands of black people at the train station.  It was the whole black community came to the train station, and they showered my father with all kinds of gifts that were on those flatbeds that you put luggage on.  And it was Walt Worrill.  He was just some kind of person that they really--people, people were crying about my father leaving Pasadena [California].  So we came to--we got here.  It was about two days.  We got here on Marcus Garvey's birthday, August the 17th, 1950, interestingly enough.  So this began my Chicago experience.  And we lived at 826 S. Wabash [Avenue] at the YMCA Hotel.  The YMCA Hotel was the a ninth--it was the largest YMCA in world, nineteen stories.  It was a hotel, YMCA situation.  And we stayed there for several weeks because housing in Chicago at that time was very difficult for black people who wanted to live in decent housing, you had to know somebody.  And the black community was contained in certain areas where, where the black community resided.  So they--,
Speaker 2: Where was this again?  I'm sorry,
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: No, the Wabash Y, I mean the Y?
Speaker 1: 826--it's a condominium there now.  826 S. Wabash.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The YMCA sold that property some years ago.
Speaker 2: But somehow or another my parents enrolled me in [John] Farren Elementary School at 51st [Street] and State [Street, Chicago, Illinois].  And man, was that an experience.  That was my introduction to Chicago.  And the impact of my upbringing in Southern California was very pronounced because I was having difficulty making an adjustment.  This was an all-black school.  My mother [AnnaBell Gravenburg Worrill] dressed me in little short pants and long socks and buck shoes.  And we used to have--I'd take the train, the streetcar from 8th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue] up to 51st Street, but after about two or three weeks, one day--the kids were teasing me all along that I talked like a white boy.  And this one day, I was coming down the steps from school.  I'd been there about three weeks, and somebody thumped me on the back of my head, and somebody else thumped me on, and somebody else pushed me and shoved me.  And I got scared.  And I ran out of that school.  I ran out on the playground, and I ran all the way to 8th and, and Wabash.  And I got on the elevator, and I went upstairs.  I was crying to my mother.  I was devastated.  I had never had this kind of physical confrontation in my life.  So finally, I guess, my father appealed to movers and shakers in the Y's [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] structure to get this little child of theirs into something so he can go to school and make this adjustment to Chicago.  And so somehow, somebody pulled some strings, and I ended up going to [William H.] Ray School at 56th and Kimbark [Avenue] in Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: That's near the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, it's a public school, but it was in that neighborhood, Hyde Park.  So interestingly enough, while my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] was on the train coming from California, he met a waiter.  And this waiter told my father that, if when he got to Chicago [Illinois], if he had difficulty getting housing, give him a call.  And by this time we had been living in the hotel for a month, and my father had not had any success in finding housing.  So he, he took the gentleman up on this--I'm blocking on his name right now.  He called him up and he owned an apartment building--this is a waiter on the train, at 5640 S. Maryland [Avenue].  And we moved there.  And so, so for the next several years as I was growing up, we lived at 56th [Street].  And that was interesting because the famous deejay in Chicago, Al Benson, owned a home right next door to the apartment building that we lived.  And the renowned Sociologist and Anthropologist, St. Clair Drake and his family lived on the second floor in a co-op [cooperative] right next to our building.  So I used to ask my daddy, "This guy is crazy.  He smokes all these cigarettes and he types at night, is he--?"  You know, so that was the environment.
Story_ID: 20417
Speaker 1: I went on through grade school and, and I, I--I had a ritual.  Everyday after I had to go to the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association].  So I learned the public transportation.  So then I, I was going to this predominantly white public school [William H. Ray School, Chicago, Illinois] that was sort of the elite public schools in Chicago, I had to go on the low end everyday to the Wabash [Avenue] Y and my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] was the head.  And so I began to participate in the activities of the Y.  And I began to have these proclivities to get involved in athletics and activities of the Y--youth leadership, the swimming team, the gymnastics, track and began to play basketball, whatever the YMCA had, I was in it.
Speaker 2: Now, can you give us some idea of the significance of the Wabash Y.  I know it has a little history.
Speaker 1: Well, the Wabash Y was built in 1912.  And it was built primarily because the Pullman--the black Pullman Porters in Chicago didn't have housing that they could stay in.  So some of the black leadership at that time, along with some white philanthropists, [Julius] Rosenwald being one of them, said, look, if you all raise some money, I'll match the money.  And I'll get some other corporate, if you will, sponsorship to build this Y for the colored people.  So the, so, and so that was the genesis of how the Wabash Y was built, primarily because the train station wasn't far.  And when the Pullman Porters ended their shift, they could walk from the train station over to the Y to have a place to sleep.  And then it also served as a place for transient people who came here to work or go to school.  And so it had a history of well-known, renowned black people staying in the Y, like W.E.B. DuBois, Carter [Godwin] Woodson.  And, of course, in 1915, Carter Woodson actually began the discussions that led to the founding of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in the cafeteria of the Wabash YMCA in 1915.  So the Wabash Y was sort of the center of, of youth and community and recreation programming, as well as residential housing for people who needed a place to stay in transient kind of situation until they could get settled in the city.  So by the time my father got there in 1915 [sic, 1950]--it was a, a premier institution in the black community that was well known for the services that it rendered to the community.  And so it was in that context that my father became the head.  I think my father might have been the third or fourth Executive Director.  I mean to get--back in those days, the YMCA was, kind of functioned like the church.  Their top people, they farmed them out to the colored Ys around the country to head up those YMCAs because they were trained, professional, YMCA professionals.  And so that's what began my father's career in Chicago.  And it began my growing up years in the city.  And so that was a--you know, I got involved in track.  I was a very good swimmer.  We--and the swimming, the swimming--the racial consciousness part of my life when I reflect back on it, was probably spawned when Joe Louis [boxer] would fight because when I was a little boy in Pasadena [California], we used to--when Joe Louis had a fight, my father and other men would sit around the radio and listen to Joe Louis who beat this white man.  I mean that was it.  And so I, you know, like, hey, Joe Louis.  And, but, my own personal experiences with the, the racial phenomenon in America really started in swimming because somehow or another black people were not supposed to be good swimmers.  And when we went to swimming meets, we were jeered at other white, predominantly white YMCAs.  Swimming was--competition was very stiff in this city.  And so our swimming coach, Roy Lewis, and Rudy Harlow, they would always tell us, "Look, do not--go in there and do your best because this, we can win.  And I don't care about those, what those white people say about us not being able to swim, we're gonna go out here today, and we're going to show them."  And so we would walk into the swimming pool there, and we had our little blue swimming--and we would march in very proudly.  And we wouldn't say anything.  And we took the abuse of the people sneering and making little remarks and laughing at the little niggers coming in the pool.  And we would kick ass.  And we became known as the--we, we got quite a reputation during the period that I was a swimmer at the Y.  We had some of the top times in the state, in the country.  And, and, and by this time, we had demystified this whole idea that black folks couldn't swim and folk--people would come to the swimming meet just to see these little sharks, these little black, nigger sharks in the pool, kicking white boys' ass who were supposed to be the top swimmers and so forth.  And so I kind of grew up--I got into understanding that there was something wrong with America, in their attitudes about race as a result of my swimming experiences.  As a matter of fact, we went to a swim meet in Springfield, Illinois, and they wouldn't let us stay in the hotel.  And my coach raised a lot of hell, and we had to do this, that and the other to get us some rooms--it was the State YMCA Swimming Championship.  Then I got into track.  And I was--turned out, I was very good in track.  I found out I could jump real high and so forth, and so I participated in track and field at the highest level for what was available at that time.  And that was called the Junior Olympics.  And I remember when I was thirteen, I--in my long jump, I had the best long jump of any thirteen-year-old in America.  I think I long jumped 19 feet, 11-1/2 [inches] or something like that.  They would, they said, "This kid is getting ready to be real way out in this long jump."  But I was into all sports.  And so that's what I did, four days a week, Wabash Y, [William H. Ray School Chicago, Illinois], Ray--I played softball.  I marveled at hitting the ball up on top of the roof at Ray School.  So whatever sport there was, you found Conrad [Worrill].  But what was interesting, other things were happening.  Somehow, you know, I was this person that was always at the forefront of whatever was going on with the kids in the neighborhood and in school and what have you.  And I hadn't really thought about it until I began thinking about this, doing this project in this HistoryMakers, but I was the president of my eighth grade graduating class at Ray School--it was all white.  And it was about three black kids, three or four black kids in the class.  And so I couldn't wait to get to high school because in my--the Wabash Y had a camp, Camp Arthur [Bruceville, Indiana].  And the older men who were the counselors, some of them were athletes, high school and college athletes.  And so one summer one of the assistant counselors had played basketball at Hyde Park [High School, later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois], Tommy Clark.  And they had just won the city Championship at the frosh-soph [freshman-sophomore] level.  And I couldn't wait--and I had heard that Hyde Park had some tremendous players over in Hyde Park.  That was the school in my neighborhood, and so I was going to Hyde Park.  And I was gonna be a star at Hyde Park.  I just knew it and so forth and so on.  So when I went to Hyde Park High School, I mean I was so excited.  That's all I could think about was going out for the football team and, and so forth. So it, during that period--this is fall of 1955.
Story_ID: 20418
Speaker 1: Now, now, let me back up for a minute because when we got to Chicago [Illinois], you know, Jackie Robinson in 1949 went into the, 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the so-called 'color barrier' in baseball--from Pasadena [California].  So Pasadena now was on the map because of Jackie Robinson.  Well, the Robinsons, the Worrills, these, these black families.  So a backdrop to this is 1936 Olympics, my--[Matthew] Mack Robinson [Jackie Robinson's brother] made the U.S. Olympic team from a junior college, Pasadena Junior College [now Pasadena City College, Pasadena, California] in 1936.  My uncle tried out for the 1936 Olympics and pulled a muscle in the trials in the coliseum in Los Angeles, California.  But--.
Speaker 2: This is Brainard Worrill, right?
Speaker 1: This is Brainard Y. Worrill, a smoker.  Okay, him and Mack would go neck and neck, according to my daddy [Walter Fleming Worrill], depending on who was failing.  But Mack, now, made the U.S. Olympic team from a junior college in Pasadena in Berlin, Germany.  And none of this connected until, you know, you grow and you begin to connect this history.  This man is my godfather.  This was my daddy's best friend.  So--.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I mean with Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe?
Speaker 1: Well, yes.  If you look at the film of the Olympics of '36 [1936], in the semi-final, Mack Robinson broke the U.S.--the World Olympic record in the 200 meters at 20.7 [seconds].  In the finals, he and Jesse squared up, neck and neck, and if you look at the footage of that, Mack was coming up on the end on Jesse--this was the Olympics, the controversy of the Olympics with [Adolf] Hitler and so forth, and Jesse won four gold medals.  Well, Mack was the silver medalist.  And my father has a copy of the telegram he sent Mack in 1936 in Berlin, to congratulate him.  And that's a whole another story because Mack Robinson became sort of a tragic figure in the history of, of athletics in Pasadena.  I mean this is way ahead of the story.  Pasadena has finally acknowledged Mack Robinson, who passed a few years ago.  And they have a statue in Pasadena in front of City Hall of Mack Robinson and Jackie Robinson that they raised money for these two great athletes who contribute out of Pasadena.  But most people know of, of Jackie.  But most, but people were not aware of the great athletic contributions that Mack Robinson--Mack Robinson was a tremendous long jumper.  And to show you how life works, this is way, way ahead of the story, but this is my godfather.  And when Jesse Owens passed away--what? 1980?  One day I came home, and there was this station wagon in front of my house at 87th [Street] and Harper [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And it had California license plates on it.  And I looked, and I said, "Who in the world could this be?"  And I looked in the car; it was Mack, sleeping, waiting for me to get home.  He had driven all the way from Pasadena to be at Jesse Owens's funeral.  So we went over to the Windermere Hotel and here were all these great Olympians from the late '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], the people that I had known who were some of the greatest black track and field athletes in the history of the Olympics.  So, but back to Hyde Park High School [later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois], as a freshman.  So I--well, not actually Hyde Park, we were talking about Jackie Robinson breaking in the [baseball] major leagues.  So when my father moved here, somehow there was a connection that my father had to Jackie, and Jackie said, whenever you come to Wrigley Field [Chicago, Illinois], you know, I'll have some tickets for you, just call up, do something and so forth.  So the greatest thing, one of the great things we did when we got here, after about a year, was to ride up on the el [elevated] train with the black folks going to see the Brooklyn [New York] Dodgers [baseball team] and Jackie Robinson and to sit with the black folks in Wrigley Field with chicken baskets, to watch Jackie Robinson play baseball.  If I, if--that was a thrilling experience.  I never--I mean I would almost have to go to the bathroom on myself because all these black folks from the South Side [of Chicago] trying to get tickets.  Everybody was sitting in the same section at Wrigley Field to see Jackie Robinson.  And we were proud cause we could go up to the box cause my daddy knew Jackie Robinson.  And Jackie Robinson left a free ticket for Walt Worrill.  So as time went on, my father kept making overtures to Jackie in his busy schedule now to come--at one of his baseball games against the [Chicago, Illinois] Cubs [baseball team], to, if he could set aside some time and be a speaker at a fundraiser because my father, back in those days, well, the YMCAs [Young Men's Christian Association] and institutions had to be supported by the community.  That's the way it worked.  They had their own budget pretty much and so--their own Board of Directors.  So my father--that was part of his duty.  So he got Jackie Robinson--I think this was 1953, if I'm not mistaken.  I was like--yeah, it had, I must have been in the seventh grade.  And my father got Jackie committed to this summer date to speak.  And in those days, the banquets were in the gym.  They would turn the gym into this banquet hall, put tables in the gym, put white cloths; all the cooking was done in the cafeteria in the Y.  And it was a big thing, $25.00, Jackie Robinson, standing room--you couldn't--I mean it was a day that I will never forget.  So everybody was just ecstatic.  37th and 38th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], thousands of people who could not buy tickets, afford tickets, they just wanted to see Jackie Robinson pull up in a limousine and walk in the Y, Wabash Y, and be a speaker.  Well, whatever time Jackie Robinson was supposed to speak, he was not there.  An hour had passed.  He was not there.  My father was pacing.  He was all of--he, he was, my father was ballistic.  And people were beginning to say that Walt Worrill was scamming them.  They wanted their money back, and Jackie Robinson wasn't coming.  And, you know how our people can get when they think that somebody ripped them off, right?  So the word went out in the community that, that, that Walt Worrill had ran a scam, and, you know, word of mouth back in those days, traveled instantly--.
Speaker 2: These were a matter of hours.
Speaker 1: This is a matter of hours, but there was call at the switchboard from Wrigley Field, and no one was watching television or listening to the game on radio--it was an extra-inning game.  And so Jackie was delayed.  And so Jackie Robinson finally came, and the word went back out in the community.  And all those people who had left were back out on the street.  As a matter of fact, it was even more people.  And so Jackie Robinson spoke in the gymnasium at the Wabash Y because his old Pasadena friend, Walt Worrill, had extended this invitation.
Story_ID: 20419
Speaker 1: I told my friends that, you know, that my daddy [Walter Fleming Worrill] knew Jackie Robinson.  My--first of all, the kids on my block, they said, "Ah, you know, you know, Conrad, why are you lying, you're exaggerating.  Your father doesn't know Jackie Robinson."  Now, this is the baseball card period, you know, Willie Mays, Larry Doby, Monte Irvin, Joe Black, Roy Campanella, it was a handful of blacks.  You know, it was Mickey Mantle versus Roy Campanella or Willie Mays.  So, you, you know, we're pulling for Willie Mays and white boys with Mickey Mantle.  I mean it was just the way it was as a kid growing up with your bubble gum cards.  So nobody believed that I, my family, had any kind of connection to, to Jackie Robinson.  So, knowing that he was gonna speak at the [Wabash Avenue] Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Assocation, Chicago, Illinois], I told everybody, all my friends in the neighborhood that Jackie Robinson was going to drive me home.  Now, I was, what, twelve years old.  And so after Jackie spoke and he was in my father's office, I went up to him, I said, "Mr. Robinson, would you give me a ride home?"  And my father said, "Conrad, would you leave Jackie alone and let--and go on about your business."  He said, "Oh, no, Walt.  [Matthew] Mack [Robinson] told me about his godson, blah, blah, blah.  No, he can ride with me.  I'll drop him."  And he, that day he had [Jim] Junior Gilliam with him.  He brought Junior Gilliam.  So everybody's in the office trying to get autographs, and so Jackie's got to get back, you know.  They stayed at the Drake Hotel [Chicago, Illinois].  I remember that's where the Brooklyn [New York] Dodgers stayed, at the Drake Hotel.  So I'm walking out, down the steps with Jackie Robinson and the entourage.  And people shooting and this and that and the other.  And I'm just as happy as I could be.  My father is shaking his head, "How did my son pull that off?"  And I get into the limousine with Jackie Robinson.  And Jackie Robinson drove--had the limousine driver drive us to 5640 S. Maryland [Avenue] to our apartment.  And we pulled up in front of there, and the whole block was lit up.  And I stepped out of that limousine like, I told you I knew Mr. Robinson and blah, blah, blah.  So that, that was another little tidbit in my life, and this Jackie Robinson when people talk about the Robinson family.  As a matter of fact, in one of the books, the biography of Jackie Robinson, they mention this, his connection to Walt Worrill and speaking at the Wabash Y in one of the biographies of, of Jackie.  So I grew up--now, I'm getting immersed into Chicago.
Story_ID: 20420
Speaker 1: What were the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, let me just tell you that Chicago was like another world to me.  First, sound, (shouting) "Watermelon Maaaan!"  I had never--the first time I heard that, I, I couldn't--I looked out the back and a donkey was pulling a cart down the alley with some watermelons and somebody saying water--I, now, I had--that was a, that was a sound.  A smell was the stockyards.  And every--during the week at certain times, I can't remember, there was a smell that hovered the South Side of Chicago that you had to--after a while I guess we, you became anesthetized to it.  But it was a tremendous odor.  So that was because of the stockyard.  And so that was--the other sound was the tremendous amount of sirens, police cars and elevated trains, which was much different from Southern California in terms of my experiences.  So those were the sights and sounds that I remember.
Story_ID: 20421
Speaker 1: You're a professor by occupation.  And I just wondered if you, if there were--you talk a lot about sports and what are the ideas and ilks that influenced you when you were young?  Or at (unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) How to play baseball.
Speaker 1: And any of the teachers that influenced you?
Speaker 2: How to play--look, I'm trying to make a point, major point that I used to go to the library and check out books on how to play second base, okay.  I, I, I used to read books related to athletics.  That's how I really got an interest in reading.  I would go to the library and read books about sports heroes, books and manuals on football and how to coach football.  I mean this is what, this, this was my whole thing.  I didn't get into that aspect of my life until--but in my house, in my house, my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] was a religious reader of black newspapers.  And every week, we got the 'Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] Courier'.  And he--the 'Chicago [Illinois] Defender' was a weekly paper.  And somehow or another, I'd always read it.  But where would, what section of the paper would I go to?  The sports section, okay?  So, I knew about all the black colleges, the Negro College League and so forth and so on.  Of course, also, my father was a subscriber to 'Ebony' magazine.  He was a subscriber to 'JET' [magazine].  So anything my father read, as far as periodicals and magazines and newspapers, that's what I read.  So I--the academic part of the, the--what I've emerged into in terms of my professional life at this moment in history, didn't occur as far as heroes and black history until the--the heroes of, that I looked up to were living; Mr. Ellis, who was the Program Director of the [Wabash Avenue] Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Assocation], Mr. Gleason who was my gym teacher.  My Japanese gym teacher at [William H.] Ray School [Chicago, Illinois], Tom Teraji, whose, who was ironically, second-string tailback to Jackie Robinson at UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles, California], whose family was interned during World War II, who were of Japanese ancestry.  My heroes were Roy Lewis, who played football with Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and who was, worked at the Y and his brother, Fred [Lewis].  In fact, during those times also there was the famous annual Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]-Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] Football game at Comiskey Park [baseball stadium in Chicago, Illinois]--40,000 black people.  And, and the Y was really involved in hosting the players.  And they would have a reception at the Y.  And particularly, since Fred and Roy grew up in the Y, you know, the whole, the whole neighborhood.  And they grew up in the neighborhood, the whole YMCA network would go to Wrigley Field [baseball stadium] with the rest--Comiskey Park to--and I remember witnessing Fred and Roy play football against Wilberforce with 40,000 black people.  So the heroes of my, my coming up were live.  They were in, they were right in front of me.  Fred [D.] Hubbard, who eventually became an Alderman of the [Chicago, Illinois] Second Ward indicted, was my Playground Director, okay.  So all of the--Tanzell (ph.) up at camp [Camp Arthur, Bruceville, Indiana].  So that the heroes, if you will, during my era of growing up were people who were living and people who were demonstrating and people who influenced my development, who were extensions of my father and were men in the community, who were there.  Leighton Jackson's father, Mr. Jackson, never knew black people worked on the railroad and tried--and went on the railroad and sorted mail on the train.  And on the side, he was a photographer and took pictures.  So those were my heroes.  I didn't know anything any books in heroes.  I knew about the, the men I looked up to in the black community who I wanted to be like.  I wanted to, I wanted to be like a little--I wanted to be like all of them.  I wanted to be like Mr. Gleason.  I wanted to be like Mr. Ellis.  I wanted to be like Mr. Taylor and in a strange way, I admired Mr. Teraji, who was Asian because of the--he, he was second-string to--and I didn't even believe him.  I asked Jackie Robinson.  Mr. Robinson, when we were in the car, I had this burning desire.  I said, "Was Mr.--do you remember Tom Teraji?"  He said, "Oh, yeah, Tom played behind me at UCLA."
Story_ID: 20422
Speaker 1: So anyway, here I am, Hyde Park High School [later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois], fall of 1955.  I'm in the halls.  I'm a freshie [freshman].  And I'm, I'm ready to go.  I'm ready to throw down.  I'm, I'm, I'm in high school.  I have arrived.  I'm fourteen years old.  But you can't compete until your second semester.  Back in those--you, you could not compete in athletics until you had completed one semester of high school.  That was the policy.  But even back then, the coaches knew who the, who, who the new crop was cause they had heard of them.  And so they let us work out with the team.  So in my first semester, I was working out with the freshmen team, okay, getting ready for my second semester.  And so they had this system in which they called Frosh-Soph [freshman-sophomore].  So in 1A--and I was--they also knew that I was quite a high jumper from the [Wabash Avenue] YMCA [Young Men's Christian Assocation].  And then they wrote it up in the '[Chicago, Illinois] Defender', I could high jump pretty good.  And so the track coach knew that, that he had somebody built-in already whose walking, right there.  And so in my second semester of high school, I won the city championship in the junior division of, of the high jump at the University of Chicago [Henry Crown] Field House [Chicago, Illinois].  I, I just wiped out everybody because I'd already been trained.  The other kids didn't even know how to high jump.  You know, it was the Western roll with the flip and all of that.  So I just took a couple of jumps and won that.  And I ran some sprints and so forth and so on.  And I made the--in my 1A semester, I made--I was a--I just walked on to the Frosh-Soph cause they, they had the uniform waiting for me.  And I was the starting forward on the Vars--on the Frosh-Soph basketball team.  And then I could not wait, Larry, for spring football.  And so in, when spring football, it was a couple of weeks of spring football.  I already knew the plays cause I knew what system Hyde Park used cause I had studied it.  And I had--they used the UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles, California] unbalanced line, single wing offense.  And before I got to Hyde Park, I had gone to the library and read about those systems and so (laughs), I knew what Hyde Park's system was.  So when I went out for spring football in, this is like in the spring of 1956, I knew the whole, the numbering system.  I knew the alignment system and plus, I was real fast.  And Mr. Hasan, who was a Jewish--who turns out, [Elliot] Ellie Hasan was Abe Saperstein's, the owner of the [Harlem] Globetrotters, cousin.  He was the Athletic Director at Hyde Park.  I didn't know all that then.  But anyway, I go out for football.  I'm a star in spring practice.  They made me a wide receiver, what we call a wide receiver now because they were all seniors.
Speaker 2: You were a flanker (unclear) then, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was, I was a wing back.  They called it a wing back.  So, I, I, I'm in, okay, you know.  In my freshman year at Hyde Park, I got a varsity letter in track, okay, cause I--in the outdoor track, I won the high jump again.  And I think I placed in the 220 or something or another.  So I'm just flying.  I'm already in the flow.  I'm--but I can't wait for football season.  I can't wait till my sophomore year 'til my first high school football game.  Now, they wanted me to swim because they heard, they knew that I was a pretty, top-notch swimmer in the YMCA.  But, Larry, I'm gonna be honest with you.  I did not want to swim because nobody came to the swimming meet.  What's the point of being in competition--I wanted an audience, okay.  I wanted a sport to participate with pom-pom girls and cheerleaders and people in the stands.  And people to show your, your talents.  And so I, I said, "No, you're not getting"--they tried their best to get me to swim at Hyde Park.  So here I am, my first high school football game, I'm a starter.  A wing back starter on the varsity football team, sophomore at Hyde Park High School, speed-burner, Conrad Worrill.  So we're at [Walter Herbert] Eckersall Stadium (laughs), I'm fifteen years old.  And they call a play for a pass--for the wing back in the end zone.  I outran everybody.  I'm in the end zone, turn around, waiting on the ball, touch--my first high school touch.  I was ready to show off my--the ball's coming right to me, Larry.  I dropped it, okay. (laughs).  I, I can still remember and I was so embarrassed.  It took me a long time to recover from that devastation of dropping an easy--a ball that I would catch blindfolded in, in, under any other circumstances.  So that began my high school athletic career.  And, of course, I, I--now, this is where the academic challenges come in.  Hyde Park was supposed to have been a, you know, one of the better high schools in the country, along with New Trier [High School] in Wilmette [Illinois].  And Hyde Park was, you know, the--one of these schools.  And I was not really living up to the standards that my father [Walter Fleming Worrill]--not the school, that my father--he, he was beginning to say, "Look, if you don't improve your grades, Conrad, I'm going to take you off the team."  I didn't believe my father.  "Take me--I'm eligible.  I'm passing.  What do you mean, take me off?"  You know, in my mind, but this continued.  And my grades were not up to my father's standards.  And he repeated this threat.  But he would go up to Hyde Park High School and tell the coaches that I could not play.  And by my junior year, in the middle of the basketball season, I brought home my course book, and my father was very disturbed.  And he went up to the gym in Hyde Park, and told them that if they let me play, he would sue the [Chicago, Illinois] Board of Education.  (Laughs) So that was another embarrassing--that--by this time, I am a star, okay.  How do you take a star, and I was not ineligible according to the policies of the Board of Education.  So how does a father take his star athlete son and tell him he can't play?  So I was floored.  But, of course, his strategy worked.  And after sitting out about to the next marking period, which was three or four games or whatever it was, he timed it.  I think my father was a strategist.  He timed it so I wouldn't miss a whole lot of games.  And he knew that this would get--definitely get my attention because he knew how much I loved to participate in, in athletics.  And so I did improve my grades enough to meet his standards.  And I resumed my basketball season.

Speaker 1: And when I got to Hyde Park [High School, later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois], I missed an important part of history because in my freshman year at Hyde Park, Hyde Park's varsity played for the city championship at De La Salle High School [sic, De La Salle Institute, Chicago, Illinois] in late February, early March, 1956.  [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Hyde Park, a gas-a-roni.  And the coach, Coach [Chester] Ziemba, let me sit on the bench and--with the varsity.  Here I am a second semester freshman.  So I sat on the bench, and Hyde Park had Melvin Mathis and [James] Jimmy McClure and [Thomas] Tommy Clark and Theodis (ph.) Garth and [James] Jimmy Steele and George ['Dush'] Mustiful, I mean those were my heroes.  I wanted to be just like them (with emphasis), okay.  So Hyde Park and Dunbar went neck and neck.  Hyde Park had a tremendous team that year.  And so in the last few seconds of the game, Dunbar won the [Chicago] City championship.  And Dunbar had gone downstate to--and got third.  But there's a backdrop to this because several things--there's so many things that happened in my lifetime that impacted me.  The--in 1954, I saw the DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois]-Mount Vernon [High School, Mt. Vernon, Illinois] game on television because they started producing what was called the 'Sweet 16 State High School Basketball Tournament' on television.  And I saw the game that Mount Vernon beat DuSable 76 to--.
Speaker 2: Now, for the sake of those people watching this in the future, set this up.  DuSable, now, just (unclear)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, the teams, the [Illinois] State High School Basketball Tournament to determine the state championship in, in basketball in Illinois featured sixteen teams from regions around the state.  And so DuSable High--no team from Chicago had ever won the state championship, had never even placed in the state championship in previous years.  But DuSable, undefeated, had this tremendous basketball team--
Speaker 2: So this is a--
Speaker 1: All black--
Speaker 2: The first intentional black high school in the city too, DuSable.
Speaker 1: No, not the first.  The first all-black high school in Chicago was [Wendell] Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this is the first intentional one.  They intended DuSable to be a black high school.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) They--
Speaker 1: Yes, they did, right.  Okay, yes, that kind, yes, I misunderstood you.  Yes.  But anyway, DuSable, I--that was so impactful.  I remember the starting lineup of DuSable's team right now.  Paxton Lumpkin, Shellie McMillon, Brian Dennis, Karl Dennis, Charlie Brown, Shellie McMillon.  They were the baddest high school players that I've ever seen in my life.  Long--all, everybody wore two knee pads.  They had some beautiful, black and red uniforms, some long socks and they threw down.  The last minute, the last quarter of that game, every time Charlie Brown--Charlie Brown shot a long jump shot, every time he came down the last minutes, three or four times, they called traveling.  It was obvious that, that cheating was going on.  So DuSable lost that state championship game 76 to 70.  Mount Vernon, which was near Centralia, Illinois where Roland Burris came from, had one black player.  His name was Al Avant.  Al Avant scored thirty points in that game and Al Avant is still the Athletic Director, as we speak, at Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois].  Every time I see him, I go off on him about him being the only black on that team.  But when DuSable came back from Champaign [Illinois] that Sunday, the next day, the word went out.  There 100,000 black people outside of DuSable High School, and the black community said, "You are our champions."  And so that set the stage because that summer of 1954, the--everybody, all the little boys in the black community were wearing two knee pads, long socks, trying to be--dribble like Paxton, trying to shoot like Charlie Brown, trying to rebound like Shellie McMillon and trying to imitate that DuSable team of 1954 because Paxton and Charlie Brown went to the University of Indiana [sic, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] on basketball scholarships.  And Shellie McMillon went to Bradley [University, Peoria, Illinois].  So, and he was--so that's, that--I mean there were so many impactful things.
Story_ID: 20424
Speaker 1: In 1955, it was the summer that Emmett Till was found murdered in Mississippi, who had come from Chicago [Illinois], like so many kids, to go South to reconnect with families.  That was the tradition in Chicago.  Well, I guess this was the period that really impacted me in terms of the political, social phenomenon of America because the organizing the help Mrs. [Mamie] Till [Bradley], a lot of it was done at Al Benson, the famous deejay's house, who lived on our block.  And so I was very conscious of the fact that Emmett Till had been murdered because they said that this little black kid whistled at a white girl in, in Mississippi.  And they killed him.  So all those events impacted my life.  And even though I wasn't act, an activist--I was an athlete, those experiences, I'm sure, impacted me to the point of what I'm doing today.  But, so here I am, Hyde Park High School [later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois], and I am just an all-star this, that and the other, okay.  I'm, I'm Conrad Worrill at Hyde Park.
Story_ID: 20425
Speaker 1: So it got time to go to college.  I had a scholarship to go to Alabama, Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama].  My father [Walter Fleming Worrill], for some reason, didn't want me to go there.  So I ended up going to Pasadena City College [Pasadena, California].  And, boy, I tell you.  I was going out there to reconnect with a friend of mine who I'd left named Harold Jones.  We communicated from the time I left Pasadena.  And we had always said that I was gonna go back, and he was gonna be and end and I was gonna be a quarterback.  Now, I'm nine years old.  Here, by this time I'm eighteen.  I'm, I'm out in Pasa--I'm ready to throw touchdown passes to Harold Jones at Pasadena City [College] and shoot some jump shots and stuff.  So I go out there, and would you believe it, the semester that I was there--because by this time they were recruiting a lot of athletes from various places into the California junior college system.  And they changed the rules that you had to be an established residency and to be in the, a resident of the State [of California] for a year before you were eligible to play the semester I stepped on campus at Pasadena Junior College [later Pasadena City College].  I could not--I said, "This--I," I'm--but I'm already in school.  So I stayed and I worked out with the team.  But I guess this was the period in my life that I just wanted to get crazy.  And so I started hanging with the wrong people and doing the wrong things, and one thing led to another.  And, and by May of 1960, I was expelled from Pasadena City College, embarrassed to come back to Chicago [Illinois] to face Walt Worrill, my father.  And so from that point on, my life took on a lot of--I couldn't get athletics out of my system.  I went over, I--and there was something about the underground network of athletes.  A lot of athletes went--would go away and get kicked out of school, flunk out of school and end up over at [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois], Crane Junior College [sic, Herzl Junior College, later Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois] and so forth.  So I found out that Homer Thurmon, who was a all, All-State high school, All-American, had gotten kicked out of Iowa [University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa].  And I knew Homer.  And so we talked that summer.  He said, let's go over to Crane. (laughs) So we went to Crane Junior College and we had a heck of a team over there.  We beat everybody in the state.  We never did practice.  We drank a lot of wine.  And it, it was really a joke, but we had a heck of a squad.  And the coach didn't know what he was doing, and we traveled all around.  We weren't really interested in school.  We just wanted to play basketball.  So one thing led to another.  I did that.  And then I, I did that year over there, and I worked at Spiegel's [Inc., Chicago-based mail-order company].  I had a girlfriend.  By this time, I'm too--all I'm doing is playing basketball and, and really lost out here in the world.  The [Civil Rights] Movement's going on.  This is 1961.  And 1962, I had a girlfriend.  I decided that I didn't want to be under my father's tyranny anymore.  So I ran off with her and got married, went up to Berrien Springs, Michigan and married her with the Justice of the Peace.  I mean I did some of the craziest things that anybody, that just absolutely caused me to be estranged from my father.  My father said I was just--I got arrested.  My father predicted my arrest in a car out on, going to Michigan City [Indiana] with Obaseki Hodari or the, Jack DeBonnett was his name and so forth.  And, and that's--ended up in the new Michigan City jail because Obaseki ran into the back of some people on the highway.  He couldn't drive his own car, and we had been drinking that day.  And then we had our girlfriends up in Michigan City.  And I started teasing him about the fact he couldn't drive his car.  He took his keys--I had been teaching him how to drive, but he didn't know how to handle a 1953 Ford stick shift.  And here we are out on the highway, a lot of traffic, 4th of July weekend.  And he didn't know how to up-shift it to slow down and hit the clutch and make the car stop.  He ran into the back of some, some folk.  The [Indiana] State Police came and the folks, because I guess all black people look alike, and they said that I was driving.  I'm in the back seat sleep with my girlfriend.  And me--Obaseki and I ended up arguing on the highway.  And when the police got there, they arrested both of us.
Story_ID: 20426
Speaker 1: By this time, I'm, you know, the war--the Vietnam [War] build-up is getting ready to take place.  I had never got a draft card.  I was just running wild and--.
Speaker 2: So this was 1962 or '3 [1963] or?
Speaker 1: '62 [1962].  Yeah, that's when they started really intensifying the draft.  A lot of people were getting drafted left and right.  Well I didn't have a draft card.  And I told--I said I wasn't never going to the military, for what?  By that, and so I don't know what was happening.  I started reading--I, Diane Nash who became Diane [Nash] Bevel went to Hyde Park [High School, later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  And I saw her picture, and I heard that she was part of the sit-in movement in the South.  And I think she came back, and she spoke at Hyde Park or something.  And she was, went to Hyde Park.  So our models were people, you know, I said, wow, she's an activist.  You know, she's fighting, and I thought by now, I knew that segregation existed in the South and it was something wrong with America, definitely.
Story_ID: 20427
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking, you know, Diane Nash [Bevel].  I was conscious of, of the [Civil Rights] Movements that were going on.  By now, I had become somewhat conscious of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] because Dr. King was coming to Chicago [Illinois] after the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  Even before I got out of high school [at Hyde Park High School, later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois], Dr. King came to Chicago and spoke at the [Chicago] Sunday Evening Club with, you know, he was featured after the victory of Montgomery [Alabama].  So now, this movement, consciousness was there.  And, you know, we knew of Dr. King and the Emmett Till situation.  But somebody [Diane Nash] from my own high school, going to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and wanted to be one of the founding members of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  See, I said, "Wow," you know.  And I started hearing about the students sitting in and so forth and so on.  And then, you know, I guess I was being influenced by people who were saying, "Why are we getting, you know, why do we have to go to war for something?"
Story_ID: 20428
Speaker 1: I just, I didn't officially get a draft card.  And, and that became problematic because the, I was, you know, the [U.S. Army] Military Police came to the door and said, "It's time to go."  "Okay."  And so I went down to Van Buren [Street].  That was the Army Induction Station in Chicago [Illinois], on May 4th, 1962, never to return that day to 7603 S. Vernon [Avenue].  And by that evening I had been inducted into the United States Army.  And by the next morning, I was in Fort Knox, Kentucky pouring out my wallet and being subjected to a Army sergeant saying, "All you motherfuckers from Chicago, put your playing cards on the table!  If you got any reefer, drop it now!  You got any dice?  Put them on table right now, goddamn it, you're in the Army!"  And so, in a matter of moments, I had given up all my civilian clothes.  I had a duffle bag full of military clothes, and I had a whole new life.  The hair was shaven, and I was in formation in a platoon marching to Basic Training by May 5th, 1962.  So I was in the Army, and they was trying to make me go to OCS [Officer Candidate School] or something.  I, I was, by this time, I had--now, I mentioned I was married.  I mean my life was in total shambles.  I didn't know which end was up.  But, being competitive and still thinking I'm an athletic, I just breezed through Basic Training.  You know, they had a, a Sergeant, white Sergeant from Mississippi.  He thought he was just going to, going to just make everybody go crazy.  You know, he thought he was a physical fitness whatever.  And he'd run us up the hill with our rifles and packs and stuff.  So I just decided, and during that weeks, that I was gonna show this white Sergeant from Mississippi a thing or two about physical fitness.  I was probably the best--physically fit at the age of twenty-one that I'd ever been in my life.  So I just ran him in the ground, made him angry.  He tried--so I ran all over the, the Fort Knox.  And after Basic Training, I ran into Alphra Saunders.  And Alphra Saunders had been the All-American guard from Bradley [University, Peoria, Illinois] who was on the team [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Chicago, Illinois] that beat Hyde Park [High School, later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois] in the city [basketball] championship in 1956.  And Al--Bradley had won the NIT [National Invitational Tournament].  And so Al [Alphra] said, "Well, hey, man, they're trying out for the Army team.  Why don't you come over here and try out?"  So I managed to make a maneuver and for a week, I was excused to go try out for the U.S. Army Basketball Team.  And I was, I mean by this time, I could dunk backwards, okay.  I mean I, my game was--I was at the top of my game as, in terms of maturing as an athlete.  And I was a basketball freak.  So we had tried out.  And they had three NBA [National Basketball Association] players.  They a couple All-Americans.  It was about thirty-five or forty guys who were trying out.  And I was throwing down, and, and Al Saunders was my sponsor.  But I didn't know how political it, the situation was then.  I was just trying out.  And it got down to twenty-five people.  I was still in the cut.  It got down to twenty people.  I was still in the cut.  And I think they were gonna carry fifteen people in the U.S. Army Basketball Team.  And I didn't make the cut.  I was sixteenth.  And Saunders did everything in his power.  And it that experience with Al Saunders that week, that I found out about his involvement in the basket--famous basketball scandal of 1961 [Mafia-influenced gamblers bribed college players to cheat], that he was implicated in.  And that, which is a whole nother story.  So after Basic Training, I was assigned to U.S. Army clerk-typist school to get my MOS, which is called a Military Occupational Specialty.  And I was, I was so jive, you know, I was just--I didn't have any direction.  I was a lost cause at that time.  So I didn't--I paid somebody to go to school for me.  I thought this was, the whole thing was a joke and so forth.
Story_ID: 20429
Speaker 1: So when I got orders at the end of this second eight weeks, I received orders to go to Okinawa [Japan].  O-kinawa--O-kinawa (with emphasis). Couldn't believe it.  Before too long I was in Oakland, California to the Oakland Overseas Replacement Station to get on a ship called the [USS] Gaffney to head to Okinawa, 12,000 miles away from the United States.  It was out--this is like in November or something of 19--the fall of 1962 because I think that was the Bay of Pigs [sic, 1961].  And here we are 1,100 troops on a ship.  I'm out on the deck one night doing duty because on the ship, the military rungs, you know, you do KP [Kitchen Patrol], Guard Duty.  I'm a private in the U.S. Army  They carry out all these activities, even on ships.  And I saw--the moon was shining and I saw the ship kind of turning.  But in hindsight, as it turned out, the U.S. military forces were put on Red, top--Red Alert, and all the ships that were heading in that direction shifted to go back towards Cuba.  But apparently, they resolved the situation and we didn't actually go.  But we ended up stopping in Honolulu, Hawaii and that was the first time I was walking down the street in Honolulu.  Some Hawaiian boys, brown-skinned, Hawaiian boys drove by hollering, "Nigger."  I'm saying, "What?  Here, in Honolulu, here, you're looking like you look, calling somebody a nigger?"  So that, that was an experience.  We ended up going--docking in Yokohama, Japan.  We couldn't get off the ship, but that's when I found out, you know, that men in the military--well, on that ship I found out that career soldiers did, especially NGO [non-governmental organizations personnel], gambled, drank heavy and, and, and subscribed, participated in, in paying prostitutes.  Now, all of this is happening to me before my young eyes.  And so we ended up in--the last stop before we got to Okinawa was in Inchon, [South] Korea.  And Inchon, Korea, they had, they hadn't perfected a dock to, for the ship to actually dock.  And so the Korean men had to come out in little barges and what have you to unload the military supplies and the troops who would get off in Korea and so forth.  And I remember this sergeant giving us a weapon and telling us to "Watch the little Chinks.  And don't let them steal anything from the U.S. military."  And that really just disturbed me.  I mean, and here are these old men, with no shoes on, working for twenty-five cent an hour they told us or something or another, were unloading the ships.  And we were supposed to stand up there because they were known to, to, you know, do some stealing of product probably just to survive.  And I said to myself, "I hope they steal the whole ship, you know."  So here I am, and by this time, I end up on Okinawa.  In the first six, six months--well, first of all, I was assigned to the U.S. Army Ryukyuan Headquarters [U.S. Army Ryukyu Islands Headquarters] , which was the military command for the administration of the Armed--the Army Forces in the Ryukyuan [sic, Ryukyu] Islands.  And so I was assigned to a bird colonel to be his clerk-secretary.  And the first day on the job I remember, "Oh, I am busted now."  So the colonel came out, and he gave me something to type.  In the military, you know, you're supposed to--now, here I mentioned to you, I paid this guy off to, to get my MOS [military occupational specialty] so I can become a 711-20, which meant you were supposed to be able to type so many words with no errors, know the U.S. Army format.  Well, I didn't know any of that.  And this colonel came out.  And he gave me something to type.  And it was something real simple, but I couldn't--I, I couldn't handle it.  I was shook up and exposed and the whole bit.  So after about a half an hour, the colonel came out.  He said, "You know, I'm looking over your records here.  And you've been to college.  You're an athlete.  You know, soldier, you're bullshitting.  You have bullshitted the United States Army!"  And I couldn't say anything cause it was true.  And he said, "I'm gonna give you another chance, 'cause I know people like you.  I know soldiers like you who try to get over.  But you--let me tell you what you've got to do because if you don't do it, you're going, I'm going to reassign you to the U.S. Infantry.  And you will be carrying a rifle and you'll be gone.  And you'll be sorry.  At the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], there is a typing class.  I'm looking in the book here at USAFI [United States Armed Forces Institute].  And you'd better get your ass over there tomorrow.  And you'd better come back here next week knowing how to type."  Well, Larry--let me say, I went to the USAFI and I got up early in the morning.  I learned the keyboard.  I typed all day, all night.  And before the week, the end week, I was, could make a Underwood [brand] typewriter jump.  And I had learned everything I could learn about the format for being what I was supposed to have learned in eight weeks, back at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in about five days.  And so I, I became a very popular clerk-typist at the--because I could make an Underwood--a lot of people don't know that.  I, I used to, I was one of the best typists on the whole island.  And they used to keep, that's--they used to keep me and make me work overtime.  And I was typing crypto and top secret and all this type of stuff cause I, I was motivated not to go in the Infantry.  And we had exercises in Thailand.  And I'd set up military command and administration for the colonel and we played war games in Bangkok [Thailand], in Korat [Thailand] and Udon [Thani, Thailand] and the Mekong Delta [Vietnam] and all--anyway, but the first six months I was on that island, I did everything wrong that one could think of because there was a place on Okinawa like 47th Street called Four Corners Koza.  And it was where, it went all the way back to black GIs who, who--this was, it was segregation on the island.  This was where the blacks went to party.  And this is where the, the prostitutes who serviced the blacks, serviced them in Four Corners Koza.  And so my first six months on the military, I was just running wild with everybody else and drinking, the, the rice wine, nineteen cents a bottle, called sake.  And between that and being frustrated, being homesick and all of that--but I would get letters and mail.  And my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] was sending me clippings and other relatives about the [Civil Rights] Movement that was going on in the United States and how the--and we were reading the 'Star and Stripes' [military-issued newspaper] and every now and then, they would say something about, not too much cause it was controlled.  They didn't want us to know too much about what was going on.  So by 1963, I began to get letters and clippings from family members that they were planning a big March on Washington [D.C.].  And there was gonna be a major demonstration concerning the problems of, of black people and racial injustice in the United States.  And we managed to figure out how to listen to that march on a shortwave radio.  I think it was August 28, 1963.  And after that, I decided--I don't know what came over me, but where we lived in our barracks was right near a library.  And for some reason, I went over there one day and I, I said, I, you know, "I've got to do something with my, my life.  What have I, what am I going to do?"  And I, for the next maybe eight, nine months, the rest of the time I had on that island, all I did was read.  And, and when I got off work for the colonel--by this time I had been promoted to a Specialist 4th Class.  And that was equal to a Corporal and I started trying to figure out what I was gonna do when I came back.  And I was really looking forward to coming back.  Okinawa was seventy miles long at its longest point and seventeen miles wide.  And, and I was beginning to start reading about wars.  And so I started reading about Frederick Douglass and I started--every, anything they had about some black history, I was, I read.  So for almost ten months, that's all I did with my spare time.  I tried to figure out how, what I was gonna do.

Speaker 1: When I got back to the United States, my grades from college [Herzl Junior College, later Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois] had been so bad, I went to Central Y [YMCA Community] College [Chicago, Illinois] to get my grades up and ended up going to [YMCA] George Williams College [Chicago, Illinois].  So that--the [Civil Rights] Movement was going on in Chicago.  I had a family.  There was a, this was 1964.  The Movement--.
Speaker 2: Where is George Williams, tell us?
Speaker 1: At that time, George Williams was on 53rd [Street] and Drexel [Avenue] in Hyde Park, the old George Williams College.  And the reason I went there is because I could go to George Williams free because they had a policy that sons and daughters and siblings of YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] professionals did not have to pay tuition.  So that's how I ended up going to George Williams College.  And then, of course, George Williams College, after my first year, moved to Downers Grove [Illinois]--they built a campus in Downers Grove.  So here I am now an older student, by this time I'm twenty-two, twenty-three years old.  I have a family.  I'm--the first six months when I got out of the [U.S.] Army, I worked in the U.S. Steel South Works [United States Steel Corporation].  And that was big money back then, you know, $125, $130 a week.  And my wife at that time had graduated from college while I was in the Service.  And she had, was a, had become a public school teacher--had been teaching for about six months or maybe a year before I got out of the military.  So I felt compelled to try to get a job and try to have some income and, and be a responsible husband and all of that.  But still something wasn't right because all of these activities were going on.  I mean you couldn't step out on the streets in Chicago in 1964 and it wasn't something happening, happening in the city.
Story_ID: 20431
Speaker 1: You're working at [U.S. Steel] South Works.  Do you have any children at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, my child [Michelle Worrill] was not born until March 30th, 1966.  But I was working, I worked at the steel mills [at United States Steel Corporation, South Works, Chicago, Illinois], as I pointed out.  I got a chance to see what working in a plant was all about.  I worked on a hot plate where the steel would come.  The [Vietnam] war was really building up so the steel mills were just bursting loose and you could work as much--you could work twenty-four hours a day if you wanted to.  I was, was--you could get overtime whenever you wanted it because of the war machinery.  So I, my job was just to stamp steel when it came off the gurney and have--it was, the steel mill was quite a place.  I had never seen anything like that in, in--.
Speaker 1: Did that encourage you to finish school?
Speaker 2: Well, I decided that I didn't want to work in the steel mill the rest of my life.  And so, you know, I'd even considered trying to get on the [Chicago, Illinois] police department or something cause a lot of my friends had gotten on the police department.  And I reconnected with my good friend, Leon Harris.  He had finished college.  Here I am, I was, I was supposed to the one that finished before everybody.  So, my other friend, Arthur Hirams, had finished college.  My friend, Leighton Jackson, had finished college.  All my boys, Ernie Thompson, all the guys I played sports with in schools--that went to school--student athletes were finishing school.  Obaseki [Hodari] had finished.  He and Leon had finished down at Washburn [University, Topeka, Kansas].  As a matter of fact, Leon and Obaseki were on the National Junior College Championship team in Parsons College [Fairfield, Iowa] in 1960-61.  So I re--I, here I am.  I was, my degree at this point was the United States Army.  And I hadn't matriculated very much in college at all.  So I had a lot, I had a lot of decision making to do.  And I had a lot of catching up to do.  So I sort hooked up with my friend, Leon, who was teach, began teaching.  Obaseki began teaching.  I began going back to school and getting serious about trying to at least finish my undergraduate work.

Speaker 1: But in the meantime, there were these tremendous fights in education going on in Chicago [Illinois] that I was becoming conscious of.  So I was going to meetings concerning, you know, the over crowding of schools and the fact that they built these, what they call demountables on the playgrounds.  And they had shifts because they actually had two shifts--can you imagine this?  In the black community, they had a shift in the morning for kids to go to school and a shift in, in the afternoon because of the overcrowding because they wouldn't let--they, because of the housing and where black people lived, and it was neighborhood schools.  They wouldn't open up the system to relieve the black community of the overcrowding.  So it became a tremendous issue because it was the Willis Wagons.  There was no playground time because there was--kids started from like, what 6:30 in the morning till whatever time.  Then another shift came in the afternoon.
Speaker 2: Now, the Willis Wagons refer to--
Speaker 1: Those houses that they built or school buildings they built on playgrounds.
Speaker 2: The mobile.
Speaker 1: Like mobiles, yes, but mobile houses on the properties of the [Chicago, Illinois] Board of Education.  And I started, I began to stumble into meetings that CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] was sponsoring in Chicago or that the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was sponsoring or the, other civil rights groups.  And so, I, I thought that this was just ridiculous.  So in my spare time, I became quite prolific, and whatever fliers they gave me at a meeting to pass them out, wherever I was going.  And what, in between whatever I was, I was doing.  And at the meantime, because of my father's [Walter Fleming Worrill] hookup, I got a job at the [Wabash Avenue] YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] Hotel--the hotel we stayed in when we moved here in 1950.  So I started off running an elevator.  I ended up being a Key Clerk.  I ended up being a Room Clerk, a Cashier, a Mailroom Clerk.  By 1966 a funny thing was happening.  The Savior's Day of the Nation of Islam was held down the street at the Coliseum [convention hall] from the Wabash Y [YMCA].  And I remember one day on our shift, I looked out during whatever time of year, I looked out and there were all these black folk with, black women with head wraps on and black men with bowties.  And I noticed that the white people at the Y were scared to death.  And I'm saying, "What in the world is going on?"  And I had heard of Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X because I forgot a little story.  Even before I went to the military in 1961, I was--my father was the last person to get a television.  And I was over at the house watching television with my father.  And he liked to watch 'Meet the Press'.  And I think that format was just getting started.  And this particular Sunday on 'Meet the Press', they were interviewing a man.  And there was three white journalists interviewing this black man.  And I said to myself, "This is the smartest black man I have ever seen in my life."  And at the conclusion of this interview, I said to my father, I said, "Daddy, this, this, this Negro man"--we were still Negro, using nomenclature Negro, "--he's brilliant."  And my father said, "Fool, if that, if that man keeps talking like that--if that Negro keeps talking like that, they're going to kill him."  And that was Malcolm X.  And this was in 1961.  So my consciousness was beginning to--so I knew about the Nation of Islam.  And I knew about Elijah Muhammad.  And I knew about Malcolm X.  So when I saw all these people in the lobby at the Y who were trying to stay at the Y because the rooms were cheap, I knew that these were people in the Nation of Islam.  And I wanted to wait on them.  But the white people that I was working with, the other clerks, they wanted to go in the back.  I mean the Assistant Manager was scared to death because the, the Nation of Islam had been depicted as this organization that, that said that the white man was the devil.  And, and they hated white people.  And here they were coming into, to the YMCA where white people were, and the white were scared to death.  And you could feel it, all in the lobby.  You could feel it with my, my colleagues.  And so as a result of that, I guess the YMCA, it went into a think tank--"What to do with this problem of all these black people who were, were gonna be coming to the Y to stay during--I guess February for Savior's Day--thousands of black people to stay at the Y."  So they promoted me and made me an Assistant Manager of the YMCA Hotel to be in charge of a shift.  And I, and, and they knew that I would probably hire all black people on this shift to handle the black people (laughs) who, who would come to Y because increasingly, more black people were staying at the Y because the rates were reasonable.  The place was clean, and it had a lot of room and a lot of students who were going to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois], so forth and so on.  So this became my, real entrée because being an Assistant Manager was like being a social worker because not only was I handling the administrative duties on an eight-hour shift of running a hotel that had 1,900 rooms, had a T.V. Room, had a cafeteria, had a maintenance, had a laundry, had security.  There were people who came in who were indigent.  I had to keep a case log.  We had a bureau of--the Federal Bureau of Prisons had a pre-release guidance center of men who were coming out of the federal penitentiary.  We had the Bureau of Indian Affairs--had a floor of Native Americans coming off reservations to Chicago to get training.  So I, I found--the YMCA Hotel was like a training ground in social work for me.  Now, I didn't know I wanted, was, was going into social work as such.  But that experience propelled whatever talent or whatever skills that I had in working with people 'cause that was where I had to, I had a lot of incidents.  I had a suicide--somebody jumped out the window.  I had problems of men trying to go up on the floors with the women with their girlfriends, which you weren't--I mean I had, I had counseling duties to try to help people.  We had, I had cases of people who were alcoholics that needed some interaction and some assistance, people who were homeless and who, who needed--and we had the Traveler's Aid Society who had offices.  So I was--on an eight-hour shift, it was like a little community, and I was in charge of the community to handle the problems of the community.  Maintenance men who I would find drunk in an elevator, asleep on the job.  Somebody setting off fires.  Somebody robbing somebody's room.  Every--everything that you think of that would go on in a neighborhood was going on in the YMCA Hotel.  So I wanted to make our shift the best shift.  And so I ran into some--my friend was a basketball coach who I had played ball with at Hyde Park [High School, later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois] at [Wendell] Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And he had some nice young men who went to Phillips, and I hired them part-time to be on my shift at the Wabash Y.  And I--at the YMCA Hotel.  So my shift was all black.  The cashier was black, the cash--the clerks were black.  The elevator operators was black.  The mailroom people was black.  The maintenance people was black.  The, the cafeteria were, were black.  And we developed a reputation of being the most hospitable, the most well-run shift because the YMCA Hotel was open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  And there were shifts.  And so we sort of set a standard for how to run a Y and how to provide services to a YMCA at that level.  And I guess that propelled me into the kind of work that I ended up getting into.
Story_ID: 20433
Speaker 1: So here I am now moving into a period activism in my life, 1966.  The whole Black Power phenomenon hit America.  You know, I remember--Chicago [Illinois] was on fire.  I mean it was just literally--you couldn't walk out in the streets and not be, fill the impact of the black movement.  And so here I am working at the [Wabash Avenue] Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association], trying to keep my gig, going, driving out to [YMCA] George Williams College [Downers Grove, Illinois] because I had purchased a Corvair [automobile].  A Corvair had a motor in back.  And I used to pick up some students on the way to Downers Grove which was thirty-five miles--and we were commuter students though George Williams did have dormitories.  But in between all this, I was organizing the black students.  And they had, by this time, I was consciously organizing.  And they had about seventy black students.  George Williams was a very conservative school and, and the issue emerged whether or not we were for Black Power.  And, and, of course, you know, being impacted by what we found going on in, in the country, we were, we became Black Power advocates.  And, and there was controversy in the country about whether or not, I mean, "What do you mean some Black Power?  We're just into civil rights.  Are you violent, or--?"  And so the whole discussion in America had hit center stage.  And the students, older students particularly, I was leading the discussion and so forth.  And one thing led to another.  I met Fred Hampton who was the President of the Maywood [Illinois] NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Youth Council.  And here was this young man that I found was very smart.  And he, they had--there was a controversy with Fred.  They said that he had robbed an ice cream truck.  He had been a football player at Maywood High School [sic, Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois].  I used to go over to his house.  And I maneuvered my internship to finish George Williams to be assigned to the Maywood NAACP Youth Council of which Fred Hampton was the President.  So I used to sit around and listen to Fred because Fred would memorize Dr. [Martin Luther] King's speeches, Malcolm's [X] speeches.  And he was nineteen, eighteen then.  And he could talk.  I said, "Oh, my goodness.  What have we have we found here?"  So I, I was kind of like Fred Hampton's advisor.  And I didn't know anything.  He definitely didn't know anything, but he was a good speaker.  And so I started getting hooked up with the student organizations that were on campus.  I'm working.  I'm doing this and that and the other.  So I'm moving around the clock.  So by 19--well, in 19--I had finally, by 1968, I had just about--I think I had officially gotten my degree.  I had finished all my coursework, but in the--some time in the early part of 1960--'68, I was torn.  I'm still married.  Now, my father's [Walter Fleming Worrill] now head, not only of the Wabash Y, but my father's the head of the Washington Park Y [YMCA, Chicago, Illinois].  And not only that, my father is what they call the Mid-South--he's over the whole South Side of Chicago.  Chicago had the largest number of YMCAs of any city in America.  So my father is a bigwig in the Y.  Now, here I am on the ground, moving into, to black militancy, a Black Power advocate.  And, and, and so forth.  So--but I'm torn because I wanted to be, you know, like my father.  And my father, I want to go--I thought I wanted to go into YMCA work and follow in my father's footsteps.  And so I was offered, you know--I'm Walt Worrill's son, the cream of the crop and (unclear) he's YMCA, Whittier [College, Whittier, California], [Richard Milhous] Nixon [also went to Whittier].  So the, I received a call from some people at the 28th Street Y [Los Angeles, California] to come out to California to interview to be head of the historic 28th Street Y where Walt Worrill had been the head of in the 1940s.  So I go out (laughs) to California with my wife, put on a suit, trying to act civil.  And I go out there, and these men actually remembered my daddy.  And they begged me.  They said, "Son, you have all of the ingredients, the pedigree, the this and the that, to turn this Y around," because the Y had, had been, had really collapsed.  And the programming and the neighborhood had changed, and they wanted some young, energetic guy who grew up in the Y, whose daddy, who was well-trained, who graduated from George Williams to come back and put this YMCA on the map.  So now--they treated me so well.  I mean they, they fed me.  They took, they said they would get me a house.  They would pay me, what, $7,000 a year, you know.  They would pay for me to come out there.  I'd be back with my relatives in California after all these years.  They got all my relatives to come.  Oh, man.  I signed a contract before I left.  But soon as I got back, April 4th, 1968, Dr. King was assassinated.  I was on the Eisenhower [Expressway, Chicago, Illinois] with some people--by this time, I think I had purchased a Volkswagen [automobile] because my Corvair, the engine blew up in the back or something.  And the oil was going everywhere--.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) pay for them--. (laughs).
Speaker 1: Anyway, I pulled off at Homan Boulevard [sic, Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  I think everybody who was conscious in the black community, black or white, you could ask yourself, "Where were you April 4th, 1968?"  And most people can kind of remember where you were.  Well, I can remember that I was driving with some students.  We had gone out to George Williams to pick up our records or something and was coming back in Chicago, and the news broke in and said, Dr. Martin Luther King had been assassinated.  I immediately pulled off at Homan Boulevard on the West Side--3400 West, went up, was right near the Sears [Roebuck & Company's mail-order catalog distribution] complex and, and, and what have you.  And (pauses) oh, what had happened--I don't know how it happened, but anyway, within minutes people were in the streets.  And I saw white people running because this was the international headquarters of Sears.  And I didn't know why these white people were running.  "Why were--running?"  It was mass pandemonium.  Well, what was happening, black people were so angered by hearing of the news that Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated.  They were assaulting white people on the street everywhere.  So with--but I didn't know this at the time.  So within hours, the West Side went up in smoke.  I was in the middle of it.  I, I was trapped.  And so before the evening--I, I mean I said, "No, it's no way in the world I can go to--I could honor that contract.  I'm not going to California."  So I wrote those people a letter that night and said, "I had changed my mind.  Some unfortunate events had occurred in America, and that I, I didn't belong in Southern California."  I wrote them a letter.  My father found out about that and he went totally off.  He called me.  He said, "What kind of Negro are you?  You're supposed to honor your word.  You signed a contract."  I said, "Daddy, I don't care what I've signed.  They will have to arrest to me.  I am not going to California."  So, he said, "Well what are you gonna do?"  I said, "You're gonna find me a job here in Chicago at the YMCA."  I said, "That's what you're gonna do."  So we got in a big argument.  And he, the people were calling my father from--this was unheard of, for somebody to sign a contract, graduate from George Williams College, go out to this Southern California and have all the expenses--and you turn around and tell these people you're not gonna take the job?  And then have nerve enough to tell your Daddy who's a bigwig to find you a job in the local YMCA of Chicago?  This was, this was, this was a heck of a little period.  So I told my father, I said, "Get--what you ought to do, Daddy, is use your clout to get me on the West Side in the Y, where the whole West Side had been blown up and burned down."
Story_ID: 20434
Speaker 1: What did you think about Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] that day, I mean, and his activities as opposed to the Black Power rhetoric?  Well, okay.
Speaker 2: And the other thing is, why, I mean, I'm still unclear as to why you wouldn't go to California after King was killed and all.  Did you feel that California--?
Speaker 1: I was torn.  I was torn, I was torn between following in my father's [Walter Fleming Worrill] footsteps or going full blast into the [Civil Rights] Movement and being a part of what was going on in Chicago [Illinois] and in the aftermath of the Dr. King rebellion.  And I chose to stay in Chicago to participate in the aftermath of Dr. King's rebellion because I--being in the North and seeing, you know, people, all of the Little Rock Nine [Little Rock, Arkansas], all of what we saw on television, children being water-hosed at Selma, Alabama, all these things in my mind, I felt that this didn't make sense, you know.  "Why are we begging to be with these people?"  And, you know, I, that was where my head was.  You know, I thought Dr. King was a tremendous speaker, but to love your enemy?  I mean this was like in my system.  I saw Dr. King speak at 84th [Street] and South Park [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], at what is now called [Nat King] Cole Park in 1966 cause my--I didn't talk about the fact that my family had moved from 56th [Street] and Maryland [Avenue] and bought a home at 84th [Street] and Chatham.  And the day we moved out there, there were four moving vans, three white families moving out and ours moving in, in 1957.  I didn't even talk about that.  So by this time, I'm saying, "Hey, you know, folk--I'm trying to," you know, so my proclivities were not--I was having difficulty understanding begging somebody.  I guess that's where my head was.  And so I, I was attracted very much to what Malcolm X--I started reading Malcolm X, and tried to figure out what Dr. King--he, Dr. King wrote books, 'Strive Towards Freedom'.  He wrote the 'Letter from Montgomery [sic, Birmingham City] Jail.'  I started--this is when I started reading about what was going on with black people.  So my father did make a move.  And I got a job at the Sears YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in the middle of where the West Side [of Chicago] had blown up.  And, and also, see, in Lowndes County, Alabama in 19--when Stokely [Carmichael] said, "Black Power," shortly after that Stokely Carmichael came to Chicago.  And I saw Stokely Carmichael speak right over here at the Afro-Arts Theater, and I thought I had never seen anything like that in my--I'm in a, a--the old, that Phil [Kelan Philip] Cohran had, what was called the Afro-Arts Theater.  I'm going over there.  Black--the [Black] Panthers had been formed in [Oakland] California and, and everybody was trying to play like they were a Panther, even if you weren't a Panther.  That was the 'in' thing at that particular time.  And so I go in the Afro Arts Theater.  And, and the, Phil Cohran's ensemble [the Sun Ra Arkestra], [Louis] Satterfield, some of these people who ended up being musicians in Earth, Wind & Fire.  I never heard music like this.  The spirit was high, the African consciousness was raising.  And here comes Stokely Carmichael.  And they rush him down the aisle.  I thought, at that time, I thought Stokely Carmichael was becoming a god.  He was the guy who was replacing Malcolm [X] who had been assassinated a year before.  So here comes Stokely and an entourage, security everywhere.  And Stokely gets up on the stage and Phil Cohran is playing this tremendous music.  I had never heard music like this, and 2,000, mostly young, black people were in, in the audience of the Afro-Arts Theater.  And a guy gets up and says, "It's a honky in here!"  And I said, "Oh, my God!"  And they go get the white fellow, (laughs) and they pick him up and walk him out of the Afro-Arts Theater and throw this guy out on Drexel Boulevard.  Now, I witnessed this, okay.  So I'm in the middle of all of this, this happening in Chicago.  I mean this, Chicago was going on.  Maulana Karenga [formerly Ron Everett] slides through Chicago.  I hear about the Black Power conferences that went on in Newark [New Jersey] and the rebellion.  So I'm, by this time, I'm, I'm participating.  I'm just, I, I'm not--I heard, I went to friends of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] meeting.  I went to CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  Ishmael Flory was trying to recruit me in the Communist [political] Party.  I'm reading [Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov] Lenin and I'm, I'm reading Karl Marx.  And somebody else is giving me Marcus Garvey.  So I'm just--look, I'm, hey, my whole thing, 'Up From Slavery', Booker T. Washington, books started flowing.  Curtis Ellis opens up a black book store.  I try to read every book I could--I said, "Where are all these books--where have these books been?"  Okay--Jiminy Christmas!  So I'm totally on fire.
Story_ID: 20435
Speaker 1: So by 1968, my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] says, "I guess I'm gonna make a move."  So my father, I guess, put in a word.  And they invited me to come and be the Program Director of the Sears Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association].  And what did they do that for?  By this time, I was full-blown, Black Power advocate, underground, working at the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago [Illinois], with an Italian Executive Director, in the middle of a black community, where the, the Sears Y had a health club that the Italian mob people built so they could come in there.  They ran all the liquor in Lawndale [neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois].  They got--but I didn't know this.  So I go over there.  The Roman Saints controlled the--the gangs, the Roman Saints controlled the skating rink.  They were selling drugs out of the Y.  And I said, "Oh, no, no, no.  This, this, this is not going down."  So by this time, [Robert] Bob Brown was organizing the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party.  Bobby--they were beginning to move.  And so here I am.  And I said, "Un-unh.  We're taking over the YMCA in the black community.  We are going to run our own YMCAs."  And so I started, along with others, the Black and Non-White Directors Movement of the YMCA of the United States and called for a Black Power meeting of the YMCA professionals in Atlanta, Georgia at Paschal's [Motor] Hotel.  And about--.
Speaker 2: A black motel.
Speaker 1: A black motel, about 500--my father thought I was--and before we went to the meetings, we had pre-meetings cause I had, by this time, I was consciously organizing black folks to take over the YMCAs in the--what's, what sense does this make to have a black community, and the blacks have got white folks running the, the YMCAs in the middle of the black community.  So I got involved in, in this movement to take control of the YMCAs in the black community and started organizing around the country.  But before we went, we would have meetings in Chicago and the old guard was saying, "You guys are too militant.  They--the YMCA was started by George Williams as a Young Men's Christian Association, and you're changing the whole mission of the (laughs) YMCA."  And my response, "You're goddamn right, we're changing the mission."  And my father would be sitting on one side of the room.  And, and I would get up and say, "Daddy, I, I know you're my father, and I love you greatly, but I don't agree with you.  I believe in Black Power, okay."  And so this was going on right--my father and I became a topic in the [Civil Rights] Movement in Chicago.  They said my father was an 'Uncle Tom' conservative, and he had a son whose was a militant.  And so we, we went to Atlanta, and we had all of these blacks from all over the country.  The YM--we shook up the YMCA of the United States.  And, and, but finally, the old guard, we came together, and they said, they--we kind of cut a deal with them.  And they said, "Look, we know what you're saying is right.  The YMCA is not promoting blacks fairly, but they've got to be trained.  You just can't go up in the Y and run a Y, and you don't any, how to run a YMCA.  So why don't you let us, why don't we set up our demands so we can have some mentoring teams.  And then we can mentor the young because we, in fact, agree with, with what you're saying.  It's just that we can't go and, and, and do this like you young men."  So I was just going off.  I mean I was like, I was--and I used--I guess I knew they couldn't mess with me because I was Walt Worrill's son.  "What you gonna do with me?"  So, I'm the leader.  I'm one of the leaders of this whole movement to change the YMCA and Levert King and [Donald] Don Lindler (ph.), I mean these people were all working at the Y.  They were, by this time, we considered ourselves Black Nationalists, okay.  And so I remember I, I got, it was James Brown that came out with 'Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud' and Nina Simone came out with '[To Be] Young, Gifted [and Black]'--all this is going on.  I mean this country and we were on fire.  So I remember I said, "I'm not wearing no more white man's clothes.  I'm not.  This is just ridiculous."  So I went out and got me some--John Moutoussamy, the famous architect who, who designed Johnson Publishing Company, the first major black-owned business downtown in Chicago, son grew up in my neighborhood.  And John's mother made me a dashiki, made my first dashiki cause they lived in Chatham [neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois] up the street.  And so from that point on, I was wearing dashikis and let my hair grow out, and I was part of the mix and so forth.  So when we go down to Atlanta for the Black and White Non-Directors [sic, Black and Non-White Directors] Meeting that we had organized, after that night, my father said, "Well, you're in Atlanta.  You're going back.  I was born in Covington [Georgia]."  My--this is first time my father had been back to Georgia since he'd left Georgia.  This is the first time I had ever been to Georgia in my life.  So my father said, "Let's go out to eat.  You and I need to talk.  This is getting ridiculous, well, I can help.  I can help you guys out with what you're trying to do.  You need to listen to me, you know.  I'm your, I'm your daddy."  So we go to the Bird Cage.  And we get there, I've got--I think I had a spear or something, you know, and I had a tiki, and my father had on his suit and tie.  And we, we go (laughs) to this exclusive restaurant in Atlanta in the black community called the Bird Cage.  So we go in, and they look at me like I'm, they look at me like I'm a fool.  And they wouldn't--they said, "Young man, do you have a sport coat on?"  I said, "What the hell, a sport coat?  An all-black place?"  "Well, do you have a tie?"  I said, "I'll be goddamned!"  This is--my father laughed.  He said, "I told you about, I told you that you shouldn't throw out all your European clothes." (laughs)  I could not eat with my father that night in Atlanta.  I had to get me a hamburger down on the strip somewhere.  And so that particular period, and what happened, as a result of all that, the YMCA of Chicago particularly, began to change drastically.  They were hiring blacks, I mean I went off.  We were going off.  When you, this doesn't, this doesn't make sense.  Now, I could go back and talk about all the errors of our ways.  But we were caught up in the spirit of what was happening, and as a result of that, I began to run into other people in other social service agencies, like Warner Saunders.  Warner Saunders was the Executive Director of the Better Boys Foundation.  And he found out about me, and he called me up, and he said, "You're over there on the West Side.  You know, you think you're a little hot shot organizer.  I've been over here for several years, and you don't come over here on the West Side without, you know, talking to the leadership."  I said, "All right, what do you want to talk about?"  By this time, I had run the Roman Saints out of the Y.  I had, I had taken over the Y.  I had gotten rid of the white Italian Executive Director.  I ran the mob out of the, the--I created a, a, a section of the Y called The Wall of Black Pride, put up the Nat Turner Room, The Malcolm X--used YMCA money, brought all these plaques, put the pictures up, caused a big ruckus at the Board [of Directors] meeting because some black woman on the Board didn't want a room named after Malcolm X cause she said he preached violence and called the Board meeting.  I had to come in and defend the naming of the room after Malcolm.  And, ah, it was, the Y, we just took over the Y.  So--,
Speaker 2: So how was this done?  How were you able to change those things?
Speaker 1: I just changed it.  I told them that we--I was the Program Director.  They had rooms named Oak Tree Room, the Greenleaf Room--.
Speaker 2: But how did you say, run the mafia out of the--.
Speaker 1: Because I went down there one day--.
Speaker 2: And the Roman Saints?
Speaker 1: Well, I wrote a letter.  I think all the--well, the Roman Saints, that's another story.  The mob, I exposed them, and I had put it out in the, in the Torch [student newspaper at Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] on the West Side that the mob figures was meeting at--using the Sears YMCA to meet in the middle of the black community and had their private health club inside the Y to use while people are starving to death over here in Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  I made an issue out of it.  I exposed them.  So they had to get up out of there and go somewhere else.  I think they went over to the Austin Y [Chicago, Illinois].  And they ran all the liquor and owned all the vending machines.  They used to sit up in the Y and eat and laugh, okay.  And this is known mob figures.  This is ridiculous.  The Roman Saints was another story.  We, we--I got the [Black] Panthers to come over there and help me run the Roman Saints out.  And so Fred [Hampton] and the boys helped me on that, and we, you know, cleaned that up. But it took about a year to get hold of the Y.

Speaker 1: Warner Saunders sought this meeting with me.  And he came over to the cafeteria of the Sears Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association], and he says, "Look, you don't want to work for the Y.  You, you're not YMCA material."  He said, "You know, I can pay you more money.  And I want you to come over here to the Better Boys Foundation and, and run the, and be the Program Director.  And I'll pay you $9,000."  Warner Saunders leaned over and looked at me.  He said, "I'll pay you $9,000 Conrad.  I heard all about you.  I see what you're doing over here."  And that's when I met Useni [Eugene] Perkins, okay.  He was working over there for Warner Saunders.  And so I was back, by this time, I had, you know, I was little cocky and, you know, you know, "Who, who in the hell are you, Warner Saunders, to come over here and offer me?  This is my territory over here.  You stay over there."  'Cause he, they were up on Pulaski [Road].  We were on Homan--we were on Kedzie [Avenue] and Arthington [Street].  So I had my territory, and I had--.
Speaker 2: You were at Garfield Park and he was like--.
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't, no, I was South Lawndale.  He West.  The Y was on--the Better Boys Foundation was something like 1500 South on Pulaski in that area.  And he, Warner was a very good organizer also.  And he had built the Y up, and he had the LaMont Zeno Theatre, and he had some black programming.  And what he was really saying is that I was in the wrong place.  If I wanted to do some black stuff, come on over to the Better Boys Foundation.  And he could let me do it, and I could be more effective, and he would pay me more money.  Well, in the meantime, I got a visit from some lady named Abena Joan Brown.  And she heard of me because what was going on, the social workers in town were organizing to take over--there was a--all of this had a kind of--the social service agencies, the Boys Club [later the Boys & Girls Clubs of America], the YMCA, the Boy Scouts [of America], all these social service agencies that were in the black community, they had white people running these agencies.  It had a proliferating impact, and people were saying, "This doesn't make sense."  So there was an organization that emerged called Catalyst.
Speaker 2: Now, tell us who Joan Brown is?
Speaker 1: Joan Brown at that time worked for the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], and was a social, social worker in Chicago, who was a well known, who, who had graduated from the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And so by 19--the end of 1968, early 1969, she sought me out and told me that I was going to graduate school.  And I said, I'm not--and by this time, I forgot to mention, I had broke up with my wife.  I moved to the West Side.  I was actually living on the West Side.  I thought the West Side was the new haven of my life because I had been raised on the South Side.  But she said, "No, you, Conrad, are going to go to grad--."  I didn't know Joan Brown from Adam.  And she said that, you know, that scholarships were being offered.  And I had no interest in going to graduate school.  You know, I'm full-blown revolutionary.  I'm trying to find a way to, to--for black independence and liberation.  And going to the University of Chicago was the last thing I wanted anybody to bring to my attention, but she said, "No, you are going."  And so there was this network, Charles Ross and I think Usen--by this time, she had Useni Perkins.  She said, "If you keep going like this, you're gonna be all messed up."  You--while they are--scholarships are available, because they had went over to the University of Chicago and said, "That this doesn't make sense, that if you only have three or four students in the Graduate School of Social Work, and you are not going to function over here in the middle of the black community and just have three or four.  You're gonna open up the doors."  So they went over and opened up the door at the University of Chicago and, and made it possible.  So I said, "Okay, what I'll do is I'll go over here and play with these people."  So I just, I didn't have any--I, I didn't think I was gonna accepted at all.  But they accepted me, and so for the first semester--I was at SSA [School of Social Service Administration], I lived on the West Side and commuted over to the University of Chicago and I ended up finally saying, "Oh, this is--I thought at the University of Chicago, the people were smart."  And I thought that this was the Citadel of intellectual activity.  I went over to the School of Social Work [sic SSA], and I found out that these people were actually stupid.
Story_ID: 20437
Speaker 1: Catalyst became an entity of black social service professionals who decided to come together to figure out a strategy around how to impact and have, and to really control social service agencies that were functioning in the black community, like the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association], like the Boys Club [of America], like settlement houses and so forth.  And so Catalyst became just that, a catalyst.  I remember at the ABC Youth Center on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois], Catalyst concocted a strategy and sent telegrams to all the heads of all of those agencies and put chairs on the stage in the small gymnasium of the ABC Youth Center, and said, "You better come over here and explain yourself to the black community.  How many black people you got working in this agency?  What are the programs for the black people in this agency?  When you gonna hire some black people to take over your agency?  And you'd better come."  And we went over there.  The place was packed, the media was there and Abena [Joan Brown] was in the middle or orchestrating this.  And there were chairs up on the stage, their names were there.  Some of them came.  Some of them were scared to come 'cause then it was like, (pauses) it was like--Chicago was, I mean Chicago was--white folk were up against the wall in Chicago for a minute or two in time.  And so the threat of whatever black people said had, had an impact.
Story_ID: 20438
Speaker 1: The death of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] seemed like a jumping off point and the people feel they had to vindicate themselves (unclear) you know, in terms of--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that had a devastating impact for black people in the country, but here in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean poor folk just were outdone that that had occurred [in 1968].  And since Dr. King had been in Chicago so many times, he had been in Chicago.  He was, at that moment in time, he was organizing the Poor People's Campaign.  Operation Breadbasket was based here.  Many of the King operatives were in and out of Chicago, C. T. [Cordy Tindell] Vivian, Al Sampson.  We met [Chicago Alderman] Dorothy Tillman back during this period, coming in as being a Youth Organizer.  And if Dr. King was coming to Chicago because he, he was going to set up his economic program through Operation Breadbasket.  And he was going to lead the open housing [demonstrations], and, and Mayor [Richard J.] Daley was saying that he didn't need King, and he had some Negro preachers stand with him to condemn Dr. King from coming to Chicago.  Then there was the march on Marquette Park [neighborhood in Chicago in 1966], which I went to, with Dr. King leading that March with all the Civil Rights leaders.  And the white people over in Marquette Park stoned the march and fire-bombed--burned up the cars that were parked over there.  So Dr. King was, Dr. King also, I think it was in 1964 [sic, 1966], Dr. King spoke at Soldiers Field [sic, Soldier Field Stadium], had 20, 30,000.  He spoke in Soldiers Field in Chicago, black and white.  I mean, you know, so there was a white movement, and particularly the religious of the church-based community.  Dr. King was a frequent guest on this, the Sunday morning church--Sunday Evening church program [Chicago Sunday Evening Club].  I think Dr. King had received the Nobel Peace Prize [in 1964].  He was hooked up with many of the Baptist ministers here like [Rev.] John [Lee] Thurston and New Covenant [Ministry] Baptist Church or Charlotte's father.  And so [Rev.] Clay Evans and, and the whole bit.  So Dr. King's--Chicago was like a second city to Dr. King.  Dr. King was in and out of Chicago quite frequently.  So people felt a closeness to, to Dr. King and to the--because Dr. King took the Southern activity and was going to try to replicate it in cities like Chicago and challenge the political structure of, of, of the City of Chicago and go up against the Daley regime, as an outsider.  He was considered an outsider.  So I was in the middle of, of quite a bit of that.
Story_ID: 20439
Speaker 1: And so by 1969, as I indicated, I decided to go over to SSA [School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And I found it, you know, sitting in classes that, this was supposed to be this premier school of social work in America.  I had never heard such foolishness--.
Speaker 2: It was the founding school for Social Work, wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was--
Speaker 2: Robert Park or some of those--
Speaker 1: Yeah, all of those people.  Well, actually, not the founding School of Social Work--it might have been, but Robert [E.] Park and Robert [sic, Ernest] Burgess founded the School of Sociology at the Univ--the first Department of Sociology in 8--1902 or something at the University of Chicago.  But the, of course, Social Work was an outgrowth of that profession.  But I had never seen anything so ridiculous in all--and see, they had three curriculums--they were organized around the old casework, which is the traditional method of, of social work intervention, as they say.  And then there was the group work method of, you know, and then there was--community organization was a new field.  And that's where all the militants, all the organizers were supposed to, you know.  So, of course, I, I went into Community Organizing.  That was the section at the University of Chicago.  And, you know, I sat in on some of those classes, I said, "This is the damnest thing I've ever--I said, these people are, don't know what the hell they're talking about."  And, so I went to class, and I was commuting, and I'm, you know, I'm torn.  I didn't really want to be there.  I was still doing my organizing in the community, and then December 4th, 1969, heard on the news that Fred Hampton and Mark Clark had been assassinated.  Now, this is--Fred Hampton was one of my people, okay.  I was--I mean that's a whole series in and of itself, the relationship I had with Fred Hampton and the [Black] Panthers here in Chicago.  So that just rocked (with emphasis) us--2300 West Monroe [Street], for what the police did.  So that, I don't know.  I can't even begin to describe.  We went immediately over to that house to see what they had, had done and the devastation and how they had shot up that apartment and, and what have you.  So that set off a whole 'nother movement in Chicago that really, really has not been unraveled yet.  Many things came out of that.  There was--and even before that, you know, 1967 Dick Gregory said that he was gonna write-in, running for mayor [of Chicago].  So behind what happened to Fred, there was a movement to change the name of Crane Junior College [sic, Herzl Junior College, Chicago, Illinois] to Malcolm X College.  So that movement was taking place.  And then there was just, it was the Malcolm X Black Hand Society.  Then it was the Deacons of Defense [sic, Deacons for Defense and Justice].  There was the West Side Organization with Fats Craw--with Leonard--Chester Robinson.  And then there was the Garfield West Organization with Doug Andrews who had the key to, to Sammy Davis's house in California.  This a organizer from the West Side.  So you had all of this activity going--and the Panthers who were over on Madison [Street].  All of this was going on at the same time.  The Roman Saints [Italian street gang] and the [Conservative] Vice Lords [street gang] did security for [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] when he came to Chicago.  [Edward] 'Fats' [Crawford], when we--at, at the march in Marquette Park, the Deacons of Defense had rifles underneath their coats and the women had pistols--wasn't nobody nonviolent.  Everybody said, "We gonna protect King."  They threw rocks and hit King upside the head.  So all of this was, was happening in, in the city.  So when Fred, after Fred's assassination--now this, they had established the Urban Training Center, Chicago Urban [League] Training Center over on Ashland [Avenue] at this church, which was supposed to be--it got funded by Ford [Foundation] or somebody, where ministers who were working in the urban centers would come--who had been workers in the Civil Rights Movement, to come and to retool themselves for working in the urban centers because the urban centers in America, all of them had had rebellions.  So C. T. [Cordy Tindell] Vivian, I think was on the staff.  I think this is how Al Sampson got here.  [James] Archie Hargraves, etc., etc., etc.  But after Fred's assassination, it was, it was a consortium of black community organizations [the Black Consortium] headed up by Calvin Lockridge.  Jorja English was in the back room, Jorja English who later became Jorja Palmer.  And so they created something called the Coalition for United Community Action, and the Coalition for United Community Action, I opened up the doors for them to meet at the Sears YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association, Chicago, Illinois] in the Malcolm X room every Thursday morning.  And [Rev.] Jesse [Jackson] was over there--every activist and leader in Chicago was over at the Sears Y at 7:00 a.m. every Thursday morning.  Jesse, Curtis Burrell, [Robert E.] Bob Lucas, Timuel Black, Paul King, 'Thursty' [Rev. John Lee Thurston], Chester Robinson, the--everybody you could think of who was organizing, Jeff Fort [leader of the Blackstone Rangers street gang], Fred Hampton met in, in this consortium.  And so after Fred's assassination, they decided that they were gonna come up with this strategy called the Black Curfew.  And C. T. Vivian now became the spokesman, along with Calvin Lockridge.  And C. T. Vivian had gone out of town and come back to Chicago and when he stepped off the plane, they had called a press conference.  And Jorja Palmer, Jorja English--she hadn't married Lu [Lutrelle Palmer] yet, had written this profound statement called, the 'Black Curfew'.  And C. T. Vivian, as he's standing right there, he said, "The black community must now struggle for self-determination and the control of the institutions in the black community.  And because of the tragedies that are occurring in our community at the hands of the police and the hands of the white whatever, and ever, starting from this day forward, there is a black community--there is a black curfew and white people must be out of the black community by sundown." (laughs)  Oh, my goodness.  This set off a firestorm in the media.  I mean, "How are--what do you mean, Mr. Vivian, that white people have to be--what are you gonna do to the white who are not out of the black community by sundown?"  And his, his response was, "They must be out of the black community at sundown, and if they aren't out of the black community by sundown, you will see."  So this interrupted the news.  So this whole thing about the black curfew--
Speaker 2: Now, this is the same C. T. Vivian that marched with Dr. King--,
Speaker 1: Reverend C--who marched with Dr. King.
Speaker 2: --who spoke in, and he was hit in the mouth by the--I think it was (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was hit over the head.
Speaker 2: --you know, as he was talking about injustice.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's on 'Eyes on the Prize' [documentary film].
Speaker 2: That's a small film, you know.
Speaker 1: Yes, he was hit in the--this is the Reverend C. T. Vivian, who was representing the Consortium of Black Community Organizations with Calvin Lockridge and Jorja Palmer and, and so forth.  So this (pauses)--.
Speaker 2: So he's one of the national voices of non-violence actually--,
Speaker 1: Yes, he was, he was part of--.
Speaker 2: --who says, they'd better be out by sundown.
Speaker 1: He said that oughta be out, out of Chicago by sundown.  Well, of course, they went to Mr. [James W.] Compton at the Urban League.  And, you know, he didn't agree with that.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you know.  So there was a split that was taking place.  But what this did, I guess the white corporate world said, "We have to do something with these people in Chicago.  These people in Chicago, these black folks in Chicago are going crazy."
Story_ID: 20440
Speaker 1: So Archie, J. [James] Archie Hargraves was the Vice President of the Chicago Theological Seminary [Chicago, Illinois].  And if the truth be told, it was [William] Alvin Pitcher, a white professor over at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  As a matter of fact, I ran track against his son, Alvin Pitcher, who was a high jumper at the, at U High [University of Chicago Laboratory High School, Chicago, Illinois], old Al Pitcher.  But anyway, Al Pitcher was sort of a progressive, liberal theologian.  And he hooked up with Archie Hargraves, and they were the ones that came up with the idea of Operation Breadbasket at the University of Chicago, if the truth ever be told.  [Rev.] Jesse Jackson didn't know nothing about Operation Breadbasket.  But that was Archie Hargraves's idea that there should be this economic arm of the Civil Rights Movement in the South that should focus on economics--.
Speaker 2: He's still alive.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Archie is over at a church in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] as we speak today.  He did a lot of things that he's not really been credited with.  And he, and--but, Archie came up with this idea to write a proposal to these foundations because the foundations were looking for a way to contribute to, to this unrest that was going on.  So Archie Hargraves wrote proposal for a million dollars to create the Black Strategy Center for a million dollars.  And they convened all the major downtown businesses and corporate entities to this big meeting, about twenty-five of them and told them that they'd better give it up.  And they wrote this proposal for a, a million dollars of which I think they agreed to fund the Black Strategy Center for nine, over $900,000.  So Archie Hargraves was the President.  C. T. [Cordy Tindell] Vivian was the Vice President, and Calvin Lockridge was the other Vice President.  And they brought in all the people off the streets.  Their offices were at 1020 S. Wabash.  Now, there was all kind of other things going on in Chicago at the same time because what had happened, as a result of the Model Cities Program and the Jobs Program, all this Federal money was flowing through this, this, the City of Chicago.  And Erwin France was the head of Model--just millions of dollars were flowing through the city.  And the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] had a jobs program, a consortium of jobs programs.  And at the same time, there was this whole concern about how to address the so-called gangs in Chicago.  So the YMCA, the Boys Club [later the Boys and Girls Clubs of America] and the settlement agencies came together through an experiment to create what was called the Detached Worker Program.  That's where [Chicago Alderman] Fred [D.] Hubbard was the first Director of the Detached Worker Program, which was supposed to be a program to intervene with street organizations in trying to get them on a positive note and so forth.  That's actually how he got elected to Alderman in the 2nd Ward [Chicago, Illinois] if the story ever be told.  But out of this, monies that were coming from government, and it was competition.  And so some people said, "Why don't these Social Service agencies convene themselves."  And they can convene themselves into what was called (pauses)--oh, I can't think of the name of it.  But it was a program to address collectively, through the Boys Club, Chicago Youth Centers and the YMCA, a gang-intervention program.  And I'm blocking on the name.  And a guy name Earl Doty became the Director of it.  And [Donald] Don Lender (ph.) was the head of--Youth Action, that's what it was called.  Don Lender was the head of Youth Action West.  And they and, so all of--and they were to work on the streets to try to really get young people off the streets and into positive activity.  Now, all this was going on at the side of the black movements, simul--these actions were going on simultaneous to the black movement.  And there was a lot of interfacing between what was gonna--this was the money that was funded to T.W.O. [The Woodlawn Organization] to supposedly train the Blackstone Rangers [street gang], where all this investigation and controversy went on up on 63rd Street, a million-dollar job training program.  So Chicago was just absolutely on fire.
Story_ID: 20441
Speaker 1: So here I am, in graduate school, supposed to be a graduate school student at the [School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--and still working at the Sears YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] in the middle of, of the [Civil Rights] Movement that was taking place.  So [Charles] Charlie Ross who was, now up in Ohio, he was a fieldwork professor--.
Speaker 2: Is this Mwanza Ross?
Speaker 1: Mwanza Ross was a Fieldwork Professor at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Earl Durham, who had graduated a year before, who was one of the top students, they hired him as a Fieldwork Professor.  So with all of these--they went from three or four black students the previous graduate year at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], to about seventy, all at one time, at SSA [School of Social Service Administration] as a result of the demands of Abena Joan Brown, Catalyst and that whole group.  They just--and all of these students were on some kind of fellowship because the government now, through various programs, the Mental Health Department [sic, National Institute for Mental Health] and various agencies, were now providing scholarships in graduate schools of social work to recruit black people to, to go into the field of social work.  So we benefited from that.  At the time, we didn't have--I thought it was all ridiculous.  It didn't make any sense, but thank goodness, we were in the right place at the right time because Charles Ross took me under his wing, and while I was there, and kind of guided me through the University of Chicago because in the spring of 1970, Charles Ross, who had been working over--lived over in Gary [Indiana], who had been Richard Hatcher's Campaign Manager when he ran for Mayor in Gary, Indiana, now decided to run for Congress, U.S. Congress in Gary in 1970--my second semester at the School of Social Service Administration.  So he pulled me over into Gary.  In the meantime--and I was working in his campaign doing, getting social work credit, at the same time, I was assigned to an internship with a black local [labor union] that was organizing in the steel mills.  And I would--so what was really happening, they didn't really want me over at the University of Chicago so they really would let me do what I wanted to do so I wouldn't be in the classroom, disrupting and raising questions to the, these professors who I felt were ignorant.  So with that, I tried to take over a black local in the steel mill, and I was conspiring with steelworkers.  And I learned a lot about union organizing and, and I learned that they don't play with union organizers.  And on, and I thought I had my black slate, and I was meeting with the men who had worked in the steel mill and who had an all-black union that was controlled by white men, Polish men who worked in the steel mill.  And on the day of the election, on the day of the election, I was never so outdone in my life.  It was somewhere up on 103rd East, I can't remember, at the Union Hall.  They prevented the black people from voting with--and stood in front of the Union Hall and would beat up black folks all up and--they, they broke out the windows in my car, okay.  And we, obviously, we didn't win the election.  So I found out a lot about union organizing during this period.  And this was my first real involvement on the ground in an electoral, Congressional campaign in terms of somebody quote, unquote "Progressive" running for an elective office.  Even though I had been on the periphery and passed out leaflets and all of that, I had never really been directly involved in helping to build a political campaign.  And so, as a matter of fact, that year, Charlie Ross had me in 'JET' magazine.  Charlie--I got a copy of it somewhere.  We were in 'JET', that I was supposed to be his Deputy Campaign Manager.  I was a student at the University of Chicago.  But that was a heck of an, another heck of an experience because I spent most of my second semester at the University of Chicago in Gary and then out in the southeast area [of Chicago] organizing or helping to organize the steel, the black steelworkers who were trying to take over their union.
Story_ID: 20442
Speaker 1: So at the same time, all these other activities were going on, like the Congress of African People meeting that went on--CAP meeting that took place in Atlanta [Georgia], which I did not attend, but I heard about.  Like Stokely [Carmichael] coming in and out of Chicago [Illinois], and then also at the same time, Ralph Featherstone was blown up on the Baltimore [Maryland] Turnpike because they were looking for H. Rap Brown, and blew up Featherstone, who ran a book store right off the campus of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  So all this was, was connected.  Bobby Rush, after Fred Hampton's and Mark Clark's assassination, you know, Bobby Rush turned himself into--they said to [Rev.] Jesse [Jackson].  Everybody was looking for Bobby and they say he was next.  And it was a lot of controversy surrounding--.
Speaker 2: Wasn't Bobby--didn't he turn himself into Father [George] Clements?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but he turned himself actually in on the stage at Operation PUSH [People United to Save Humanity].  That's where the, it, it culminated.
Speaker 2: He hid out right across the street from (unclear) Clements (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Right, gilded, of course, the African, Afro-American Police League [Afro-American Patrolmen's League], I was actually at Renault's house the night that Howard [Saffold] and Renault [Robinson] and Obaseki [Hodari, formerly Jack DeBonnett] and Curtis Couzen (ph.) and that group of police officers, they were gonna form a league to try to model themselves after the police league in, in New York because Renault went to Hyde Park [High School, later Hyde Park Academy, Chicago, Illinois] with me, graduated a year after I did.  And I went over there with Obaseki--Jack DeBonnett who was a friend of mine, on the second floor in Renault's apartment and heard them talk about--I thought that they were crazy.  I mean how are the police gonna be revolutionary.  But that was a whole debate and, and a contradiction--.
Speaker 2: Wasn't [Edward] 'Buzz' Palmer (unclear)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Ah, Buzz Palmer, yes, most definitely Buzz Palmer which was, they were trying to, you know, reform and, and impact the [Chicago] Police Department and all of what it was doing in its service to the black community.  So all of, all of those activities were going on right here in Chicago.  So Chica--I was in the middle of all that, at one level or another.  And I can't think of any meetings I wasn't in.  I can't think of--I, I became, by this time, I was a master at laying out a flyer real quick, on a mimeograph machine, getting ink all over you.  I was Jorja [English] Palmer's errand boy because Jorja Palmer was a backroom strategist for--and she was a brilliant--Jorja Palmer could write up a--we could be in a meeting and say, this is what we want to do.  And, and by the next morning, she'd have a whole preamble--she'd have a whole position paper on whatever it was.  So with the issue of Lu [Lutrelle] Palmer because the Daily--he was work--a journalist for the 'Chicago Daily News' [newspaper].  And he wrote about what happened to Fred Hampton, they tried to edit his column, and he wouldn't stand it, for it.  And he decided to resign from the 'Chicago Daily News' and the [Black] Panthers went down and escorted him to the 'Chicago Daily News'--went in the Press Room, scared the--they scared the editorial, the people at the 'Chicago Daily News'.  They called the police, had squad cars and paddy wagons and all Lu Palmer was doing was to go get his things and the Panthers escorted him out of the building.  And all this was going on in Chicago.  And Lu Palmer started a newspaper out of that called 'The Black X-Press [Info-paper]' where he was gonna try to show and model how black people needed their own vehicle, our own instrument of communication.  This was by 1970.  Now, I'm still at the University of Chicago, allegedly.  I was doing some of my class work, etc.  But there as--but also, in 1970, a couple of things happened.  I believe it was 1970, yeah.  They had two incidents.  There was the Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] massacre of the white college students who were protesting against the war in Vietnam where the [Ohio] National Guard shot into the crowd and killed a few of the white students.  But there were also in, several months later, at Jackson State University [Jackson, Mississippi], the police--there was a demonstration about, the students were, were demonstrating over some of the inequities that were taking place at Jackson State University.  And the white sheriffs and the police shot into dormitories and killed some black students.  And so by this time, you know (pause), I remember calling a meeting on the campus of the University of Chicago, the black students.  I'm saying, "Yeah, we should support what happened to the students at Kent, but what about what they did to the students at Jackson State University?"  And it didn't get very much coverage in the press at all.  And they shot these students down in cold blood.  So I think we sent some people down to investigate.  We were the, kind of the, did some of the grunt work for the 'Black X-Press' and so forth.  And so, you know, this is 19--by 1970, so maybe the next time we talk we can pick up on how we began participating in the communi-versity.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir could you please state your full name for us?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Conrad Walter Worrill.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: December 15, 2009.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: The Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies], Northeastern Illinois University [Chicago, Illinois] in the suite of the Kemetic Institute [Kemetic Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 672439
Speaker 1: All right, so what we're doing is we're trying to complete an interview we started in 2002 and we were talking about the beginnings of the Communiversity and I think that you were in graduate school at that time at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Well 1968, 1969 was perhaps a real transitional part of my life because Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination on April 4, 1968 impacted the country and certainly impacted me because I had accepted a job in Los Angeles, California.  Because I had finally finished my degree at George Williams College [Downers Grove, Illinois] and I was torn between following in the footsteps of my father [Walter Fleming Worrill] in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] work and somehow being in the movement, which I at that point in my life had not figured out.  So I was heavily recruited to--because George Williams College is a YMCA college to come to California and work at the 28th Street YMCA in Los Angeles.  The symbolic significance of this was my father during World War II [WWII] was the executive director of the 28th Street Y and left quite a legacy.  So the elders associated with that YMCA seemed to be delighted to offer the position to the son of a man who had been there and sort of revitalized that Y during the war years.  So I went to Los Angeles, they seemed to be impressed with my knowledge of the YMCA and having been raised by a man who was distinguished in the YMCA work; and so I signed a contract for seven thousand dollars to be the executive director of the 28th Street Y.
Speaker 1: Now that- that's a good salary for those days, right?  'Cause people now think seven thousand dollars is--but that was a good salary then.
Speaker 2: So shortly after, as I recall, I was driving on the Eisenhower Expressway [Interstate 290] coming from the western suburbs either it must have been Maywood [Illinois], I don't remember exactly, and the radio came on, I was in a Volkswagen that I was driving.  I might have had some students, some the people from the community, I'm not sure but it came on the news that Dr. Martin Luther King had been assassinated and I pulled off at Homan [Homan Square, Chicago, Illinois]--exit and drove in the area of the Sears Y and--because I had been sort of relating in that area and within a moment's notice, Roosevelt Road was up in smoke.  So something just came over me and I said, I cannot go to Los Angeles, California, this doesn't make any sense at all.  And I sent them a telegram and told them that I could not take the job and this set off a firestorm within the YMCA circles and before too long my father had called me to tell me that I could--that was unprofessional, that I could not do that.  I had signed a contract and what in the heck was wrong with me.  And I just told him I couldn't do it.  One thing led to another and it was another one of those rocky periods and conflict with my father that I had on that issue.  But somehow through his influence I ended up working over at the Sears YMCA [Chicago, Illinois] as the program director, so I didn't leave Chicago [Illinois].  So there was just so much going on in that period because I had befriended Fred Hampton.  I was sort of working with him when he was the president of the NAACP Youth Council in Maywood.  The Panthers [Black Panther Party] were forming in Chicago.  I was trying to do black movement organizing as a YMCA professional and it, I, I renamed all the rooms in the Y--the Nat Turner room, the Malcolm X room, the Martin Luther King room.  As a matter of fact, they had a big debate with the board at the Y, of the Sears Y because they were in opposition to one of the game rooms being named in honor of Malcolm and it was so funny to me because they didn't debate on Nat Turner.  Nat Turner actually was engaged in warfare--physical warfare.  And so I was, I was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Do you suppose that they didn't know who Nat Turner (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I don't think they did.
Story_ID: 672440
Speaker 1: But all of that, I say all of that to say that that was a real transitional period for me in my life trying to get a hold of the Y because there were a lot of street organizations that had, had somehow taken over the Y in terms of the Roman Saints, the Vice Lords, et cetera, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've never heard of the Roman Saints.
Speaker 1: The Roman Saints were a very powerful street organization in and around the North Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] area and they were the counterpart to the Vice Lords.  And so that was also my beginning of working and interacting on the streets through my YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] hat; and my big challenge was just to get a hold of the youth department so the kids in the community could come and have access to the skating rink, the swimming pool, the gymnasium, et cetera, et cetera.  And one of the strategies I utilized--I called up Fred [Fred Hampton] by this time he was a Panther, okay, in the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party and I asked Fred to do me a favor and he came over with some Panthers and we did some negotiation with the Roman Saints and before too long we had gotten control of the Y.  And so during that year we must have moved into 1969, Abena Joan Brown [HistoryMaker Abena Joan P. Brown]--and we were doing so much with the kids.  We were taking the kids up to Michigan and I was having Black History Month programs and we were trying to use the framework of the Y to put some type of consciousness--because our consciousness was in transition; everything was happening in America.  It was just a couple of months prior to that, we, we had been calling ourselves Negroes and all of a sudden we became black people.  So it was this great transition and this re-identification with Africa and so I was in the middle of this transition along with the whole black movement and everything that was going on in America was sort of steeped in my soul.
Story_ID: 672441
Speaker 1: By 1969, sometime I don't remember, Abena Joan Brown [HistoryMaker Abena Joan P. Brown] came to me and I had known her from her work in Catalyst [The Catalyst], I had known her from work as--the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and I had known her for, for being an outspoken activist around racial inequity and social service agencies in the City of Chicago [Illinois] and being a leader of the movement to address that issue.  And Abena came to me and said, "You need to go back to school," and I told her I had, I struggled to get a bachelor's degree; the last thing I had on mind was going back to school, that was not me.  And she said, "You are a fool, you're going back to school and I don't care what you say because a lot of resources have come down, different funding and I graduated from the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration [Chicago, Illinois] and they'd come to me to recruit other African descendent people to come to school and open up the doors of SSA," this premier school of social work in this country.  I told her I don't care what she was proposing, I was not going to do that and that was the end of that and she said that--we got into a big argument and she said, "You're going to take your butt over there."  I can't repeat the language that she used and you are going to the university and I resisted.  But somehow, I don't know what happened, I think she contacted the people and told them to contact me and so out of diplomacy I went over to the SSA and filled out the application and before too long, I was admitted to the School of Social Service Administration.  Through the endorsement of Abena Joan Brown and also Charles Mwanza Ross [Mwanza; Charles O. Ross, Jr.] was a fieldwork professor there and Jay Gaylord [ph.] was a field professor.  Arnita Boswell [Arnita Young Boswell], Whitney Young's sister was a field work professor there.  Earl Durham was a--he had finished the year before but he was such a bright student and older man, they hired him as an assistant professor.
Speaker 2: That's Dick Durham's [Richard Durham]--?
Speaker 1: Dick Durham's brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--and plus I had--that's a whole another story because I had worked with--I had met Earl Durham on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] at a mental health center through my work at the Y [Young Men's Christian Alliance].  So I went--that particular day, I don't know what happened, I ran into all these people saying, "Yeah Conrad [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill], we hear you're coming to school," blah, blah blah.  So I reluctantly enrolled in SSA and I--my feeling was, this wasn't going to last and I was doing this to appease Abena Joan Brown.  And so I continued to work that semester and I was living on the West Side, 5013 West Maypole [Avenue] and I was going to school and trying to do the Y thing but somehow or another I got into the school thing and figured out that this wasn't as challenging as I thought it was going to be.  And as a matter of fact, it appeared to be somewhat lightweight; and so I decided to resign from the Y and just go head in to SSA.  So 1969, 1970 was my first full year of graduate school at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and I was involved in organizing the black students, I met, I met Malala [ph.] whose name was Cheryl Simms [ph.].  I met her at the School of Social Service Administration [University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, Chicago, Illinois] and along with some other black students, we began to form an organization among the graduate students and relate to the other graduate students and I was still relating to the West Side.
Speaker 2: Now was Black Body formed by that time?
Speaker 1: Black Body was formed; I think that was Mansong Kulubally.  I had heard of them.  So much--during that time there was so much going on you'd have to have a genealogical chart to kind of be connected because something was going on all the time.
Speaker 2: I just wonder if the student groups were related because Black Body was an attempt to align all the black student groups together, right--and they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, right and they--I think they kind of emanated--I think Linda White [HistoryMaker Linda M. White] was her name at that time; Iva E. Carruthers [HistoryMaker Iva Carruthers] was a teacher along with her friend at Dunbar [sic. Farragut High School; Farragut Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] and I think and Hannibal Afrik [Harold Charles; Baba Hannibal Afrik], I think they had a lot to do with advising many of the high school students.  I wasn't directly involved in that movement but all roads led to the unfolding of black consciousness in the City of Chicago [Illinois] and this related also to some extent to the unfolding of the Communiversity.
Story_ID: 672442
Speaker 1: So, 1969, 1970 I was in graduate school.  I had a real experience because Mwanza Ross [Mwanza; Charles O. Ross, Jr.] ran for U.S. Congress in Gary in 1970 and he somehow recruited me to volunteer to work in his campaign.  That was my first real political campaign.  I was supposed to be an assistant campaign manager.  We didn't have any money and he was running against Ray J. Madden [Ray Madden] who had been in Congress like fourteen, fifteen terms.  He was an old white man and this district [Indiana 1st Congressional District] was predominantly black and we just thought that this would be a shoo-in because Charles Ross was actually the strategist that led to the election of [HistoryMaker] Richard Hatcher in 1967.   And so he felt that--and then he ran once in '68 [1968] with Hatcher's backing and it was a fairly close election.  So he just assumed that by 1970 it was going to be a shoo-in.  Well something happened in the politics--I don't really know the, what happened but Hatcher didn't endorse Ross and so we were up against him.  So I spent--I, as a field--for my field internship at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, Chicago, Illinois], I worked in Charles Ross' campaign for a whole quarter and practically lived in Gary, Indiana.
Speaker 2: I just want to say for the record, Charles Ross, well known in Ohio for hosting cultural unity weekend, I think his, he had Ujamaa Shule [Umoja Sasa Shule]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in Columbus [Ohio] and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --very well known there.
Speaker 1: So I became very close with Charles.  And also during that time I had another internship with some steel workers, which was an inter- interest- I can't remember the chronology but somehow some steel workers came to me.  They said they heard I was a pretty good organizer and they wanted--and that I was in graduate school and that they were a predominantly black shop over at U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] but that all the leadership of the union [United Steelworkers] was white and would I come over there and help them organize an election in the union so that they could run their slate of black candidates.  This was over in Southeast [Southeast Side, Chicago, Illinois].  Larry [Larry Crowe], I have never experienced anything like that.  On the day of the election, they were shooting in the streets, okay.  And this might have went on for two months and the guy who was the leader of--worked in the steel mill for thirty or forty years, owned a building and rented to Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] on 67th [Street] and Ridgeland [Avenue] and so we used to meet over in his building and I used to run into Jesse all of the time.  And I said, would ask--you know mentioned to Jesse that we needed some help to try to organize and, and--but on that day they put so much fear in the black workers in that steel mill, they didn't come out to vote and the white people won the election.  So I say all that to say those--I can't even get out at night.  Then, of course, December 4, 1969 when Fred Hampton and Mark Clark was assassinated and I'm not really doing this in any chronological context but I just happened to think that that was a very impactful and devastating event that occurred in Chicago [Illinois].  And so--
Speaker 2: We actually did talk about that the last time.  In fact, a lot of what you're saying we kind of talked about, but I wanted you to get warmed up so I didn't want to stop you (laughter).
Story_ID: 672443
Speaker 1: Yeah you talked about the assassination of Fred Hampton and some of the fallout of that.  But I never asked you this question the last time and that is did you have any organizing training--any formal training as an organizer in, at the SSA [University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, Chicago, Illinois] or something?
Speaker 2: No--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Because I know Jake [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] was telling me once that Saul Alinsky came to town.  I don't--this is the home of where they started doing that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah well the industrial areas foundation, no I had no training as an organizer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If I look back on it, my training came from my family, okay.  My father [Walter Fleming Worrill] was an organizer.  Okay, he--that's the kind of work he did when I reflect back on it.  So I was in a house with a man who organized.  And, so I would say that my influence and propensity towards organizing work was heavily influenced by my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right.  So well, was there a community--how did the community organize around the murder of Fred Hampton to, you know?
Speaker 2: Well it was so much activity, the funeral, the campaign emerged around naming Crane Junior College [Malcom X College, Chicago, Illinois] in honor of Malcolm X, the student movement on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] that was quite heavy.  The Panthers [Black Panther Party] were very much involved in and based in and around Crane Junior College; and the whole targeting of Edward Hanrahan, which was a two year campaign to--
Speaker 1: Now he was state's attorney, right?
Speaker 2: He was state's attorney that led to the successful campaign of defeating him, I believe it was in 1972 and black people re- voted, voted Republican and Bernard Carey was elected as the state's attorney.  So I was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hanrahan planned the raid, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the point man for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and all the law enforcement agency that--he was really working on behalf of the FBI.  When the--this new book ['The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther,' Jeffrey Haas] has just come out on the murder of Fred Hampton that's very good that Jeffrey Haas who was the lawyer--the people's law firm that they waged battle for many years and the survivors who were in the house were paid $1.85 million in the late--or the early 1980s.
Speaker 1: So it took like--this is twenty years really almost to get--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --well, yeah, yeah twelve years.
Story_ID: 672444
Speaker 1: So now I'm realizing that graduate school was not as tough as I thought it was going to be and it became pretty interesting and I started to get into the academy, I guess you could say because I, I just felt like a lot of the ideas that came out of this social work school would, just appeared to be ridiculous and at that time, I didn't really know the basis and foundation of white supremacy in the academy and how it emerged and how it dribbled down into what is called the social work curriculum, that came later.  But I was always challenging and my professors in trying to struggle with the intuition that something wasn't right in this curriculum at SSA [University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, Chicago, Illinois].  So by 19--now all of this is going on and in 1971, I, I was slated to graduate and the--some of the black leaders in Chicago [Illinois] had managed to get the corporate structure to give them close to a million dollars to create the Black Strategy Center [Chicago, Illinois] and the Black Strategy Center was housed at 1020 South Wabash [Avenue] and C.T. Vivian [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. C.T. Vivian], Calvin Lockridge [R. Calvin Lockridge] and Archie Hargraves [J. Archie Hargraves] were the principal players in the negotiation with Marshall Fields [Marshall Field and Company] and some of these other corporate downtown Chicago financial giants; and they gave them nine hundred thousand dollars to establish the Black Strategy Center, which was supposed to be a think tank to address many of the problems facing black people in Chicago.  Well somehow I was recruited to be, to do an internship at the Black Strategy Center and one day I was on the elevator and a guy got on the elevator and said, "I'm looking for Conrad Worrill [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill]," and I said, "I'm Conrad Worrill."  He said, "Well my name is Ken Dowden [ph.] and I've come here to recruit you into a Ph.D. program at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].  And I told him, "You must be crazy."  He says, "No I'm not."  So we got off the elevator, we went and sat down and he explained to me that he was a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin in a fellowship program called Triple T: teacher, trainer of teachers.  And that they were recruiting people who had not been formally trained in education and who had an activist background because they wanted people--to train people who had a community based background to be trained in curriculum and development and social st- series, train teachers.  And I said, "You must be crazy."  He said, "There's a fellowship, they'll pay for your tuition, you've been highly recommended, you've been discussed," and I know nothing about this.  And what had happened, one of the persons that had selected to be in this Ph.D. program dropped out.  They said--so the guy said, "Why don't you just come up there for an interview?"  I hadn't even officially finished my master's degree at the University of Chicago and I was doing an internship at the Black Strategy Center and all of this was happening.  So I went up for the interview in Madison, Wisconsin and met this Jewish fellow who I f- learned later was the top curriculum expert in the country, Fred Newman.  He was the chair of the curriculum development program at the university.  So I interviewed and I guess I did all right and they asked me to formally apply and now I go from not wanting to go to the University of Chicago to almost completing my master's degree in social work to being recruited into a Ph.D. program.  All this was happening at lightning speed.  They accepted me and for--I believe I was ac- formally accepted in January of 1971 and they asked me to take one class and I commuted to Madison, finished up my master's degree, worked at the Black Strategy Center and in June of 1971 I moved to Madison, Wisconsin; so that's a whole nother story.
Story_ID: 672445
Speaker 1: Now in the meantime, the, I'm struggling now in the Ph.D. program [at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] and I'm thrust in Madison, Wisconsin and there were three other black Ph.D. students, Ken Dowden [ph.], Gene Robertson [William Robertson] and Ken Addison [Kenneth Addison] and so we formed a little group.  There were about fifteen other black people and we began to try to figure out how we were going to negotiate this Ph.D. program.  I'm--all of this is just, I can't--when I look back on it, I'm saying how in the world did I find myself in this.  But anyway, my good friend Leon Harris used to laugh at me because I would come home on the weekend and hang out with Leon and Leon said, "You need to come down here man because you're really out the box," and down here meant the Communiversity.  So during the two years that I was in Madison on a regular basis, I would come back to Chicago [Illinois] and participate in the Communiversity and Leon kind of helped me behind the scenes shape an idea that turned out to be my doctoral dissertation.
Speaker 2: Okay, well I--that's a lead in to what was that idea (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well my dissertation topic was institutions and power and the role of teaching these concepts in a second- social studies secondary curriculum.  So my whole orientation was the examination of institutions, organizations, agencies and their relationship to power; and how you could create a curriculum to help young African American students understand these concepts and put it into action in terms of understanding how to negotiate institutions in power in their community.  So that's what I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, now go back a minute and tell us like to your understanding who, how was Communiversity started, what was it and who participated in it?
Speaker 1: Well the Communiversity was an outgrowth of the student movement in Chicago who wanted some alternative interaction outside the academy to independently discuss the real meaning of black education.  And so the students convened and reached out to a number of professors and teachers and leaders in Chicago, like Bobby Wright [Bobby E. Wright], like Anderson Thompson, like [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates, like Bob Rhodes [Robert Rhodes].
Story_ID: 672446
Speaker 1: --ethora of, of scholar activists in Chicago [Illinois] and they just started informally meeting and it grew into this Saturday structure of all day interaction around every topic that affected people of African descent worldwide.  And the Communiversity in, perhaps was my saving intellectual grace, if you will because by the time I had got- started participating in the Communiversity, we had--it had sort of settled down to--maybe, in the beginning there were hundreds of people who came on Saturday but it settled down.  Every Saturday a hundred, 150 people would come to this building.  We would break into our study groups.  If we weren't studying Karl Marx, if we weren't--Chancellor Williams' book, Bobby Wright's [Bobby E. Wright] class on black psychology, Anderson Thompson's class on the black movement and studying all the movements going, being introduced to Martin Delany, being introduced to Bishop Henry Mc- [Henry McNeal Turner], people I'd never heard of; Edward Wilmot Blyden, Hosea Easton, the g- studying the Garvey [Marcus Garvey] movement, studying the evolution of the white left coming out of the International Workingmen's Association in 1864.  And looking at the tributaries and studying Marx and, and studying all the various left tendency--I mean we, looking at China and the Chinese Communist Party and what happened in the 1920s and the African Blood Brotherhood [African Blood Brotherhood for African Liberation and Redemption] and then looking at the Blyden Society [Blyden Society for the Study of African History; The Harlem History Club] in the 1930s.  All of this was going on in the Communiversity and this was my education; and then on top of that Dr. Thompson [Anderson Thompson] was the leader of the Association of African Historians and we would have conferences and I was introduced to Dr. Clarke [John Henrik Clarke] and then Dr. Ben [HistoryMaker Yosef ben-Jochannan] and later on down the line John Jackson [John G. Jackson].  So all of these people would come in February to these conferences; Max Roach, James Fadey, intro- got introduced to Che Kantadiya [ph.].  All this was on Saturday in the Communiversity so by the time I finished my Ph.D. [at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] in 1973, I was like a Communiversity-ite person and that really helped shaped--now all of, while all of this is going on, Larry [Larry Crowe], 19--in Gary [Indiana] in 1972 was the National Black Political Convention.  I heard about it, I drove all the way from Madison [Wisconsin] and went over to Gary.  Didn't know what I was doing, just walking around with ten thousand black people in this fired up political convention.  And it was in the air that black people needed to form their own black independent political party.  So, all--at the same time that was in March and then May 27, 1972 there, I heard there was going to be an African Liberation Day march, rally and parade sponsored by the African Liberation Support Committee.  That went down and so all of this organizing activity was occurring.  I'm in Madison coming to the Communiversity and trying to stay connected.
Speaker 2: These activities involved hundreds of people, maybe thousands of people in terms of African Liberation Day--
Speaker 1: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --just to give a perspective--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But there were about fifty, sixty thousand people at ALD in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] in '72 [1972] and there were at least ten--eight to ten thousand people in Gary for the National Black Political Convention that had been organized of, through the CAP cadres of the Congress of Afrikan People led by Baraka [Amiri Baraka] at that time.  It was a masterful organizing event and the pan-African nationalist movement was at fever pitch during that particular period and had arisen to a kind of an ascendency where the nationalist fervor in America was very impactful.
Story_ID: 672447
Speaker 1: Can you think of a ti- of the time when you first considered yourself a black nationalist?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I ca- I don't, I can- I don't know in our previous interview if I talked about the time that I saw Malcolm X on television.  I, I could never in my soul--I never believed that integration was the solution to black people's problem.  Now this was just in my spirit, I was never against any other people but it always seemed to me that we should take care of ourselves.  That was just something that, that was in my soul, maybe the people I talked to, I'm not sure.  I, I would say that probably by 1968 or '69 [1969], I started seeing myself as a black nationalist--maybe even '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay and at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] or at University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], did--were there any black instructors that had that perspective or teaching anything that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: At the University of Chicago, Charles Mwanza Ross [Mwanza; Charles O. Ross, Jr.] had that orientation and that was interesting because Earl Durham was a Marxist and so we--Earl was a great organizer and a great thinker but he was, he came out of the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] that were--and he was in the left camp.  So that gave us in our class, something to balance off these ideas but Charles Ross--Mwanza was definitely a black nationalist.
Speaker 1: Now was he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But in Wisconsin, there was nobody.  Wisconsin we didn't even have any African American professors when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now was Mwanza Ross part of Congress of Afrikan People or did he become part of it?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He always had his own organizational base in Gary [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a great organizer, I learned a lot about organizing from Charles Mwanza Ross.
Story_ID: 672448
Speaker 1: So, how, how long did Communiversity last?
Speaker 2: Well as an idea the Communiversity still exists, but in terms of work on Saturday and meeting consistently on Saturday, I would say all the way up to 1977 because through the Communiversity and the Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] and the role that Jacob Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] was playing, along with Andy [Anderson Thompson] who had gone to Africa--they had both gone to Africa to study.  I think Jake at least two times on sabbatical where he met Diop [Cheikh Anta Diop] and Andy at least once where he took Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin]--they, Billy Brown [ph.], they went to Africa one time, they toughed it out and they came back pushing the idea that we should have a study tour and that we should all go to Africa.  And a lot of this advocacy of going to Africa was occurring on Saturday in our organizing through the Communiversity, hooked into the Center for Inner City Studies and I would say up until the latter part of the 19--maybe, up until 1977; that was our first study tour to Africa.  It was about forty students and, and community persons and faculty from the Carruthers Center who went on that study--three week study tour.  After that period, if my memory serves me correctly around '78 [1978] when Jake had a little meeting with Andy and I and had this proposal to establish a Kemetic institute.  I didn't know what a Kemetic institute was but it was after that period that the activity and the Communiversity began to wane because there was so much else going on.
Speaker 1: Okay, so while the different aspects of Communiversity were organizing a different way, you're saying--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I would say so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672449
Speaker 1: Since you're the historian around here, or one of the historians around here, you know, when did--I've often wondered when did CICS start--the Center for Inner City Studies at Northeastern Illinois University [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965] there was a request for a proposal that, from the [U.S.] Office of Education to establish a graduate program to retrain teachers in the inner city.  One of--there may have been two African American professors at Northeastern at the time.  One of them was Dr. Donald Smith.  And Don Smith along with some other professors in the college of education at Northeastern College, it wasn't a university at that time.  It had come from Chicago Teachers College West [sic. Chicago Teachers College North, Chicago, Illinois] that became Northeastern College [Northeastern Illinois State College, Chicago, Illinois] and they bought the land at Bryn Mawr [Avenue] and St. Louis [Avenue].  Don Smith had grown up in this neighborhood [Bronzeville, Chicago, Illinois], graduated from Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and so he was familiar with the neighborhood.  So they put the proposal together and it was successful.  And so Dr. Smith because of his knowledge of this building, which was the Abraham Lincoln Center [Chicago, Illinois], he came to the administrators and asked if space could be used to--in this program to establish a graduate program to retrain teachers in the inner city.  And they agreed to let Dr. Smith use space, he recruited a number of persons like Andy Thompson [Anderson Thompson] who was the assistant principal at Forrestville High School [Chicago, Illinois] and Barbara Sizemore [HistoryMaker Barbara A. Sizemore] who was the principal, Don Bailey who was the speech and language man.  A number of other persons whose names escape me and they began creating the curriculum and recruited students, about fifteen to twenty students who were on fellowships from around the United States who met here to begin developing the curriculum that became the master's degree program in inner city studies in 1966.  So 1966 was the first year of the establishment of the graduate program, the master's degree program in inner city studies.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, 'cause I never knew that (laughter) how that got started, so--
Story_ID: 672450
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about this building, too.  Now this was the Abraham Lincoln Center [Chicago, Illinois] when they moved in here but what about the Abraham Lincoln Center, (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well the Abraham Lincoln Center was an outgrowth, Larry [Larry Crowe], of the settlement house movement in Chicago [Illinois] led by Jane Addams.  The European immigration to this country and its tributaries to Chicago with the many ethnic groups that make up this city were in the late 19th century and early 20th century.  Jane Addams led a movement to help European immigrants make adjustments to living an urban life, specifically Chicago through food, clothing, shelter, language, education, employment; how to make an adjustment to living in America, language barriers, et cetera.  So that movement became quite an impactful movement, but it was based near where the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] is now.  That's where Jane--as a matter of fact, Jane Addams school of social work [Jane Addams College of Social Work, Chicago, Illinois] is in the area where Jane Addams did a lot of her organizing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The house is still over there, right?  Over on campus?  Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, so on this side of town there was a Unitarian pastor by the name of William--Jenkins Lloyd Jones [Jenkin Lloyd Jones] and he was in the Unitarian church somewhere in this area [Fourth Unitarian Church, Chicago, Illinois]; and a big fight broke out among the Unitarians and a split occurred because they wanted to get involved in organizing these immigrant groups that were living in this area.  And they formed another church called the All Souls Church [All Souls Unitarian Church, Chicago, Illinois] and decided that they were going to dovetail into this settlement house movement and they lost the campaign to build a physical structure to participate in this movement because at the turn of the century this neighborhood that--it's called Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] today, was populated primarily by Polish people.  And so in the late--1898, 1899 they went on a campaign to raise money and commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright and his firm and some of his family members and associates to begin to put designs together to build this structure, which I think they raised somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars, commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright and in 1905 this building went up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's a historic building (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a historic building named the Abraham Lincoln Center.
Story_ID: 672451
Speaker 1: Over time there's a, there's even more to it.  I know and--you want to tell us about--the WPA era and some of that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, research has it in 1915, W.E. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] gave a lecture in the auditorium here and over a period of time the auditorium here at the Carruthers Center [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], or the Abraham Lincoln Center at that time.  There were always a number of community events, always going--Paul Robeson spoke in the auditorium, the book 'Black Metropolis' ['Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City'] written by St. Clair Drake and Horace Cayton [Horace R. Cayton, Jr.], they received financing from the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] as scholars to do the research while they were in graduate school at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and they actually lived on the seventh floor, an apartment in this building conducting the research that ended up being that seminal work, 'Black Metropolis.'  So this building just has so much history, but the transition from the Eastern European, Polish neighborhood to a black--predominantly black neighborhood is interesting also because of the riots of 1919.  You had the migration of black people coming from the South because of what was going on with regards to lynching and the recruitment of the industrial plants in the city to recruit blacks to come and work in the steel mills and other major industries.  And at the same time these industries were recruiting and subsidizing the Eastern Europeans to move southeast.  So in 1919 when word went out that the black kid had been drowned by the whites at, white people at the 31st Street Beach [Chicago, Illinois], a riot broke out in and around this area.  And it's called the riot of 1919.  During that time, it was right after World War I [WWI] and during that time men could bring their weapons home when they were discharged from the [U.S.] military.  So black men and white men had rifles and for over a week there was arms insurrections in and around this general community.  And so after that there was a tremendous push to relocate the whites southeast--the eastern European; and there was an intensification of black people moving into this area and that began the transition of what we, what is known today as Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois].  When I was coming up, it was called the Low End.
Story_ID: 672452
Speaker 1: You finished your Ph.D. in--?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-three [1973], okay.  So what did you do immediately after you finished your Ph.D.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well I didn't have a job and I couldn't get a job--nobody would hire me, you know.  I don't know what was going on.  At the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] they pride themselves on assisting their doctoral students in getting positions as professors in America and they, they put your resume together and they send it out.  And so that happened with me, but I didn't get one request for a job.
Speaker 1: Now what were your aspirations at that point?  What kind of job did you want?
Speaker 2: I just wanted to--by this time I wanted to teach and I wanted to, I wanted to either run an agency and do organizing work or teach black people.  And how that worked out--so I had a job offer--the only job offer I had was the Response to Educational Needs Project in Washington, D.C. which was a program in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.], Anacostia to Southeast, D.C. to experiment with community control of the educational system in Washington, D.C. and I knew some people down there.  They brought me down there, they, I was interviewed--the people--the grassroots people seemed to like me and I was almost on my way to take the job because I didn't have a job.  When--one of the professors I had had at George Williams College [Downers Grove, Illinois], I'm blocking on his name right now.  And he was kind of, I guess quote unquote a progressive and he taught philosophy and he heard somehow that I was finishing up my degree in Madison and he called me to say that George Williams College was establishing an urban institute and wanted me to head up this urban institute because they wanted to get more into the urban issues or something or another and would I be interested.  And I remember I drove all the way from Madison, Wisconsin to Downers Grove [Illinois].  I bought a two dollar shirt or something and went for the interview and I was hired as an assistant professor in the urban institute at George Williams College, which was the undergraduate school that I had finished.  And that was a very interesting experience.  That was my first professorship so to speak, assistant professor at George Williams College.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were returning home in some re--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Returning, I finally got back in Chicago area.
Speaker 1: So were you the only black professor on campus?
Speaker 2: There were one--maybe one or two more if my memory serves correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay, well how long were you there and what happened?
Speaker 2: Two--I was there two and a half years coming into the communi- I brought the whole Communiversity program out to George Williams College.  We had a conference.  I had Bobby Wright [Bobby E. Wright], Andy Thompson [Anderson Thompson], Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.].  I had the whole black nationalist movement one weekend at George Williams College.  I, I don't know where those documents are but we had a whole black experience weekend at George Williams College.
Story_ID: 672453
Speaker 1: By this time I had met Jake [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] and [HistoryMaker] Iva Carruthers and I really said, "One day I hope I can get a job at the Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois]."  And I remember asking Iva about it and she said, "Oh yeah I'll mention it to my husband," and I came over here, I was out at George Williams and I gave Dr. Carruthers my resume, he didn't seem to be too interested and nothing ever happened.  But in 1975, I guess they had a position available, and Andy [Anderson Thompson]--I was working very close with Andy and Andy said to me to apply.  And by this time the center had moved out because this building was under renovation, to 4545 Drexel [Boulevard] to the old Bronzeville elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay so Abraham Lincoln Center [Chicago Illinois] moved out of this building and gave it up entirely to Northeastern or what, did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, that's a whole other story.  Okay we're mixing it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh the center (unclear) studies moved--okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I didn't mention that in 1968 the Abraham Lincoln Center built a new Abraham Lincoln Center and Northeastern Illinois University [Chicago, Illinois] purchased the Abraham Lincoln Center for $250 thousand and this proper- this became the property of the state and thus became the Center for Inner City Studies in 1968.  The building was very raggedy, it was in bad shape and so over the years there was a campaign to extract capital dollars to renovate the Center for Inner City Studies.  So in the mid-1970s that happened and the center moved out over to 4545 Bronzeville--Drexel where I was interviewed for the position here by all of the faculty at th- and staff at that time.  I didn't learn until years later that the person that I was competing with for the position was Kobi Kambon, Joe Baldwin [Joseph Baldwin] was his name at that time.  And I didn't know that Jake was supporting Joe Baldwin and Andy was supporting me and I got the vote, I'm understanding years later when this leaked out by one, one vote.  And Joe didn't know--I knew of him and he knew of me, we didn't know we were applying for the position, but years later it came out as to what really happened.  So he went down to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and I ended up working here.
Speaker 2: Well they had two strong candidates apparently.  Yeah, so okay so you started in 1975?
Speaker 1: Right, technically I began January 1976 but all the interviews and what happened and then the negotiations were in December 1975.
Speaker 2: Yeah Joe--Kobi Kambon, he's one of the, one of the best black psychologists we have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, he is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in the country, right.
Speaker 1: Yes he was very close with Jake.
Speaker 2: Okay so what did you teach when you started?
Speaker 1: I taught a class, history and culture of ethnic groups, was a class that I taught.  I taught a class--introduction to inner city studies.  I taught a class on history and philosophy of black education.  I taught a class, I believe, revolutionary movements.  I taught a graduate course, research writing.  So I began just teaching a number of undergraduate and graduate courses.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  But, so a lot of the--well, so a lot of activities you were involved in at George Williams just kind of carried over to the center, or?
Speaker 1: Well I re- I resigned from George Williams College [Downers Grove, Illinois] and took the professorship here and I was glad to get away from George Williams College.  So no, there wasn't--that was just a job that I had but the center became more of a way of life--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because it was connected to the Communiversity, it was connected to people I was working with and it was my dream position.  It was in the community and I was blessed to have been cho- selected for the position.  That's, that's all I can say.
Story_ID: 672454
Speaker 1: Okay, well I guess what I was trying to--I, let me rephrase this that--there have been a number of activities, I guess, established you know out of the center [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] and out of the center's activities that are institutionalized basically in the black community now.  One of them is African Liberation Day and--can you tell us about that?  I mean there was African Liberation Day, there was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, see this is what happened, after--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) birthdays--(unclear)--there was a whole lot of things came out of--yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Kwanzaa, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah but see those--okay those were not necessarily connected--they, you would have to almost probably have a group discussion with different people.  The Confederation of Pan-African Organizations were people who had participated in the Communiversity, who were leaders of organizing the first African Liberation Day in Chicago [Illinois] in 1973 because in '72 [1972] was a national African Liberation Day, but in '73 [1973] they were decentralized.   By '74 [1974] there was a national debate and split inside the African Liberation Support Committee inside the National Black Political Convention on the intrusion of some of the leadership who were shifting into Marxism.  So a whole debate broke out in the black movement around that. So the Confederation of Pan-African Organizations also sponsored the first Kwanzaa in Chicago.  So we'd have to give credit to this coalition called the Confederation of Pan Africanist organi- (unclear), there was just--you know Hannibal Afrik [Baba Hannibal Afrik], I'm trying to think of--Rurwa Shuree [ph.]--it was just a host of--[HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti, and the forces of the institute [Institute of Positive Education, Chicago, Illinois]--all of these were a part of--the topographical research center [Black Peoples Topographical Research Center, Chicago, Illinois] forces.  So most of the black--the catalyst forces were all part of this confederation that sponsored African Liberation Day, the Saba Saba that never really got--never really did catch on and Kwanzaa.  But then the debate, the split, the, a struggle nationally in the movement over Marxism somehow impacted the African Liberation Day energy nationally.  And so ALD and Kwanzaa waned for a year or two; and, and what we did, we came back with another form of the confederation into what was called the African Community of Chicago, which we began to organize to pick up from where the Confederation of Pan-African Organizations had--had attempted.
Story_ID: 672455
Speaker 1: What were the key issues, I guess in contention, you know, with the Marxist and the nationalists--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well I think that, well there was just so much going on.  I think that sometimes people run out of gas and that the--there was a running out of gas period, and we helped kind of bring the spirit back or the fire you would see through the African Community of Chicago.  So we began to sponsor African Liberation Day and then we, we made something that--did something that was kind of controversial.  We suggested that African Liberation Day needed to be on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and there was some resistance in the beginning but the African Community of Chicago began sponsoring ALD down Madison Boulevard [sic. Madison Street].  And we had the first bringing back the spirit and energy of Kwanzaa at the South Shore YMCA [Chicago, Illinois] in 1979, 1980.  We had a thousand people packed in the gym; and by, but this time, June of 1980 there was a call to the National Black United Front and we were involved in that.  And so after a year of two of forming the Chicago chapter of the National Black United Front we took the African Community of Chicago organizing project inside the National Black United Front and the National Black United Front began sponsoring African Liberation Day for a number of years, as well as the citywide Karamu Ya Imani.
Speaker 1: Okay and that's be--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And all of this was done out of the Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As well as a number of other activities, the Kemetic Institute [Kemetic Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] was beginning to emerge, et cetera.
Speaker 1: And what--now I want to go back to, I guess--so after African Liberation Day consists of a parade, a march--
Speaker 2: A parade, a march--
Speaker 1: --a rally?
Speaker 2: --speakers, solidarity, messages, the struggle--to k- highlight the struggle in South Africa and the general African liberation support work and the whole bringing together of the African--various components of the African community on a day to highlight people of African descent worldwide.  So we, we had real grassroots flavor, we had marching bands from high schools, community groups and we started at Austin Avenue and we would go into Garfield Park [Chicago, Illinois] and have a day of activities.  It was quite an event that we, we, we really--up until about 1997, '98 [1998], and I think we ran out of gas.
Story_ID: 672456
Speaker 1: We were talking about the debate that emerged around Marxism versus nationalism, Pan Africanism that broke out full blast i- around '73 [1973], '72 [1972].  Th- it really broke out in the African Liberation Support Committee because the African Liberation Support Committee went from a slogan of, "We are an African people," that workers of the world shunite- should unite; and so led by Abdul Alkalimat of g- formerly Gerald McWorter who was one of the leading Marxist theoreticians inside the African Liberation Support Committee and Owusu [Howard Fuller, Owusu Sadauki] the influences of Marxist idea--Marxist Leninist idea of--got propelled in a document called Frogmore.  It was the Frogmore document where they laid out this whole long rationale for this proletarian revolution with black people uniting with the working class people and they began to change the whole agenda of--of African interests solely around African Liberation Day.  So it was just a--a battle broke out and eventually--and it was a sort of overlapping because the African Liberation Support Committee also had people who were a part of CAP, and (gesture)--
Speaker 2: That's Congress of Afrikan People?
Speaker 1: Yeah the Congress of Afrikan People and so this--this debate over Marxism and the intrusion of--and shifting away from African interests solely as an African interest organizing entity caused a nasty skirmish because all of a sudden in mid-stream you have Imamu Baraka--Amiri Baraka who had been the leading spokesperson for a couple of years of Pan African and nationalism and in mid-stream in a speech declares that he is a Marxist.  And this just set, this just set off a battle.  So--and then there was another entity, the National Black Political Convention had the National Black Political Assembly, which was the org- organ that organized in between the convention.  And so after Baraka's declaration and after this, the Marxists began to disrupt inside the African Liberation Support Committee.  The African Liberation Support Committee fell apart.  And the forces inside the National Black Political Assembly began to have tremendous debate calling for Baraka's resignation because now by 1975, Baraka and his forces of the Congress of Afrikan People who up to that point had been the administrative arm to running the National Black Political Assembly that the opposition to, to Marxism called for Baraka to resign.
Story_ID: 672457
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute, I just want to be the Baraka [Amiri Baraka] advocate here.  I would say--somebody might say, "Conrad [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill], what's wrong with scientific socialism?  You're, you're in the academy, why wouldn't you support something that's scientific and proved to work around the world?  There are revolutions around the world and they're all--it's based on scientific socialism as espoused by even your own, own of your own leaders, Kwame Nkrumah is a Marxist ideologue.  And now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --why wouldn't you be in favor of that?"
Speaker 2: Yeah I would say as great as some of our leaders are, as Jake [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] would say they, they somehow missed the point in studying our own revolutions.  And Jake would always say that particularly in his book 'The Irritated Genie' ['The Irritated Genie: An Essay on the Haitian Revolution,' Jacob H. Carruthers]--he always pointed out that some of our revolutionary leaders were following alien ideas and not looking to the revolutionary fervor that's a part of our own experience; and he always pointed to the Haitian revolution--Dessalines [Jean-Jacques Dessalines]--that we have people who are revolutionary who had successful revolutions in terms of the overthrow of the French and the Spanish and the British in Haiti.  The problem with ideas, whether they'd be on the left or they'd be on the right, is that these ideas all emanate out of the notion of white supremacy.  That in the end are directed toward white people and the European order still being in charge.  Maybe some adjustments will be made that more, that will open up the door, but essentially at the foundation--at the core of these ideas, they represent the interests of other people.  And so our challenge has always been to go to the deep well and get to the idea that approximate the experience of African people, the historical foundation and antecedents of African people which led Dr. Carruthers and Asa Hilliard [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] and Cheikh Anta Diop and Theophile Obenga to go to the deep well of ideas that emanate from the African experience or African civilization, if you will.  And when you, these ideas are matched up against each other, you find a conflict.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So science is, you know--you view, you view the world through culture and science explains the world.  So science is not objective, and so for someone to say that they are scientific socialists really doesn't have any meaning for me because science is driven by culture.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, Jake Carruthers wrote a little pamphlet in 1970, '71 [1971] called 'Science and Oppression' that we should all read and re-read and many of us have been reading it for forty years it's so heavy.  But it's--so we have to look at the relationship of science and oppression and culture.
Story_ID: 672458
Speaker 1: Now I wanted to go back and ask you about the origin of the National Black United Front.  You know, who came up with this idea and I think it went, actually went national here in Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Well the idea for the National Black United Front had its foundation out of the Metropolitan Black United Front in New York [New York], was Reverend Herbert Daughtry [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Herbert D. Daughtry] and Jitu Weusi.  But in the late--around 1976 and 1977 there was some efforts to convene some of the major activist forces in the country as a result of the fallouts, the splits, the counter intelligence program--to have some meetings to try to revitalize the national organizing work that was going on.  But people were so entrenched in their ideological positions, those meetings weren't successful.  But the Metropolitan Black United Front was becoming very successful, so local grassroots organizing entity and unbeknowing to the Metropolitan Black United Front by '78 [1978] or so, '79 [1979] there was a Black United Front formed in Portland, Oregon.  There was the United League--it was a front formation--Skip Robinson [Alfred "Skip" Robinson] in Mississippi; and then there was an effort to create a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] Black United Front and then there was the Cairo [Illinois] Black United Front under Charles Koen.  So in the country there were these five fronts organizing at a local level, they weren't connected to each other in any way, but suddenly discovered each other.  So there was an effort to talk about the potentiality and possibility of consolidating these local efforts into a National Black United Front and organizing a National Black United Front.  So in Chicago [Illinois] in January of 1980 at Robert's Hotel [Roberts Motel No. 6, Chicago, Illinois] an entity was convened called the National Forum for Black Unity and became a research and advisory council to the motion to call for a National Black United Front convention that was held in Brooklyn, New York in June 1980.  So in Chicago at Roberts Motel in January 1980 and then again in May 1980 this idea and support around this National Forum of Black Unity to support the idea of calling for the National Black United Front convention did take place here in this city and eventually led to the convention that was held in the old armory [13th Regiment Armory] in New York where a thousand activists--
Speaker 1: In Brooklyn, yeah.
Speaker 2: In Brooklyn, New York--a thousand activists from thirty-four states and five foreign countries convened in New York for that conference.  And that began the--the development of what is known today as the National Black United Front.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were elected in 1980 as (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985] I was elected to replace Reverend Herbert Daughtry who stepped down--who had served as the chairman for the first five years; and then for twenty-four years, almost twenty-five years I've served as the chairman and I just stepped up not stepped down because now I'm in the elder mode and we've elected a new national chairman--brother Kofi Taharka out of Houston, Texas.  But over this third year period, the National Black United Front engaged in a numerous, multiplicity of organizing activity throughout the United States and in fact, in the world.
Story_ID: 672459
Speaker 1: Now I want to go, just chronologically so in 19--in the early '80s [1980s] there was also an organization forming called the National Black Independent Political Party?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that relate to the National Black United Front?  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --I know it didn't last long, but.
Speaker 2: Yeah the NBUF was an outgrowth of the National Black Political Assembly and the desire that had been a part of that motion really going back to Gary [Indiana] that created a black independent political party.  That idea had its--it germinated from Gary.  And so there was always this energy that what black people really needed was our own political party.  And so NBUF was being driven by those forces--Ron Daniels [Ronald Daniels] and others to follow through on that idea of calling for a national black independent political party.  There was a debate on that because some people felt that that motion should relate to--that we needed to build the front before we built the party.  That, that was kind of where that was and--
Speaker 1: And this was a time, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was elected president--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right wing president of the United States--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: They had gone from Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] to Ronald Reagan (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So they did--they had a meeting that called for the National Black Independent Political Party right in the summer of 1980 after the founding convention of NBUF, I went to that meeting, it was in New Orleans [Louisiana], Ben Chavis [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.] had just gotten out of prison.  He was the one that put the resolution on the floor and so they voted to begin organizing for a National Black Independent Political Party.  They had a big meeting in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at a high school--a couple thousand people.  And by the next year in Chicago [Illinois] they had the founding congress of the National Black Independent Political Party at Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Reverend Walls' [Albert Walls] church [Walls Memorial Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right, right, I think it's the last time I saw Dr. Bobby Wright [Bobby E. Wright] was at that, that meeting, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But they were never able to consolidate the, the work or the idea of a national black independent political party because some of the forces of the left and--the question--what was the political party supposed to do--was it to engage in electoral politics, was it going to be just a revolutionary party, was it going to be vanguard party; and so all of these debates took place.  It never got consolidated.  So by the mid-1980s, it--the National Black Independent Political Party sort of fizzled because they never could come up with a program of action.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That would be my assessment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 672460
Speaker 1: But it was an organization that included the same kind of debates between the Marxists and the nationalists on some level--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was going on.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Manning Marable was there and a lot of other people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that represented the left.
Speaker 2: Abdul Alkalimat.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But so that failed on a national level but in Chicago [Illinois] in 1982 or so Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] started talking about the need for a black mayor in the City of Chicago.  And it, it (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well it was really before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The idea of a black mayor in Chicago really goes back to 1975 [sic.] after the death of Richard Daley [Richard J. Daley]; and Lu Palmer called a forum at the Parkway Community Center [Chicago, Illinois] and after Richard Daley's death, black people were talking about running somebody from there.  Richard Newhouse [Richard H. Newhouse, Jr.], matter of fact, there were about four or five names that were being tossed about and there was this big forum, as my memory calls, on the need for a black mayor and a document was written to explain why Chicago needed to have a black mayor.  So I still have that, that--I can see that document right now.  Anyway, the document talks about Chicago being founded by Jean Baptiste Point du Sable and it went into the history of black people in Chicago and Oscar De Priest [Oscar Stanton De Prienst] and Dawson [William L. Dawson] and so forth and Dawson's role in electing Richard Daley in 1955.  It was quite a document.  So by 1977, '79 [1979] Lu Palmer and others ran Harold Washington for mayor for the first time in 19--and Harold Washington won six wards.  [HistoryMaker] Renault Robinson, [HistoryMaker] Howard Saffold, [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage, many--[HistoryMaker] Jorja Palmer, many of those forces organized Harold Washington's campaign.  It's interesting that one of the wards that Harold won, I believe it was '77 [1977] or '79 [1979], I can't remember which year.
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977] when he ran, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was the 6th Ward [Chicago, Illinois] and the 6th Ward was the highest voting black turnout ward in Chicago and that ward--the alderman of that ward was Gene Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer].
Speaker 1: Yeah that's Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], right.
Speaker 2: Chatham, right.  So this trajectory of--by 1979 when we had that tremendous snowstorm in Chicago and, and Bilandic's administration dropped the ball and led to black people and others leading a charge to get Bilandic [Michael Bilandic] out because of their ineffectiveness and the, Chicago being overrun by the weather and their inability to handle it, Jane Byrne was elected--
Speaker 1: That's the first woman--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --on the black vote.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So the first woman is elected on the black vote.
Speaker 2: On the black vote and it, shortly after when Jane Byrne who had, had made so many commitments to the black community began to retrench, it was at that moment, particularly around the school board issue that this idea began to really surface again around the potentiality and the possibility of electing a black mayor.
Story_ID: 672461
Speaker 1: I believe it was '81 [1981], Jane Byrne wanted to appoint Thomas Ayers [Thomas G. Ayers] to become the president of the Chicago school board [Chicago Board of Education]--that's Billy Ayers' [Bill Ayers] daddy, of the Weathermen [Weather Underground] of the professor at the University of Chicago [sic. University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was working very closely with Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrellle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] at that time and we filed a lawsuit against Thomas Ayers because we found out that his voting address was in Rolling Meadows and he lived in a condominium with Jane Byrne in the city, but he voted in, out in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.  So we filed a lawsuit, forced him to back down and this is how Kenneth Smith [HistoryMaker Kenneth Smith, Sr.] became the first African American school board president.  So that particular battle was quite a battle around black people becoming the majority of the school board because up to that point the school board was appointed by the mayor.  Had eleven appointees and there was always three Negroes, if you would say--three black people.  So by '81 [1981] we had pushed it to five and then after '81 [1981] we pushed it to six.  And then this whole, whole controlling the school board movement led into the call for the whole black movement that kicked off in the summer of 1982 with the ChicagoFest boycott and the whole targeting of Jane Byrne for defeat.
Speaker 2: Now I just want to put it in perspective that the, by that time 80, 90 percent of the students of Chicago public schools were black, am I correct?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So people thought well Lu, Lu Palmer's theory was we should control most of the seats on the school board if we're (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well yes, not just Lu Palmer's theory; that was the black movement's position.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Lu Palmer was a tremendous spokesperson for the movement because he was on the radio on 'Lu's Notebook' saying it's enough to make a Negro turn black.  And then slowly in 1982 he coined--he, Lu Palmer had a conference at Malcolm X [Malcom X College, Chicago, Illinois]--CBUC.  He, Lu Palmer organized the Chicago Black United Community [sic. Chicago Black United Communities] and they had a conference on ei- August 15, 1981 and the slogan on the brochure was, "We shall see in '83 [1983]."  Now that was in '81 [1981].  And so by 1982 the crescendo--the voter registration, the, the spirit around electing a black mayor and getting Jane Byrne out of office was at a fever pitch.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I believe he said that every day on the radio.  Every day he had a show, he said, "We shall see in '83 [1983]"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah, in '83 [1983], yes.
Story_ID: 672462
Speaker 1: All right so we're talking about the building mayoral campaign in 1983--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah that, that was quite a movement and a number of books have been written.  And it--I would probably say the best book that captures that mo- grassroots part of that movement and our contribution to that movement was 'Prairie on the Fire' [sic.] by Gary Rivlin.  That's a book I would suggest if (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Fire on the Prairie' ['Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race'], right.
Speaker 2: 'Fire on the Prairie,' 'Fire on the Prairie,' right.  So, that was quite an experience.  We worked very deeply in that campaign and were part of that, that historic movement.
Speaker 1: Yeah the Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] was I mean--was really involved.  Bob Starks [HistoryMaker Robert T. Starks], I know was, became the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well see you can't say the Center for Inner City Studies.
Speaker 1: Okay because it wasn't officially involved (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah that's the university--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but that there are entities associated with those of us who were--the, what happened was on November 7th at Robert's Motel [Robert's Motel No. 6, Chicago, Illinois] a meeting was convened by Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] and others because Harold had not really declared what he was going to do.
Speaker 1: Now there, just to lead up to that--there were plebiscites held, right?  To determine (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well the plebiscite had occurred that summer in which a survey had been circulated by CBUC [Chicago Black United Communities] and there was a big meeting at Bethel A.M.E. Church [Chicago, Illinois] to announce the results of the survey in the plebiscite and I believe there were some twenty-five thousand people who had participated in the survey. And the majority of the people indicated that they would back Harold Washington for mayor.  So the push for Harold Washington and the consensus was generally around the support for Harold.  And by November of 1982, Harold still hadn't announced whether he was going to run and people were getting very frustrated.  So a meeting was called at Robert's, Al Sampson [HistoryMaker Reverend Albert Richard Sampson], myself, Lu Palmer--just a host of activists, Danny Davis [HistoryMaker Danny K. Davis], Cliff Kelley--if I can remember--Bobby Rush [HistoryMaker Bobby Rush]--if I can remember correctly.  But anyway, in that meeting we talked about what we could do to form our own campaign.  If Harold Washington ran, we didn't need to be downtown; we needed to form our own campaign.  So Al Sampson talked about what SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] had done in Cleveland [Ohio] in assisting, and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in assisting of Carl Stokes to become the mayor of Cleveland, where they created a parallel campaign to the official campaign and I said, me, meaning Conrad [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill], I said, "That's a heck of an idea, Al.  What we need to create is a task force for black political empowerment."  And because I was the chair of the Chicago chapter of the National Black United Front, Sampson was the chair of the Citizens for Self Determination, and I believe Connie Howard [HistoryMaker Constance "Connie" Howard] was in that meeting too.  We looked around the room and almost everybody in the room was a chair or a head of some organization--
Story_ID: 672463
Speaker 1: So Starks [HistoryMaker Robert T. Starks] was sitting over there, we said, "Hey let's put Starks in there as the chair and make him the convener of the Task Force for Black Political Empowerment."  So that's how the Task Force for Black Political Empowerment came into existence.  We sent a delegation over to Harold Washington's house to demand what--I think Danny Davis [HistoryMaker Danny K. Davis] was the point person as to what he was going to do.  And the next day, November 8, or November 9th, I believe it was announced in the Chicago Tribune that Harold Washington would make his announcement for mayor on November 10th at the Hyde Park Hilton, which is now the Ramada [Ramada Inn Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois].  (Unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay now there's a, aren't there, there's some other steps leading to that, right?  Because I think that--wasn't there a caveat by Harold Washington that he would not run unless there (unclear)--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: That was, that was earlier.
Speaker 2: That's earlier, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah that was--he said he wasn't going to run until it was 150, 100 thousand dollars in the bank--that we had registered over 150--all of that had been met way back.  The black business people, Al Boutte [HistoryMaker Alvin J. Boutte, Sr.] and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ed Gardner [HistoryMaker Edward Gardner]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Jacoby Dickens and Cadillac Al Johnson [HistoryMaker Albert W. Johnson] and even Bobby Wright [Bobby E. Wright] was a part of that group before he died.  Bobby Wright died in, during, March 1982--Bobby Wright passed away.  But all of those conditions had been met and that's why this meeting on November 7th was so important because people were saying, what is Harold going to do?  We've done, we've met all of his requests in the movement.  So he did announce on November 10, 1982--that was quite a day.
Speaker 2: I also heard--well I heard him say and others say that there was some reluctance because he had just been elected to [U.S.] Congress--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --something he had been trying to do for a long time and you know he was elected.  [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage came in at the same time and they--you know he was--you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah well that was a concern, yes.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: That was a concern and he was, I think Harold--I forgot what year it was.  Was that 1980--'80 [1980] Harold was elected to Congress--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '80 [1980], yeah.  His first term, so he was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So there, I remember--this is my own personal recollection of you wearing a blue beret during this period of time--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the process blue beret that matched the buttons of the campaign--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Was there a story behind that beret?
Speaker 1: No, not a real story other than we were into wearing--I don't know, I--no--it's just that's what I wore.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I guess that was my street hat.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay there was also like--I think that Harold Washington referred to you and some other people as the Mau Maus I believe.
Speaker 1: Yeah we were considered--we were in the street.  We were able to affectively put Harold in the streets at major transportation centers, at major housing developments, at major thoroughfares throughout the black community and we were able to really generate.  And the way we did it, we had sound trucks and trailers and we--we had a lot of fanfare with bullhorns and we would rev up the people.  And by this time Harold was--had become a very popular figure in the black community and it didn't take much.  If people knew Harold was coming, they would come out of the woodwork to see him, shake his hand and to engage him.
Story_ID: 672464
Speaker 1: Now one, one slogan that I thought was interesting because I had a little part of this one was we--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That flyer that you developed--we should, we discovered it, we should govern it.  That flyer was a classic flyer then I think you did the artwork which was a caricature of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable and Harold Washington.  That was a heck of a flyer.  And you know Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] was just surfacing and trying to rebuild the Nation and so he had to really work in the backroom and I took Harold over to his house.  At that time the minister was living at 94th [Street] and Damen [Avenue] to talk about what he could do to help out in the campaign.  And I don't know if I ever shared this with you but the Nation of Islam, Minister Farrakhan directed Akbar Muhammad to take that flyer and run it off at the Final Call building [Final Call Administration Building, Chicago, Illinois].  And the Nation of Islam ran off a million copies of that flyer.  I don't know--were you aware of that?
Speaker 1: No I wasn't.  I was not.
Speaker 2: We put out a million copies of that flyer that the Nation of Islam ran off.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is--
Speaker 2: That flyer went around the country because people wrote letters condemning the flyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So can--for instance what did they say?  What was the, what was the (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was a racist flyer; we were racist and that, that kind of response.
Story_ID: 672465
Speaker 1: This is a campaign that's catching fire.  And what, what do you think is the difference between the candidacy of Harold Washington and some other campaigns that didn't get off the ground in the black community?  I mean what was the--what was it about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well it sometimes it's hard to duplicate a first, okay and a barrier was broken and I think Harold Washington's death--we have not really recovered from that and the fight and split that occurred in the black community over Sawyers [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] and Evans [Timothy C. Evans] has had a devastating impact on--on our movement.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted to go back and talk about the (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So I mean that's why nothing else has been able to get off--it took the spirit away from us; the fight, the nasty fight that we had among ourselves.
Speaker 1: Well, okay let me frame this--the African Americans in Chicago [Illinois] are not the majority like they are in some cities that elect a black mayor or the voting majority.  How do you--what do you attribute his election to--
Speaker 2: Well in 1983 there were two whites, Daley [Richard M. Daley] and Byrne [Jane Byrne].  So they, they split their vote, that's how we won in '83 [1983].  Is that what you're saying, be--in terms of the numbers--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, yeah how that--yeah and (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But--but at that time we were still--more than 35 percent of Chicago was African American in 1983.  And even--I don't know what it is now.  The Latino population is become pretty much the majority population but that, does that mean voting.  See it's one thing to have the population in numbers, it's another thing--what are the registered voters.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think during those days the official numbers were almost even for blacks and whites in the City of Chicago and the Latinos formed another 15 percent or something of the electorate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so there were--were you involved in forming alliances with any of the other groups?
Speaker 2: Well we worked with the Puerto Ricans, and we worked with some of the whites, particularly Helen Shiller and, and Slim Coleman [Walter "Slim" Coleman] and Jesus Garcia and the Chicano community.  We had some working relationships with other activist forces in the city--Chuy [Jesus "Chuy" Garcia], Luis Gutierrez and some of those forces during that time.
Speaker 1: I know there was--
Speaker 2: Cha Cha Jimenez [Jose "Cha Cha" Jimenez] of the Young Lords, we worked with him.  And, so yes.
Speaker 1: Okay all right so it was more than just organizing the black community.  But you--
Speaker 2: We interfaced with these other communities.
Speaker 1: All right.  There was an interesting story you told me a long time ago about raising funds for Harold Washington and a meeting that you had with John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], I think if you want to share that, I don't know.  Do you remember what I'm talking about?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah there was--or it may have been Lu [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II]--Jorja [HistoryMaker Jorja Palmer] and Lu telling me the story.  But they were saying John Johnson was contributing more money to Richard Daley [Richard M. Daley] than he was to Harold Washington.  But he was gonna, he was contributing to both candidates because he wanted to cover all his bases and that there was a confrontation that the Harold Washington campaign had with him around you know his contributions--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I wasn't in on that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I know he, I know he did finally come to the table and made significant contributions to Harold's campaign, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But he was not, he was not uncharacteristic of businesspeople to give money to everybody.
Story_ID: 672466
Speaker 1: The aftermath of Harold Washington's election was bittersweet for some people.  You know the black population largely was elated.  You know a lot of things were accomplished that weren't accomplished before in some ways but people did have a--I know Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] was very bitter about lack of support from the Washington administration for his--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah well--yeah, you can't really--God bless Lu Palmer--you can't really (unclear) what Harold Washington accomplished by Lu Palmer because that was personal.  That was--Lu Palmer was a very close friend of mine.  As a matter of fact, I was his campaign manager when he ran for [U.S.] Congress against Charlie Hayes [HistoryMaker Charles Hayes], which--who was being backed by Harold.  Politics you know is kind of a strange animal.  Harold Washington's administration accomplished a great deal during the short period of time.  And one of the things they accomplished was reorganizing the city hall and there were black--most black people don't, are not--most people are not aware that the technology used in city hall today, in government, in billing and the whole technological part of the administration of government in Chicago [Illinois] was started by black people and Harold Washington's administration who brought in key black people.  Who went in and said, "Hey this place is archaic," and began organizing.  So to this day your--the computerization of business in city hall was initiated by the Washington administration.  Midway airport [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illiois], the whole bringing back of Midway airport, as a matter of fact, the deputy commissioner of aviation graduated from the Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], was our department secretary who Harold Washington stole from me and hired, Renee Simms is her name and she (unclear), she was such a talented young lady that Harold appointed her as the deputy commissioner of aviation and she was on the team to help bring Midway airport back.  So no there were a lot of things that were not accomplished; and the other thing that Harold Washington found out where a lot of the jobs were that nobody--the forty thousand jobs in the City of Chicago.  My brother [Oscar Worrill] is a beneficiary of that who still has a job today as a drain inspector inspecting house drains that nobody knew anything about.  What was a house drain inspector, Larry [Larry Crowe]?  So I--you know Lu's bitterness was related to a whole other set of dynamics that were personal.
Speaker 1: Okay but you, but you consider the Harold Washington administration to be largely successful in terms of its (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In four and a half years they, they shook up government in this city.  They didn't get all of what we wanted but they shook up government.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a significant shift in allocation of resources to aid black businesspeople in this city who probably wouldn't have gotten some of those major contracts if there had not been a black mayor.
Story_ID: 672467
Speaker 1: When Harold Washington dies in 1987 there's a general--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Did you--what year did you say?
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Points) Eighty-seven [1987], yes.
Speaker 1: General depression in the political life of the black community anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that, that was a tragic story, a tragic set of events, a tragic set of manipulations that took place that were all earned--internal to our own demise and I remember Bill Henry who was the alderman of the 24th Ward [Chicago, Illinois] called me at home a day after Harold's death and said, "Conrad [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill], don't get in this, we got the vote.  I got all the votes, we're for Gene," I never will forget that.  And when I think about what really happened, we got manipulated by our--by people.  It was a fight between the black elected officials and the black appointed administrators in the wa- Harold Washington's cabinet and that was the split that we don't understand to this day.  So after the funeral, I went to the Washington administration and said we needed to have something for the grassroots people here to acknowledge, and they can participate in commemorating Harold Washington.  They agreed and financed the rally at the pavilion [UIC Pavilion, Chicago, Illinois] which I helped organize with the support of Michael Scott [HistoryMaker Michael Scott, Sr.] who just passed.  Michael Scott was the deputy director of special events.  That pavilion rally was manipulated by forces to turn that rally that was supposed to be to commemorate Harold Washington to Tim Evans [Timothy C. Evans] and everything went downhill then.  In my naivete, during that time in politics when Ed Smith came to that rally and had a memorandum calling for a special meeting of the city council [Chicago City Council], I went to the mic [microphone] and directed everybody to go downtown to city hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois], that's a true story.  We got manipulated.
Speaker 1: Yeah, city council was actually choosing a mayor when you were at the pavilion.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But the point is they had the vote, it didn't have nothing to do with Gene Sawyer's being a Tom, and Gene Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] didn't talk.  It had something to do with people who were fearful that they would lose their jobs who were in battle with the black aldermen.  That's what the real debate was about.  The real fight was the real manipulation.  We shouldn't have ever got into that.  Tim Evans should have stayed right where he was as the chair of the finance committee, which is the most powerful committee in city council.  We could have had the finance--just like Daley [Richard M. Daley] and Burke [Edward M. Burke].  Burke was over finance, Daley's the mayor.  We should have had Sawyer as the mayor, Evans as the finance but we got caught up in these egos, we caught up in this manipulation and we haven't recovered yet.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I, I regret that and I will--in my own soul was forced to apologize publicly to Gene Sawyer because he shouldn't have never been treated like that.  Gene Sawyer was not a great speaker and all of that, but Gene Sawyer behind the scenes did a lot of things for black people that some other people did not.
Story_ID: 672468
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the campaign, the aftermath and (pause) the mistakes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah well we, after the Harold Washington election, there was so much going on.  Really the Free South Africa Movement was ramping up, the National Black United Front played a key role in the south--Free South Africa Movement because our vice chair of international affairs, Adiyaman Bendali [ph.] was able to participate as an observer in the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid [United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid] at the United Nations where the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] and ANC [African National Congress] sat at the same table.  And it was during those deliberations that the famous hit list on athletes and entertainers going over to Sun City [South Africa] emerged and NBUF led the campaign to challenge entertainers and athletes not to go to South Africa.  This is in 1981.
Speaker 1: Yeah I remember Millie Jackson was challenged.  She was kind of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, Ray Charles, The O'Jays--so the trajectory of the Free South Africa Movement was something that the National Black United Front participated in along with other movement forces and particularly the protest at the South African consulate and the Springboks in 1982 coming to Chicago [Illinois] and we ran them out of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yeah the South African rugby team, there's now a movie ['Invictus'] about the South African rugby now that's out here with--
Speaker 2: So much, much, much went on.  Mandela [Nelson Mandela] gets out of prison, tours the United States.  We were involved in hosting him here in Chicago and, and Detroit [Michigan] and--with Stevie Wonder.
Story_ID: 672469
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-six [1996], it was revealed that--through the San Jose [California] Mercury News [The Mercury News] that this whole crack cocaine explosion that was emerging in America.  A reporter by the name of Gary Revlon [sic. Gary Webb] wrote a three part article pointing out how crack cocaine had been targeted for the inner city, using street organizations, where the profits from this campaign had been used to finance the Contras in Nicaragua.  And this was just, this just set off the black leadership in this America.  There were protests on the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency].  The National Black United Front decided that our response to this was going to be charge the United States government with genocide.  And so, during the fall of 1996 we attempted to begin a campaign to replicate what Robeson, Du Bois [W.E.B. Du bois] and Patterson [William L. Patterson] had done in 1951 in the first genocide campaign against police brutality in the United States by collecting signatures and petitions, and going to the United Nations.  And so we launched that campaign from the fall of 1996 to the spring of 1997.  We garnered over 156,000 signatures.  We went to the UN human rights center [United Nations Human Rights Council] in Geneva, Switzerland with Bob Brown assisting us and Somari Grace of NBUF and James Muhammad and Valerie Michaud of the National Black United Front, James Muhammad of The Final Call.  And we went and we presented these petitions and our complaint to the United Nations under what is called the 1503 [1503 Procedure], which is a confidential procedure where you file charges of human rights against--human rights violations and genocide against a nation or a people.
Speaker 2: Isn't this an idea that Malcolm X had at one point, or was?  I think Paul Robeson was (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well Malcolm, this came--Malcolm really got that from Robe- Robeson, Du Bois and Patterson, that was '51 [1951].  Malcolm said that we should take our struggle before an international body, body and bring them before the world court [International Court of Justice] which is an extension of that because in order to bring somebody before the world court, to even get to that state, you have to charge them with genocide.  You have to go through steps and stages within the international body.  And so we did that and so in 19--a lot of people don't remember, but in 19--in June 1997, when we came back from Geneva.  I got a receipt from the state department [U.S. Department of State] saying they acknowledge our complaint in a letter.  In June 1997, Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] gave a speech at San Diego State University [San Diego, California] calling for a race commission in which he appointed [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin as the chair.  In the back room, Franklin being from Tulsa [Oklahoma] was pushing inside the commission that a lot of people are not aware of, he was saying we need to lift up reparations--John Hope Franklin.  And this, and this was a period in which the reparations movement was beginning to unfold at a high level.  In addition to that, the African centered education movement also in this country was unfolding at a high level particularly the work that the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations had engaged in particularly the tour, study tour that was taken to Kemet [Egypt] in 1987 (unclear) that we helped Dr. Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] and his leadership as the president.  Over a thousand people went to Egypt in 1997 [sic.].  So all--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987], yeah.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, '87 [1987].  So all of this in the latter part nineteen eight--Harold Washington's election on a local level, Nelson Mandela coming out of prison on the international level; South Africa coming to independence, Nelson Mandela becoming the president, not to mention Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] running for president in 1984 being backed by Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]; (gesture) running again in a serious campaign in 1988; (gesture) 1996 genocide campaign.
Story_ID: 672470
Speaker 1: And then we discovered that in 2001, there was going to be a UN [United Nations] World Conference against Racism in Durban, South Africa and we joined forces with the December 12th Movement and began to organize what became known as the Durban 400.  We had a singular focus that we would go to this conference--this international conference of 160 nations of the world, fifteen thousand people to push the idea that the transatlantic slave trade--slavery and colonialism were crimes against humanity and that black people were owed reparations.  So this small group of activists--we organized ourselves, raised our own money and we went to Durban, South Africa and pushed that idea and joined forces around the world.  And out of the Durban declaration [Durban Declaration and Program of Action], the transatlantic slave trade was officially declared a crime against humanity and that black people were owed some kind of repair even though they watered down the language to some extent.  So the point is the National Black United Front along with many other organizations on the activist side--the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations became into existence when a Egyptian studies conference [Ancient Egyptian Studies Conference] was convened in Los Angeles, California in 1984.  And then ASCAC was officially brought into existence at Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] in 1985 and the work of the leadership--the African centered scholarship and the whole African centered education movement throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  The demand for reparations and the lawsuits that we helped file in the late--in the early part of the--2000, 2002, we filed a lawsuit that ended up in federal court against all the major--twenty major corporations that we had identified that benefitted from slavery during the 19th century.  The lawsuit that Bob Brown filed, the lawsuit in Tulsa [Oklahoma] and the crescendo fever pitch around the legal strategy--Ray Winbush's book 'Should America Pay' ['Should America Pay? Slavery and the Raging Debate on Reparations,' Raymond A. Winbush] sort of summarizes and wraps up our organizing work up unt- almost to this moment in history.  So going all the way back from being influenced in the 1960s and now being sixty-eight years old and transitioning into elder hood, a great challenge is still before us for the next generation to take on the spirit of the sit-in movement of the students in Greensboro [North Carolina] that led to forming SNCC and on Easter Sunday in 1960 in Raleigh [North Carolina]--that kind of energy, the sacrifice, the dedication, the struggles of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the ancestors like Kwame Ture who was one of the major spokesperson who articulated the call for black power in this country is all a part of the thirty-five or forty year set of experiences that we've had that have def- definitely shaped our lives, hopefully impacted others and of course as we say in Swahili [sic. Portuguese], the struggle continues; a luta continua.

Speaker 1: We're hoping this next generation can continue as we document our history, as we write our history.  The book on the east--'A View from the East' ['A View from the East: Black Cultural Nationalism and Education in New York City,' Kwasi Konadu] that was written recently is a very important book that should be read.  'Fighting for Us' ['Fighting for Us: Maulana Karenga, the US Organization, and Black Cultural Nationalism,' Scot Brown], the young brother that wrote a book on the US organization should be read--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Brown [Scot Brown].
Speaker 1: The book, the memoirs of Kwame Ture, 'Ready for the Revolution' ['Ready for Revolution: The Life and Struggles of Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture),' Stokely Carmichael] should be read; and the book on the Lowndes County [Alabama] and the black power--Black Panther [Black Panther Party] explosion ['Bloody Lowndes: Civil Rights and Black Power in Alabama's Black Belt,' Hasan Kwame Jeffries] should be read; [HistoryMaker] Clayborne Carson's book ['In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s,' Clayborne Carson] on the history of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] should be read.  As the activist wing of our reading of the last forty years of struggle and activism and organizing along with intellectual warfare should be read on the scholarly side of our movement.  'The Maroon Within Us' ['The Maroon Within Us: Selected Essays on African American Community Socialization,' Asa G. Hilliard], Asa Hilliard's [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] book.  All of Carruthers' [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] writing; all of Hilliard's writing; Marimba Ani's book 'Yurugu' ['Yurugu: An Arfican-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and Behavior']; and of course we need to go back finally and read those little pamphlets that we wrote in the early 1970s called The Afrocentric World Review, particularly the first two which got us on this path of Afro-centricity and African centeredness.  So it's been a great run.  I've learned a lot, it's been a blessing to be a part of much of this work and we hope that the next generation--that we can work and help advise them as we continue to struggle for the liberation of African people worldwide.
Speaker 2: So, so what did we gain, I guess in a, in a struggle like reparations when--I meando you think we're ever going to get (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well one of the things we gained is we understand that reparations has to be on two fronts; and if we never get what they owe us--because clearly they owe us materially, but they can never pay us for what they did but they still owe us--is that we have a great responsibility, if we get nothing from them, to repair ourselves.  So the word itself, repair for damages, that we have a great obligation to work on the project to internally repair ourselves.  And so with that brother Larry [Larry Crowe], I've got to shut it down and this has been a great interview.
Speaker 2: All right, well I, I don't know what else to say, I have some more questions but I can't you know--but thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
