Story_ID: 363161
Speaker 1: So we're gonna begin talking about your, your family, your, your lineage.  How far do you remember your grandparents or great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: I remember my, both my maternal and paternal grandparents.  Well, my grandmother because my maternal grandfather had died before I was born but my grandmother whose name was Marie Elizabeth Brown.
Speaker 1: This is on your father's [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I just happened to marry a Brown [Kenneth Brown] so I'm, I'm named after my grandmother, so there I was Marie Elizabeth Dutton Brown [HistoryMaker Marie Brown].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandparents on my father's side were Bert [Bert Dutton] and Beatrice Dutton.
Speaker 1: Going back to your, on your mother's side, what was your grandmother's name or, you said it was Elizabeth?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any, do you have any stories to share, share about her that maybe even your mother told?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, what I know about Marie Elizabeth Brown who was born in 1980 [sic.], is that her birth name was Mariah Pride [ph.] and she moved to New York [New York] when she was, I guess, either in her late teens or twenty with her husband, who was my grandfather, whose name was Waverly Brown.  And they moved here, first they moved to New York to work in service and I think that my grandfather was a carriage driver and then my grandmother was working in domestic service.  And she and he decided that New York was too difficult and they moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], to the northeast section of Philadelphia within a community where there were a number of people from their home in Virginia, they were from Farmville, Virginia, Prince Edward County [Virginia] and Rice, Virginia, which is very close to Farmville and there was a community of people from Farmville and Rice who had moved to the Tacony section of Philadelphia.  And it's interesting about my grandmother because I never understood from my mother or my aunts and uncles that she worked, you know.  I think my grandfather died, she may have received some kind of assistance, he, job, he died on the job, I think, in the '30s [1930s] or something like that and then she also had one of his relatives who lived in the house there.  But, and that was, you know, Marie Elizabeth Brown.  She was a very staunch churchgoer.  She was a member of Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Holmesburg [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And some of the earliest memories that I have was attending church with my grandmother and the people who were a part of that community all of whom were from Farmville.  They would be there, the Jacksons, you know, which is a great big family, and then the Browns, and many others who I don't know remember.  But my grandmother, she felt that education was really, really important for her children and so three, she had six children, two of them had died early in life, but three of the surviving children attended and graduated from college in the late '20s [1920s] and early '30s [1930s] while they worked their way through school in Philadelphia or near Philadelphia, that would include my mother, Josephine Olivia Brown Dutton [Josephine Brown Dutton], and my uncles, Theodore Roosevelt Brown [Theodore Brown] and another uncle, Landis Brown, who attended Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  And Theodore Roosevelt Brown attended Cheyney [Cheyney Training School for Teachers; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: What, what, how much education did your grandmother have?
Speaker 2: I don't think very much at all, I'm not sure whether she, probably she finished maybe the, up through the eighth grade, but she was literate but I don't recall any formal education.
Story_ID: 363162
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories of your interaction with her [Brown's maternal grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Brown] besides church?
Speaker 2: Well, always visiting her in the summer.  We lived, from the time I was, just after I was born because I was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], in Hampton, Virginia, and then subsequently in Nashville, Tennessee.  And we did what was the reverse of what many youngsters did in the North by going South, we traveled to our grandmother in the North.  And the great thing about visiting her was that she always shopped (laughter) and was always so about taking us downtown, she and my Aunt Gladys [Gladys Brown Rhinehart] who was her oldest daughter, my mother's sister.  And I remember, you know, just shopping with her and sitting on her front porch on Fillmore Street, she lived on Fillmore Street in Frankford [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And the neighborhood was one where all the neighbors, you know, knew each other, their porches were all connected.  And I remember the Smiths living on one side and I can't remember the others but it was a community and I just thought that that was the greatest experience, just visiting my grandmother, spending time with her, you know, going through her things, playing with her Victrola, she had a wind up Victrola, you know, just listening to her, you know, tell stories about growing up, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: She talked about living in the country, you know, and as a little girl and how, you know, hard it was and how difficult it was but, and how she moved up to the North, I remember a little bit of that.  I also remember a lot about her listening, I mean, it all goes back to church because talking to you I'm reminded that she would listen to 'The Upper Room' on the radio every Sunday morning before church and then we'd get dressed and we'd go to church [Mt. Zion Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and I mean we really would get dressed, you know, that was I guess a part of the whole shopping thing because everybody had to just really look like they were in their Sunday best and that's what it was, you know.  Then, you know, everything from white gloves to stockings and heels and all of that, you know, and then growing up through that.  Then in her later years she came to live with us, she came to live with my parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] and so I spent a lot of time with her in my teen years and I remember just, you know, sort of helping my mom take care of her.  By this time she was not really able to get around too much and then she was sort of, not exactly bedridden because she would be able to move from the bed to her chair but I would spend just, most of what I remember is an emotion feeling because I really felt really, really close to her and, you know, that was, I think probably, the most traumatic thing that had happened to me in my life when my grandmother passed.  You know, and that was the closest person that I had known and that I had been close to.  She passed when I was away at college.
Story_ID: 363163
Speaker 1: Your father's [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] parents, did you have a lot of interaction with them?
Speaker 2: Not as much.  But I had some interaction with them, my grandmother, Beatrice [Beatrice Dutton], she died I think during my early adolescence, or late childhood but I do remember visiting her but she was a very quiet woman, I mean extremely quiet, I don't even remember anything about the relationship other than the place, I mean, going to visit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did they live?
Speaker 2: --her and my grandfather in North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And my grandfather, he was also very quiet, Bert Dutton, but he was very, a very, very proud person who I'm not even sure what his job was but I know that during their lifetime that probably both of them worked in service.  I, I think my grandfather worked at Horn and Hardart because that was one of the businesses in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the time that employed a number of black people working there, preparing the food and placing it in the automat.  But I do remember my father talking about my grandmother and how education was really, really important for, in their family as well.  And how she had saved whatever small amount of money that she had to make sure that my father could get away to school and he actually went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and I have a letter here somewhere where my father had saved it where my grandmother had written a note to him giving him just these very few dollars to go off to college saying how proud she was of him and he went out off to Penn State.  He had graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia, one of the few black students and he went off to Penn State to major in civil engineering.
Story_ID: 363164
Speaker 1: And worked in service and slept in the kitchen of the people that he worked for, my father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] did that almost through his whole, I think through the whole four years he worked for a family called the Bishoffs [ph.] and they stayed in touch until my father died.  But he took care of their children and cleaned their house and was one of, I think about six or eight black students at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and he graduated in 1933.  But it had always been really hard for him as well as for my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] who also worked in service.  And she worked for, my mother worked for a family called the Danawitzes, I mean, I'll never forget this Ree Danawitz [ph.], how many times did I ever hear the story--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --about how hard she worked and how she would write letters to Ree Danawitz's, either beau or husband in the service 'cause Ree couldn't write the letters but my mother was a college student writing letters for Ree Danawitz.  And she also worked in a cleaners and dryers where I would hear the story where she only had two skirts but because she worked at a cleaners and dyers she could dye the skirts different colors and it would seem like she had a larger wardrobe.  So that work ethic, I mean, it wasn't as if they, you know, really drilled it into us but these were stories that both my parents shared and I was very conscious of, you know, what it took for them to go through their college experience.
Story_ID: 363165
Speaker 1: Let's step back just a little bit and, and talk about, we were talking about your, your father's [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] parents.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, for both your grandparents, did they own the property that they lived on?
Speaker 2: My father's parents [Beatrice Dutton and Bert Dutton] rented their home and later in my grandfather's life after my grandmother died, he went to live with my father's sister, Catherine Delever [Catherine Dutton] in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in her home with her husband.  My [maternal] grandmother [Marie Elizabeth Brown] owned her home on Tulip Street in Tacony [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And again I think that this came about as a result of whatever benefits that she had received when my [maternal] grandfather [Waverly Brown] died.  Then the second home that they had on Fillmore Street the one that I knew, my father bought that home for my grandmother.  And I remembered hearing stories, I mean, I think the house cost maybe six thousand dollars or something like that and he bought it when, after he met my mom [Josephine Brown Dutton] and they got married in the late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 363166
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit more about your father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.].  Did he share about him growing up?
Speaker 2: He talked about college [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania], I mean, a lot.  He talked about high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, do you have any stories that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, he went to Central High School--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] which was the top academic high school for boys.  And he traveled to Central from North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I think that he was one of few.  One of the things that I have to say about both of my parents, they, they really did not talk about hardships, I don't know why, they, you know, that was just their way.  They, they talked about maybe, you know, the financial hardships but they didn't talk that much about, you know, discrimination or, you know, I had to figure this out on my own, you know, looking at their class pictures and so on saying, "You were the only one in your class, you know, it had to be difficult, this was in the '20s [1920s]."  But he talked, daddy talked about, he talked a lot about church.  Now he was an Episcopalian, so he also was very engaged in the church, so he talked about being an altar boy, he talked about growing up in South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], nothing specific though, I mean, I don't recall him telling us very much about that part of his life.  You know, my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton], my brother reminded me when we went to a family homecoming a couple of years ago in Farmville [Virginia] how my mother used to go back to the South when she was in her teens and how she just really didn't like it because of biases and prejudices and particularly in Farmville and Prince Edward County [Virginia] was notorious, even up through the '60s [1960s] when they shut down the schools so I can imagine what it was like for her in the '20s [1920s].  And my brother, he said, "Well, Mom didn't ever tell you about the times that she was insulted and, you know, treated, mistreated in those experiences."  I said no.  So again that's, you know, an example of how they kept those experiences pretty close and I had to figure it out later on, you know, what that was about or hear it from somebody else.
Story_ID: 363167
Speaker 1: So you said your father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] had graduated from--
Speaker 2: Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: --Penn State.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And in civil engineering?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Josephine Brown Dutton]?
Speaker 2: Graduated from Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in English.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what years those was?
Speaker 2: My father graduated from Penn State in 1933.  And my mother graduated from Temple, I think, in 1937, I'm not absolutely (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --certain about that.
Speaker 1: So are there any other stories or anything else you want to talk about your mother or father?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  I think that, what I would like to say about them, my strongest recollections begin when I was a child in Hampton, Virginia, and my father taught at Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton Virginia].  Prior to that he had worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps which was a, one of [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt's, I guess, programs that he had started.  And as an engineer there were no other opportunities for my father so a number of the black engineers and architectural graduates they worked for the government in building projects in, across the country in various locales.  And following that my father then received an offer to teach engineering but they didn't have an engineering school but to teach in engineering at Hampton Institute so he and my mother moved, they were married in 1939.
Story_ID: 363168
Speaker 1: Do you know how they met?
Speaker 2: They met through their mutual friend, Ethel James Williams, and who was quite a woman in her own right in Washington, D.C., she passed a couple of years ago but she was a classmate of my mom's [Josephine Brown Dutton] at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and somehow or other she knew my father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] and so she introduced them and they dated and then they married in 1939 in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And so they moved to Hampton [Virginia].  And what I know about Hampton is that that was absolutely my mother's favorite place of all the places that we lived, that she loved that campus at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and she loved her friends there.  They were very active in campus activities.  There were obviously a lot of younger people on the faculty there, their friends, Bill and Julia Moses [Julia Mason Moses and William H. Moses, Jr.] and the Glosters, the Davises, just any number, Saunders Redding [J. Saunders Redding] who was well known as, you know, in literary circles.  And these were just really wonderful times.  I mean, I remember as a child their gathering because of segregation.  I mean, a lot of what took place socially took place in the home, most of what took place, it took place in the homes.  So they would have their little card parties and, you know, all of those kinds of things going on.  In all of the campus activities everyone would participate in them whether they were graduations, various entertainers would come to the campus to entertain because that was where, at that time, Negroes, you know, or black people could see entertainment so they would come to the colleges and campuses.  I remember Pearl Primus, the dancer, coming because when I came home, you know, then I would remember, I remembered dancing, you know, like Pearl Primus, you know, and because it was just a phenomenal thing.  And seeing singers, [HistoryMaker] William Warfield.  And those are, those memories and my parents are buried on the campus of Hampton in this small cemetery, where they, there were no more burial plots I guess after 1950 or whatever but they reserved those plots and it's right there on the campus, I mean when we went to bury my parents, classes were changing, students were walking by.  You know, but the cemetery goes back to the 18th century where Native Americans were buried there and then subsequently people up through I guess now, I mean, if they reserved the plots and had a family plot there.  So that was, you know, that, Hampton was really quite an extraordinary experience and then we moved to Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Well, you were born, born while they were at Hampton?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: In (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was born in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: But that--
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: --but moved to Hampton maybe a, not even a year, three months old or something like that.
Speaker 1: Right.  And how old were you before you, before you all moved again?
Speaker 2: Probably nine years old.
Speaker 1: So most of your formative years was on the campus?
Speaker 2: Well in, I think we moved to Nashville in 1949 so that would make me about nine years old--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: ---moving to Nashville and from birth to then, I was at Hampton.
Story_ID: 363169
Speaker 1: Well you told me some of your memories about Hampton [Virginia] but what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I can remember various campus activities.  And I would think, I'm not sure, maybe I was four, maybe I was five, I'm not gonna say earlier but I do remember, and my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] talked about it a lot because anytime anyone would visit they'd say, "Okay, Marie [HistoryMaker Marie Brown], you can take so and so around the campus," and I remember everybody being so amazed that I knew my way around the campus at such an early age but it was a time when, you know, safety was not something that people worried about, you know.  As a young child, I could, you know, walk to various places easily, you know, to, I remember going to the bakery and so on.  I remember going, starting school there and being in kindergarten, nursery school.  I do remember those nursery school days.  I mean, for whatever reason I remember drinking tomato juice, I've always remembered this (laughter) was my experience drinking tomato juice but I, you know, cultivated a like for tomato juice.  And, you know, I can remember that, I remember going to the first days of elementary school at Phenix elementary School [George P. Phenix Training School, Hampton, Virginia] which was right across the street from my house.  I remember going to the gym because I remember the smells.  My father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] coached boxing and I could remember just sitting there in the bleachers watching this or, you know, going into the area where the swimming was taking place, the swimming teams were practicing.  We lived across the street from the football field.  So I remember, you know, the games and how, you know, our house was really popular after the games because the old football field at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] was right across the street.  I remember pets that we had.  I remember cats getting caught (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What pets?
Speaker 2: --in the tree, you know.  And I remember a dog we had named Jiggers [ph.] (laughter) you know, who, you know, the possums would almost kill Jiggers and because the possums came out of, you know, wherever they come from and, you know, they attacked him but then the vet put him back together again.  There were a lot of memories that I have from Hampton and from just friends of my parents, being there was a very positive and very warm community environment.
Story_ID: 363170
Speaker 1: --You talked about the smells and the sights, what sounds do you remember on the campus [of Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] or around your home?
Speaker 2: I would think that the sound that I remember most, music.  You know, there was always music.  My parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] always had records and they were always playing records.  And for some reason, oh, what's his name, Louis [Louis Jordan] whatever his name is, and the Tympany Five [Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five].  You know, I remember sounds like 'Flat Foot Floogie and the Floy, Floy' ['Flat Foot Floogie (with a Floy Floy)'], just because they would make such a big thing out of that.  But all of the other singers of the day, you know, the performers of the day, I mean they loved music.  And I think that I remember the social gatherings, you know.  I remember attending a lot of concerts and recitals and the dance recitals and music was just, you know, a dominant force, you know, African American music, everything from classical to the most popular at the time.
Story_ID: 363171
Speaker 1: So we were still talking about Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and your early years there.  Tell me more stories about, maybe what about elementary school?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I do remember elementary school because it was across the street from the house.  And--
Speaker 1: What was the name of it again?
Speaker 2: Phenix [George P. Phenix Training School, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Phenix elementary school.  And I remember liking my teacher a lot.  I don't remember her name, I think it may have been Mrs. Bridges [ph.] but I'm not sure whether or not that was my brother's [Benson L. Dutton, Jr.] teacher because I do remember a story about my brother going to, I think, the first grade and she clapped her hands and he ran out of the classroom and ran home (laughter) 'cause he wasn't used to anybody making that kind of noise, it scared him.  So which was right across the street so I'm not sure whether Mrs. Bridges was his teacher or mine at some point.  I don't remember very much about, you know, play, or classroom learning.  I do remember, my memories are about arts and crafts, don't ask me why because I am not an artist, I don't, I don't even have that latent (laughter) talent or, you know, whatever, but I do remember arts and crafts.  I do remember making, you know, various, you know, holiday projects, I mean 'cause that's what they called them projects, and I always loved projects.  I mean, and I loved subjects like geography and history for whatever the reason I'm not sure what that was but those were the things I loved--
Story_ID: 363172
Speaker 1: There were a lot of related activities on the campus [of Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], I mean there was May Day.  And I do remember May Day because every year in May the campus would cel- have this big celebration.  And what I realize now that, you know, it wasn't really about little kids, it was really about the campus but they included all of us.  And my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] and all of the other mothers would make these May Day costumes.  And then the older that you became you then were selected to be in the court of the May Day Queen which was the campus queen, and my mother would struggle to make these dresses, you know.  I remember them being organza and whatever it is, I mean, this was all this royalty, you know, coronation, flower girls throwing petals in the path of the queen, you know.  And all of this would take place in the, it would take place in the stadium which was across the street from our home but it was always, you know, a very, very big thing on the campus to be engaged in these type of activities.
Story_ID: 363173
Speaker 1: Then there would be a lot of visits to surrounding historical areas in Hampton [Virginia].  Williamsburg [Williamsburg, Virginia] was close by, so one of the Sunday rides, special Sunday rides, because again during the eras of segregation there just was not a lot to do outside of the campus but Williamsburg was one of the places that we could visit, you know, and I remember going to Williamsburg.  And we would also visit friends, families, a lot, there was a lot of visiting, home visiting and so on.  And we would visit, you know, Sunday visits that was a big thing.  And, you know, we would go to the beach, there was an African American beach, black beach, Negro beach, (laughter) going all the way back, Buckroe Beach [Hampton, Virginia], you know.  And I remember going to Buckroe Beach and, and all the black folks would go to Buckroe Beach.  And you'd see your friends there and that would be, you know, one of the activities too.  And crabbing, one more thing.  I remember, now I remember the Moses' [Julia Mason Moses and William H. Moses, Jr.] I mentioned, Bill Moses had attended Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] with my dad [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] and so he was, he had majored in architecture, daddy had majored in engineering and they both ended up at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] together.  And they had two children.  And I remember in elementary school [George P. Phenix Training School, Hampton, Virginia] at lunch time we would just take off and they lived on the waterfront at Hampton and we would just go and get in their little row boat and go crabbing.  I mean, that was a major thing because we were right there on the waterfront, you know.  And it was Pud [William H. Moses III] and Michael Moses [Michael Moses Williford].  Michael was a girl who was about my age and Pud was her brother.  And we would go get in the boat and we would crab and, I mean, crabs, cooking crabs was a big thing in our family.  My mom [Josephine Brown Dutton] just loved to cook crabs, I mean, and the crabs I remember them jumping out of the pot onto the floor in the kitchen, the whole thing about catching crabs.  And, you know, my brother [Benson L. Dutton, Jr.] second to me was born with a crab (laughter) as his birthmark.  You know, which was amazing (laughter) you know, and we said, "How'd this happen?"  But anyway those are, you know, some of the best memories from Hampton.
Story_ID: 363174
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] work outside the home while you all were at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't work at--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Hampton.
Speaker 1: And you also mentioned your siblings.  How many brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers.
Speaker 1: Two brothers.
Speaker 2: One, Michael Eric Dutton [Michael Dutton] who was born in 1949.  And Benson Leroy Dutton, Jr. [Benson L. Dutton, Jr.] was born at Hampton in 1944.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, in 1949 your family moves to Nashville [Tennessee]; is that right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Around '48 [1948], '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about the move.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember the arrival in Nashville because my father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] had accepted a job at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And we were moving from Hampton [Virginia] and he had not found a house there yet in Nashville, he had been recruited, I think, by the McKissacks.  And the McKissacks, you know, are still a well-known African American architectural firm.  But Calvin McKissack, I think, he was the founder of McKissack and McKissack architecture firm.  So when we moved to Nashville we stayed with the McKissacks for about a month and then my parents found an apartment.  Well, this was something that, you know, after moving from a house, we found an apartment on Sigler Street, I'll never forget this, it was, why, I don't know, but 1509 Sigler Street and that was in south Nashville.  And, you know, I remember my mother being very distressed about this because they just could not find a house.  I mean, finally they did find a house, they found a house on Arena Avenue, 339 Arena Avenue.  The house doesn't exist anymore 'cause they widened the highway.  But so we moved to Nashville--
Story_ID: 363175
Speaker 1: What these moves meant were experiences in school that now I remember really quite well.  I started at an elementary school, Carter-Lawrence Elementary School [Carter-Lawrence Math and Science Magnet Elementary School, Nashville, Tennessee], and I think I was in the third grade in Nashville [Tennessee].  And then when we moved I remember going to public school, Ford Greene Elementary School [Nashville, Tennessee].  What I remember about these schools and I can't remember exactly who the principals were but I do know that we used to have extraordinary assemblies.  And assembly was always a major thing in these elementary schools.  I mean, I can remember going into assembly and we would always be excited because we'd never know what the assembly, of course, it would be music and it would be, you know, the chorus, but there would always be some kind of, you know, I guess, lecture.  But I do remember that Ralph Bunche came to our elementary school because he had gone to college with the principal who was now I remember is Mr. Ford [ph.], and I think that they had attended college together and I do remember, you know, Ralph Bunche coming in to address the assembly.  And then there were other people who later on were, I guess, nationally renowned because so many of the educators who became principals and administrators in the Negro schools in the South had attended Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and people had, and Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and they had gone, gone to school together.  And so they would just interact and, I guess, you know, respond to invitations.  So that was a very special situation.

Speaker 1: In the fourth grade my parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] transferred me to Catholic school.  And that was St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School in Nashville [Tennessee].  And it seemed that this school was considered, you know, one of the best schools in Nashville, the education was considered superior.  The tuition was two dollars a month, so this made it (laughter) an elitists, with paid tuition, two dollars a month.  In addition, you know, I worked washing dishes and setting the table for the nuns and then worked in the lunchroom for, I think, a free lunch or a quarter a day or whatever it was, all the way from, I think, the fifth grade up through the eighth grade when I left and I graduated from St. Vincent's.  But when I went to St. Vincent's, which is really hard to believe, there was outside plumbing at this school.  And the school was in a house that was behind the church and that there were, when I first went to St. Vincent's there were four grades in one classroom, first to fourth, fifth through the eighth.  When I was in the sixth grade I believe or maybe seventh, by the time we were in sixth or seventh we had built a new school, I mean, we had raised, we had sold more chances (laughter) and more bricks and more whatever you sell to build this school but, you know, the Franciscan fathers taught us and the, also the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament who are committed to schools for Native Americans and African Americans (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) African Americans.
Speaker 1: And so they taught us and we sold all the stuff.  We built the school, St. Vincent is still sitting there but I remember going through, you know, this experience.  And then we had indoor plumbing and we had a brick school and by this time, there were only two classes in each, two grades in each classroom.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is in the new school?
Speaker 1: In the new school, yes.  Which was really interesting because when you're in the fifth grade and the sixth grade is being taught, but they're over there, you're hearing everything that's in the sixth grade, you know.  And so when you get to the sixth grade you sort of know all of this but it's sort of review and it really is a wonderful way to excel.  And in the seventh grade, seventh and eighth grade the same thing took place, you know.
Speaker 2: Was, was there one teacher?
Speaker 1: One teacher.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: One teacher who said, "Okay, fifth graders, okay, now you study and you, you do whatever, you read silently or you do your workbook lessons," and then the sister would go and teach the sixth grade, you know.  So I don't know whether the knowledge you received, you know, was subliminal and then the review, I can't remember the process now but, you know, that's how it was all the way through the eighth grade.  I was a non-Catholic, I was still Episcopalian and even though I had wanted to convert because they made it (laughter) so that you wanna convert.  And, you know, as a child you really don't wanna be the odd person out, you really didn't wanna be a non-Catholic in a Catholic school.  But my parents said no, my mother said she had converted from Baptist to Episcopalian and that was the last stop and that was it, you know, so.
Speaker 2: How was it different from Hampton [Virginia]?  Now the classrooms in Hampton each grade had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Simultaneous) Had its own--
Speaker 2: --teacher.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So you enjoyed the way it, it, you were being taught at St. Vincent's?
Speaker 1: I did because I didn't know any better (laughter).  I mean, I did in the sense of know that that wasn't the way it was at Carter-Lawrence [Carter-Lawrence Elementary School; Carter-Lawrence Math and Science Magnet Elementary School, Nashville, Tennessee] or Ford Greene [Ford Greene Elementary School, Nashville, Tennessee] because we had our individual classes in the public schools in Nashville.  But then when I went to Catholic school, I mean, I guess, I just assumed this was the way it was supposed to be, you know, in Catholic school.
Speaker 2: Do you, well was the Catholic school was it all black?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, it was all black.
Speaker 2: All black.  And the nuns were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The nuns were white.
Speaker 2: --were white?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And the teachers at your other elementary schools--
Speaker 1: They were all black.
Speaker 2: They were all black?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 363177
Speaker 1: Was there a favorite teacher or a nun or someone that might have encouraged you?  At this time you had begun to read.  What, what were you reading--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, I always loved books.  And what I can remember from, particularly from the fourth grade on, I don't remember to much about prior to that but the, at Catholic school [St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School, Nashville, Tennessee], we had library of books that were first of all the series, the 'Nancy Drew' series.  And we had 'Cherry Ames, Student Nurse' [Helen Wells] and we had all of these series books so, you know, the real, you know, the real excitement was about reading each one of those books and ongoing.  And then I was just so in love with the information that my parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Dutton, Sr.], I remember what a struggle it was for them to buy the 'World Book Encyclopedia.'  I mean, I thought, you know, I mean, I think, that they made more of paying for that 'World Book' than (laughter) anything else that I can remember.  I remember the 'World Book' being like this is the biggest purchase that we've ever made but I loved the 'World Book' and I would just sit and read from A to Z, you know, all of this information.  And that was what I did.  Between 'Nancy Drew' and 'Cherry Ames' and whatever, you know, what they would call young adult reading now, and the 'World Book' and my classroom textbooks that's, you know, basically what I read from the fourth grade through the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: When did you begin writing?  Do you remember what your first writing experience was?
Speaker 2: Well, I was never much, you know, I mean, I'd write compositions, you know, in the fourth grade, you know.  I remember fourth grade compositions.
Speaker 1: Did you like to write?
Speaker 2: I didn't dislike it (laughter).  You know, but I was not thrilled about, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Writing.
Speaker 2: --writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: You, you loved reading more?
Speaker 2: I loved reading more (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) More.
Story_ID: 363178
Speaker 1: What other activities in your elementary days, now that you're in Nashville [Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you participate in?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, the activities in Nashville were basically family social kinds of things.  I remember that Dr. Matthew Walker [Matthew Walker, Sr.] had a farm and it was Walker's farm.  And we would go to Walker's farm on the weekends when the weather was really nice throughout the summer.  I mean, I remember hay rides, going to Walker's farm, fish fries, going to Walker's farm.  Then also there were hunters on our block, I mean, Dr. Crump [E. Perry Crump] and Dr. Trehearn [ph.] and Mr. Jones [ph.], they were hunters, my father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] was not a hunter, we didn't have a gun in the house, we, no, unh-uh, that was just not happening, you know, in our house but they were all hunters.  So they would take the kids clay shooting sometimes.  And (laughter) I remember people look at me, clay shooting, yep, you, you know, they'd throw whatever that device they used to put the clay things up in the air and then we would shoot, we had BB guns.  You know, I mean this was a big part of my childhood, you know, the whole BB gun era, Red Ryder BB Gun [Daisy Red Ryder BB Gun].  And now I think about how dangerous that was and that was just, you know, ridiculous, you know, to have BB guns.  But we had backyards and we had alleys.  So another big thing was just playing in the alleys.  I mean, we would cut down some tall wooded weeds or something and then, you know, we'd play cowboys, you know, up and down the alley.  Hide and seek was big.  Any, you know, activities, marbles, jacks, we would plan these, you know, okay.  And then, we, of course, had a lot of chores to do.  So everybody knew that they had their chores to do but once the chores were finished we could come out and play.  And so there was a lot that collective play, you know, because kids could play together on the block and nobody really worried, worried about it, you know, and we could go across the street and play in the school yard.  We, in Nashville we lived across the street from the Murphy School [Nashville, Tennessee].  And the Murphy School was a white school where there was, you know, a school that probably could house five hundred students but because the neighborhood had changed there were only fifty kids that went to that school but we couldn't go, we had to go back across town to school.  So we would play in the school yard after school hours--
Story_ID: 363179
Speaker 1: What was the makeup of your community?
Speaker 2: In Nashville [Tennessee]?  It was, I think it had changed, it had gone through its transition so it was maybe 80 percent black.  And I didn't realize how close it was to a more integrated Nashville until I went back recently and I was walking and I said, we were this close to Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee], never realized it.  I mean, I could walk from Vanderbilt to where I was but there were those territorial lines that separated the communities.  So essentially we lived in, you know, an 80 percent black community, although our next door neighbors were white in Nashville on Arena [Avenue].  And there were a number of white families integrated throughout the neighborhood but because of de jure segregation, you know, there was, there was none of the integration of the schools but we played together after school, you know, which was sort of crazy when I thought about it afterwards when I was old enough to understand.
Speaker 1: What type of jobs did your neighbors have?  What occupations?  What class would you say they would be (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were a cross section.  A lot of people were teachers and also doctors, lawyers, it was sort of a, I guess, one could call a middle-class neighborhood although the income level wasn't that high, you know.  I remember that my parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] paid ten thousand dollars for their house, I mean, and this was like a huge house, and they couldn't, they thought that was just, you know, over the moon, you know, to pay that much for a house.
Story_ID: 363180
Speaker 1: Were you involved in say the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, in Nashville [Tennessee] I became first a Brownie, and I remember becoming a Brownie in elementary school and that was in the public elementary school that I attended.  I think it was maybe Ford Greene [Ford Greene Elementary School, Nashville, Tennessee], I'm not sure.  I was a Girl Scout, a Brownie, and then I think when I became ten or eleven or twelve, I, then flew up that's what they called it and I became a Girl Scout.  I loved the, again, I loved the social aspects of Girl Scouting.  I can remember so well that part, I mean, and how I struggled to earn badges but, you know, I wasn't really the cookout, you know, kind of nature person (laughter) that one was required to be to earn badges, you know.  But I enjoyed the Girl Scouts.
Speaker 1: Well, you have any stories about what badges you might have acquired?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I think, that they were really basic.  I remember going on one overnight and I'm sure we did more overnight camping trips and cookouts that I did not like, (laughter) you know, and for a lot of reasons.  It just was not me being that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --kind of person.  But I enjoyed, you know, my friends and that was I think, that's always been the basis.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who your friends were then?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the Girl Scout friends.
Speaker 1: Or, or elementary school friends do, do you have any elementary school friends that you still have today?
Speaker 2: Not people I'm connect, well, yeah, actually I do.  Hap Beasley [Leslie Warren Beasley] was my boyfriend in the fourth grade (laughter).  And Hap, I just talked to Hap last night.  I mean, we've maintained this friendship all the way through and he lives in New York [New York], you know, when he's not traveling the world and doing other things, you know.  But, yeah, I just showed him over the holidays a picture of us from St. Vincent's [St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I think that Hap may be the only person from elementary that I'm really close to now.
Story_ID: 363181
Speaker 1: So now you're getting ready to graduate from St. Vincent's [St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School, Nashville, Tennessee] and what, what year are we in?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm not sure.  I went to high school in '55 [1955] so.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went but in between St. Vincent's, after St. Vincent's, I went to Washington Junior High School, Booker T. Washington Junior High School [sic. George E. Washington Junior High School] in Nashville [Tennessee].  And the reason for that was that I could not go to the Catholic high school being a non-Catholic.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And they had integrated, this was the year so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954], was the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and immediately the Catholic schools in Nashville said, no more segregation.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So that meant that my best friends who were Catholic were going to go to, girls were going to Cathedral [ph.], the boys were going to Father Ryan [Father Ryan High School, Nashville, Tennessee], Hap [Leslie Warren Beasley] went to Father Ryan because he had converted to Catholicism.  You can imagine that that was a very difficult situation because my parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] said, "I'm sorry, we're not converting and you are going to go to public school."  So I went to public school in the ninth grade and I remembered that experience very well because first of all, I had learned everything that was going on in the ninth grade already (laughter) being in the seventh and eighth grade together (laughter).  In, and in Catholic school, I mean, you just diagram sentences, you knew your time tables backwards and forward, you, I mean, there was just so much more that you learned at that time.  So ninth grade there I was, you know, and my homeroom was the library.  And Mrs. Huddleston [ph.] was the librarian.  And I loved to talk, this all relates to the social thing, so she put me at a table by myself which was over by the books, on the wall in the library, and that was just so great because I could just take the books (laughter) off the shelf, read them, put them back.  And I remember Mrs. Huddleston saying, "Class, look at Dutton [HistoryMaker Marie Brown], she's over there even talking to the books (laughter)."  And so I can just see that now, I can see that, you know, that her desk in the middle, me being all the way over on the left and then the rest of the class they're in the, at the tables, you know, facing her.  I remember for the first time having to take home ec [home economics], being a great failure with home ec.  Mrs. Green [ph.] was my home ec teacher.  And that, I remember making a corduroy jumper and, you know, all the well, whatever they call it, has to go one direction in corduroy because otherwise, and I had put these six panels and then one panel I had cut out upside down, (laughter) she made me wear it in the fashion show, oh, I was so embarrassed and all of that.  But I really loved Washington Junior High School.  I loved, you know, a whole different experience, I think being in the ninth grade too contributed a lot to that.  And I also made lifelong friends, Aaronetta Hamilton [Aaronetta Hamilton Pierce] who is, lives now in San Antonio, Texas, her name is Aaronetta Pierce now.  She is someone that I am in close contact with, you know, or occasional contact with.  And I remember just that being a very positive experience even though I was not happy in the earliest days of, to be going to public school and leaving my Catholic school friends behind or they're going to another school.
Story_ID: 361423
Speaker 1: Before we go on to high school, I wanted to ask you about the, the type of music that you enjoyed at that time.  You were still in elementary, well, St. Vincent's [St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School, Nashville, Tennessee] and, and junior high school [George E. Washington Junior High School, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I think around the seventh, eighth grade, I recall, you know, really being in love with what was called rhythm and blues, still called rhythm and blues.  I remember getting a record player at that time and my parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] had always listened to music and they had 78s.  I don't remember having any 78s records but I do remember the 45s and that was the beginning.  In Catholic school we started having dances in the seventh and eighth grade but there were certain rhythm and blues records that we were not allowed to play.  For example, 'Work With Me, Annie' or 'Sixty Minute Man' or whatever it was that seemed to be suggestive.  Also in Catholic school we did a lot of square dancing, you know, (laughter) and I guess the nuns figured that that was the best way to keep boys and girls (laughter) apart 'cause we swing your partner, you know, and do-si-do but we did a lot of square dancing and we did a lot of Irish dancing because the nuns were from Ireland and they would teach us their childhood, you know, childhood songs as well as, you know, the dances.  I mean, we all knew 'Danny Boy' and, you know, "My name is McNamara, I'm the leader of the band," ['McNamara's Band'] all of that, I mean, that stays with you your entire life.  You know, I can still remember most of it.  So that was, those were the kinds of songs that we heard.  It was sort of a split screen, I mean, from what the nuns wanted us to listen to, to what we all of a sudden had discovered this music.  I mean, you know, and Johnny Ace, you know, and 'The Clock' and Little Willie John, you know.  This was going into the ninth grade and by that time, you know, these shows were coming through Nashville [Tennessee] and playing at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I remember going to, you know, the rhythm and blues shows and seeing them, seeing these performers live on stage at Tennessee State, where a lot was going on for the college campus students.  And so that was, you know, the beginning of our rhythm and blues days.  And then Nashville was close to, well, there was always good radio in Nashville.  I remember WLAC [WLAC Radio, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I remember, then there was Randy's Record Mart [sic. Randy's Record Shop, Gallatin, Tennessee] that came on and I had received a little transistor radio that I used to play at night and keep it under my pillow 'cause we could get the signals from, I think it was Gallatin, Tennessee, or where ever Randy's came from and they would play all of these songs.  And eventually, you know, we'd save up and, you know, buy the records.  We, one of the big activities in the ninth and tenth grade was to go downtown on Saturdays and they had these listening booths in the record store, I think it was called Ernie's Record Mart [Nashville, Tennessee], and we would buy, you know, bags of Krystal hamburgers and go and sit in these booths, ask for the records, play the records, and then, you know, we would probably end up buying one or two.  And that was a big deal because that was how we could listen to the music that was an activity, that was something that was really not segregated, I mean we would, we could go into these record stores and sit in listening booths and just sort of have a party, you know.
Story_ID: 361424
Speaker 1: Were your parents political at all?
Speaker 2: My father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] was.  My father definitely was a race man.  He, in his days at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] I think that that was sort of limited to his activities on campus where he focused on, you know, self-empowerment or self-improvement, organizations for the students.  I mean, he was the campus faculty advisor for the Phillis Wheatley club [Phillis Wheatley Literary Society], which was a group of women students on campus.  I remember the Phillis Wheatley club, club, because they would meet at our house sometimes.  I don't remember that much about Hampton.  I do remember in Nashville [Tennessee] and in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], daddy was always active in organizations and a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], a supporter of the Urban League [National Urban League].  And from him that's where I first was seeing the message, you know, from his activities.  He was not sitting at the dinner table really discussing these matter with my mom [Josephine Brown Dutton] because as I said earlier they would just sort of kept that, you know, somewhat quiet but I could deduct from what was going on and doing, you know, my own independent research about what was happening, and particularly from 1954 on after the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision because, and I was thirteen then but I knew that that meant something and, you know, I continued to listen to what was going on because a lot of what was talked about was overheard by kids.  I mean, we were not engaged in the actual discussion, it's not like now, my grandkids (laughter) they're, it's an interaction but then it was like children were still seen and not heard.
Speaker 1: Well, was there any discussion or did you hear anything at that time because then in '55 [1955] Rosa Parks and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the bus situation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: --do you remember?
Speaker 2: --oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I remember really well in nineteen-, I remember Rosa Parks and knowing how important this was because Dr. Trehearn [ph.] on our block took all of the kids that were, well, they could, they had a station wagon so they could pile us all in, to Reverend Kelly Miller Smith's church [First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill] in downtown Nashville and he said that we were going to hear this preacher and it was Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And I remembered that, I mean, I was like fifteen, maybe then or going on fifteen, and I remember going to the church with the rest of the people and sitting there and listening because they made it important, they made it important for us to know what was going on.  And we understood segregation because we understood what we could not do, you know.  The water fountains, you know, in the stores were clearly labeled colored and white and we were just sort of aware of that and looking at those signs and, you know, as kids we'd say, well, where's the water that's not colored, we don't see any colored water here, you know.  And but our parents would always say, "Okay, kids, you know, you'll have to be careful."  You know, I remember my mother being angry about the way she was treated in the department stores and there were certain stores that she wouldn't go to and I didn't understand that it was, you know, demeaning and denigrating to her to be called a girl at first I thought, oh, they thought my mother is young, you know, she's the same age, and then when I saw my mother, you know, take all the towels on the table (laughter) and turn them upside down and just, you know, because she had been insulted by the sales woman, I said oh, something is going on here, you know.  And then she explained to me, you know, that that was, you know, something, she was being denigrated by being called a girl, you know.  And so, yeah, my mother was, she responded in her own way.  My father was more of an activist, you know, engaged in community activities and so on and then there were other people in the community.  But I remember it being very quiet, it wasn't until after, well I moved to Philadelphia then the sit-ins started in Nashville and even looking at 'Eyes on the Prize' I see people I had gone to high school [at Pearl High School; Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] with, you know, who were at those lunch counters in Nashville and leading, you know, they had a very active, you know, movement in Nashville but I had moved up North by the time all this happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.

Speaker 1: Nashville [Tennessee] is known for, going back to the music--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --go, for country western music.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was there any influence?
Speaker 2: Well, you couldn't help it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You couldn't help but hearing it, you know.  And I remember once my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] taking me to the Grand Ole Opry [Nashville, Tennessee] and I don't know why she did it, maybe she did it because she thought it would be an experience, she was very well aware of the history but then again, it was still segregated, I mean, and blacks folks had to sit in the balcony so I don't know why she did it but I guess, you know, she was great for exposure, you know, I mean, it wasn't like we did this every week, it was one time, you know.  And you could not help but hear the music, I mean, and be aware of the people who were the country and western greats, I mean, whether or not it was Hank, whatever his name was.
Speaker 1: Hank Williams.
Speaker 2: Hank Williams and the Carter Family, Minnie Pearl, you know, you, you were just aware of the Grand Ole Opry having such an impact on the music scene in Nashville.  But rhythm and blues was really big so we had our own thing going on where, you know, you weren't gonna find any black folks buying, you know, country and western music, it just wasn't, because rhythm and blues was so dominant.

Speaker 1: You are in junior high school [George E. Washington Junior High School, Nashville, Tennessee], well, tell me what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was really a good student.  I loved school.  I mean, I really loved school.  And through elementary, junior high, I made all A's.  In Catholic school [St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School, Nashville, Tennessee] we were graded in numbers for the most part, I think maybe they may have switched to letter grades but I'd always made A's and maybe an occasional B through junior high school.  And for the most part through high school [Pearl High School; Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School] in Nashville [Tennessee] and I'm not sure, I think in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I did as well but there was some controversy there where my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] had to deal with the teachers but that's later in high school.
Speaker 1: So you were, got hundreds and was it expected that you would do well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was--
Speaker 1: --by your parents and teachers?
Speaker 2: --yeah, it was expected, particularly in elementary school and junior high school giving me, you know, my, my report card the priest would come to distribute the report cards and not only distribute them, read your grades in (laughter) front of the whole class now that I think of it.  And if you did not meet their expectations, I remember Father Berkeley [ph.] just throwing the people's cards on the floor.  I mean, this was crazy, you know.  I mean and that was just such an insult but if you made ninety [percent] rather than a hundred you were expected to do a hundred, to make a hundred in the subject, that was also considered not good enough.  There were friends of mine who were rewarded for their grades, you know, and they'd receive some kind of monetary, you know, acknowledgment but I never did, you know.  And my parents, you know, I'd take the report card home and they'd say, "Well, this is good."  And if there was, you know, an 85 or a 90 [percent], they'd say, "Well you could try to do a little better in this subject."  And so that's what I thought one was supposed to do.  You know, and it, for me, it wasn't that difficult because I loved school, I mean, I loved, you know, I loved school up to a certain point in my academic (laughter) experience and then I didn't love it anymore because it became too difficult with science and math.
Story_ID: 361427
Speaker 1: And this is when you go to high school?  What is the name of the high school?
Speaker 2: In Nashville [Tennessee] I attended Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School] in Nashville, Tennessee, for the tenth and part of the eleventh grade.  And that was a very positive experience too.  This was still under, you know, segregation.  I would have graduated in the class of '58 [1958] from Pearl High School.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  The Catholic schools, Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] happened and they desegregated right away?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But the public schools did not?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So it was still segregated when you went to Booker T. Washington [sic. George E. Washington Junior High School, Nashville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was still segregated.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now Pearl High School?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And there were two black high schools in Nashville, Cameron High School in south Nashville, and Pearl High School in north Nashville.  So that meant that all black high school students, other than those who were integrated into the Catholic schools attended either Pearl or Cameron, and we went to Pearl.  And interesting, at that time my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] taught at Pearl High School, she had then started teaching.  She had taught during my days in elementary school too in Nashville, she had started teaching but she was at, now at Pearl.  And I don't know whether that had any influence on anything, I mean, because people, there were a number of people whose parents taught in the schools.  I mean, there weren't, if you were teachers, there weren't that many choices, you know, for you to attend nor for teachers to teach, so it wasn't an unusual situation--
Story_ID: 361428
Speaker 1: But those were some of the best teachers that I ever had in my entire experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who were some of those teachers?
Speaker 1: I remember Mrs. Freeman, particularly, at Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee].  She was the English teacher and she just expected one to excel.  And I remember it stayed with me my entire life and she wrote on one of my papers and I think that I only had a few errors on the paper but she wrote that this lethargy would not be, is not acceptable.  And I said what is lethargy?  (Laughter) You know, what does this mean?  When I looked it up and she said laziness, I said, oh, my God, you know.  But Mrs. Mildred Freeman she was incredible, she was just an incredible teacher.  I mean, you sort of approached her class with trepidation but at the same time I can still remember that she really did teach English and it was, you know, something that stayed with you.  I mean, it was a great transition from Catholic school [St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School, Nashville, Tennessee] where you got the structure through diagraming and you knew grammar and all of that but then she expanded that through reading as well as writing.  Also my French teacher, Madame Williams [ph.], she allowed no English spoken in her class and this was first year French from tenth grade on.  And she was an incredible French teacher which had some bearing on an experience I had later on when I moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the eleventh grade.  And then there was Mrs. Williams [ph.], another English teacher who was extraordinary.  There was Reverend Ewing who was my math teacher who was extraordinary in high school.  So these were the people that I remember the most.
Speaker 2: And in knowing them and the fact that they were really good teachers is what gave you the positive experience?
Speaker 1: Yes.  You know, because I think looking back on it now, it was really stimulating.  It was an experience where, you know, you just looked forward to going to school and it was not the exception to excel, I mean, I was not the only one.  We were, there was a lot of competition.  I mean, I was the president of the class in the tenth grade and, and it was all based on academic excellence, it was not a kind, another kind of popularity, you know.
Speaker 2: Did you ever play an instrument?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Or take dance?
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 361429
Speaker 1: You went to Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] until the eleventh grade (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Til the eleventh grade and at which time we moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  My father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] had accepted a job at the end of my tenth grade or early eleventh grade experience.  And he accepted a job in Philadelphia working for the city and he left teaching at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And that was really a difficult time because here, you can imagine, being in the middle of your high school experience people that you cared about, loved, you know, wonderful, you know, teachers, great, you know, social experience, and moving to Philly, and not knowing anyone, no one, and going to, for the first time an integrated school [Germantown High School] in Germantown in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: So tell me your experiences.
Speaker 2: Well, okay.  We moved, I remember, you know, my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton] saying how important it was for me to just do everything properly, you know, and, you know, she always stressed this kind of behavior and ladylike behavior and southern gentility and all of that that had become the norm in my life.  Well, here I am in Philadelphia that was not going on (laughter).  This was a whole other urban experience.  We didn't know urban in Nashville [Tennessee], you know, even though we were in the city, it was not urban.  Plus this was an integrated experience and school experience so I had to learn a lot, you know, fast.  And I remember being the new girl, you know, the new girl in class and making a couple of friends, Billy Owens [ph.], I remember him really well, he's now deceased but Billy was my protector and buddy, he was just such a sweetie pie.  And then there was Carnell Bridges [ph.], Carnell was, you know, he was like another kind of protector but he had street cred, what they would call now so he could keep everybody else, you know, away from me.  And I remember some of the tough guys, I mean, they would look like wimps compared to what tough is today (laughter) but, you know, just really getting on the trolley and picking on me and Carnell keeping them away from me, you know, and all of that.  And they would call me Magnolia because I had a southern accent and I came from, you know, the South and that was, you know, making that social adjustment.
Story_ID: 361430
Speaker 1: Then being in an integrated high school [Germantown High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was also another social adjustment, you know, because I had never attended school with white students.  And, and there was, you know, this whole dynamic that took place that, you know, you had to just sort of learn, you know, you, I was just thrown into the eleventh grade so I just had to learn this and but making friends with everybody.  I mean, learning that, you know, it was just a matter of who your friends were and what you had in common with them.  But it was also making an adjustment.  I mean, I remember for the first time my mother having to come to the school because she had an encounter with the French teacher who had failed me because she said that I was cheating because there was no way for me to know the kind of French that I knew coming from the South.  Well, she didn't know Josephine Dutton [Josephine Brown Dutton] (laughter) 'cause she came up there and I still can remember, I mean, you don't want your mother to go to school 'cause you figure it's gonna be worse but it really wasn't worse because my mother made her understand that, you know, that I did not cheat.  And the same with Mrs., Miss Kramer [Mildred Kramer], I'll never forget her, she was just such a difficult English teacher, and my mother had to come up there, she also claimed that I was cheating in school because she said that there was no way that I could excel in English and given the background that I've already shared, I mean, you know, it would be obvious that, you know, I'd know, you know, eleventh grade English (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the French?
Speaker 1: And French.
Speaker 2: Oh, English and French.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And because at first the teacher asked me was I from Haiti, I'll never forget this, and I said no, you know, and then after that she just didn't really wanna know anything about my not knowing, you know, my, you know, passing and excelling in both of these courses, you know, really, really--
Speaker 2: So what was the outcome?
Speaker 1: Oh, after, you, please, Josephine Dutton, she could straighten out anyone and she just knew what to say, you know, to get respect, you know, and to let them know that that was unacceptable but there were always other challenges.  I mean, there were the guidance counselors, these stories are always legend when you talk about African Americans going through a school system where you are directed and guided into others, you know, higher education or not higher education--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --choices.  So that was also, you know, a problem because I was told: "Well, you should apply to schools in the South because they're cheaper and because they don't have heating considerations," and all of this kinds of, I remember that, you know, just sitting in the guidance counselors office and knowing that I was never gonna get any kind of advice, you know.  And looking back on it I wish I had gone to the, stayed in the South, I mean, had gone back to college in the South or, you know.
Story_ID: 361431
Speaker 1: But what I did I chose to go to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, Ogontz; Pennsylvania State University, Abington, Abington, Pennsylvania] because I was sort of just disenchanted with everything and my father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] had gone to Penn State.  It was really the simplest and easiest, I think I didn't apply to any place else, I was just like I don't care, you know.  I, and that was, you know, the high school, that was the beginning of my, you know, period of well, I just really don't care, you know, because it was such a blow not to be acknowledged for a, your interest in academic work, you know, the work that you did to be told that you didn't really do it.  And so psychologically I think that I just said okay, I'm getting through this experience in high school, I'm graduating from Germantown [Germantown High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and then with college I'll just do the easiest thing and I'll just apply to Penn State (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Penn State.
Speaker 1: --of course, I was accepted.
Speaker 2: But what your, your grades were still good when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were good for the most part.  I mean, I had started receive, I mean, physics and higher math the trigonometry and all of that really took me because I just wasn't a math person, I was a word person and when we got into beyond algebra I was lost, you know, and I was lost because I just didn't apply myself in those areas.  My mind was not computing, (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 361432
Speaker 1: Before we go on, I'm sure not whether when we were talking about your mother and father whether we stated their names and their dates of birth--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --so can we do that right now?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother is Josephine Olivia Brown Dutton [Josephine Brown Dutton], she was born on July 7, 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father was Benson Leroy Dutton, Jr. [sic. Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] and he was born January 7, 1910, that would have been yesterday, he would be ninety-seven.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the high school that you graduated from, that was Germantown High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Germantown High School in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And so in 1958 you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then you entered college right away?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: At Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, Ogontz; Pennsylvania State University, Abington, Abington, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: At Penn State.  And I attended the local campus which was the Ogontz campus at Penn State.  They had a two year satellite campus that was not far from Philadelphia where we commuted, we were commuter students.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For two years I went to Ogontz and commuted.  It was near Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, near Jenkintown [Pennsylvania], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so tell me about the experience going to college.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Even though you commuted it still had to be different.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  And I don't know what my expectations were, I think that I was still not really enamored with the whole college experience because mind you I had grown up in Nashville [Tennessee], I had grown up on the campus [of Hampton Institute; Hampton University] in Hampton [Virginia] and in Nashville where there was Fisk [Fisk University], Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University], and Meharry [Meharry Medical College] and then being taken from there in eleventh and a half grade, I, you know, was just like okay, just resigned, I knew I didn't have a choice, I was going to college, you know, so going to Ogontz was it.  And it was hard, it was, it was difficult, the academic side was difficult but, you know, we, meaning the other students and I, and the African American students did band together and we had our own little world in that, you know, we, you know, just I think participated in, you know, for survival's sake and--
Speaker 1: What kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We all commuted, we all commuted from Philly.  And, I mean, Charles Shorter [ph.], I remember he had a 1950 Mercury that was just the worst car in the world and he would pick up, I was the fifth person he picked up and then we would go, (laughter) you know, we would go up to the campus.  And then Herbie Coverdale [Herbert L. Coverdale, Jr.] who is a psychologist now, Dr. Herbert Coverdale, he would be one of the people who had a car that would drive and pick up, you know, the city kids and we would go to college and go, go up there to Penn State.  And it was small, it was a small campus.
Story_ID: 363182
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your days at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, Ogontz; Pennsylvania State University, Abington, Abington, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and how you were commuting.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So share some more about Penn State.
Speaker 2: Well, the commuting years, the memories are sort of integrated with living in the city as well because I was living at home so it was probably just a continuation, it was not, you know, campus life.  But we had a strong group of people who were engaged in the social life of the city.  And during that time I also pledged a sorority at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] where the city chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] was, I guess, we can say where the headquarters of the city chapter were which meant that young women from many of the schools in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area pledged in to AKA at that particular chapter, people from West Chester [West Chester University, West Chester, Pennsylvania] and Cheyney [Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] and Penn State and University of Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your, your sisters?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember, well Hazel Sodder [ph.] who was my roommate once we moved up to the main campus, up to University Park [Pennsylvania] when we left Ogontz.  Hazel Sodder, Joyce Jenkins [Joyce Russel Jenkins], I remember twins, and I can't remember the twins' name, Phyllis Eggelston [ph.], we had a lot, a big line, twenty something people were, and I just went to a reunion a couple of years ago in Philly.  Now do you think I could remember people (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 363183
Speaker 1: Well what about political, you know, you, you had some political action in Nashville [Tennessee] what about on campus now?
Speaker 2: Well, at Penn State at Ogontz [Pennsylvania State University, Ogontz; Pennsylvania State University, Abington, Abington, Pennsylvania] there was nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, 'cause we were in the city.  And I don't remember participating in anything political but I was certainly aware of what was going on in the South at that time.  But it was still maybe 1958, '59 [1959] so things hadn't really heated up until the '60s [1960s], you know, when I went up to the main campus in University Park [Pennsylvania].  That is, you know, an interesting part of my life and I only knew how interesting it was, really interesting it was racially in retrospect.  Penn State Ogontz was only two years so you either had an opportunity to transfer up to the main campus or to go to another.  Shirley Poole also was a great friend and she's still a great friend but she went off to Boston [Massachusetts] which reminded me, you know, transferring to another school Boston University [Boston Massachusetts].  Hazel [Hazel Sodder (ph.)] and I and a few others we opted to go to the main campus.  What we realized after we got there we were really a minority, there were I think at that point maybe only two hundred, two hundred fifty black students on the campus at Penn State and there were maybe twenty-five thousand (laughter) students there total.  But we banded together.  The sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] had a suite which meant that we all roomed together in a certain part of the, of dorms.  But we didn't get that suite until my senior year and we moved into new dormitories, Pollock [Pollock Halls], the Pollock dormitories on Penn State's campus up at the main campus.  And again this called for another enormous adjustment because here we were on this huge campus in the middle of Pennsylvania, there were no, not one African American faculty members, no adults.  When, I didn't realize this until I went back later to and understood that we were a bunch of young college kids on a campus without any kind of adult advisor, role model, supervisor, professor, there was just, we were just there.  And it's a miracle that (laughter) we came through this experience, you know.  But I remember it for the most part being a positive experience.  But I also remember not being engaged academically as I would have now looking back (laughter) wanted to be.  Because it was just such, you know, a vast, you know, academic arena and at nineteen we were really on our own so, you know, and this was the first time, you get up and go to class if you want to, if you don't want to, (laughter) you know, you go socialize, you can hang out with, you know, the fraternity, because they had the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and the Ques [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  I don't think there were any Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] on campus then.  And but I, really again in retrospect think that we were really quite mature to be able to get through that experience and to succeed, you know.  And I think that that had everything to do with, you know, our parents and, you know, the guidance that we received from them and the fact that we were afraid not to (laughter) because Hazel and I wouldn't, you know, we were surrounded by mountains and the view was just beautiful and I'd say, "Okay, we can only gaze at the mountains for so long because, you know, our parents will kill us if we flunk out, you know."  And so whatever we had received, you know, from our parents, you know, and not so much in threats but understanding what the sacrifices were, we knew we had better not mess up, you know.  And it wasn't that we were doing all that great academically because it was hard.  We were taking, you know, courses that we were not really engaged in, I mean, particularly in the math and sciences, we had to take them as requirements to graduate.  In the other areas, I was a psychology major, don't ask me why but, you know, it was not being whatever else one could choose, I mean, psychology just sounded like something that we wanted to do.  Hazel was a psychology major too (laughter) so here we were roommates being psychology majors and it was hard.
Story_ID: 363184
Speaker 1: At this point what had you decided you wanted to do after graduation?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, we thought we were gonna be psychologists, I mean I don't know where we discovered this or being readers, you know, both of us were avid readers and maybe who knows maybe we saw a psychologist in a movie, I don't know.  But psychology at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] was in the College of Education so we always knew that we could get an education degree and we could fall back on that which is exactly what we did in reality because to be a psychologist meant that you had to continue on in school for two, four, whatever many years, or to be an analyst you had to go beyond that.  And I think that when both of us were finished with the main campus and graduated that was enough.  You know, it had been a, a tough academic road to hoe (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, even though there were no African American advisors was there anyone there that could, could give a hand, I mean give you advice or guidance (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had advisors, I mean, but I don't really, I mean, I remember my first years at Ogontz [Pennsylvania State University, Ogontz; Pennsylvania State University, Abington, Abington, Pennsylvania], Dr. Housenick [ph.].  And I think he was a psychologist, maybe that had something to do with it too but I think we had already chosen our major at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, no, that wasn't Dr. Housenick that was my regular doctor.  What was his name?  I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's fine.
Speaker 2: But anyway, no, Dr. Housenick was another doctor but it was, you know, there, I don't remember anyone being there.  I remember going back later, now there's the Paul Robeson Center [Paul Robeson Cultural Center, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and there are a number of African American advisors and faculty members on campus and I think that it has made a tremendous difference although Penn State has undergone a lot of racial problems in recent years but things that we never experienced.  I mean, we never experienced the racism and the, you know, hate mail and acts that have, I read in the alumni news and even in The New York Times some of the incidents that have taken place there recently which is really disturbing to me now.
Speaker 1: Well, it's good that you didn't experience any of that.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 363185
Speaker 1: So you graduated in 1962?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, I returned to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and what was I gonna do but sign up for, at the board of education (laughter) because I knew I had, needed to get a job.  So I was a substitute teacher and then I up, you know, you had to take an exam to get a permanent assignment so I took an exam, a written and I believe it was an oral exam.  And I wanted to teach in junior high school and my first choice was Wagner Junior High School [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] because Wagner Junior High School was a school that I passed every day when I was going to Ogontz [Pennsylvania State University, Ogontz; Pennsylvania State University Abington, Abington, Pennsylvania] and I'd pass this junior high school and I'd say oh, that, maybe that's where I will teach one day.  Well, I did, I got my first choice, went to teach there, seventh, eighth, and ninth grade.  And boy, was that a, as they say junior high school is the baptism of fire and it really was.  I mean, the seventh graders were wonderful, the eighth graders were okay, but the ninth graders, I mean, they had really gone through, you know, "Okay, now we're this tall and we are, you know, on our way to being adults," which I think now is why they place ninth graders in high school as opposed to, you know, the whole middle school, junior high school experience.  But I taught social studies.  I loved it, I really loved teaching.  It's interesting I've been thinking a lot about it because [HistoryMaker] Bebe Moore Campbell was a student in the eighth grade when I taught there and, you know, as, you know, she just passed.  And she was in the academically talented class, I didn't teach them but I taught the second academically talented class and her best friend, Hope Jeannerette [ph.] was in my class.  So I remember them being 8-1, and 8-2, that was, those were the eighth grade classes then I think.  At--
Speaker 1: So you were there how long?
Speaker 2: I was there, I think, for about two or three years--
Story_ID: 363186
Speaker 1: I read about a, a job with the school district in the office of intergroup education [Office of Integration and Intergroup Education], it was a new office being set up, the office of intergroup education and integration.  In the meantime I had been working in Fellowship House which was an organization in North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and this was after school, I was, you know, engaged in their young people's program as a volunteer because my father [Benson L. Dutton, Sr.] was working with Fellowship House.  And it was a school that was run by Marjorie Penney and she, they were Quakers and they had a farm, Fellowship Farm [Pottstown, Pennsylvania], and they were bringing people together, you know, to support the Civil Rights Movement in the South and also to work in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] public schools in the area of multiculturalism and integration.  So I worked there with young people after school as a volunteer.  And I took, my, my father was in charge of a committee, he was the head of a committee to bring Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to Philadelphia and the King's Way Committee [ph.] so that was all around that same time.  So I heard about this job and I took a test and I took an oral exam and I got it.  And so that meant I was out of the classroom.  I mean, there were eight coordinators that were hired.  I was given District 5, where I was to coordinate any intergroup activities in the schools for that district and that was introducing the principals and the parents and the children to new multicultural curriculum materials and working with my other colleagues in making sure that the African American history and so on was being introduced and multicultural history was being introduced in the Philadelphia schools.  And so there I was, I think I was twenty-five.
Speaker 2: What, what year was this?
Speaker 1: That was 1965.
Story_ID: 363187
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you, do you remember what you were doing or where you were when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I was there in my classroom at Wagner Junior High School [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in a parent teachers meeting.  And I only had I think one or two parents there and I remember Mr. Callen [ph.] who was our vice, vice principal running into the classroom and I can just see it as if it was yesterday, saying the president has been shot.  And this was something, I mean, you couldn't even, I would still remember not even understanding how, how do you think about this, what are you talking about, you know.  Because we just never knew assassination, you know, except for [President] Abraham Lincoln, I mean, going back that far.  So I remember just everybody just sort of breaking down and leaving.  I remember that it was on a Friday and it was payday, and for some reason I (laughter) went to the bank and deposited my check and never came out of the house again until, I don't know, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I mean, we were just glued in front of the television from that point.  But, I mean, that was, that was just devastating, it really, really was.
Speaker 1: How did you talk to your students about it?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: You don't remember, okay.  That's fine.
Story_ID: 363188
Speaker 1: The coordinator position for the, it was for the--
Speaker 2: School.
Speaker 1: --Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] school system, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the School District of Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this is the year now Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: No, he was '68 [1968], you mean assassination?
Speaker 1: No, when the--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --Civil Rights Movement really starts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, '65 [1965], yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it starts really taking off.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there any political activities that you might be involved in?
Speaker 2: Well, I was still working with Fellowship House [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were really engaged from Philadelphia so I was not a part of anybody traveling to the South or any of that but very active in our own community and in our schools.  I remember that in Kensington [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was my district, which was east of Broad Street in Philadelphia, it was a working-class neighborhood, somewhat integrated but predominantly white and where kids were being bussed in, so this was during the whole busing period and it was a rough time in Philadelphia and it was my job to be there at the schools when the buses came in.  And there were demonstrations, name calling, comparable to what was going on in Little Rock [Arkansas] and, you know, other places when integration was taking place.  And it was really a very, very difficult experience to get through but, you know, we persevered, you know, in that office of intergroup education [Office of Integration and Intergroup Education] and, you know, eventually, you know, the schools were balanced and integrated to a certain extent as much as possible even though the idea was to really lessen the crowding in other schools, it was not so much for integration but it was sort of to balance the education opportunity for the children.  And in the meantime the School District of Philadelphia had received a major grant from the government to conduct intergroup seminars in Atlantic City [New Jersey] for every administrator in the whole school system.  I mean, from vice principals to curriculum people and for I don't know how many weekends we all traveled to Atlantic City where the top sociologists, psychologists, educators would come in and conduct seminars to help these school administrators and teachers to understand how to think and what they should be doing in terms of integration and in terms of history, multicultural history.
Speaker 1: So do you think the program was successful in what it set out to accomplish (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was success- it was successful in that particular era.  But as you can imagine, you know, as time passed, a lot of what was implemented was lost with people either retiring, or principals retiring, you know, supervisors retiring, and it just, it was never institutionalized and that was one of the problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember, well, I'm, I'm still thinking about the, about this time in the '60s [1960s], do you remember the first time that you voted?
Speaker 2: No.  I had to think back to being twenty-one and being able to vote because I've always voted but I don't remember that and that would have been in Philadelphia but I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: When you leave the school system [School District of Philadelphia]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --tell me what happens next (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, when I left the school system, I left it, as I'm directly, related to my being in the school system.  Loretta Barrett who had been a teacher in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] school system, came to talk to our in service group, the office of intergroup education [Office of Integration and Intergroup Education] about what she was doing in New York [New York] in publishing, book publishing.  And she was working as the editor of a series of multicultural books called the 'Zenith Books.'  She had been hired by Charles Harris [HistoryMaker Charles F. Harris] who was an African American publishing pioneer and I think he's been a HistoryMaker too.  And Charles had hired Loretta to work with him on the 'Zenith Books,' she had come to New York to talk to us about what she was doing because a great part of our job was to integrate these multicultural books into the curriculum in the Philadelphia system.  Well, as it turned out Loretta had taught at Gratz High School [Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with my mother [Josephine Brown Dutton].  And my mother had mentioned a while ago prior to her coming that, "Oh, you should think about, you know, doing what this young teacher did at my school."  I mean, I remember the conversation and, you know, I just dismissed it like go to New York to do what?  I mean, that's like, you know, my becoming an explorer in the North Pole.  So she came and she said, "Oh, you're Mrs. Dutton's daughter?"  And I said, "Um-hm."  And she said, "Oh, well, when you come to New York sometime you should come and talk to me about what it is that you do in the system."  So my next vacation from the school system which would be the Easter holiday, I said oh, great, I'm going to New York and then I'm gonna call Loretta and I remember standing in a phone booth across from Radio City [Radio City Music Hall, New York, New York] calling her and saying, "Well, I'm in New York," you know, and she said, "Well, okay, let's have lunch on Thursday."  And so I said okay.  And I met her for lunch and she said, "Well, I'm not coming in to work tomorrow it's Good Friday but I want you to really talk to some people in the, at Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York] about what it is that you do."  And I said, "Okay, I will."  And I went in, met the people that she told me that I should talk to.  They, you know, asked me what did I do, and I told them about the multicultural books and the African American history books and all of that that I was sharing with the administrators and the parents and the kids.  And they said, "Well, you should talk to so and so about that."  And so I talked to three different groups of people about it.  At the end they said, "Well would you like a job?"  I said, "What?"  (Laughter) You know.  Now this was 1967, so they were looking for affirmative action hires because they had been called by the committee headed by Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] to Washington [D.C.].  He was the head of the House education committee [House Committee on Education and Labor; House Committee on Education and the Workforce] and he had called in a number of publishers from New York, everybody, and said what are you all doing to integrate your staffs and to also what are you doing to, you know, integrate your publishing programs?
Story_ID: 363190
Speaker 1: Here I show up and they said, "Oh, we would like to hire you."  And I said, "Hire me, (laughter) this was an interview?"  Because before that I had always had to take a test, be interviewed, I knew fill out an application.  I had never been to this type of, you know, hire, been through this type of hiring situation.  So, I said, "Okay, well, I'll go home and think about it and then I thought about it," and I said well this may, I may never have an opportunity to move to New York [New York] or to work in publishing and I think that I will consider it.  And then I accepted it.  Well, what it was was a trainee position [through Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York].  So that meant that I gave up my job in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] school system as an, working from the administration building, and being an administrator, really coordinator over a district to becoming a trainee.  Okay, the training program was supposed to last ten weeks and what that meant was that you go from department to department then in those ten weeks you learn everything you need to know about publishing.  My training program lasted ten months because there really weren't any jobs, I mean, publishing, there were five other trainees, I was the only black one, everybody, maybe there were eight, everybody dropped out but two, John Ware [John A. Ware] and myself.  But every week I would, when they came time to assign me I would say well, okay, I don't have a job yet but maybe I will go to children's books again and read manuscripts or maybe I'll go to advertising.  I just gave myself assignments until one of these days I talked to Loretta [Loretta Barrett], you know, I was always in touch with her, she was an editor in Anchor Books [New York, New York] and doing Zenith ['Zenith Books'], and I said, "Loretta, you really need an assistant, I mean, why don't you have an editorial assistant?"  Well, you know, there was always a reason why she didn't have one.  So I said, "Well, I just really need to be your assistant and we're gonna go to personnel together," 'cause before it was personnel not human resources.  And we went to personnel and I became her assistant.  And that was in 1968.
Story_ID: 363191
Speaker 1: And I worked as her [Loretta Barrett] assistant for a year which was an interesting time.  I assisted in editorial work on books and helped her with all the books that she had acquired.  And I really took over a couple of the authors and that was when Vertamae Grosvenor [Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor] became my first author, you know, which was really quite an experience because Verta at that time was living on the Lower East Side [New York, New York] and she was also playing in Sun Ra's band.  She was a singer with Sun Ra, so and his inter-galactical outer space whatever [Sun Ra and His Intergalactic Infinity Arkestra], and so all this was going on in the Lower East Side.  I had never experienced anything like the Lower East Side, (laughter) you know, and Sun Ra before or Verta but, you know, we worked on her book, we worked on her book and it was really funny because she wanted to publish the whole book in lowercase 'cause this was during the '60s [1960s] and everything was lower case, you know, E. Cummings [E. E. Cummings], you know, and all that.  I said nobody's gonna read a recipe book in lowercase (laughter).  We would have some knockdown drag outs and then eventually 'Vibration Cooking' ['Vibration Cooking: Or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl,' Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor] was published and it stayed in print for a really, really, really long time up until recently and it may go back into print again but Verta now is a commentator on National Public Radio [NPR], you know.  But those were my first experiences.
Story_ID: 363192
Speaker 1: I mean, during that time Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  I remembered that being, you know, a time at Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York] where Loretta [Loretta Barrett] and one of our, the editorial colleagues, Judy Dollenmayer, we're going to personnel to ask are they gonna give us the day off and they said nope.  But we flew to Atlanta [Georgia] to, that day, we didn't know anybody, we just, I remember getting on Eastern Air Lines and we flew to Atlanta to just be there and to march from the church to what is now the Kennedy, The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The King Center.
Speaker 1: And seeing Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] who, we had stopped along the way 'cause it was hot and seeing Bobby Kennedy and I remember going up to Bobby Kennedy, Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] was working for Bobby Kennedy then, and to shake his hand and he was like one of his assistants and he was sort of trying to keep people away but I just moved and I just felt that I needed to shake Bobby Kennedy's hand and I was so glad that I did that because two months later he was dead, you know.  And it was such an incredible day for us, you know, just saying, "Well, we don't care if Doubleday doesn't give us the day off or whatever, we're just gonna go."  And that was the spirit that we felt and it was, I remember seeing Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] who was just a young preacher coming through the Hyatt Hotel, we were in the coffee shop before we went back to the airport and he was just in his jeans, and he was, you know, like there was Jesse Jackson.  And it was just that incredible time and that period and then we went back to Doubleday.  I stayed at Doubleday through 1969 then I moved to California when I got married.
Story_ID: 361586
Speaker 1: --Sixty-nine [1969] you moved to California and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, I was married September 6, 1969 to Kenneth Brown from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And he was in art school, he was at the Art Center College of Design in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And I just got married, upped and left New York [New York] and next thing I knew I was in L.A. and wondered why (laughter) I was in L.A. because it was not New York.  And I had visited L.A. but it's like they say about New York it's one thing to visit but it's another thing to live there.  But in a, in a very short time, I had found a bookstore in the shopping center that was across the way, not too far from where we lived.  And, of course, I didn't have a car so it had to be, you know, not far because everything in L.A. is like crossing big boulevards and driving for twenty minutes.  So it was in a shopping center and I had gone in and met the owner, Mrs. Mary Cleaves.  And I met Mrs. Cleaves who was a librarian at L.A. High School [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], who was on sabbatical but decided to open a bookstore.  She had a partner, I asked her could I work there and she said, "No, I have a partner."  And in about two weeks she called me and said, "Are you still interested in working here?"  And I said, "Yes."  And she said well, her partner thought they were gone make a whole lot of money (laughter) in the first couple of weeks but it was so slow and he just really didn't know the book business.  So I went to work in the bookstore and I worked there my entire time in L.A. which really made it special for me because it was a small African American bookstore in the Midtown Shopping Center [Los Angeles, California] which was a strip mall type of place in L.A. at, near San Vicente [Boulevard] and La Brea [Avenue].
Speaker 1: What was the name of the bookstore?
Speaker 2: Bronze Books [ph.].
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: B-R-O-N-Z-E, Books, Bronze Bookstore.  And so what it did was to make L.A., you know, a place that I really enjoyed being while I was in the store because people who come to a bookstore, bookstore customers are special people, they're looking for books.  And I would have a number of conversations with people and some of whom would tell me who they were, others wouldn't tell me who they were, I mean, it was a mixed bag of characters and of individuals.  I mean, the characters were people who were in L.A. obviously to be discovered and who were, had some kind of, you know, need to be seen and to probably find their way in the film, to the film or television world.  And then others were, you know, college professors.  I remember meeting Clyde Taylor, Dr. Clyde Taylor, who now teaches at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], became a lifelong friend from just meeting in the bookstore.  I mean, we would talk about things of mutual interest.  And then one day, you know, many, many, months later, you know, he introduced himself to him, or I asked him, I said, "Well, who are you and what do you do?"  He said, "I teach at Claremont College."  And then, and he said well, who are you?  And I said well I used to work in publishing in New York and blah, blah, blah.  And then I remember meeting a Nigerian professor at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], Dr. Boniface Obichere he would come into the store.  And just any number of people with whom I could have a great conversation about books.  And so that made me really happy and that was very rare in Los Angeles at that time. Because I had applied for jobs in publishing there and at that time the only jobs available were in adult publishing and I didn't know what that was until I went for the--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --jobs and I kept seeing XXXX (laughter) in all the books, I was like oops, nope, this isn't the place.  And then I applied for another job and they said they wanted an editorial assistant, the job was to input every manuscript by, you know, a PC [personal computer], and, you know, to create the book, I said, oh, no, I can hardly type, this, this would never do.  But when I found the bookstore that was really great.  So and then I also worked as an editorial, a freelance editor for a publication called The Black Politician [The Black Politician: A Journal of Current Political Thought].  And senator, state senator, Mervyn Dymally [HistoryMaker Mervyn M. Dymally] had, was the publisher of this particular book.  It was a journal, and it was just really great doing that kind of work and sort of being there--
Story_ID: 361587
Speaker 1: Kenneth [Kenneth Brown] graduated from Art Center [Art Center College of Design, Los Angeles, California].  He had gone to Art Center via, his Philadelphia [Philadelphia] connection as a next door neighbor to Bill Cosby growing up in Philly.  And he, Bill Cosby had paid for his tuition and all that with the idea that Kenneth eventually would work for him.  And Kenneth created all the Fat Albert characters with two of his artist friends from Art Center but this didn't have a happy ending because the Filmation [Filmation Associates, Los Angeles, California] and William Morris [William Morris Agency, Beverly Hills, California] people took over the project and Cosby let them do that, and so Kenneth was never compensated for that.  So that's history, it can be documented in Jet magazine (laughter) and everywhere else.  But, you know, so life went on, I hated L.A. [Los Angeles, California], eventually because it was just, you know, two industries going on there, it was, you know, Hollywood and gossip and that was it, you know.  And there was no place to really walk, how many times are you gonna go see, you know, Dance Theatre of Harlem when they come and Alvin Ailey, it was during the early years, and to the same museum, I mean, it was just not the cultural stimulation that New York [New York] was about.  And then I also happened to be there now it is, it was the second worth, worst earthquake, they've already had the worst one, but now this one would be the second worst, and that was just traumatic, you know, I just said, unh-uh.  So I had, my daughter [Laini Brown] was born on April 1, 1971, and the earthquake had taken place sometime earlier that year or the previous fall, I can't remember.  But, you know, every little rumble, you know, I was just ready to leave.
Story_ID: 361588
Speaker 1: So finally I, then that spring of, or early summer of '71 [1971] I said, "Okay, Kenneth [Kenneth Brown]," he said, "well I'm ready to leave L.A. [Los Angeles, California]," I said, "okay, well, I'm gonna go first," and I returned to Washington [D.C.] where my parents [Josephine Brown Dutton and Benson L. Brown, Sr.] now lived, they lived, they had moved to D.C. from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And so I returned to D.C. with the baby, stayed there for a year, or yeah, about a year and Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York] called me and they said, "Okay, we're looking for somebody, you know, because we had two other assistants while you were out in L.A. and now we can't find anybody," so they could not find another African American in all of New York City [New York, New York] to be an editorial assistant at Doubleday, "Do you want your old job back?"  Here I am with a baby, you know, wanting to move back to New York, Kenneth's on his way, I said sure (laughter).  I said, that was easy.  So but I said, "I will only return if you give me a promotion and make me an editor and, you know, you know, and I will come back and begin working."  I forgot when, I think it was August, September, I can't remember, but I returned in '72 [1972] and I became an editor, an, an associate editor at Doubleday then in '72 [1972].  And Laini [Laini Brown], my daughter, whose nickname was Mookie [ph.], well, whose really known as Mookie Brown, Mookie went into daycare, you know, because we had a daycare in, on the ground floor of our building on 164 West 83rd Street, Le Jardin Ala West [ph.], a young couple had just started daycare, they had a daughter the same age as Mookie.  And so they were like one year olds together or something like that and then I started at Doubleday as an editorial assistant.  And that was my full responsibility as editor and I worked there at Doubleday as an editor until 1981.
Story_ID: 361589
Speaker 1: Who were some of the books that were published during your time?
Speaker 2: Okay.  From that time, Alexis De Veaux.  Alexis is now, she was a very young author at that time but she's published a couple of books since then, a biography of Audre Lorde ['Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde,' Alexis De Veaux].  And she, her first book was 'Spirits in the Street' [Alexis De Veaux].  And she was a, now she's a professor at SUNY [University at Buffalo] in Buffalo [New York].  And I remember Alexis particularly because she was a young woman who grew up in Harlem [New York, New York] on 114th Street and I watched her growth and her become who she is, I mean just a phenomena.  I also worked again with Vertamae Grosvenor [Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor] on another book called 'Thursdays and Every Other Sunday Off,' but that had been acquired and published while I was in California but I became her inherited editor.  I worked with Chester Higgins [HistoryMaker Chester Higgins, Jr.] on his first books, this is jumping forward, I think, into the late '70s [1970s], early the, yeah, the mid to late '70s [1970s], Chester Higgins with his first books and now he's done many and he's been with The New York Times forever but I remember doing a book on his photographs of black men called 'Drums of Life' ['Drums of Life: A Photographic Essay on the Black Man in America,' Chester Higgins, Jr. and Orde M. Coombs] which is an incredible book that, I guess, you could find it in used books online.  I also worked with Peter Simon and Stephen Davis on the first book on reggae, 'Reggae Bloodlines' ['Reggae Bloodlines: In Search Of The Music And Culture Of Jamaica'], and that's still in print as well.  Norma Jean [HistoryMaker Norma Jean Darden] and Carol Darden's [Carole Darden-Lloyd] 'Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine' ['Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine: Recipes and Reminiscences of a Family'] which is now in its thirtieth, the twenty-seventh, or twenty-eighth year in print.  And their book led to the catering company.  It has led to two restaurants, you know, here in Harlem.  And also an off, off Broadway play that was based on the book being published.  And then there were other books, many books that dealt with social issues.  There was 'Elders in Rebellion' ['Elders in Rebellion: A Guide to Senior Activism,' Lou Cottin], dealing with, you know, aging issues.  There were, there was a book called 'Burnout' ['Burnout: The High Cost of High Achievement,' Herbert J. Freudenberger] which was just featured on the cover of New York Magazine, the whole idea of burnout which acknowledged Dr. Freudenberger's [Herbert J. Freudenberger], you know, book and him coining the term burnout.  I, I couldn't believe it, it was about two months ago and I just said, my goodness, that was my book.  And then 'Coping with Difficult People' [Robert M. Bramson] which is another book.  I did a, a book on African American women writers with Mari Evans, called 'Black Women Writers' ['Black Women Writers (1950-1980): A Critical Evaluation'].  I did several books with Mary Helen Washington which were anthologies of African American women's writing, 'Midnight Birds' ['Black-Eyed Susans and Midnight Birds: Stories by and about Black Women,' Mary Helen Washington], you know.  And I can't remember the title of the others but there have been many, many books that I worked on as an editor and that I brought into print.
Story_ID: 361590
Speaker 1: What is it like as an editor to look at the, the different works that come before you?  Tell me the process--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how, what's the process for editing?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's changed slightly but when I was an editor my early days of editing had to do with reading about certain, you know, the work of certain people who you felt could be, you know, an author of a book and coming up with an idea that you and they could, you know, develop together or they would have an idea for a book; scholars, academics, artists, creative people, writers, and they somehow, we would find each other and they would make a presentation in the form of a proposal.  This is for nonfiction.  And they would make a presentation in the form, in the form of a proposal that I could then review and if I felt that it was in the proper form and good enough to share with my colleagues we would distribute it, have a discussion, a departmental discussion.  And it was my job to make the case for that book and to identify the audience, of course, and we weren't just doing it for our own gratification but we had to come up with the fact that there are going to be these readers and people who really want to read about whatever the subject is.  And then generally, the editorial director would take your book and your case to what was then called a pub board, a publishing board, where you would have the editor-in-chief, sometimes the publisher, marketing, sales, advertising, subsidiaries rights people, all sitting around the table and the editorial director would have to make the case and they would determine how much money they were gonna pay for the book and whether or not the book went through.  Often, books never made it through either one of these processes or sometimes they would make it through the editorial process and the publishing board would say, no, they didn't get it.
Story_ID: 361591
Speaker 1: And if you really believed in the book, for example, the reggae book ['Reggae Bloodlines: In Search Of The Music And Culture Of Jamaica,' Peter Simon and Stephen Davis] and another book I did on Rastafarianism, I mean, I would have to make a case and go directly to the publisher.  And I remember the publisher telling me once, "I hope you have a big garage, Marie [HistoryMaker Marie Brown], because you're gonna have so many books that you're gonna have to store because this'll never sell."  Interestingly enough, both of these books stayed in print, earned out their small advances, you know, just, so that was a vote of confidence for me, you know, or the case that I had made for the book even though they had not heard about interest in reggae or in, and you have to understand this was thirty years ago when the audience for reggae here was primarily young white college students.  So one of my bosses at the time was the head of our department [at Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York], Pike Johnson, and I said, "Pike, just call your sons," he had twin sons at the University of Colorado.  And he was so happy he had called them because they said they, he came back he said, "My sons really thought I was really in the know, (laughter) you know, that I knew what was going on when I asked them about reggae, they said, 'Oh, yeah,'" so that's how that happened.  But it is all determined by how well the author makes the case and the proposal, how well the editor can carry it forward, how convincing the editorial director can make it, and that's just the beginning.  And then they say, yes, and then it's up to the author to write the book, to produce the book, that you promised to write, based on a proposal.  And to then once it's published to market and promote it, you know.  Publishing has changed in that almost every book now is based on whether or not that author has a platform, that's the new word, the new buzz word, the author must have a platform.  Prior to this era, books made the platform for the author.  I mean, you'd publish a book and then your recognition would come based on the book.  But now for example, if you just take cookbooks, the, you know, you take, 'Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine' ['Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine: Recipes and Reminiscences of a Family,' Norma Jean Darden and Carol Darden-Lloyd] and you take 'Vibration Cooking' ['Vibration Cooking: Or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl,' Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor], these books were written and then they created that opportunity for the authors.  Now you have to have a platform.  You have to be on The Food Channel or you have to be a restaurateur, you know, or a celebrity chef in order to get a book.  It's not that way where the opportunity comes from your production of the book.  So, you know, that's a different kind of thing.  Or you're a celebrity and because you have a platform and you're Jamie Foxx or you're, you know, Fergie or whoever, you get a book deal, you know.  Still, you know, there are some people who are not household names who get book deals but it's more and more difficult.
Story_ID: 361592
Speaker 1: During the time that you were at Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York], I'm just stepping back a few--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --cause I, I just thought of something.  Well, I, I, I don't know, I guess, this is the question but Jackie Onassis [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] worked at Doubleday, didn't she?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was she there while you were there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes, she was.  I'm smiling because this is really a funny story.  There's a lot to Jackie Onassis having been there.  But when I was an editor, she came to Doubleday.  And I remember clearly, looking up from my desk and seeing Jackie Onassis standing at the door with someone who was taking her around to introduce her to editors and people in other departments.  And it's just, it, it was just amazing, just to see her standing there.  But I stood up to go and greet her and my pocketbook was (laughter) on the floor right by my desk which I hadn't seen and I go (making sounds) (laughter) all over, what a grand introduction.  I said oops, at least I didn't fall on the floor.  But there, I remember that, you know, tripping, I said okay, hi, and she says, "Hi, I'm Jackie Onassis," and I said, "I know, (laughter) you know, it was so great to meet you."  And then, you know, and we talked on a couple occasions about book projects.  And then I left to become an agent and I had sent her a project on [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, Miss Dunham's memoir and she called me to talk about it, you know, and I just really could not still believe that she was on the telephone because this was before I moved into the whole house which was another story but my office used to be right there in that little small space there and I can see myself picking up the phone, "Hi, this is Jackie Onassis," and I'm just like, I don't believe this, you know.  And she called to tell me why she couldn't acquire the book, you know, because she's really couldn't convince the powers that be at Doubleday.  But she told me that she remembered seeing Miss Dunham dance in Paris [France] when she was there and how important she was to her cultural development in experiencing, you know, Katherine Dunham's dance.  And then she also called me about Vertamae Grosvenor [Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor] because she really wanted Verta to do this book on her life when she married Bobby Grosvenor [Robert Grosvenor], because the Grosvenors and the Auchinclosses, had been neighbors up in Hyannis Port [Massachusetts] or where ever up on the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts], where ever they were raised (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: And she knew Bobby Grosvenor when he was a young man and she knew all the family and all of that but then when Verta married into the Grosvenor family, because he's with the Grosvenors of the National Geographic and all of that, that was just another whole experience for, you know, this family and all of that.  And she would say, "Well, I just don't know why she doesn't wanna write this," I mean, she wanted to write it but she could never get around to writing it so, you know, we had several conversations.  And then she was a great supporter of the Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center [New York, New York] which is still in existence.  Budd, Budd Schulberg was one of the founders along with Fred Hudson of the Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center which is a, an organization that supports black arts and artists, you know, in New York [New York] through workshops, seminars, and productions.  And I remember Budd saying well, we have to get together and have lunch with Jackie.  And so he and Fred and I went to lunch with her and it was just a great experience and I, it was a rainy day just like this and we had lunch on a, somewhere in the 50s between Madison [Avenue] and Park [Avenue].  And then, you know, she said, okay.  And then she just said, "I'm going, now, I'm going, I'm just gone take a half day with work and just jump on the bus and go home."  And she, I said I could imagine those people on the (laughter) Madison Avenue bus seeing her get on the bus, you know.  But, you know, she was just that way.  She was just, you know, very accessible.  And she, people would ask me, "Did she come to work?"  I said, yeah.  She, you know, she does, you know.  She was serious about her editing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and about her job.
Story_ID: 361593
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you stayed at Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York] until 1981?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: Oh, well Doubleday was undergoing some changes but, you know, we could feel it but we didn't really know exactly what was going on and so many editors were leaving because they were just feeling something and they were getting offers from other publishing houses and I wasn't getting any offers from anybody so I was still there.  And then we had had a department of maybe about eight to ten editors and then it was down to maybe two.  So there was a young man, Jonathan Blount, who was starting a magazine, he had been one of the founders of Essence but he had always had this thing about starting another magazine.  And so he had really convinced me that I should be the editor-in-chief of this magazine and help him to write up, you know, the whole proposal and development for funding for this magazine.  And because everybody else was leaving Doubleday I just said this is an opportunity, maybe I should, you know, respond to it.  But I really didn't wanna leave book publishing and I thought that maybe if I told them that, you know, I was going to leave they would say don't leave but they didn't, they said, "We wish you luck."  And so there I was in the book publishing, I mean, in the magazine publishing business and I worked at this start-up magazine through three issues and it folded.  It folded because it did not, not because it did not have advertisement or circulation, it had excellent advertising and circulation for a start-up but because the management really was not behind it, you know.  And that was OAO [OAO Corporation], it's a corporation in Washington, D.C. but the head of that corporation wanted to make the magazine and, you know, a central part of this corporation and the other powers that be did not want that to happen and so they shut us down.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the magazine?
Speaker 2: Elan, E-L-A-N.
Speaker 1: And you said Jonathan Blunt?
Speaker 2: Blount.
Speaker 1: Blount.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And spell that for me?
Speaker 2: B-L-O-U-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And at that time he was the publisher and the backer was Cecile Barker at the OA, OAO Corporation.
Story_ID: 361594
Speaker 1: What happened now?
Speaker 2: So I--
Speaker 1: Were you disappointed?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah because this was really something.  Kenneth Brown was the art director, [HistoryMaker] Marie Brown was the editor-in-chief [of Elan] that meant we had no income, it was like shut down overnight, May 5, 1980, what year was it?  Eighty-two [1982], um-hm.  And so that was it, you know, and I was devastated because I had never not been employed.  I mean, I didn't even know what unemployment was about, that was something that happened to other people, you know.  Either you stayed in the school system and you got a gold watch or you did whatever but you just never got fired, I mean.  So it was really hard, I took to the bed, I just could not, I could not deal.  And then I finally got up and realized in May, I said this is a great time to be unemployed in New York [New York], you know, you can go out, you can do these things, I had gotten unemployment, I could do freelance, you know, so I got my head together and I was doing a lot of freelance work, editorial, and just sort of breathing.
Story_ID: 361595
Speaker 1: And I wandered into a bookstore on Columbus Avenue and asked them were they hiring anybody, this was around October or whatever, November, and they said no.  And then they called me in December and said, "Oh, yeah, we need you to work for Christmas," and I said great.  It was the Endicott Booksellers [New York, New York], beautiful bookstore on Columbus Avenue, right behind the Museum of Natural History [American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Endicott, E-N-D-I-C-O-T-T.  And Encarnita Quinlan was the owner, E-N-C-A-R-N-I-T-A, Quinlan.  And Susan Bergholz was the manager, B-E-R-G-H-O-L-Z.  So they hired me for the Christmas holidays to work and it was the hardest thing that I had ever done because, you know, you think you love books and you're in a store and people are asking for all kinds of titles that you've never heard of, you think you know a lot and I said wow, this is something.  So when the holidays ended, they said, "Well, we would like for you to continue working here but you have to commit to a year."  And I was so glad because it gave me some place to be.  So I said, "Okay, I will work for a year."  Well, I worked there for two years.  And that was wonderful because I became assistant manager and assistant buyer.  I could feel comfortable again in the world of books because I really knew what was going on because I was immersed in the store, you know, on the ground, in book selling.  And at that point people started calling me, editors, one editor and said, "You should be an agent," and I said, "No, unh-uh.  I do not wanna be an agent, I would like to be an editor."  And in the meantime I had gone on a few job interviews to be an editor but I'm sorry to say the people were acting as if I could not read, I mean, these, this was another time, this was not the '60s [1960s], these, this was the '80s [1980s] and people were really giving me a hard time and acting as if, you know, none of the books that I had produced had been produced by a major publishing house, Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York].  Called me back for three, four, five, six interviews and then never responding.
Story_ID: 363193
Speaker 1: It's 1983, I guess, I think--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --we're in '83 [1983] 'cause you, you stayed there until '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At the Endicott Booksellers [New York, New York] and you're having a hard time getting a job as an editor.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me about Endicott.  How do you, you stay there for another year and then what happens?
Speaker 2: I stayed at Endicott for a year, I was, and I became assistant buyer and assistant manager.  And one of my young mentees, Gerald Gladly [ph.] who was an editor at Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York], called me and asked me if I would consider agenting one of the authors that he was taking on and that author was Randy Taraborrelli [J. Randy Taraborrelli], who has now since become, you know, a mega writer of celebrity bios.  And Randy at the time was, I think, the president of the Diana Ross Fan Club or something like that.  He was very young then and he was, so he wanted to do a Diana Ross fan book ['Diana: A Celebration of the Life and Career of Diana Ross,' J. Randy Taraborrelli] and Gerald wanted to publish that.  And he also later did a book on the history of Motown ['Motown: Hot Wax, City Cool and Solid Gold,' J. Randy Taraborrelli].  So he needed an agent because this was in a period where now the publishers were really requiring most of the books that they acquired to be agented because so many manuscripts were being submitted because technology had changed the picture with the copying machines people could make many copies (laughter) of their manuscripts and send them to many publishers and there was a lot more submission of manuscripts happening than publishers could really handle so they found that okay, we can require that there be agents to represent these writers so at least they'll be some kind of, you know, filtering process.  So I told Gerald, "Oh, well, okay," reluctantly, I will agent, you know, these manuscripts.  And so I took on Randy for the first two or three, two projects.  And then he wanted to switch over and write more critical kinds of books, well, where, you know, he could really get into their lives, he was no longer the fan, he was gonna really go into, you know, all of the other aspects of their lives, not just the good but the bad and the ugly.  And so I felt like I couldn't represent those kinds of books, I don't know where my head was then but that was where it was and so.  But eventually I started acquiring other clients because as I mentioned, you know, the publishers were requiring people to have agents so people were sending me manuscripts and I started out, you know, just representing a very few authors but I was able to do this because I had worked at Doubleday and one of the reasons that one can agent somewhat successfully is that you have editorial contacts in other houses.  And by this time there had been, you know, a lot of turnover in publishing so I knew at least one person in every publishing house 'cause I had worked with them when they were editors at Doubleday, so I was able to at least have someone to submit to.  And then from those people you find out others and when they move around, so that's how my business got started, you know, I would submit to the editors I knew and then subsequently meet other editors or those editors would acquire some of the authors that I was representing.  And I was able to sustain myself through, you know, those tough times also doing freelance editorial work, putting together a newsletter for the National Minority Supplier Development Council which I did right here on this place, we did newsletters, we packaged books, I did books, you know, how to books on how to raise your pet, how to raise your dog, how to raise your cat, how to, you know, enter the stock market, whatever was necessary, I mean, I did it as it was, as it related to, you know, packaging and producing or selling books.  And those were the early days of Marie Brown Associates [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 363194
Speaker 1: So how has it progressed?  I mean, it's so many years now, how many years have you been an agent (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty-three years.
Speaker 1: Twenty-three years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, it's an interesting business because I came into it in the '80s [1980s] and that was sort of a, not such a highly receptive period for African American authors.  The '60s [1960s] had been high, the, up to the mid-'70s [1970s], and then the market for African American books had sort of diminished, the market in publishing houses had diminished, or the interest had diminished from the mid-'70s [1970s] up through almost the '80s [1980s].  So here I was in this business at a time when it was not, you know, a strong publishing marketplace for authors that I was representing, although I represent all authors, you know, but at this time predominantly and always predominantly African American.  But I just continued to make the case and I was very lucky to have relationships with editors who would, you know, see the value and understand the value of the authors that I was representing.  So through this period I did a lot of children's books.  And I love books for young readers.  I love children's books.  And I represented at one time, Eloise Greenfield.  And then I also represented an illustrator Jan Gilchrist [Jan Spivey Gilchrist] who she worked with a lot.  I represented Tom Feelings who, his work is just incredible, Carole Byard, and Fatima Shaik, and Denizala Tour [ph.], these are all children.  And then, of course, Faith Ringgold.  And Faith's books, the first book that we did together was 'Tar Beach' [Faith Ringgold] and I think she's done now fourteen books since then.  And that's just been an incredible, wonderful experience.  And I also represented Tonya Bolden [HistoryMaker Tonya W. Bolden] who now has done, you know, I'm sure, twenty books by now.  And Tonya has become very prolific in the area of children's books.  So that, [HistoryMaker] Vy Higginsen who, you know, was a radio personality (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Personality.
Speaker 2: --but 'Mama, I Wanna Sing' ['Mama, I Want to Sing,' Tonya W. Bolden and Vy Higginsen] I did the tie in with that book and other, 'This Far by Faith' [ph.] which is a collection of African American gospel music for children with art.  And so there have been these children's books and in the meantime I've worked with a number of first novelists.  And Colin Channer whose book 'Waiting in Vain' has sold exceptionally well and he has, you know, a collection of short stories, 'Passing Through' [Colin Channer] and the second novel, 'Satisfy My Soul' [Colin Channer].  Another book to come 'Lover's Rock' ['Lover's Rock: A Novel,' Colin Channer] which is a continuation of 'Waiting in Vain.'  And then Randall Robinson who was the founder of TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] and I worked with Randall from his first, very first book which was an autobiographical short work, political commentary 'Defending the Spirit' ['Defending the Spirit: A Black Life in America,' Randall Robinson], then 'The Debt' ['The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks,' Randall Robinson] which became really a bestseller dealing with reparations, and 'The Reckoning' ['The Reckoning: What Blacks Owe to Each Other,' Randall Robinson] which was a book that talked about the prison industrial complex, and 'Quitting America' ['Quitting America: The Departure of a Black Man from His Native Land,' Randall Robinson] when he decided to move to St. Kitts [St. Kitts and Nevis] and leave America.  Now he has two other books forthcoming, one on Haiti and President Aristide [Jean-Bertrand Aristide] and how he was kidnapped and taken away from this country, from his country, and another one that'll be coming next year, that he has yet to start working on.  And Carl Weber who is a bestselling author who is now working on his eighth novel but I began with the first one which was 'Lookin' For Luv'.  And Carl's out on his seventh tour right now--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --for his seventh book, you know.  And Bakari Kitwana who has found his place.  He, the first book that he did was 'Hip Hop Generation' ['The Hip-Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in African American Culture,' Bakari Kitwana] an analysis of the impact of hip, hip hop on the economy.  And then the second book was called 'Why White Kids Love Hip Hop' ['Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America,' Bakari Kitwana] and that's being taught in a lot of colleges, and universities.  A lawyer Wallace Ford who worked in David Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] administration who really his alter ego is a novelist of popular fiction (laughter) so he has done two books, 'The Pride' [Wallace Ford], and 'What You Sow' [Wallace Ford] which are two books that take place on black Wall Street and their characters are Wall Street investment bankers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --and so on and it's all of that.  So it just goes on.
Story_ID: 363195
Speaker 1: You know, I do fewer books now than before because the industry has changed, they're more interested in hip hop and street books and whatever but I'm still in there trying to fight the good fight to get, you know, more substantive works out there and that's what I do.
Speaker 2: How, how do people find you?  I mean, do they, do they just do a proposal to you, pitch you, how do you get your clients?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Or how do you choose them?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they can now find me because I'm just out there, (laughter) you know.  And, you know, if you go downstairs to my office you'll see, you know, it'll just be overwhelming, just manuscripts everywhere, with the Internet queries everywhere.  You know, I'm in directories.  I know that every time that I speak to the public or go to a workshop that's gonna result in more submissions to me.  But I'm committed to representing as the kids say (laughter), you know, so I'm not gonna hide from the people, it's just that I am disappointed to a great extent in the publishing industry now because they will not, you know, approve or see the market for quality publications, whether it's popular fiction, I'm not talking about just literature, I'm talking about quality writing or books on subjects other than celebrity bios, you know, or some kind of dysfunctional or pathological story which really those dominate the stories that, you know, we see being published and there are people out there writing all kinds of good things.  So they find me, I mean, you know, they just come.  I don't try to advertise nor look--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --for anybody because there's just such a strong body of talent out there that really deserves to be published and we're finding it more and more difficult these days, I mean, because the market is being skewed in another direction just like the music has, theater has, you know, not to take anything away from the people who are writing, you know, nor, you know, the people who are out there doing the bus and truck shows or any of, you know, the sitcoms on television where you raise your eye and say okay, you know, or the films that you don't find uplifting or, you know, see us in very denigrating kinds of situations.  But there needs to be some balance somewhere so that's the only reason I stay in this business (laughter) is to just continue to fight that fight (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And balance.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 363196
Speaker 1: I know you have quite a, a, a few friends and some have just been in your life for a very long time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --do you wanna talk about them?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I have friends that go back to high school.  Shirley Poole is one who comes to mind.  She is now the executive director of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women.  And Shirley has been my friend since we were seventeen and actually Shirley taught me how to dance (laughter) really, because Shirley was the best dancer when we went to Ogontz [Pennsylvania State University, Ogontz; Pennsylvania State University, Abington, Abington, Pennsylvania], you know.  And Shirley and her children and my daughter [Laini Brown] and grandkids, I mean, we are, I guess, you could say extended family, you know.  And so she's really very close.  And then there's Hazel Sodder [ph.] who was my roommate in college.  And Hazel and I remain really close friends.  Hazel is Patti LaBelle's first cousin.  But Hazel retired from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] school system and she travels a lot these days, and I said, see I could be doing that if I hadn't gone off on this route, you know.  And then they're all originally Philadelphians, or around Philadelphia.  And then there is Ed Bradley who was my really closest, best friend, we moved to New York [New York] together in 1967.  And he went to work for News Radio 88 [WCBS Radio, New York, New York], and I went to work for Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company, New York, New York] as that trainee I described earlier.  And so we remained friends up until the day he died which was November 9th of 2006.  And sort of experienced this whole, you know, from both of us being affirmative action hires through this and we'd go to dinner and lunch and talk regularly and I'd say, "Edward, can you believe that, you know, this is the twenty-fifth year we've been in New York, and then the thirtieth, and the thirty-fifth," and then this past year, we had gone out to dinner in the summer and August 1st was when, you know, I came to New York and he came shortly after that from Philly, he said, "You didn't bring up what (laughter) that this was the thirty-ninth year," I said I forgot, I said, "Can you believe, I must be getting old, I can't remember that."  So, you know, he, he's been in my life a long time.  Of course, Hap, I mentioned earlier Leslie Warren Beasley from Nashville [Tennessee] from the fourth grade that's when we met, you know, and he's still my friend.  I have, you know, the people from the '60s [1960s] that, you know, we met together in New York.  The extended family has meant a lot to us and to my children, my child, and my grandchildren and to, we've meant a lot to each other.  I mean, collectively Dolores Reade [Dolores Hope] who lives in New York.  Linda Tarrant-Reid who was my first assistant ever at Doubleday.  She graduated from Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and was a friend of my brother's who attended Hampton and so I met her when they were students and then when she came to New York she wanted a job and I was just becoming an editor for the second time around so she became, and she's stayed in communication, she's an author now. And so, you know.
Speaker 1: What about, and, and your husband unfortunately passed away.  When did he pass away?
Speaker 2: Kenneth [Kenneth Brown] passed away in 2004.  He had a heart attack so it wasn't anticipated.  The children had just visited him and they were on their way back to Nashville because that's where my daughter [Laini Brown] and grandkids live in Nashville.  And that next day, August 15th, I think, or 16th, he had, he died, um-hm.
Story_ID: 363197
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, what is the one thing that stands out to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that even though that's a very difficult question 'cause there have been so many moments, but I think that what stands out is what basically is responsible for me being here and that's my love of books and literature and that I received at a very young age because there were always books in our home, always papers, that was stressed, and there were magazines, you know, positive images of African American people whether it was Ebony or whether it was through networks, you know, just hearing the message, not having it beaten over my head but seeing it lived by example which was one way that I always felt that, you know, even though segregation did enforce certain unequal opportunities there was a community that was more focused and there was more focus on positive role models and you could really have a vision of what your life could be, I mean, not being a literary agent but just being somebody or something, you know.  And not necessarily celebrity in that vein but just having positive role models.  So that, you know, the opportunity to be in that realm of educators and people who have taken education and have a strong work ethic that has been, you know, probably the most influential thing for me.
Story_ID: 363198
Speaker 1: What would your message be to the future generation?
Speaker 2: That's also very clear, you know.  Looking back I know that it is important to take advantage of every moment that you have to make some step forward.  This is not to say that one does not have fun 'cause I've had a lot of fun (laughter) and I have traveled extensively but to find something in your life about which you could be passionate and to really, you know, pursue that passion.  For me it has been books and I think that for everyone information in whatever form that it comes.  I know that information is changing in format now so it's available electronically, you know, as a, you know, in addition to in print but I think that we cannot really, you know, stress enough the importance of being informed and of taking advantage of that information.  I mean, it may look like those people who are hip hop moguls, all the people who are, you know, clothing manufacturers or the people who are celebrities, you know, get it easily because of the way that they--because of luck or because they're in those positions but they work, they work really hard, they are really informed, they read, you know.  You just don't see them reading, you see them entertaining, you see them, you know, you hear about the money they spend or you look at, you know, 'MTV Cribs' or whatever it is that one looks at and it is a process.  I mean, if you read closely those entrepreneurial stories in Black Enterprise or in Essence or in Fortune Magazine or Inc. [Inc. Magazine], or where ever, it's a process, it is a process.  Every now and then we see somebody really hit it and make it, you know, at twenty-two or twenty-five but the real long distance runners are the people who really say, stay steady.
Story_ID: 363199
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who loved literature and who loved her people, you know, and who was committed to both her people, literature, people, encompassing family, extended family, people I don't know, cultural ancestors, you know, that's, I think that that probably would be the legacy that I would want to leave, you know, to have that emotional relationship with people, good, bad, or indifferent, whatever they're--not to judge them but to know that, you know, there is something that is very special about the human condition, the human person, the human being I should say, and to acknowledge that and to do whatever it is to, you know, enhance that, you know, experience.
Story_ID: 363200
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd like to talk about that we have not talked about?
Speaker 2: I think that basically we have covered everything.  I mean, I would just like to see people devote a little more time to informing themselves, you know, to be more serious about the opportunities that they have, to waste less time, you know, buying into other people's celebrity or, you know, spending time pacifying themselves with television or, you know, other forms of entertainment and not really actively working toward, you know, improving their lives and anybody else's, even if it's just one person, you know.  And not to give up, you know, on themselves first of all or on the process.  Because I see too much of that happening where people just shrug their shoulders and say well, you know, I'm only one person, I can't do anything.  Well, I was only one person, but, you know, I get excited about all of the books and authors, even when people, you know, respond negatively because I've talked about all of the disappointment and all of those factors but I don't have to talk about it because everybody goes through that but the important thing is to just, you know, transcend those experiences and to keep going, you know.  You can't give up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, if there is nothing else, I'd like to thank you very much for taking the time because I know your time is very valuable, and we really do appreciate you taking the time to tell your story so that the future generations will know about the hard work and the struggles to get to the point where you are today.  And the appreciation that they can appreciate what you have done in the literary world.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thank you very much.
