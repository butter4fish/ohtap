Speaker 1: Uriele?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Uriele.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: Well, yes there is a story behind that name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got it from my father.  My father, you know, in the South, a lot of times African American men had initials for names, you know, U.L., W.D., W.L.; well, my, my father took the name Uriele Lebanon.  And when I, I came along, he wanted to name me Uriele Lebanon Boze, Jr. and my mother [Iva Stewart Boze] said--
Speaker 1: How do, how do you spell Lebanon?
Speaker 2: L-E-B-A-N-O-N.  He wanted to name me after him, Junior and my mother said, "You're not going to stick my son with that, that, that name."  So they compromised, so I ended up with Uriele and the middle name Lawrence Boze, so that's how I get--got that name.
Speaker 1: That's, that's something.  But Uriele Lebanon, is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: He took--
Speaker 1: I mean, that's--
Speaker 2: Well, because his--he had initials.  He was U.L. and so he took the name Uriele Lebanon.
Speaker 1: So he named himself then?
Speaker 2: Named himself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he--did, did he as a--did he make it up or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know where--
Speaker 1: --did he get it from someplace or--
Speaker 2: I--he just got it from somewhere, but I have--I don't know the origin of it but, you know, he's--his, his name was U.L.
Speaker 1: It sounds somewhat biblical, but I don't know, you know, just--
Speaker 2: I don't either, but the strange thing about it, even though he took the name Uriele Lebanon, people still continued to call him U.L.
Speaker 1: There you go.  All right.  So--but you go by the name of U. Lawrence--
Speaker 2: Lawrence Boze.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born around 1926, at the--in April, I think it was April the 11th, 1926 [sic. April 9, 1922].  She was born here in Houston, Texas [sic. Louisiana] and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --her parents were Harrison [Stewart] and Lydia Stewart, and this is out of Fifth Ward of Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The famous Fifth Ward of Houston; everybody knows--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the Fifth Ward.
Speaker 2: And my grandparents was--were famous also.  They owned the, the only African American business right down from Phillis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas], it was Stewart's Grocery [ph.].  It was--and they were the entrep--entrepreneurs of the, of the, of the area of Fifth Ward, so most people went through Fifth Ward went through Wheatley, they came through my, my grandparents' store.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: On the corner of Market [Street] and Schweikhardt [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they had the only black business over there?
Speaker 2: In that area--
Speaker 1: In that area.
Speaker 2: --yes, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: In the Fifth Ward, yeah, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody thought we were rich.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, how far back can you trace your ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: All the way back to Haiti because my grand--my grandmother was originally a Placide, P-L-A-C-I-D-E.  We had a family reunion in the Placides out of New Iberia, Louisiana.  Actually, moved from Haiti to Miami [Florida] and the story is told that one of the brothers had an altercation with a, with a Caucasian man and they had to move from Miami, they moved to Louisiana and to move to New Iberia.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that name again, the Placide?
Speaker 2: P-L-A-C-I-D-E.
Speaker 1: P-L--oh, C-I-D-E.  Oh, Placide.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Placide, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which means peace doesn't it?  Or peaceful or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Peace, yeah.  Placide.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there was a famous Cuban poet of the 19th century named Placido [Gabriel de la Concepcion Valdes] who was a, you know, he was a revolutionary poet, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in, in Cuba, you know, in those days.
Speaker 2: Well, there was seven brothers that they all moved to New Iberia.  Our family actually started migrating around from Lake Charles [Louisiana] and Westlake [Louisiana] and Crowley, Louisiana and eventually my, my grandparents moved to, to Houston and started the store.  In fact, my grandfather, in addition to having a store worked at Hughes [Tools Company, Houston, Texas] too, for thirty-five years, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the, the family moved to New Iberia, Louisiana so--
Speaker 2: Well, my grand--my grandmother did.
Speaker 1: --there was a--yeah, so there was a generation--
Speaker 2: And then she met my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So she was born and raised there and then--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then when she was married to your grandfather--
Speaker 2: They moved to Houston.
Speaker 1: --they moved to Houston?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's something.  So, any stories passed down about Haiti that they tell?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the one I just told you about, about them getting in trouble with it and they moved--
Speaker 1: In Miami?
Speaker 2: In Miami--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --having to move and, and it's ironic our, our--the things eerie about it, I looked at some of the pictures of some of the brothers and we have strong family genes, because a lot of the men in the family look strikingly resemblant to those with--the, the brothers that moved, so--but the family's pretty big.  I'm related to the Caesars.  I'm actually related to the Jacquet family, you know, the jazz--
Speaker 1: Illinois Jacquet.
Speaker 2: Illinois Jacquet, yeah, he's one of my relatives; yes, he is.
Speaker 1: So you're related to Caesars and the--
Speaker 2: The Caesars and the Jacquets, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Jacquets?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any famous Caesars?  'Cause I know there's, there's an actor named Adolph Caesar--
Speaker 2: Well, a couple played football--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but other than that, no, I don't know too much about the Caesars.
Story_ID: 251687
Speaker 1: Is there a story about the family--why the family moved from Haiti to, to Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 2: I guess they just migrated.  I mean, I really--when we had a family reunion, the one and only we had, they just said they moved to, to, to get a better life to move to, you know, to move from, from Haiti to, to Miami and they just migrated there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother [Iva Stewart Boze] was born in 1926 [sic. 1922]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which would probably mean that maybe your family made the migration around 1900, around the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was sometime out in there.  Like I said, I, I will stand to be corrected a couple years on my mother.  My mother died in, in, in 1966 [sic. 1965], at the age of forty-two, so you take it back farther to from '66 [1966], that's '24, 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-four [1924].
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when she was born.
Speaker 1: --you think it's probably a good guess that the family came from Haiti around the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's probably right.
Speaker 1: Probably, yeah.
Speaker 2: That is--that's a--
Speaker 1: Shortly afterwards maybe.
Speaker 2: Shortly after, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 251688
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Iva Stewart Boze] grow up in--what was her personality like and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was a very strong independent African American woman.  She grew up--she had one brother, Thomas Stewart.  She graduated from Phillis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas].  She graduated with some pretty famous people, Charles Brown, who went on--who had made up a song 'Merry Christmas, Baby' and Arnett Cobb, the jazz saxophonist.  My mother was a musician.  She went to Prairie View [State Normal & Industrial College; Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University, Prairie View, Texas] and graduated from Prairie View with honest honors, and she went onto The University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].  And I have pictures of when she was at University of Iowa working on her graduate degree in, in, in music and that was in 19--oh, my goodness, '41, [1941], '42 [1942], and she graduated there with, with, with highest honors.  And she grew up, you know, as I said, she had a very nurturing grandmother [Lydia Placide Stewart] and grandfather [sic. father, Harrison Stewart]--parents, rather.  And the store was very successful, you know, because my grandparents did make a lot of money at the store, and they were able to give her a very good education and so she went out and started teaching music.  She taught at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] and I'm kind of getting ahead of myself, but that, you know, that's what she first did.
Story_ID: 251689
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Iva Stewart Boze and Uriele Boze] met that you know?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  My, my father, he was born in Groveton, Texas and his father [Calvin Boze, Sr.] was a traveling preacher.  And my, my father was very secretive.  I, I have learned to only recently he had about ten brothers and sisters; he never really talked about them.  He, he grew up with his, his brother was Calvin Boze, was the one who was closest to him and they got separated.  My father went to Mary Allen [Junior] College [Crockett, Texas], which was a small college in the Crockett [Texas]/Groveton area, and he moved to Houston [Texas] and he met my mother in the store, believe it or not.  He came in the store and met my mother and that's how they, they became acquainted.  And at the time, I believe he was working as a Pullman porter, my father was.  And, of course, my--as I said, my Uncle Calvin, who was also a musician, was living with another family, the, the Archias [ph.] and he later, you know, said he later became and got his own band and they moved to California.  And we were supposed to move also, but my mother said she didn't want to leave her parents [Lydia Stewart and Harrison Stewart], so instead, we stayed here.  When they married, we moved to Pleasantville [Houston, Texas] which, at the time, was a--one of the high--one of the most influential African American superb communities, and I lived right across the street from Judson Robinson's--the Judson [Wilbur] Robinson, Sr. family and that's, that's where I grew up for, for a time being.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Pleasantville, Texas?
Speaker 2: Pleasantville.  Pleasantville, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, is there any stories about your father's family, the, the Bozes that goes back to the 19th century or anything like that, that they--
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, the--I've, I've tried to look up his--my father's family history is a little less sketchy.  I know, as I said, his, his, his father was a traveling preacher who never spent a lot of time around them that much, but his mother was Mary [ph.], and he had ten brothers and sisters.  And I know a couple of his brothers now, but that's only recently, and--but notwithstanding, they, they--understand they moved--migrated from Louisiana as well from, from the same area, from the New Iberia [Louisiana] area.  They come from, from the--from Louisiana and moved to Crockett to Groveton area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a history of musicians, other than your uncle in the--in that--
Speaker 2: My uncle.  Well, my mother.  My mother was a piano--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I know.  I mean, I'm talking about your father's side.
Speaker 2: Oh, my father's?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: On my father's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My father himself, he, he was a, he was a singer, he was a musician as well himself; yes, he was.  He wasn't as famous as my uncle, but he was, he was a, he was a good singer.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Good.  Yeah.  All right.  So tell me about--now--oh, what did your father do for a living?  Was he a Pullman porter full-time?
Speaker 2: He was a Pullman porter at first, and then what he did, he, he took the--he studied and he passed the securities, securities dealers test and he became the first African American securities dealer in the State of Texas.
Speaker 1: Well that's quite a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: --move, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he founded the, the first African American bank in his town right down the street.  It was called Riverside National Bank [Houston, Texas].  My father founded, founded that bank.  It was his idea and he created it.
Speaker 1: Founded Brimside?
Speaker 2: No, Riverside.
Speaker 1: Riverside.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Riverside National Bank.
Speaker 1: Riverside--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --National Bank.
Speaker 2: Right.  Which is now Unity Bank.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it did--it didn't close?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't close.
Speaker 1: So when, when did he found the bank?
Speaker 2: It was in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he founded it in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know a lot of black banks that started in early '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --early '70s [1970s] are now closed, they got gobbled up by other banks or something.
Speaker 2: Well, it, it actually merged, but my father was, was no longer involved with the bank.  But the bank was created, it was his idea, he got the people together.  He, he, he issued the stock and he got, he got all the paperwork together and I'm, and I'm very proud of him and they've honored him because of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is something to be very proud, proud of.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then when he left that business, he went into the hotel concession end business and actually became quite successful doing that.  He had con--made the contracts with just about every hotel in, in this city and he'd provide, of course--he had a couple of parking, parking lots and he had provided for hatcheck rooms and he had about ten contracts with amazing hotels.  So he was doing quite well for himself, he did.
Story_ID: 251690
Speaker 1: Tell us about growing up; do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory, believe it or not, is--a lot of people think that I'm, I'm kind of crazy, I remember nothing.  I just remember darkness, then I remember the next view was on my father's [Uriele Boze] shoulder, okay?  And then just snippets from then on--
Story_ID: 251691
Speaker 1: I remember growing up with--my mother [Iva Stewart Boze] and father [Uriele Boze] divorced in 1958, and we moved to--first we moved to California, then we moved--'cause my mother was working on her Ph.D. at the University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California].  And before then, I have to add that I'm also proud of the fact that my mother was one of the first African Americans to go to the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas].  She went to the University of Texas in 1956, which is summer school there and I was not aware of the importance of that until I actually really got to law school and understood.  You know, this is just about two years after Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education, 1954] that she was going to the University of Texas.  And she moved, moved to West Texas and she was a music teacher in West Texas at a school called Midland Carver [Carver Junior-Senior High School, Midland, Texas].  And at that school, my brother [David Boze] and I--I played football, basketball, track and my fath--my, my brother did and we would always come back to Houston [Texas] in the summertime and stay with my, my grandparents [Lydia Placide Stewart and Harrison Stewart].  And my grandparents, every year we would travel.  We would get in the--you know, she would buy a new Cadillac every year, and we'd just get in the Cadillac and we, we, we drove to--we get one of these travel agencies and we traveled to Seattle [Washington], we traveled to New York, we saw Grand Canyon [National Park, Arizona].  You know, I--and it was, it was really a, a--I knew this was something that normally, African American kids couldn't get exposed to, I did, and I appreciated it.  My, my parents really exposed me to a lot and the travel broadened my horizons, and I ready--I read anything I could get my hands on and that was basic--that was my growing up and, and, and, and it nurtured me.  And so, you know, I really--I feel that--and I've always said I stand on their shoulders because, you know, as I said, I'm very proud of the fact that my mother was outstanding because they still honor my mother in, in West Texas, even though the school is no longer there because she won many, many awards for the, the choir that she headed.  Won many, many state tournaments when it was still segregated, when we'd go down to Prairie View [State Normal & Industrial College; Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical Institute, Prairie View, Texas].  And, in fact, I made all state myself.  I sang an octet in the choir and I was all state three years till my mother's death when I had to come back to finish my senior year at [Phillis] Wheatley [High School, Houston, Texas].  But they now have a, a choir and they honored her, and I went back there well, about two years ago, the Iva Boze Singers [Iva Boze Spiritual Forces Community Choir] and they brought in the Mighty Clouds of Joy and they had a--you know, they did a thing for her and they still sing there.  So that was my--I had a very--I think a very nurtured, rewarding upbringing with my family.  We, we were exposed a lot, but they always told us to be, be aware, don't get too full of yourself, and I think that's really stood with me throughout my life.  You know, these things--all, all, all I know these things that most African American kids cannot be exposed to.  I've tried to pass that on not only to my kids, but anyone I get in contact with.
Story_ID: 251692
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds of--I remember, (laughter) I remember--this is interesting, this is very interesting.  I remember putting a stick in my grandmother's [Lydia Placide Stewart] brand new Cadillac when she was about to, to leave town and go on a trip and getting, getting--my mother [Iva Stewart Boze] whipping me for it.
Speaker 1: You put a stick--where, where--
Speaker 2: In the ignition.  And I remember going to Finnigan Park [Houston, Texas], which is near [Phillis] Wheatley [High School, Houston, Texas] and Dr. Marion Ford, who is now deceased, was a famous doctor around here teaching me how to swim.  I remember the sights and sounds of, of playing football, you know, and, and also, the laughter at family reunions and, and cookouts.  And just the fact, you know, that I had a very--we traveled extensively, like I said.  The sights and the sounds of the many places that we, that we, we visited on our many travels 'cause we visited about six years in a row, myself, my brother [David Boze] and my two first cousins and we'd all get in the Cadillac or the [Lincoln] Continental, if they had a new Continental and we, and we traveled.  And I remember the sights and sounds of the Grand Canyon [National Park, Arizona], Carlsbad Caverns [National Park, New Mexico], Yosemite [National Park, California] Seattle's Needle [Space Needle, Seattle, Washington], the Needle, New York, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  These things are at a very early age, you know, this was before I was thirteen years old, and I remember those sights and sounds.  Those things I remembered and I cherished those memories very much so, and I think it helped me in, in my, in my latter years as I went through school because I really feel that that helped me as I went through, through high school and also going into college [University of Houston, Houston, Texas], it really did.  Because I--as they say, travel broadens you, it did, it most certainly did broaden me, absolutely.  I remember my brothers and--and my brother and my, my cousins, we'd always hang out together.  They always buy us clothes and everything.  Everybody got the same thing so we, you know, we--and that--it was good.  We had a good family and un--unfortunately, when my mother died, it kind of disintegrated to a great deg--degree and now that's a sad part.  I lost my mother when I was sixteen and I was--I had to really kind of grow myself up the rest of the time and it was, it was a difficult transition because, you know, because of the nurturing and a lot of things I was not aware of.  Racism was something I was not really worried about.  I just, at that time, I thought everybody was doing what I was doing, but it, it came to me that this was--what we were doing was not the norm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I had to learn a lot when--'cause I had--like I said, I had to move from Midland Carver [Carver Junior-Senior High School, Midland, Texas] out of West Texas where my mother was celebrated, back home to my grandparents' at Wheatley High School and really kind of like started all over again, in a new high school as a senior with a--the death of my mother on my mind.
Story_ID: 251693
Speaker 1: Can you describe yourself as a little kid, as a little boy?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I was a, I was a fat nerd.  I wore horn rimmed glasses and I always--a lot of our pictures are with, with horn rimmed glasses and plaid shirts in every picture of that.  My, my brother [David Boze] was--all, all the girls thought my brother was cute, and I was just a fat--the fat older brother with the big horn rimmed glasses on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what, what did you like to do and what, what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I liked to read.  I read.  I read everything I could get my hands on.  You know, I just, just, you know, I--you know, I was very shy and I just read and, and I studied and then I played football and then basketball--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so--
Speaker 1: Now, did--now you grew up--now, where did you--did you grow up mostly in Houston [Texas] or in Midland [Texas]?
Speaker 2: No.  Most of the time, in my formative years, was in Midland, Midland, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: At that time, you know, Midland actually integrated before Houston did, because one of the reasons why they integrated because Midland Carver [Carver Junior-Senior High School, Midland, Texas], where I was going to school, was winning football championships every year, so they figured we need to get some black players over here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you went to grade school in Midland Carver to--
Speaker 2: I went to grade school in Midland.
Speaker 1: Midland?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they had like one black school there, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I actually went through the third grade here in Houston at Blackshear Elementary [School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved, moved to West Texas, and I went to Booker T. Washington Elementary School in, in Midland, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Booker T. Washington.  And then the, the high school was Carver?
Speaker 2: Midland Carver.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Midland Carver Hornets.
Story_ID: 251694
Speaker 1: Were you parents [Iva Stewart Boze and Uriele Boze] together then?
Speaker 2: They were divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were divorced.  They moved to--
Speaker 1: All right.  'Cause we didn't talk about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  They divorced in 1958 and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were about, about seven or eight?
Speaker 2: Seven or eight years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how was that?  I mean, how did, how did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Very traumatic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a very traumatic thing.  I didn't, I didn't really understand what it was about but, you know, my mother, well, at that time she was working at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] as a, as a, as a music teacher and then she came--they divorced and we moved out of town.  We moved to Midland [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: --you didn't, you didn't see your father very much after that?
Speaker 2: My father, I didn't see him very much, at that time.  You know, he came back in my life later on because as I say, I still had--didn't really know him that well.  But later on after my mother died, I had to--during my senior year in high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] and after I came back to Houston [Texas] after her death, I ended up coming and, and staying with him instead of my grandmother [Lydia Placide Stewart].  Our family lawyer was Barbara Jordan, in fact, Barbara Jordan was a very good friend of my mother's and actually came to Midland and stayed with us.  She grew up, as I said, most anybody who came through Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas] actually had to go through my grandparents' store, Stewart's Grocery [ph.], so everybody know who the Stewarts were.  So Barbara Jordan--and so I, I stayed with him, and that's when we began to really formulate a, a good father/son relationship 'cause I didn't really know him between eight and probably about sixteen and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were in Houston when your parents were together and when they got divorced, you moved to Midland?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And then, then back to--
Speaker 2: We would only come back to, to Houston on--in the summers, and I would see him in short snippets.  He would come by and we, we would spend a little time with him, but not really a lot of time with him, only when we came back in the summertime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then 'cause like I said, we were traveling a lot in the summer, so really my visits were--and he was working still too.  He was, he was still a Pullman porter for a while, and then he had his securities deal business and then he went off into the hotel concession business so, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 251695
Speaker 1: So that's a lot of trauma.  That's, you know, some trauma, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it seems that people really were looking out for your growth and development, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your grandmother [Lydia Placide Stewart] and your mother [Iva Stewart Boze] and--
Speaker 2: They were.
Speaker 1: --everybody was trying--
Speaker 2: I had a, I had a--it was good, but still even with that, I did--had a lot of trial and errors trying to figure out which way to go because a lot of things I was used to, my mother or my grandmother, 'cause they--you know, they died and my grandmother died in '71 [1971], '72 [1972] and my, my grandfather [Harrison Stewart] died not too long after that.  And it was really--believe me, I was an immature sixteen-year- old because I was--a lot of things had already been done for me and, and I had to kind of find my way.  And as I said, it was a trial and error, but I, I--my mother had instilled enough values in me, my father [Uriele Boze], that I didn't--never to stray too far away from their values and the values that they, you know, believes in God and those kind of things.  So we went to--again, you know, church was always--I remember church also, that's another you have to remember.  We--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Shiloh, Shiloh [Missionary] Baptist Church [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: And that's in Midland [Texas]?
Speaker 2: That's in--no, that's in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: All right.  In Houston?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's interesting, my family history is, is, is somewhat mixed on religion.  I have a lot of Catholics in my, in my family.  In fact, I have a, a, a cousin who was a, a nun who, who taught a lot of people; in fact, Sister Anastasia [ph.] was her name.  So we, we have Baptists and Catholic, but--and actually, I, I go to both, so I would, you know, go to the Catholic, Catholic Church and go to Catholic Mass and also go to church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a church in Midland?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We, we had a church home in Midland.  My mother played the organ and, and it was Macedonia Baptist Church [Midland, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she played the organ on Sundays in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the church.

And my, my good fraternity brother, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, while we were both on the--part of the delegation going over to Africa with [HistoryMaker U.S.] Secretary of Transportation Rodney [E.] Slater.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my uncle's, the cover of his CD, Calvin Boze, the complete recordings that were recorded by my uncle, including his hit, 'Safronia B.'
Speaker 1: This is me standing in front of the [Great] Sphinx [of Giza] in Egypt.  I was allowed to go near the--normally, tourists are not allowed to get that close but the Egyptian government allowed us to get that close to the sphinx.  They were in the process of trying to, to repair it.
Speaker 2: This is in 1997.  This is a picture of my handsome father [Uriele Boze] and my beautiful mother [Iva Stewart Boze] about the time they were about to get married back in, wow, early '40s [1940s].  About '43 [1943] or '44 [1944]; 1944.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of myself with my good friend, Johnnie Cochran.  We were in Chicago, Illinois right before I was inaugurated as president of the National Bar Association in Chicago, Illinois in 1996.  I think it is, yeah.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] back in the early '50s [1950s] showing my uncle as being a headliner along with Anita O'Day, Harold [Wayne] King and Pigmeat Markham.  Here comes the judge (laughter).
Story_ID: 251697
Speaker 1: You sang in the church choir and all that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: You sang--what, what, what did you sing?
Speaker 2: Bass baritone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Somehow I figured that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, bass baritone.
Speaker 1: You can hear the timbre in your voice, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Iva Stewart Boze]--as I said, my mother was a music teacher and I was, I was trained.  I, I had took voice lessons from, from--I had a music, music teacher and I, and I played a cello and, and upright bass and my brother [David Boze] played the drums.  And like I said, my mother was a piano teacher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so I had some--you know, music has always--I'm, I'm--if anything, I'm a frustrated musician, because when I got out of high school I had to make a decision whether I was going to play football, 'cause I had several athletic scholarships or take a music scholarship.  And I ended up taking an athletic scholarship, and I really feel there was--maybe I should've taken my music, my, my musical scholarships 'cause I, I had a music scholarship to Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] about the same time that The Commodores were down there and, and I kind of--I said, "Well, you know, you never know."
Speaker 1: You could've been a Commodore--
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: --maybe.
Speaker 2: I have no idea--
Speaker 1: Who knows, though?
Speaker 2: --but, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't take that scholarship.  And I, I was pretty good because I--when--after my mother's death and I came into--back to [Phillis] Wheatley [High School, Houston, Texas], I was going to Wheatley High School, I auditioned for the opera 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi] and I made a--I made the, the, the, the show, and I was--they typecast me as a slave and I wonder how they came up with that.  They had me in a diaper on the stage.  And what's--what--what's really interesting about that, Danny Oliver [ph.] was one of the dancers at the time and we became good friends from that.  You know, we always, you know, through the years, we kid each other about, you know, being in the opera 'Aida' which actually opened [Jesse H.] Jones Hall [for the Performing Arts] here in Houston [Texas].  And we traveled.  We went to--we, we performed--this is the Grand Opera of Houston [Houston Grand Opera] now.  It was--you know, we had, we had to audition and--'cause I was--at that time, I was pretty buffed.  I was in shape and I was--and I, I sang very well and I, I--we, we performed for Jones Hall here and then we went to New Orleans [Louisiana] and then we also performed in Shreveport, Louisiana, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they always make the, the, the black folks in 'Aida' always carried a chair and all that, that sort of thing, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's funny, like, you see a lot of black people in the--always in the opera no matter where it's performed, there's always a lot of black people--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --on stage.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Which we, we interviewed a gentleman in Gulfport, Mississippi who was a black officer in Europe and got in a production of 'Aida' as his first production ever.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, and he, he, he continued and got in some German movies and other things.  But based on the fact they're looking for somebody black for being the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in 'Aida.'
Story_ID: 251698
Speaker 1: In grade school--now, now, were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was a B+, A student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  All the way up until--well, it, it only dropped after my mother's [Iva Stewart Boze] death and I moved to--back here to, you know, to finish at [Phillis] Wheatley [High School, Houston, Texas].  My grades slipped somewhat, but I still finished in the upper ten percent because Wheatley was a very, very competitive school.  I graduated with several people who, you know, I, I was one of the highest ranking guys, but there were several, several girls ahead of me whose, whose credentials, oh man, they was unbelievable.  That's--it was still during the time of segregation but, you know, trust me, I didn't--I never thought that even though Wheatley was poor, I always thought that the teachers really cared.  And I had caring teachers when I was in Midland Carver [Carver Junior-Senior High School, Midland, Texas], and a lot of--I graduated--my graduating class was over seven hundred and--which really is--they don't have seven hundred people going to Wheatley now.  That was my graduating class and many of them got national merit scholarships and the--Shirley Fobbes [ph.], who was the valedictorian of, of, of the class made fourteen hundred and something on the SAT; you know, I made close to twelve hundred.  And Algenita Scott Davis, who, who I think you should also interview for this as well, who was another past president of the National Bar Association also came out of my class, and she was, you know, she was in my class and she was high up there as well.  So, you know, we had a very competitive--when I became a member of the Knights and Ladies of the Purple Shield and I was still kind of shy, you know--
Speaker 1: Now, what does that mean?  Now, we're not--you know, we're not Wheatley students so you have to tell us.
Speaker 2: Well, Knights and Ladies--
Speaker 1: The Knights and Ladies of the Purple Shield.
Speaker 2: --of the Purple Shield was a, a very exclusive club that only--you had to have a, a high GPA, you have to be invited to, to join.  And I, I thought it was an honor since I was a transfer student just coming to Wheatley and they invited me to join because as I said, even though I was--I still felt like I was that little short, fat nerd guy, you know, I had grown up.  I was, at that time, about six-two, maybe about 215 and I was still very shy around girls and they--actually, the--there was a girls club that nominated me as most debonair and I had to go look it up 'cause I didn't understand--I didn't even know what they were talking about.
Speaker 1: So what is the debonair?
Speaker 2: Who--what--who do you--what, the boner?  What, what, what is this?  So yeah, that was, that was Wheatley High School though, you know, it's--a generation's gone to it, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So Wheatley is like the traditional black high school in Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, and Yates, Jack Yates [High School, Houston, Texas] and--which Debbie Allen went to and then Phillis Wheatley because I played in the last--what they called the last Thanksgiving game 'cause they--every year they have a--they used to have a--that was a traditional Thanksgiving Day, it was Wheatley versus Yates in Jeppesen Stadium [Houston, Texas] and there would be 30,000 to 40,000 African Americans out there for the game.  And it was still--you know, like I say, it was still part of segregation, but that was, that was a big event and I played in the last Thanksgiving game as playing football.
Speaker 1: Now as a football player, now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you're a pretty good sized guy now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what did you play in--
Speaker 2: I played defensive tackle and offensive tackle as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: High school and as well as in college at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Did you play any basketball or anything?
Speaker 2: I played basketball.  I played basketball and Wheat--Wheatley was also famous for its basketball teams 'cause they won state many, many times.  Dwight Jones played in the [1972 Summer] Olympics [Munich, West Germany] with the Atlanta Hawks.  They had a, a lot of great basketball players that played over there and won state quite a few times and I played--well, actually, I wasn't that good, but I played on the team and I--then I played on freshmen basketball team.
Speaker 1: You, you played on a team that won the state championship?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I played on the team that everybody was disappointed about 'cause they--we, we only went 21 and 6--
Speaker 1: Oh boy.
Speaker 2: --so that was a bad year (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you all were used to winning?
Speaker 2: Yeah, winning state.  Yeah, so we--you know, but that was--been a bad year, an off year so--but anyway, I thought we had a pretty good squad.
Story_ID: 251699
Speaker 1: So you sound like you had a pretty decent high school life [at Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now when your--your mother [Iva Stewart Boze] died back in, in Midland [Texas], was, was she sick a long time or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: --did you all expect it or what?
Speaker 2: No, she had--she got cancer and they didn't know much about breast cancer at the time.  My mother was very brave.  She never really complained with--to us about it, but sometimes I would see her cry, you know, and, and she had a--you know, breast surgery and she, she, she, she was very brave.  And they came to us one day, she had just gone for a checkup, and they told us she was on her death bed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so that was very--you know, it was very traumatic.  I still think about that, you know, it really, it really is very sad.
Speaker 1: So, so I--that went on for a while then, I mean, I guess, you know, from the time, you know, just when you were sixteen, but leading up to that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she was sick and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was sick, right.
Speaker 1: --so I suppose that was a tough time for everyone--
Speaker 2: It was tough--
Speaker 1: --dealing with that.
Speaker 2: --'cause she continued to teach, she continued to, to--music and that's why there are people, they started--they started the choir because a lot of people out there in West Texas and Midland really loved my mother and they still--that's why they honor her by establishing that--the, the, the--that choir and it's named after her which, you know, it travels around and it's named after her out in West Texas.
Speaker 1: Well, what's the name of it?
Speaker 2: The Iva, the Iva Boze Singers [Iva Boze Spiritual Forces Community Choir].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And they call it Boze but, you know, Boze, Boze, so the Iva Boze Singers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What style of music do they perform?
Speaker 2: They sing, you know, traditional, gospel.  They will sing, you know--because, you know, singing, what we're doing--you know, my mother would teach us all types of music and I would sing in French and German and they do the same thing, so they have a lot of different styles that they do.
Story_ID: 251700
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas], did you have--did you know what you wanted to be when you--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I really didn't 'cause I said I was still pretty well traumatized by the death of my mother [Iva Stewart Boze].  I really didn't know whether or not--and I really didn't have a lot of--my grandmother [Lydia Placide Stewart] was kind of old, she didn't really understand and my uncle [Calvin Boze] didn't help me at all, so--and my brother [David Boze] was younger and I mean, I just had to try to make a decision on my own what I wanted to do and I said I turned down some music scholarships and I turned some football scholarships down out of town.  I could've gone to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], you know, Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and a few others, so I decided to take a scholarship over at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] to play football over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were you going to major in?  Had you decided?
Speaker 2: I didn't know.  I was undeclared--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at first.  I mean, my mind wasn't focused in on, on that as much.  So I played football for a while and like I said, I got into--for a while I had to learn my way because, you know, I started, as I said, the trials and tribulations.  For a while, I was just playing football and, and partying and having a good time and, and in fact, I picked up the nickname Boogaloo [ph.].  That was my nickname 'cause, you know, I, I could dance and I would join--I joined my fraternity Omega Psi Phi [Fraternity] spring of '69 [1969].
Story_ID: 251701
Speaker 1: I, you know, sang in little groups 'cause I was singing still and I--we won talent shows and, and I would sing.  And we--I went on the Chitlin' Circuit singing with my little doo-wop group and that actually started back in high school, I was with a group and actually, I sang when I was--when we won--'cause I, you know, I said, I told you before I won state in an octet when I was with my mother [Iva Stewart Boze], but we also, when I started singing at [Phillis] Wheatley [High School, Houston, Texas], I won another state championship singing in an octet and one of the members of that group that sang with me was James Wise, who later was singing with Archie Bell & the Drells.  So, you know, he was--you know, he was backup to Archie Bell so, you know--
Speaker 2: So did, did you know many of the members?  Now that's a--
Speaker 1: I know them all (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, see the thing about it, when I was coming to Houston [Texas], somebody called me up and said you got to ask somebody about Archie Bell and the Drells--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'cause this--certain things about Houston are nationally known.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Archie Bell and the Drells is one and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the other thing is just the reputation of the Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas] you know--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --is, I mean, all over United States--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --people know about Fifth Ward, they know about it and young kids talk about going Fifth Ward when you're getting real angry at something, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  Archie Bell, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Bloody Nickel, you know, George Foreman's out of Fifth Ward and a lot of other people out of Fifth--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So they always ask about that.  So Archie Bell and the Drells; now, how did--you know, they always announce proudly of all the--you know, I'm, I'm from a city with a lot of bands--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I was from Dayton [Ohio], there's about seven bands out of Dayton--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but they never say we're from Dayton, Ohio, but Archie Bell always will say I'm from Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: From Houston, Texas, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Did you know Archie Bell?
Speaker 1: I knew him--I, I, I knew him, but I knew, I knew James much better--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --since he and I sang in the choir.  Archie didn't sing in the choir, by the way--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he just sang with the group.  But James sang--he and I sang in the choir and he sang in the octet, we sang, so we spent a lot of time together, you know, practicing and, and--for singing and for state competitions so, you know, I knew him very well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And can you tell us what a drell is?
Speaker 1: I have no idea; to this day, I still don't know.  I think they just wanted it to rhyme with his name.  Bell and Drell--
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: --that's the only thing I can tell you.
Speaker 2: --I suppose that's probably it, I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Archie Bell and the Drells, I mean, that's all I can tell you, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So--well, you know, so what, what was the name of your--the group that you were in?
Speaker 1: Oh, I was in a--I sang with a guy named Vernon, Vernon Young and the Enchanters [ph.].
Speaker 2: Well, it sounds like we ought to heard--hear--heard of them, the Enchanters.
Speaker 1: We--
Speaker 2: They sound--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we were on the Chitlin' Circuit.  We--like I said, we sang.  We were--we went out to little--we, we, we got a few gigs in those small towns around singing a few Temptation [The Temptations] things; that was in high school, then when--as I said, when I went to college [University of Houston, Houston, Texas], I, I continued and I started singing with a guy who is now deceased.  I sang with a couple of my [Omega Psi Phi] Fraternity brothers, we had a group.  One of my favorite songs I, I would sing and lead sing was, was [The] Dramatics, 'Whatcha See is Whatcha Get.'  You know, I, I sang that song and at the time, you know, they had the--those one piece jumpsuits, so I had my one piece jumpsuit on and, you know, we--I mean, we, we had a band and everything and I was singing 'Whatcha See is Whatcha Get.'
Speaker 2: With a big afro and all that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And platform shoes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I know another time I was singing with a band and--with another guy, Howard Love [ph.], and we, we were doing a tighten up and I jumped out 'cause, you know, like I said, I could dance very well.  So I'd get out and as big as I am, you know, a lot of people called me--like I said, I got the nickname Boogaloo [ph.], so I'd come out and I was doing a tighten up and I was tightening it up and the cumberbun flew out in the audience; they thought it was part of the act.  It just poof, and all the ladies screamed, and I said, "Okay."
Speaker 2: Okay, so that must've been a lot of fun in college--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 2: --and so--
Speaker 1: It was.  I had a lot of fun.  Like I said, I wasn't--
Speaker 2: Now you picked--
Speaker 1: --doing a lot of studying.
Speaker 2: Well, you picked up extra money too doing that too, you know.
Speaker 1: I did.  And as I said, my mother left me in very good shape because I went to--when I went to college, I had a Riviera Gran Sport.  I was on football scholarship and I had a Riviera and I had tailor made clothes.  And I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and none of--
Speaker 1: --my--I used to get my--
Speaker 2: --the alumni had to buy for you anyway.
Speaker 1: No, they didn't buy me anything.  I mean, my--I said my mother, when she, she left us in very--I bought me a Riviera Gran Sport and I had clothes tailor made from Johnny Burden Taylors [ph.].  And I would get my clothes down there where The Temptations and all of them would come into town and get their clothes made and I would rent my clothes out to other football players and rent my car to them (laughter).  I was into--I was a businessman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the entrepreneurial spirit right, too.
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter).
Story_ID: 251702
Speaker 1: Now did you come in more contact with your father [Uriele Boze] towards this--at this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  Yeah, when, when I was playing football, even though I was living in the dorm and I said I want to--when I went to play football at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas], there were a lot of great, you know, became great football and basketball players, Don Chaney, Elvin Hayes.
Speaker 1: Oh, Don Chaney was?  Elvin?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, the Big E was there; that's right.
Speaker 2: Elvin Hayes was there, Warren McVea, Robert Newhouse, Earl Thomas when we played with the [Chicago] Bears, like I say, just quite a few, quite a few guys.
Speaker 1: These are some big time people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were.
Speaker 1: Somebody--Elvin, the Big E.  Elvin Hayes was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the only basketball rival to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who was then Lou Alston [sic. Lew Alcindor].
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't there at the game when they played in the After Dome [sic. Harris County Domed Stadium; Houston Astrodome, Houston, Texas].  We, you know, being athletes we got--we were--had front row seats to see it, you know, we were right there.  And most--you know, most the guys on the team were, were friendly 'cause we all live in the same dorm.  You know, Theodis Lee who, who, who died, he later played with the Harlem Globe--[Harlem] Globetrotters, but he died; he was a forward on that team.  And then a guy named George Reynolds from New York, I don't know where--haven't seen George in a long time, but all these guys were my friends, yeah, and--
Speaker 1: That must've been quite a time.  You got the money--
Speaker 2: It was.  I remember in--
Speaker 1: --you had talent, you had, you know--
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds, I remember us playing [The University of] Tulsa [Tulsa, Oklahoma] with Drew Pearson in the Astrodome and we beat them 100, 100 to 6.
Speaker 1: Did Drew Pearson score?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.  Elmo scored five touchdowns; Elmo Wright was injured, but he was from Sweeny [Texas], he was one of the first guys who used to, you know, dance in the end zone, but a lot of people didn't realize that he was not trying to showboat, he was just excited--
Speaker 1: That's just the way--
Speaker 2: --to have scored.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's just the way it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was just--he from Sweeny, Texas, he just was excited to score.  And so we--and, and we had our first black homecoming queen that year and I--her name was Lynn Eusan and she later was killed very tragically.  And, you know, during this time it wasn't without some, some controversy because I--most of the black players that were on the team, you know, the coach--and Coach [Bill] Yeoman is, you know, he and I, you know, we still talk.  He comes by, but he, at that time, it was a time that, you know, black players, they don't want them speaking up--out, you know, they didn't want them doing things.  And I was--I had always been taught to learn and so I would go to the black student union meetings and things and, and, of course, some of the white players would go back and tell the coach, you know, that I'm going to the black student meetings, Middleton Boze so, you know, I was first time so they demoted me 'cause I was getting involved in things that they didn't want me to do.  And, and they actually asked me, and I'm not--they wanted me to take the SATs for some guys and I refused to do that, since I made over 1,200, and I told them I wasn't going to do that.  And so, you know, it was, it was, it was, you know, I, I--my football career at the University of Houston did not end on a very good note.  I actually tried to play in semi-pro in Roanoke, Virginia and was attempting to try to play with the New Orleans Saints and that didn't pan out and decided I had to come back and get in school and unfor--
Speaker 1: Now, what did you play when you got to college?  I know you weren't playing line--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: --in college.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: You were still playing line?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was playing defense tackle.
Speaker 1: Seemed like, seemed like you weren't big enough for de--defensive tackle.
Speaker 2: I had gone up to about 230 [pounds].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was about 230.  Yeah, I was playing defensive, defensive tackle.
Speaker 1: But it's funny, I was looking through the photos in there and there's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a picture of you with Alan Page--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I think.  And then looks like you don't seem to be big enough, but you're bigger than he is in the photo.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Alan Page, one of the greats with the Minnesota--
Speaker 2: One of the greats.
Speaker 1: --[Minnesota] Vikings and the [Chicago] Bears, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Judge, Judge Page, yeah.
Speaker 1: And now he's a Judge, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Supreme Court of Minnesota [Minnesota Supreme Court], yeah.
Speaker 1: So--but I saw--maybe you were big enough, I don't know, but you don't, you don't seem to be in person to be big enough to be playing line.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was playing, believe me.  And Alan Page was--you know, he was a small person.  You have to understand at that time, the players were not as big as they are now, but they were--believe me, there were some great players even though.  I was about 230 at that time--
Speaker 1: And you played--
Speaker 2: --playing defensive tackle.
Speaker 1: --defensive tackle?
Speaker 2: Defensive tackle, yeah.
Speaker 1: Even now, defensive tackle you're talking about a guy--
Speaker 2: Three hundred.
Speaker 1: --three--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 300 pounds or so.
Speaker 1: That's right, 70 pounds heavier--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: --at least and much--and maybe 6'5", 6'6".
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So the players are much bigger.
Story_ID: 251703
Speaker 1: I still remember coming down on a kickoff in high school when Bill Gregory played with the [Dallas] Cowboys and he was an exception; he was six-foot-eight and 270 [pounds] in high school and he--like I say, he later played with the, with the Cowboys.  And we were playing La Marque Lincoln [Lincoln High School, La Marque, Texas] and these--like you said, sights and sounds, I remember we were scoring--we kept scoring so I was on the kickoff team and he would come down and he would come down and throw a rolling block at me and he would kick me every time he rolling block.  And after a while I told the coach, I said, "Coach, take me off of here 'cause he--he's kicking me.  He's killing me.  He's kicking me."  He's a big guy so, you know, finally, you know, they, they, they got him off.  And I remember playing San Antonio Wheatley [Phillis Wheatley High School; G.W. Brackenridge High School, San Antonio, Texas], that was another sight when we would kick off, a guy had a icepick in his hand, he's got, he's got an icepick in his hand.  Of course, we lost that game.  I was playing--that's when I was playing Midland Carver [Carver Junior-Senior High School, Midland, Texas].  It was kind of tough then.  I mean, I, I played--
Speaker 2: He had an icepick on--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the football field?  He was actually sticking people with it?
Speaker 1: No, he, he, he didn't try to stick it, but he--everybody saw it and they got out of his way.  So like I said, I--you know, West Texas football, I don't know if you saw the movie 'Friday Night Fever'--
Speaker 2: 'Friday Night Lights.'
Speaker 1: --'Friday Night Lights,' well, you know, a lot of--
Speaker 2: Not yet, I'm--I'll probably catch up.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, they talk about Odessa Permian [Permian High School, Odessa, Texas], see there's was a black school there, man, that was just as good.  It was called Odessa Blackshear [Blackshear High School, Odessa, Texas], you know, because most of the kids that, that played at Permian would have gone onto Odessa Blackshear, but they closed the school, because it was winning championships, and when I was playing--
Speaker 2: --because the black players played it, because--
Speaker 1: --'cause--
Speaker 2: --they were segregated then.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  And I played on the, on the black--you know, I played the Amarillo [Texas], [George Washington] Carver [High School, Amarillo, Texas], Lufkin Dunbar [High School, Lufkin, Texas].  Played against Ronnie [Shanklin] and Donnie Shanklin, you know, back at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Later on, went on, to the, to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Speaker 2: --Yeah, Ron Shanklin was the wide receiver for them.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.  And I played against those guys, and I was out there in West Texas, and then I came--like I said, I came back to Houston [Texas] playing at [Phillis] Wheatley [High School, Houston, Texas], I played against some other guys who, who later played pro ball.
Speaker 2: In fact, when I was at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas], as I said, at the time--at that time, [Bill] Yeoman, he was an army man, and he, he didn't like guys, African American guys, to have big afros and mustaches, so you had to cut them off.  We had guys from Los Angeles [California] who came in to play, and they were left because, you know, it was just too rigid.  And Cliff Branch was here.  It was a good fr- I mean, he left.
Speaker 1: Cliff Branch, he was a quick wide receiver with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he played with the [Oakland] Raiders later on--
Speaker 1: --Oakland Raiders.
Speaker 2: --played with [Fred] Biletnikoff on the Raiders, but he went to the University of Houston with me, and then he said, "[HistoryMaker U.] Lawrence [Boze], I'm leaving."  And he left and went to [University of] Colorado [Boulder, Colorado], and I, I just stayed.
Story_ID: 251704
Speaker 1: What was the coach's name?
Speaker 2: Bill Yeoman.
Speaker 1: Bill Yeoman; Y-E-O?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Y-E-O-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And like I said, Coach Yeoman and I are real good friends now, and I don't hold any animosity toward him, but I knew I should have played.  And any player will tell you that--and a lot of the players that played with me really envied me, because they knew that I--even thought I wasn't studying at the time and not going to--you know, you can't make good grades if you don't go to class.  So I was doing what--I wouldn't go to class, because, you know, I won't get into how many times other players did not go to class.  But I didn't go, okay.  So when I got serious about coming back, I had to go back and retake about sixty hours of classes that I actually didn't go to class and I made straight A's on.  And, again, I thought was able and I knew I was able to do that, because of the upbringing I had from my--that had been instilled on me all the time.
Speaker 1: But, wait a minute, what you're saying is that in those days, you can be a football player and never had to go to class.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't go much and I stayed eligible.
Speaker 1: And--yeah.  And you have been more conscious than some?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And had--
Speaker 2: --and I'm not going to name any names--
Speaker 1: --and had a more of a foundation than others.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Well, I just know players who never went and stayed eligible and stayed eligible.  Okay?
Speaker 1: This is history.  It needs to be told, you know.
Speaker 2: He never went to class and stayed eligible (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the sign of the times.  That's what was going on.  So when I see, you know, I see these things going on now, you know, I'm not surprised.  It's been going on forever.  I mean, they been exploiting black athletes since, you know--at the time I was going to the university [University of Houston, Houston, Texas], black athletes were new to school, so they gave us, gave us cars and things to ride around on, and so, you know, those kind of things.  Not that, like I said, nothing where that players were--most of the guys were going, to tell you the truth.  It was a smaller towns, you know, Hallsville [Texas], you know, like I said, Sweeny [Texas], and my roommate was from Plum, Texas (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is it about, now, I'm going to ask you a regional question.  You probably give me, like, an answer.  I don't know what kinds you give me, but, but what is it about Texas that produces so many athletes.  These little towns, and I've read some--you keep hearing about them.
Speaker 2: It's the only sport in town.
Speaker 1: Like Beaumont [Texas], of course, produces all those great athletes.
Speaker 2: The only sport in town.
Speaker 1: And all these places, little towns and Louisiana and Texas, that part of the country seems to produce a lot of great athletes.
Speaker 2: Football is king in, in Texas.  It has been for a long time and a lot of great African American players come out of these small towns, like a Paul Gibson who was deceased.  You know, like I said, there's a lot of tragedies, too, because I've seen a lot of great athletes, you know, just literally destroy themselves, you know.  They put all--once you get injured, you know, it's over for you.  A lot of them.  You can't get an education.  They put all the eggs in one basket.  That's why a lot of our former teammates say, you know, "[HistoryMaker U.] Lawrence [Boze], you know, you were really smart once you, you were able to, you know, you saw you weren't going to be a football career.  You were able to come back and start, you know, take these classes all over again."  As I said, I have to look to my mother [Iva Stewart Boze] and father [Uriele Boze], and my grandparents [Lydia Placide Stewart and Harrison Stewart] to instill me, because I just had to dig back into my old study habits--
Speaker 1: That's right.  But you had a foundation--
Speaker 2: --and got serious.  A foundation.
Speaker 1: That's a good point.  Because, you know--
Speaker 2: --and a lot of these guys I wondered, did not have that foundation.  They had been nur--they had been put on pedestals throughout their high school careers where they didn't have to go to class and just play football, so they had not real foundation in studying, and so when their football career has ended, it will be either at a college level or professional level, they end up with, with, you know, with just hourly jobs or--and work they can't get.  I have ex-teammates now which are struggling, you know, to make ends meet, because, you know, they didn't--everything--in their glory days, you know, when it was glory, but when the lights are out, it's, you know, it's just not there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There's a lot of sad stories like that.
Speaker 2: A lot of sad stories.  You know, I can--you know, we can talk about all day.  I have a lot of sad stories about a lot of my ex-teammates about things, you know, they just--football was everything.  And, you know, I went through some pain, because I knew I was good.  I knew I, I should have been playing more, but, you know, it was a life lesson that I needed to learn.  You know, it was a life lesson that I needed to learn.  You know, that this world--you know, reality will catch up on you.  But, I took from that and I became more determined that they weren't going to put me on the trash heap.  You know, like you've done a lot of other athletes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 251705
Speaker 1: They demoted you when they thought that you were going to black student meetings [at University of Houston, Houston, Texas] and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They demoted you to second string.
Speaker 2: All the way down back to the turd bowl.  I was first team and they demoted me all the way back to the turd bowl.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz.  So you're a sub now--I mean--
Speaker 2: Not even a sub, no.
Speaker 1: --a third.  Okay.  You're a guy with red shirt or--
Speaker 2: Just, just running with the, the scout team.  After being first team, yeah.  And still whooping, you know, beating up the All-American players.  I mean, just tearing them up.  You know, and like I said before, I don't hold any animosity against the coach, because that was he felt he had to do.  But to me, I think, it was probably the best thing that could ever happen to me because it made me become much more serious about the fact I needed to turn my, my, my direction away from athletics and more toward getting, you know, getting this education I need to--
Speaker 1: So you had to retake the course you had already so-called passed?
Speaker 2: No, so-called had never been to class.
Speaker 1: But--so what do they do in that case?  If you register, say, for Biology 101 and you don't--
Speaker 2: --Yeah.
Speaker 1: --show up, you're still eligible, but do you get a grade for that?
Speaker 2: Well, somewhat.  I mean, they put us in--well, they put us in class where they thought we could excel.  I took sociology about five times, and other classes, I went to one.  I went to this class twice; one at mid-term and one for the final, and I guess it was, it was a crazy class because it was about the economics of racism.  That was the name of the course, and I, I put some--man, I just, just--let's say, you know, that capitalism has to have a down tribe mass.  It cannot operate unless we have somebody pushing it down.  I drew this thing on it then talking about pushing down on masses of poor whites and blacks and Mexican, you gotta (unclear), you know. It cannot survive that way.  I got an A (laughter).
Story_ID: 251706
Speaker 1: So how did it go, I mean, you picked those grades up and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I came back, and I--what I did is I--I was in a hotel restaurant management school, the Conrad Hilton school [Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, University of Houston, Houston, Texas], and actually became the first African American to graduate out of school.  Those sixty hours, I made straight A's and actually made dean's list those two semesters.  I had more than enough hours, except my GPA wasn't high enough, so I had to come back to lift my GPA in order to graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--were you inspired about that at all by your father's [Uriele Boze] activities with the ho--in the hotel business, because he was--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  And I--that's why I entered it because he was still in the hotel business, and I would work with him and I entered into hotel restaurant management, absolutely.  That's exactly why I did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Good.  So you said you were still trying to play some ball [football], too, at--
Speaker 2: I did.  You know I tried a little semi-pro and was attempting to try with the New Orleans Saints, and none of that panned out.  And I decided, I better get back in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is not working.
Speaker 1: That's when the Saints, I think, were the ain'ts or something.
Speaker 2: They were the ain'ts, absolutely were the ain'ts.  No sense in me--this was not meant for me, so I decided I better get back in school and see what I can do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: That's what I did.  I came back to the university and took those courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you graduated--
Speaker 2: Well, and that's where I met another crossroad, because then I had become.  I was--had reinvigorated myself as far as education so now I wanted to go to graduate school, and I, you know, I tried to--I rode off to--because I wanted to go to law school, and so I saw that this by this time, I wanted to go to law school.  I had gotten married, okay, and I decided--I was trying to figure out, now, where am I going to go.  I start writing schools to ask them to, you know.  First, I wrote the, the people who send the grades out.  Tell them, don't count--look, look at my records to see that every--you know, I took these classes or why I made an F and made an A, but they said they could only count the first, the first courses, so I was looking for MBA-JD program, and I ended up being accepted to Southern Cal [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] conditionally, and I was accepted Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] unconditionally.  They accepted me in both, both programs.  Southern Cal told me to come back after I--you know, going somewhere one year and then come back and reapply.  So I went to Texas Southern, and it was interesting because at the time I was working.  I was working at the University of Texas System in a hotel, and I was working as a night auditor, front desk manager, I had about seven jobs, and then someone told me I--complained that I wasn't working fast enough, even though I was checking them in at night, taking their bags up to the room, and doing everything else.  They said I was moving too slow, and they fired me.  And so, you know, this was a crossroad I had to make.  Well, I said, should I go into law school or should I try and get another job.  My wife [Joycelyn Menard] at the time told me, you need to go get another job.  Even my father said, you need to get another job, and I said, "No, I'm going--I'm going to walk the plank.  If I don't do this now, I'm not going to ever do it."  So I, I went on to, to law school, the M.B.A. program, and I took that risk because I had no idea how, how I was going to fare.  You know, I prayed about it, and I decided I was going to do it.  And it turned out fine.
Story_ID: 251707
Speaker 1: I met--you know, like I said, I met a lot of good people. I met a young man when I was in law school [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] who is now deceased who later became my, my partner for an adventure, which was an interesting adventure I need to tell you about.  We, we rented the [Houston] Astrodome [Houston, Texas] for the last black college All-Star game, and, you know, yeah, it was--we had it here in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 2: A black college All-Star game?
Speaker 1: A black college All-Star game.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So was this an annual event?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, for how many years was this?
Speaker 1: Well, he--it actually was--this was after finished law school, of course.  You now, but when I met him in law school, we did the black college All-Star game where we, we took All-Stars from various historical black colleges [HBCUs] and had an All-Star game, and we, we got sponsors, and knew how to get it together.  We had Budweiser to--Anheuser Busch to sponsor it, and we had levels of sponsorship and we had Levert, Gerald Levert, and it was going to be a game-and-a-half.  And I did all the legal work for it, and we had Eddie Robinson and Coach Robinson.  We had all these players in from various historical black colleges, and it gave them an opportunity to actually have pro scouts come in and look at them.
Speaker 2: What was the year of this game?
Speaker 1: Oh, man.  Early--I always look like a Brian Mitchell.  Remember Brian Mitchell?  Played with the [Washington] Redskins, punt returner?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Then played with Philadelphia [Eagles].  He got drafted out of our game.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay?  And that's--
Speaker 2: This in the late '70s [1970s] or--
Speaker 1: Late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Hey, that's about the time that Jerry Rice was playing too--
Speaker 1: --yes, about the time.
Speaker 2: --at Mississippi Valley State [University, Itta Bena, Mississippi], yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I remember he and I, this guy, we were standing in the middle of the Astrodome and saying, now we're two black guys in the middle of the Astrodome.  Now, what do we do?  I mean, it's a huge (laughter).  We look and say, "What are we're going to do now?"  You know, we had--the game came off successfully.  Unfortunately, my, my partner had a, had a substance problem, and he disappeared on me and I had to carry forward with the game, and all Anheuser Busch told us, it almost threw the game off, because they were going to give us the, the black college mythical scholar--I mean, championship.  They want us to do games in Chicago [Illinois], because they were trying to enter that market.  I was going to stop practicing law and just do these--because we were going to do one with basketball, which would give us a great opportunity.  You know, the game came off but he took the money, and blew up.  Anheuser Busch had to step in and pay off the bills, and they treated us, very, very, very well.  Because when we signed the contract initially, they gave us free backstage passes to The Rolling Stones, so we were back there with Mick Jagger and the group (laughter), and they come to Houston.  And, so, you know, they treated us, they treated us very well, and it was unfortunate.  And that's why I really am--I'm a person who is very concerned about, you know, substance abuse, because I saw a young man who, who had a bright future.  You know, sub--he eventually died of over--overdose.  He OD'd.  He never finished law school, but, you know, he continued--we continued to be friends, and he had a great gift of how to put these kinds of games together, and a lot of people trusted him, and substance--crack cocaine took him out.  It really did, and it's really a shame.
Story_ID: 251708
Speaker 1: Where were you in law school?
Speaker 2: I went to Thurgood Marshall's School of Law [Thurgood Marshall School of Law], Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was also in their graduate school of business.  I would do the law during the fall and spring, and I would do my M.B.A. graduate courses during the summer, so I was going to school year-round.  And those people who would tell you at the time, they would say, "Boogaloo [ph.] going to be lawyer?"  You know, they say, "How in the world is Boogaloo going to be a lawyer?"  You know, because they didn't know me as being as a person who would study all the time, because I had a very serious reputation of having a, you know, partying and having great parties and dancing.  But they, you know, they were not aware of the fact--and now it's severely reversed.  Most people now couldn't even say, "You used to do this, and normally--
Speaker 1: {Laughter).
Speaker 2: --you used to be dancing and--
Speaker 1: Used to be Boogaloo?
Speaker 2: --used to be Boogaloo, you?" (Laughter) So it's a totally different thing.  And so I was--I did well in law school, I have to say so myself.  I got a lot of awards, and I was blessed.  I finished class valedictorian, summa cum laude.  And also finished class valedictorian in my graduate course, graduate degree in finance and summa cum laude.
Speaker 1: So you worked on both at the same time?
Speaker 2: At the same time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I'm still, at this time, the only MBA-JD graduate from Texas Southern University, even after all these years, and I graduated from law school in 1978, okay, and still to this day.  And I took the bar exam, and I made 82 and the highest in the state was 85.  So I was, you know, I was right there, and I was disappointed because I was trying to ace it, and my study partners; one of them made 83, the other one made 82.  And one of my study partners is a lawyer in Dallas [Texas].  Now, every time he sees me, he puts up one finger saying, you know, you got one point than me.  But, you know, I felt good about it.  I studied real--we did very well on the bar exam.  And it was interesting, because I--later as I am now, I'm the vice-chair of the [Texas] Board of Law Examiners.  You know, I actually write the bar exam for anybody trying--I write the wheels question, and we're appointed by the, the Texas Supreme Court.  And I was a bar grader for Raymon Jordan who was, who was a--see, they've only been three African Americans who had been on the Board of Law Examiners here in the state.  First, it was a guy named Mark T. McDonald, who was also a former past president of the National Bar Association, then Raymon Jordan, then myself.  And I was Mr. Jordan's grader. I graded his questions for about six years, and he recommended me to the board and then to the Texas Supreme Court put me on the board, and I just been reappointed for another six-year term, and I just got elected by, by fellow members to be vice-chair of the board.
Speaker 1: Now, during this time, did you maintain a relationship with Barbara Jordan?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I did maintain a relationship through--all the way through, all the way through her death.  Yes, I did.  Like I said, her and my mother [Iva Stewart Boze] were real close friends, and when I--and I'm getting ahead of myself, because after I finished law school, I had to figure out what I was doing because I did clerk for the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] in Dallas during the--my summer of my second year.  I also clerked for the city attorney, Otis [Harold] King, and then I had to decide what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 251709
Speaker 1: So I start sending out resumes and sent a resume out to Gulf Oil, and they initially sent me a letter saying, you know, declining.  So they gave me a second look, because they saw my grade, my GPA, and the fact that I finished first in my class, and they had me fulfill all their requirements.  And so the general counsel at the time was a man by the name of Jesse Luden [ph.].  They brought me in, and they took me on a world wind interviews.  I had to interview here in Houston [Texas], in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], interviewed me--I got interviewed about--I took about fifteen interviews before they finally offered me a job.  Said, we got to make sure, you know, that you're okay.  So I said, fine, I went through them all.  And so I then became the first and only African American oil and gas lawyer they had.
Speaker 2: Now, Gulf [Oil], I remember at the time--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Early '70s [1970s], because they were--well, mid-'70s [1970s], they were taking a beating in the--amongst the black political people they were following what's going on in Angola--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and there were ads in--American Friends Service Committee had an ad of a Portuguese soldier holding up a brother's head--
Speaker 1: Well, Gulf--
Speaker 2: --in a jet?
Speaker 1: Let me tell you in, in, in my--as an oil and gas attorney, what they call--they call that upstream.  I was able to see a lot of things a lot of blacks normally don't see.  How they took a lot of black people's property from them.  And I am convinced that adverse possession statutes were passed in order to help assist to taking of black people's land.  You have to understand, most of the oil and gas--oil and gas riches, and I am talking about millions of dollars, almost billions of dollars, have come off land who were originally black folks' land in east Texas, in Louisiana--
Speaker 2: Now, these are--are these lands that were originally occupied by black folks because they weren't as valuable as some of the other black--
Speaker 1: Well, because they thought they weren't valuable--
Speaker 2: They were swampy-like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They gave them swampland-
Speaker 2: --or something like that--
Speaker 1: --thinking it was nothing.  When actually, you know, they were and they would come back and they wouldn't run them off.  They would do it either through a gun, they would use the courts, they would use sheriffs.  They had actually used some family members sometimes, because they would put Xs down.  And as an oil and gas attorney, believe me, I was able to see all these things, and the thing that they would say about black people, and the racism, derogatory things, and how they would take land from people.  You know, and I've spoken to Kweisi Mfume about this, really, in the last month about--because I've had people, I, I, you know, I still try to represent people sometimes in oil and gas matters because it really is a crying shame how they took all this black land from black folks and set up adverse possession statutes where if you don't stay on your land for a certain period of time than, you know, someone else can claim it.  And in this state, they have prescriptive periods of ten years.  If you stay away, you know, it belongs to someone else, and then you sell it to someone else where they have a good faith purchase and it goes on and on.  And so, I mean, really tell you, literally millions and millions of dollars that could have gone to black folks who was taken from by these these pillar tops.  Exxon [Mobil Corporation], that land was black land, okay.  It really is, it is a shame.  I've spoken to many people about it, and, unfortunately, I've not been able to help, you know, a lot of people because these statutes you can't retroactively try to take land back from people who--the way it was stolen, but you can see the history around black people had land back as far as the turn of the beginning of the State of Texas and had land grants, because a lot of Hispanics had land grants and still own--and still have their property. To this day. Down on Laredo [Texas], I know a lawyer who has eight thousand acre ranch that his family got as a land grant from the State of Texas, okay.  And he still--his family still has it.  You can't tell me one black person who, you know, who still has that from a land grant, and I've seen it.  I saw when I was an oil and gas lawyer.
Story_ID: 251710
Speaker 1: So this is quite a story, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Quite a story, and I had some interesting tales about that.  I mean, because, you know, racism there was too far.  I know one time I was going to my, my, section chief's house and to say he was conservative is being very candid--but he was--he didn't like black folks that well, even though I was working for him.  So he was just kind of putting up with me.  So anyway, I came to his--it was a company function.  I went there with my wife [Joycelyn Menard] at the time.  We went through the front gate, because he had a gated community, and I came up there, and I had, you know, the car was looking good, we was dressed up and then the guard asked me were we here to work the party. (Laughter) And I said, "No, I'm coming to visit my relative, Mr. Fuller [ph.]."  He said, "Oh, okay."  And then when I got in there, I said, "You know, Bob, the guy at the gate asked me if I come here to work the party."  And I said, "You know, Bob, I told him, I said, 'No, that you were a relative and I was coming here,'" and then Bob said, "Ha-ha, well, he's not enlightened like we are.  And he said, "You're right."  And we kind of laughed, and you know, that--he was embarrassed by it.  But that was just--that's what I had to put up with a lot of that, and I--I mean, I had to--I stayed in Gulf Oil about eight-and-a-half years, and then they merged into Chevron [Corporation].  And Chevron was a totally different company, and I, again, I had some problems with the people at Chevron because they were totally, totally different landscape, so I eventually left there, because I ended up going into--
Speaker 1: Was it worse than Gulf or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, worse than Gulf because they had people--Chevron, even though a California company; it really had an insidious kind of relationship with Pillsbury Madison [& Sutro], a law firm out of San Francisco [California], and they didn't really have too many African Americans as lawyers.  They only had one.  And we had more than that, and it was--it was very--you know, as even though because I learned Jesse [P.] Luton [Jr.] ran the Gulf law department like a law firm, and I actually litigated.
Story_ID: 251711
Speaker 1: I mean, I tried cases in Dallas [Texas], in New York [New York], and I also--like I said, I got involved with Continental Airlines [Houston, Texas].  I was writing software licenses when I got, what they call a downstream.  New York was my base, and I would actually go to New York all the time and spend weeks at the time, and I'd go down and spend time with my friend, Gil Hardy who lived in Washington, D.C. who was actually best friends with Clarence Thomas.  That's how I met Clarence Thomas.  I met him before he was--I think still working at the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].
Speaker 2: What was he like in those days?
Speaker 1: Good guy to talk to, and have a drink with.  You know, I mean, he was okay.  And I met Anita Hill and met her at that time.  And, actually, I think, Gil knew her, okay.  And, you know, and if you saw the hearings on Clarence Thomas, they talked about a guy named Gil Hardy who got tragically killed.  He was a good friend of mine.  He got killed in a scuba diving accident off the coast of Morocco.  And it's ironic, I could look at these and see Clarence Thomas there, and I see these people talking about Gil and, you know, I know these people.  I'm saying, yeah, this is--you know, history is being made.
Speaker 2: Now, Anita Hill, she was a conservative Republican too or some kind of Republican too?
Speaker 1: Right.  I didn't know what her politics were.  I just know her as somebody Gil knew.
Speaker 2: No, I'm just thinking--I'm just putting it out there--
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: A lot of people think that she was a Democratic--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  I don't--I never thought--
Speaker 2: To get Clarence Thomas--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: But, you know, they were actually both colleagues in the same administration?
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Well, I met Gil.  Gil was, like I said, Gil and Clarence went to Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] together, and Gil clerked in the Virgin Islands, and I met him through the National Bar Association and we became very good friends.  And as I worked with Gulf Oil, I would come and I would take the metro line down from New York and spend time in D.C. and then come back home.  So he was a good friend of mine until the time of his death.
Story_ID: 251712
Speaker 1: And so I worked at Gulf [Oil] and Chevron [Corporation], and, you know, as I said, I left there because--and then I worked for Allied Banks [of Texas].
Speaker 2: Now, was there a dramatic leaving or did you just--
Speaker 1: It was.  Very dramatic, because I ended up filing a discrimination case against them.  They thought they had, you know, they thought they had tamed me in a sense.  You know, I said, I'm no longer Kunta, I'm now Toby.  But they--you know, all I did was I just bide by my time to gather all my time to gather all my evidence, you know, to file a discrimination case, and then when the holidays came I left my letter of resignation on their desk, and then I was gone.  I filed my lawsuit.  I didn't win, but I don't regret having done what I did, because they would get down on me a lot of times because I asked to join the National Bar Association [NBA], and they told me there aren't any black lawyers good enough to represent us, why you want to go to a black law organization.  We'll pay for you to go to the ABA [American Bar Association] but we won't pay for you to go to the NBA. They wouldn't hire black lawyers to work for them, because they would hire outside counsel.  And I would recommend all the time, because I'm in-house counsel, you know, I would part of my job when I was there we used a lot of outside counsel, and I would always say, "You know, there are a lot of good lawyers in the National Bar."  They wouldn't hire.  They said there wasn't any black lawyers good enough to do so.  And it's interesting, after filing my discrimination lawsuit, even though I lost, they started hiring black lawyers.  They would come to the National Bar Association meeting.  The chief litigator would come.  He seen me.  His name was Bailey, John Bailey and say, "How you doing [HistoryMaker U.] Lawrence [Boze]?"  I said, "I'm doing fine."  I said, "Y'all finally decided that black lawyers were good enough to represent you."  And he just chuckled and feel embarrassed, because that's what happened.  So even though I didn't win the lawsuit, I think I won a victory that opened some doors for black lawyers.  Even though, I--you know, personally, I didn't gain a thing, and they embarrassed me, and it's reported, and they tried to demonize me.  But they know they did me wrong, because I was winning cases.  I won the largest litigation case that ever anybody had before, now the individual who's on the Texas Supreme Court he wrote a letter of recommendation for me.  He wasn't on the Supreme Court then.  He was just a district judge.  He later, ironically, became a Texas Supreme Court judge and one of the judges who appointed me to the [Texas] Board of Law Examiners, okay.  But they tried to demonize me, but it didn't, it didn't work.  They eventually came around and came back to the National Bar Association and started hiring black lawyers.
Story_ID: 251713
Speaker 1: What did you do after you left Chevron [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: After I left Chevron, I worked--I was hired to be the general counsel--I mean, the assistant V.P. in the holding company [Allied Bancshares, Inc.] for one of those then Allied Banks [of Texas] here in Houston [Texas].  And my job, because of my bankruptcy experience, was try to solidify all the--all they had about fifty banks around the state.  They wanted to solidify all their banking arrangements, the bankruptcy, because they had all these outside counsel.  And I did a good--in fact, I did a too good a job, because a lot of the outside counsel on these banks, they had chummy relationships with the local banks with--because they would be in business with the next door neighbor, and I would bring a lot of stuff back in-houses and they put a lot of pressure on me.  So eventually, they fired me, too.  They fired me at home, because I did my job too well.  So I said, "Well, I'm not going to take another job," because I had some experience in a law firm.  I said, "I'm going to go ahead and go out and see what I can do."  I literally started when I left there, working out of my car.  I didn't know anything.
Speaker 1: So you actually go from corporate law to trying to do private practice.  What was going to be your focus in private practice?
Speaker 2: I just thought doing just general personal injury.  Pick up locations here and there.  I actually had to travel down to Baytown [Texas] to get somebody to type up things for me.
Speaker 1: So personal injury.  So you actually had to find out who had an accident or something like--
Speaker 2: I knew a lot of people, and people started sending me little things, and I was then started renting space from a firm, it was called Bernie, Kagan and Hartsfield [ph.].  And I started doing cases for them to, you know, because they knew I was a litigator, and a lot of them didn't want to litigate so that was one way I paid--I paid for my stay there.  I would take, you know, I would do litigation for them and do their cases.  And we, we--I had some very good victories for some of them.  Eventually, I moved after being with them for a while.  I moved next door.  Actually, to this building.  I was in the 2208 Building, and started winning out of that building, and again like I said, I was still trying to drill up a practice, and I was still being involved with the National Bar Association [NBA] all along.  And, eventually, I became friends with a lot of people at that time who eventually became some noteworthy people; Dennis Archer and I used to jog all the time just before he became a mayor, just before he became the [Michigan] Supreme Court justice.  Dennis and I go way back, very long time.  I became friends with a lot of NBA people who eventually became presidents of National Bar Association, and I just--when I eventually--you know, and as I said I stayed with the National Bar Association building go up my practice, going to the conventions and getting involved in various committees, and I ran for various offices and worked my way through the ranks from member at large to--well, energy committee first and member at large, and vice president for several terms, I was chair of the convention committee under several presidents and then, like I said, I became a ABA [American Bar Association]--I was appointed, and I became a member of the House of Delegates with the American Bar Association or as a representative for the State Bar of Texas and Dennis appointed to, because he was still active in ABA, he wasn't the president then.  He would--he helped in appointing me to a lot of committees on the American Bar Association, and so eventually--and I ran for my practice, it got better.
Story_ID: 251714
Speaker 1: I had a case that--with Willie [E.] Gary out of Stuart, Florida.  We represented Pleasantville [Civic League, Houston, Texas].  Because what happened there was a warehouse that blew up next to the Pleasantville and spewed all this toxic hazardous waste throughout this African American community, and that's one of the, probably, one of the interesting cases [Pleasantville Civic, et al v. Logistics Partners, et al] I ever did.  No one knew at the time that the material that blew up came--was owned by a company--it was owned by the governor of Italy.  And so we end up--I end up going to Italy for a month, living in Milan [Italy], taking depositions.  There was about fifty lawyers that went.  We represented, because Willie and I made a presentation for the Pleasantville Civic Committee, who recommended to the community at large to hire us, and so we ended representing nearly three thousand people, okay.  We represented the largest plaintiffs group; three thousand adults and minors, okay.  So I went to Italy and we stayed a month, and so we would three days on taking depositions and three days off, and, you know, of course on the days off, we would travel around Europe and that was the time where the world soccer, so I end up in France, seeing the world soccer.  I went to Switzerland, I mean, Sweden.  I mean, I just was all through Europe, Europe on the train.  And I, you know, just did traveling.  We would, during the day, we would take depositions, and I would speak in English, and they would translate it into Italian, but I had a sneaking suspicion that a lot of people we were translating, they already knew English, but they were just making you do it.  And so that was a--you know, that case went on.  It was a very big case, and we had a very successful, I believe, in for the people.  We got millions of dollars for them, sure did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sure did.

Speaker 1: President's reception during my presidential year in Minneapolis, Minnesota along with five past presidents of the National Bar Association [NBA] surrounding me at the time.  This is a picture of me being greeted by then, President [William Jefferson] Bill Clinton, in the background is Air Force One.  I had just arrived along with the delegation that had gone to the [Fourth] African American-- African-African American Summit from the--with Kinshasa, Zaire [sic. Harare, Zimbabwe], with the secretary of transportation, [HistoryMaker] Rodney [E.] Slater, and he met us on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base [Joint Base Andrews, Maryland].
Speaker 2: This is me along with [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, we were in Africa--I don't know, but we're still, again, on the trip to Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is me making a speech before doing the Congressional Black Caucus weekend during my administration in 1996 in Washington, D.C. (laughter). This is me along with then [HistoryMaker] Mayor Willie [L.] Brown of San Francisco [California].  I don't think he was mayor, I think he was on the city council at the time along with now State Senator [HistoryMaker] Royce West.  We were at the NBA convention in Oakland, California at the time.  And that was 1990 or '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: These are my kids [Andrea Simone Boze and Darren Lawrence Boze] introducing me as being--coming up to be president of the National Bar Association.  They did my--introduced me before I came to give my acceptance speech at the convention in Chicago, Illinois in 1996.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is me on my trip to Egypt as part of the delegation of presidents of black professional organization by the Egyptian government.  I'm standing before the tomb and monument of Anwar Sadat [Unknown Solider Memorial, Cairo, Egypt].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is--I'm in--this is on my international trip.  That's me in the red and black shirt along with my many good friends in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is me at the--this is my inauguration and along with me on this picture is executive director of the National Bar Association, John Crump, in the -- my inauguration in Chicago, Illinois.  It was in 1996.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next?
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother [Lydia Placide Stewart] on the left, my mother [Iva Stewart Boze] on the right on one of our trips, many trips that we took, and I can't read.  Can you read that sign?  What does that say?  That we took in the summer.
Speaker 2: Carlsbad Caverns [National Park, New Mexico].  I was about--I guess, I was about ten--
Story_ID: 251716
Speaker 1: So you were talking about working with Willie [E.] Gary?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: For this lawsuit [Pleasantville Civic, et al v. Logistics Partners, et al], and as I said, we eventually, we settled for the African American community, and we, we got millions of dollars for them--for their injuries and their personal property damage, and that's kind of--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --that's basically, that's one of my key components of my law practice now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  At the same time I had that case, I was also president of the National Bar Association.  I was elected the president of the National Bar Association unopposed in--for the '96 [1996], '97 [1997] bar year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was the fifty-fourth president of the National Bar Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in the, I guess, in the early '90s [1990s], there was a sort of a drama with the National Bar Association when Clarence Thomas was elected to the--was appointed to the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and I think he--
Speaker 2: --he was invited.
Speaker 1: --he was invited to speak (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --before the National Bar Association.  Tell us the dynamics of this drama.
Speaker 2: Well, it caused quite a stir, and I believe Algenita Scott Davis may have been the president at the time.  Like I said, there were a vast majority did not want him to come to speak to us, and, you know, as I said, I knew Clarence and--but his politics and his, and his opinions and really were against what we felt to be the aims and goals of the missions of the National Bar Association.  But eventually, they, they--we allowed him to come and he spoke.  And after that, Judge [A. Leon] Higginbotham [Jr.] had a response to what he had said, you know.
Speaker 1: At the same--
Speaker 2: I think it was at the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) presentation?
Speaker 2: Right.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: All right.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because Judge Higginbotham in opinion of a lot of black lawyers that know should have been--really should have been appointed to the Supreme Court.
Speaker 1: Even though, he was kind of advanced age at the time, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But he should have been appointed to the United States Supreme?
Speaker 1: He was in the tradition of Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  Absolutely.  And I had the pleasure of meeting Thurgood Marshall before he died, because he came down to Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] when we named the school after him, the Thurgood Marshall School of Law, absolutely.
Story_ID: 251717
Speaker 1: One thing I have not asked you is, you know, who were some of your mentors and teachers in law school [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?  I mean, professionally.  Who were the people that you looked up to and--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I looked up to several professional--Otis [Harold] King who became a city attorney.
Speaker 1: Here in Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Here in Houston.  Raymon Jordan who was a long time civil rights lawyer here in town, now.  As I said, a member of the [Texas] Board of Law Examiners who I took his place on the board and now he owns several businesses here in town.
Speaker 1: His first name, again?  I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Raymon.  Raymon Jordon, yeah.  R-A-Y-M-O-N; Raymon Jordon, okay.  And I, I had several teachers I looked up to.  There was a Tom Kleven [Thomas E. Kleven].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Klevean?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  K-L-E-V-E-A-N [sic. Kleven].   That's as close as I--Tom Kleven and, there was a Isaac [Edwin] Henderson.  Those were my favorite professors.  And then Professor Carl, Earl Carl who was blind, named Professor Carl.  Earl Carl.
Speaker 1: C-A-L-L?
Speaker 2: C-A-R-L, Carl.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Carl.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those were--I admired them a lot, and you have to understand a lot of these professors were also practitioners out in the community, as well.  Just didn't teach it to law school, so a lot of them had ongoing law practices, as well.
Story_ID: 251718
Speaker 1: I enjoyed my stay at the, at the law school [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  When I made my way up to the National Bar Association [NBA], in trying to figure out what theme I wanted for my bar year, I looked back at some of the, you know, the founding members of some things that they had done.  And I took it, I guess, from something I heard that, and his name is escaping me.  My theme was, was forging alliances in the uncompromising fight for justice and equality, okay.  And that was my bar year theme.  And I think I had a very good bar year.  I, I traveled extensively around the world, we had meetings here in Houston [Texas].  I went to Jamaica.  I actually was instrumental in--at the time, there was a banana boycott.  I was instrumental because the European Union [EU], was with the assistance of United States, was pushing to take away the subsidies for bananas that the Caribbean nations used.  And I came out in support of the Caribbean nations, and they thought of me as a hero and so they continued to, to--even when I was in Jamaica, I met the prime minister, and I had my, winter meeting at the Half-Moon Bay Resort [Half Moon Resort, Montego Bay, Jamaica].  A lot of people think that was probably the best one.  In fact, I saw the--Shelvan [ph.] in, in her remarks indicate the best winter meeting was the Half Moon.  And that was, that's I picked that.  A lot of people still think--you know, because we had villas with maids and butlers in Jamaica.  It was a good time.
Story_ID: 251719
Speaker 1: And we ended up--we went--my international trip was Rio [de Janeiro, Brazil].  It was Brazil, actually.  And we ended up in quite a few places and, and we saw where the slave quarters were, we went to Bahia [Brazil] where all the slave ships actually came in along with San Salvador [Salvador, Brazil] and Rio de Janeiro.  And we would have seminars there where we would speak in English, and they would translate it in Portuguese, and we went through the slums, and we went to the schools, and we just became a part--I actually went to a black-'60s [1960s] black power rally.  Because, you know, it's really class race based there a lot, and they discriminate against you based on the color of your skin so much for that.
Speaker 2: A lot of people don't know about the--
Speaker 1: --oh, it is.
Speaker 2: --black population in Brazil
Speaker 1: It is.  There's a huge black population in Brazil.
Speaker 2: I think, it's the second largest of any country in the world--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --after Nigeria?
Speaker 1: --and they are very much so discriminated against.  They cannot go--there's free education for certain class members in Brazil where the black people of my color, you don't get an education.  You don't get an education at all.  And so I was there in support--and we actually--you know, we started a chapter in Rio.
Story_ID: 251720
Speaker 1: As I said, we have a chapter--the National Bar Association [NBA] has chapters all over the world.
Speaker 2: Just a moment.  Tell us something about the--for those who might watch this tape and never heard of the National Bar Association.  Can you tell us when it started and then what the goals and objectives are?
Speaker 1: Well, this comes from my past speeches.  The National Bar Association is the nation's largest and oldest association of African American lawyers, judges, and law professors in the world.  We have over fifty-four chapters.  We were started because African American lawyers could not join the American Bar Association.  We have such distinguished members as, you know, Thurgood Marshall, Johnnie Cochran, who's a good friend of mine and the American--National Bar Association, the law organization that you can come up close and, and speak personally with lawyers who are doing, and judges, who are doing some outstanding things, because we are family.  I have met, you know, [HistoryMaker] Charles Ogletree, Professor Ogletree who I know very well, Judge Constance Baker Motley, so many people that I met through the years as a result of interacting with the National Bar Association.  It is a bar of choice.  You can get your CM [ph.] requirements, and it really is--we have always been at the forefront of the struggle.  You know, during my year, I thought to interact with black legislators, with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  You know, I've given awards to Kweisi Mfume.  And as I said, [HistoryMaker] Rodney [E.] Slater who was then the secretary of transportation was a good friend of mine, invited me to go to the [Fourth] African-African American Summit, and I few on Air Force Two, along with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, the Little Rock Eight [sic. Little Rock Nine], [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, Dorothy had a--Coretta Scott King, Jesse--the president of the export import bank, and it was a great--you know, it was an experience.  It really was.  I feel that the, you know, the National Bar Association does things, you know, that we do more with less.  We don't get paid for this at all, while the ABA, American Bar Association, pays its presidents a stipend of at least a hundred thousand, I think it's a hundred fifty thousand dollars.  We get paid zero, and it has to come out of your pocket.  You get a little money at the end of the year, but it's, it's more than about what you--it's what you spend.  It's about the network of lawyers helping each other throughout the country, because I get--I don't advertise.  All my, my cases come with referrals, and I get referrals, and I refer cases to lawyers around the world.  Johnnie Cochran referred me cases, I referred him cases.  The lawyers in Detroit [Michigan], Chicago [Illinois], Virgi- West Virginia, small places.  You know, we have a, a bank of--we have a book, and we, we, we, you know, we interact with each other like that.  And that's, that's why I, I tell any young black person who's aspiring to become a lawyer or who is a lawyer, that when all is said and done, the National Bar Association is the- it should be your law organization of choice, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think there's another national black association of lawyers called the National Counsel of Black Lawyers [sic. National Conference of Black Lawyers]?
Speaker 1: Not association--NABL; National Association of Black Lawyers [sic.].  I don't know whether or not they're even in existence.  I was a member of at it one time.  They thought we were too bourgeoisie, you know, because they thought we, we, we did a little too much socializing for them.  But, you know, we feel--we do socialize, but we are about the business of what we have to do, and as I said, Dennis Archer has been a president, along with being, you know, the only person who was also an American Bar Association president.  H.T. Smith out of Miami [Florida] who is a noted civil rights lawyer out of Miami, Algenita Scott Davis, who I told you; Mark T. McDonald out of the state; Walter Sutton from Dallas [Texas] out of Chicago.  You know, we've at least eight women would have been presidents of this organization.  No other law organization can say that, you know, that they--and so we have--and we don't discriminate.  We have many white members, Hispanic members.  There's diversity and we work with other bar associations of color.  We, we have now what is called a, a, a--the Crump [Law] Camp, where we bring in young teenagers to try to teach them about the way to became lawyers.  I personally have assisted in, you know, I was with Tom Joyner.  We were trying to start a nationwide thing where we would bring a lawyer on to speak about issues.  That's still in the work.  I've known Tom a long time.
Story_ID: 251721
Speaker 1: There're a lot of many, many great programs that lawyers throughout this country get involved in, and in overseas, as well.  Like I said, we have--in Canada, because I've traveled to Toronto [Ontario, Canada]. I've traveled to London, England, to Jamaica, Brazil, the Bahamas, and around the world with regard to this, in my bar year [at National Bar Association].  And I work with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], along with my Congresswomen Sheila Jackson Lee and [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters and her husband [Sidney Williams] who is, by the way, is a [Phillis] Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas] graduate.  And at the time, he was the, the--what is it?  What is the name I'm talking about?  You know, the counselor [sic. ambassador] to the Bahamas.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To them at the time.  And he was an All-American football player at Wheatley High School, and his name is escaping me right at the moment.  But, you know, but I bet you, he's going to kill me, but Maxine's husband--Sydney.  Sydney--oh, my goodness.  It's going to come to me.
Speaker 2: It's not Waters?
Speaker 1: No.  No.  It's not Sydney Waters.  He's a--
Speaker 2: He's a U.S. ambassador to--
Speaker 1: U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, yeah.
Speaker 2: --to the Bahamas, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  And it's going to come to me.  But anyway, that's, that's the kind camaraderie.  I mean, no other organization could you know--get to know people on a first name basis the way--like I said, Judge [A. Leon] Higginbotham [Jr.] and so many people throughout the years that I've, I've, known and got to know through my travels and through my inner-connecting with it.  It's enriched me, and it has enriched my family.  My kids [Andrea Simone Boze and Darren Lawrence Boze] introduced me to--in Chicago [Illinois], because I, I became president in Chicago, they wanted to introduce me, and they did a very good job, and I think my speech opened up a lot of eyes.  A lot of people didn't really realize that I could speak the way I could.  And I think I said, I think I had a very good bar year.  And every--I'm sure every president said they had a good bar year, but I think I did.
Speaker 2: One thing you said intrigued me is about the organization.  You said there were white members of the National [Bar Association]--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I mean, who are they?  Are they like civil rights lawyers or--
Speaker 1: No, they're just lawyers.  I mean, we have associate--I mean, you can become an associate members that--not lawyers.  You can't be full-fledged members, but we have white lawyers who are members.  All you have to do is join.  You know, we also work with the, the black law student lawyers association, BALSA, Black American Law Students Association [National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)], you know, who, who feed into-join in our organization, and we tried to--I've spoken before in many times when I was a president.  And even now, you know, because I gave at least 75 to 100 speeches, you know, at the time that I was president of the National Bar.  And so did many other presidents.  My--I had my convention was in Minneapolis [Minnesota], you know, with the, with the mayor at the time was an African American woman at that time.  And I just flown in back from (laughter) from Africa with--and I have a picture, you know, we met with President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton.  He had just gone to [Las] Vegas [Nevada] and he was--we was just flying in.  He was about to fly out, and I have a picture, you know, with President Clinton meeting us on the tarmac out there an Air Force Andrew.  Andrew[s] Air Force Base [Joint Base Andrews, Maryland], and they took us--you know, picture with us.  I met President Clinton many times and his wife [Hillary Rodham Clinton], the senator and along with, with Al Gore.  You know, I been to the White House [Washington, D.C.] many times, and so these are the kinds of things that the National Bar Association--if it were not for the National Bar Association--and you also have to send backbone of National Bar Association are its affiliate chapters.  Every city has an affiliate chapter of African American lawyers or African American women.  You know, the Houston Lawyers Association is here in Houston [Texas].  I'm a past president of the Houston Lawyers Association, along with I was a family member of the Texas Association of African American Lawyers [African-American Lawyers Section of the State Bar of Texas], which is a statewide organization.  And I work my way up, like I said, on all these various things.  And so in every city there is, there is a Houston--there is a chapter that makes up the network of the National Bar Association, which is really over 25,000--a network of over 25,000 African American lawyers, judges and law students--I mean, and law professors.

Speaker 1: You say you're doing a lot of environmental--
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.
Speaker 1: --stuff.  Now, you're even working on a case with Erin Brockovich?
Speaker 2: Well, for the lawyer, is Erin Brockovich.  There's also Walter Lack and Tom Girardi.  We're representing nearly three hundred former railroad workers; some living, some deceased, and their estates, who were exposed to all kinds of hazardous waste while they were working for Southern Pacific [Transportation Company] here in Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas], what they call a Liberty Road creosote plant, and I think it's an excellent case.  You know, we're in mediation now trying to settle the case.  We go back next week, and this call is called a feeler case.  I do a lot of cutting edge environmental cases in, in that area with regard to environmental hazardous waste.  I had one in New Orleans [Louisiana], as well representing at least seven thousand people for the--a dump in the lower Ninth Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana] where they had a sewage waste dump, you know, and I represent that in that case as well.  I do that--that's, that's the bulk of my practice.  I do, do litigation, some litigation and I represent several corporations, do some entertainment law.
Story_ID: 251723
Speaker 1: As I said, I told you my uncle was, was a band leader and my first cousin on my father's [Uriele Boze] side; one of them is married to-Sandra [Boze] is married to [HistoryMaker] Professor Harry Edwards, you know, who from San Jose [State College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California].
Speaker 2: You had a great sports--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.  That's my first cousin's husband, okay.  And I also have her children.  One's a Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]-- Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California], Harvard trained lawyer and went to Berkeley undergrad, and--so I'm proud of my family.  You know, I have a lot of members who have done very well.  And my auntie just recently died.  I had to go to Los Angeles [California] for her funeral, but I was able to, before she died, I was able to get to her all the royalties that had been placed in suspense for my Uncle Calvin [Boze].  You know, when you came in, you heard that music.  That was from Calvin Boze's hits.  A lot of people he sounds like, alike like Louis Jordan.  He had one big hit that you may have--it was called 'Safronia B,' and 'Safronia B' was actually sung by The Manhattan Transfer on that 'Bop Doo-Wopp' album.  If you look at, you'll see on there, it'll say, Calvin Boze, so they did a rendition of his 'Safronia B' on it.  And, actually, you know, my girlfriend at the moment, her, her mother's what would be her uncle--when her older uncle who is now deceased played in my uncle's band, back--the Sample--because Joe Sample.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: And one of his oldest brothers played with my, my uncle and his band was Calvin Boze and the All Stars [Calvin Boze And His All-Stars], and he used to back up Dinah Washington, he played in the Apollo Theater [New York, New York], with--and we had pictures with him on the marquee with Pigmeat Markham and Ruth Brown, you know, and in those days, so, you know, there was--that's some history that a lot of people, you know, I'm kind of proud of.  The kind of things that he was doing.
Story_ID: 251724
Speaker 1: Is there a case, a particular case, that you're the most proud, of or it's the biggest one that you can see is the most important you ever tried or?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's a--I've had so many cases, you know, in this time.  There's always bittersweet and good.  I was glad to get the kind of money I was able to get for Pleasantville [Houston, Texas] residents, because that's where my roots all lied.  And those people put their trust in me, and I feel I did an excellent job for them.  I think the case I'm now involved in is, is equally as important, because these poor railroad workers were not even exposed--were not even aware of what they were being exposed to.  And at first, I thought it was sort of like a, a like a Tuskegee [Syphilis Study] kind of thing that, you know, they only did it to black men, but actually all the men who worked out there, even though it was segregated, were all getting exposed.  In some cases, those with the best jobs got exposed more than anybody in these hazardous waste.  That case to me, is, is important.  I think it's going to be the largest FELA [Federal Employers Liability Act] settlement that has ever been had in the country.  It's that much money involved, because, like I said, we represent nearly thirty men who had died from all types of cancers working out there and representing their estates in FELA cases.  That's what the Federal Employees Liability Act was set up specifically for railroad workers, and a lot of these men are sick and dying.  A lot of them had cancer, and all kinds of respiratory problems and very serious problems.  And it's a very important case because I was, you know, I was able to tell a lot of these widows, you know, that their husbands may have died as a result of being exposed to all these hazardous waste that they knew nothing about, and that's black, white, Hispanic.  And it's a very important case.  I think it's a cutting edge case.  It really is.  And those are the kind of cases I been involved with.  I failed to mention that I was proud during my administration along with past president, Fred Gray, who is, you know, of the leading attorneys in this country, who is actually, you know, ordered before the [U.S.] Supreme Court several times.  And he represented Tuskegee Syphilis men.  I was able to give a reception on their behalf, and I was there at the White House [Washington, D.C.] when President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton gave his apology.  I was there when he gave the apology, and I gave a reception the night before, and I was right there with Fred Grey when, when President Clinton gave his apology to those men for what had been done to them.  And I thought that was, that was--I was very proud of that moment.  And there were so many moments like I said while I've been the president and while I been- just been a member of the National Bar Association [NBA].  And, you know, so many--like, I can't mention them all.  There were so many things that occurred during that time.
Story_ID: 251725
Speaker 1: Do you encourage, as a general rule, or maybe as a legal philosophy, do you encourage people that you represent to take the case all the way to its conclusion, to a judgment, or do you--I mean, just depends on do they--do you settle out of court a lot or do you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I can try lawsuits and what disturbs me somewhat is the way that they'd been able to misrepresent to the public at large about medical malpractice cases.  I don't do them anymore, but the fact is, medical malpractice cases are not all about just the lawyers bringing cases trying to, you know, bring--drive up the insurance rates of doctors.  Most states, including this state [Texas], in order to bring a medical malpractice case you have to have a doctor that said another doctor did something wrong, okay.  That's the thing they're not telling you.  It's not just the lawyers, there are doctors who are saying that this other doctor breached a standard of care, okay.  I litigate, I, you know, as I said before, most of my cases come from referrals.  At one point in time, I wouldn't take a consultation fee until my staff told me I was giving too much of myself away for free, because the fact is, because, you know, I represent predominately African Americans and when they come in, a lot of times, I, I turn away more cases than I take, because some cases I feel like it's going to be a lot of trouble, other cases I know I can't help them, and I'll tell them.  I won't take their money, you know, and I won't accept it.  And then I have to always tell people all along that, you know, this country is such and hopefully, you know, with President [George Walker] Bush getting reelected that we won't see a further eradication of the rights of individuals to a right to trial by jury.  And that's really where they're trying to go with or the loser pay.  In other words, if you lose a case, then you got to pay all the bills of the other side.  That's the British system.  And this eradication of our rights, and we got to be ever vigilant because especially with President Bush being reelected again, he may put on to the [U.S.] Supreme Court one if not two as many as three Supreme Court justices to eradicate, you know, even making ch- Clarence Thomas a chief justice, has been told--which has been thought about eradicating our right to trial by jury.  And I tell people all the time, look, juries are not fools, they're not that many frivolous and groundless lawsuits.  When you see somebody get a lot of money, it's because they've lost something they can never get again.  All right.  They've lost a loved one, they've lost a limb, you know, what's the sense of having three or four million dollars or twenty million dollars or how much amount of many if you are paraplegic, you're a quadriplegic, you need around the world care.  They're not giving money away.  And that's the kind of thing they're trying to fool the American public with.  You know, I represent people, I see people's pain, they bring their pain to me, they scold at me, they vent at me.  If you don't like people--and I've learned that from my father [Uriele Boze].  And I think that brought me well being in the hotel service industry to understand that being a lawyer is a service industry.  You got to understand people.  If you don't like people, and I see that, that many times I see that many lawyers that get in trouble with bar associations and get grievances on them, because they just don't like people.  They don't want to interact with people, and if you don't want to interact with people, and you're a plaintiff's lawyer, you're going to have a problem.  You have to understand you're providing a service.  That's why I always call all of my clients Mr., or Mrs., or Miss.  I don't get on a face-name basis with them in most cases, because, you know, it tends to think people that, you know, tends to try to feel like, you know, you're not providing a service.  And I understand the burden that I have as an African American lawyer that there are some mistrust.  I'm AV rated by Martindale-Hubbell, which is the highest rating that you get, and you get that by being rated by your peers, so I'm quite proud of that, and I cherish that.  I've never had grievances--you know, I've had grievances filed, people file them, but none of them ever stuck and I been practicing now--this is my--going to my twenty-seventh year of practicing law, and I enjoy the practice.  And I, you know, I took this building, I took this building and renovated it and brought it out here in the community, you know, because I practice corporate law, and I'm now in the community.  And, like I said, these cases come with referrals, and I do still travel extensively because I have cases all throughout Texas and in some other states, but that's my practice.  And I litigate.  I have cases in federal court now, in Beaumont [Texas] and in Port Arthur [Texas], and we're litigating these cases.  So, yeah, I can try cases, and I do 'em all the time if I have to.  If I can settle, I will.  But if we have to go to trial, I'm, I'm, I can prepare and I can go.

Speaker 1: This is me with Kweisi Mfume, president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], at a banquet in Washington, D.C. in 1997.  This is one of three publications of Jet magazine, in which I was featured and this one I was featured giving an award, one of the highest, I think it was the C. Francis Stradford Award to the Honorable Joyce London Alexander who is a chief magistrate judge for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; Boston, Massachusetts, in 1997.
Story_ID: 251727
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my--some of my hopes and concerns are--especially at this time, it--as I said, a little earlier, President [George Walker] Bush being reelected.
Speaker 1: That just happened last night?
Speaker 2: It just happened--well--
Speaker 1: Or this morning?
Speaker 2: Or still it being- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) or still being happening?
Speaker 2: No.  As we speak right now, Senator [John] Kerry was making his concession speech, as we sit here right now, he just made it, and I have many concerns.  I have concerns about where America is going, because I heard him saying that one of the--a lot of people who were concerned with the moral issues; but in my opinion, we're involved with immoral war, okay.  It is a war that is expanding.  It's going to expand more, which is not going to--not going to get any smaller, and I can see my concern with African American young men losing their lives for nothing.  I have a son [Darren Lawrence Boze] who's twenty-two years old, I have a daughter [Andrea Simone Boze] who is eighteen and there are many African Americans--I have people who come in here every day who have sons and daughters who are in Iraq [Iraq War] right now, and they worry about them.  I worry about the shape of our community with all the drugs involved with our young people not really having any direction.  Where are they going?  Only trying to get into music, rap.  I have concerns about African American leadership.  You know, where are our leaders, our so called leaders, where are they taking us?  You know, who is, in fact, a leader?  Where are we?  Okay.  Because the Bush administration won't speak to most of our elected leaders, would not meet with Kweisi Mfume. Barely, if ever, speaks with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, and his election with, with, with fifty-eight million votes, in my opinion, gives him a mandate that he doesn't need black people.  What does that mean to us?  Well, that means no more than that we've done for all the long time that we been here in America.  We have to do for ourself.  That means that, you know, as I said, I came up through a segregate--it was--it wasn't--I don't think, in my opinion, it wasn't segregated, because I--you know, I read something.  Someone sent me something, and it was so ironic.  They sent me Malcolm X's speech, Bullet on the Ballot [The Bullet or the Ballot].  It was made in 1964.  And, you know, he was talking about what the Democrats were doing to black folks, okay.  So forty years later, is Republicans.  But a lot of things he said echoed true.  We have got to be about doing what we have, and he says there's a difference between segregation and separation.  Segregation means they control.  White folks outside your community are controlling what you do, okay.  I believe I went to separate--a separate high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].  They tried to control it, but they couldn't control our thoughts and minds, because we excelled.  I've gone to school with people who become doctors and dentists and leaders in the community, and just good family people; husbands and wives, upstanding with kids and going to college.  And I think that's what we're going to have to be about, and that's my concern that we've lost our direction about the fact that in the coming days, we're going to have to start doing more for self, because it's going to be difficult--difficult--much more difficult days ahead of us, absolutely.
Story_ID: 251728
Speaker 1: That raises a question--just--one of the questions that I think that all of us have to face at some point when talking about black unity.  What holds us together other than--I mean, it seems like we have a lot of bad things happening to us, but as you said, the schools are now split apart.  We don't have our--we don't control--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of major institutions anymore, so--in our community.  So what can hold us together as a people to give us a sense of direction and identity?
Speaker 2: What has always held us together in our field that is our hope and our vision is our soul.  We've always held together even in the worst of times.  We still have historically black universities [HBCUs], we're going to have to protect them.  Because if we don't have these historically black universities and institutions, where are our kids going to be educated?  You know, President [George Walker] Bush was quick to talk about leaving- No Child Left Behind [Act of 2001], but where are they going?  Leave them where?  If you're in a school like in this state where, you know, the teachers or now faced with a task of teaching the kids how to pass a test, not educate them.  And for those kids who they feel can't pass this test, they keep their numbers up, so that they can keep their jobs.  They put them in special education.  So we got, literally, in this state, hundreds of particularly young black males going into special education courses, because they can't pass these tests, okay.  We'll have to unify.  We've always unified in times of strife.  There are a lot of good things that are happening, but believe me, we're at a time where a lot of African Americans have strived, strove and gotten a lot of things done, we have more politicians, we have a lot of people in very important jobs, but at the same time, a great deal of masses, I feel, that are still out there and they're not achieving anything of what America's supposed promise to them.  And they help--a lot of them have lost hope.  You know, I look at the numbers and I saw--they said they were going to get out to vote for a lot of young African Americans to vote.  No more voted this time than they did before.  It was the same numbers, which mean a lot of kids just don't think it's going to change.  And why vote, okay. So, you know, I feel that we--you know, we're going to have to do it, and I've tried to do, and I will continue to do what I can to try to emphasize and, and try to make a difference in the lives as many people as I can, and that's why I remain where I am.  I remain a resident of the inner community.  I haven't moved out to the suburbs somewhere.  I haven't tried to, to go away from my, my base.  Because I feel that, you know, this is where my family grew up, this is where my, my foundation was, and this is where I want the foundation, not only for my kids [Darren Lawrence Boze and Andrea Simone Boze], but for, for children all around me.  You know, I help--I go to the law school [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] all the time and I try to encourage the kids, I try to help them about the bar exam, you know, because--and they need help, because, you know, without institutions, there's not only--there's only three historically black law schools now, okay.  Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], and it's a question whether or not it's still predominately black, African American.  Then there's Texas Southern [University (TSU), Houston, Texas] which is diversified.  When I was over there, there is more diversified than any law school or predominately, you know, go to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then we have more diversity at Texas Southern in the law school then they have.  There's no question.  And then there's Southern [University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  I, I think there may--I may stand corrected.  There may still be a law school in North Carolina, A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], but that's it, okay.  And without those law schools, you know, the vast majority of African American lawyers would not be lawyers.  I would not be a lawyer if it were not for TSU.  TSU took a chance on me.
Speaker 1: A lot of people wouldn't be.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I mean, [HistoryMaker] Thomas [N.] Todd--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Oliver [W.] Hill.  I mean, a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Oliver Hill, my good [Omega Psi Phi] Fraternity brother.  But I have (unclear) with him, and I know him very well.  And it's just the fact that these institutions take chances on African Americans 'cause they care, and as I said, I would not be in a position, and, I mean, if it were not for TSU law school.  If it weren't there, I wouldn't be a lawyer.  And I know a lot, a lot of other kids, because my LSAT score weren't that great.  Even though, I've done on the SAT.  On the LSAT, I did not do that well on the test, but TSU took a chance on me unconditionally, and that's what I feel about, you know, what I should do.  I should do things unconditionally, because I need to.  'Cause I must.
Story_ID: 251729
Speaker 1: I've had a level of success.  I can't retire with my success.  I have to reach back, because I stand on the shoulders of my parents [Iva Stewart Boze and Uriele Boze].  My parents did a lot of firsts, my grandparents [Lydia Placide Stewart and Harrison Stewart] did a lot of firsts, okay.  But I would be remiss if I didn't continue to do that.  And a lot of times I just feel--my brother's [David Boze] now is a preacher here in town.  He's building homes, affordable homes.  He went to--he was also a football player.  He played football at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and he's now building affordable homes, and he's a preacher which is to him a great turnaround, but that's good.  God works in mysterious ways, but that's the way things happen, okay.  And he's doing--he's making a positive difference.  And I feel here with my small staff, here in Third Ward [Houston, Texas], I'm making a difference in my neighborhood, as well.  And, you know, I really appreciate the opportunity, because I think what you guys are doing is so important, and it's like I don't want it to happen like my--like I said, my father didn't pass his history down to me.  So a lot of about his family I'm only learning, you know, long after his death.  But what you guys are doing is something that we can pass down to generations to African Americans, and I know it will instill to younger people to try to strive to be someone, and, you know, I highly commend what you guys are doing.  I really do, and I appreciate it and I'm honored about the fact that I was able to, to be a small part of it.
Story_ID: 251730
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on what you've done so far and you're still relatively young--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, what would you consider--or is there any major thing that you would do differently first?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, I would go all the way back and be a musician.  I'd never been a lawyer (laughter).  I'm frustrated--like I said, I'm a frust--I told Joe Sample all the time, I'm a frustrated musician, you know.  I would, I would--I probably would be singing.  It would be totally different.  You wouldn't be sitting here with--and who knows, if I'm so important you still would have come to talk to me, I don't know.  But, if anything, I would have done differently, I wouldn't wasted so much time in college [University of Houston, Houston, Texas], you know; but I guess that's what I had to go through.  You know, I had to sow those oats, I had to go through those trials and tribulations in order to be who I am today, okay.  If I had to do it over again as far as my law practice and where I work, I felt I had to do that.  I don't think I won't be a good a lawyer as I am if I didn't go up in the corporate world and understand what's going on there.  Because I had so many, you know, fellow members of my, my graduating class did not have an opportunity to go into the corporate world and learn what's going on there.  So I took that education, took that experience; the good, the bad and the ugly about it and came out here and I'm able to, to service my clients out in these areas.  Anything else, I don't--no regrets.  I'd probably do it the same way--
Story_ID: 251731
Speaker 1: Now, likewise, when you look over the--your whole career to this point, what would you consider at this point, this may sound strange because you're too young, but what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I would think I would--I would want my legacy to be that I was a lawyer who made a difference in a lot of people's lives with regard to--because I represent so many people in major cases.  I think that's what I want my legacy to be, that I was able to help communities and large groups of people to, to get justice for rights and wrongs.  Because a lot of wrongs that are right, they would not have known about it.  I would not have known about--what happened out in Pleasantville [Houston, Texas] was a--it was an explosion.  What happened to those men out in Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas] was a travesty.  They never knew what they were being exposed to.  And there's so many of these things around the country happening, okay.  I want to help families.  Like I said, that's why lawyers like myself, and I feel good about the fact that I'm able to bring, to bring some closure and let the families know, look, you know, because cancer comes to a lot of--their exposure to these things while they were trying to work, while they--these--a lot of men were unskilled, you know, and bring justice to them, and I feel good about the fact that I'm able to do that.  And I do in conjunction with lawyers of all persuasions, okay.  You know, I associate with black, brown and white.  And try to bring justice.  I think that's--that, again, I was going to back to my theme, my bar year: forging alliances in the uncompromising fight for justice and equality.
Story_ID: 251732
Speaker 1: And I feel that my--part of my legacy, I want people to remember the kind of difference that I tried to make during my bar year, and I had people that I forgot to tell you.  I was also (laughter) a little famous for the fact that I got profiled.  I forgot--I almost forgot about that, and I was on the front page of USA Today.  I was the president of the National Bar Association [NBA] going through BWI [Baltimore-Washington International Airport; Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airportt, Maryland] when they stopped me saying, I fit the profile.  This was before the 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  This is in '97 [1997].  And I said, "What profile?"  They took me around there and they stripped searched me and through all my underwear and all stuff out there and a guy with a gun and I said, "You guys, you have messed with the wrong person.  You don't know who I know."  I said, "Why are you doing this?"  They said, "Well, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] won't allow us to tell you what the profile is."  Well, they didn't know that I knew Secretary of Transportation [HistoryMaker] Rodney [E.] Slater, right.  And I met with him and the FAA general counsel, and I went on a lot of talk shows, you know, Travis Smiley [sic. 'The Tavis Smiley Show'], and I went on several cases, you know, because I came on to phrase and I, I, never patented and I never trademarked: flying while black.  That's exactly what I was doing.  I was flying while black.  And a lot of people called me for years for them being profiled.  We finally settled that case with U.S. Air [U.S. Airways], okay.  And I said, as we sit here, I was--a crew from the USA Today came in and interviewed me for that, and I was on the front cover about the fact that I got profiled.  We settled with U.S. Air, and I was able to get a fairly substantial settlement out of them, and they had William Coleman, [HistoryMaker] William T. Coleman [Jr.], negotiating with my lawyer to settle the case.  You know, William T. Coleman was the first black secretary of transportation, okay.
Speaker 2: It's interesting how that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Huh?  It is interesting, but--and I bring that up, and I'm glad I would mention it because that's what we have to do.  We have to turn toward each other, the (unclear) and turn towards each other as a away from each other.  Were it not for the fact that I knew the secretary of transportation, Rodney Slater, they wouldn't have settled with me, okay.  The thing with it is, is that as a result of that, they started making changes after that, because it got so much press that the airlines could no longer say they're profiling things with based on what the FAA was doing, because the FAA wasn't telling them to do that.  So in another way, I was glad, and that's why I say that we--if you get empowered in some way, use this empowerment to help others where you can and that's when I felt--I felt that if I use my empowerment by going to meet with Rodney, he made, he made the FAA--he made the FAA make the airlines change some of the things they were doing, because I hadn't left the country.  They're trying to say is if I was a terrorist.  I said, hell, I was traveling from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--I mean, from Baltimore [Maryland] to Pittsburgh.  I was going to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] meeting in a suit.  And so I said, you have to use that, and when you get empowered, when you get in a position where you can help others and you can empower others to make some change, we've got to do it.  We can't put that back on ourself.  We can't self-aggrandize ourselves and be selfish enough to keep it for ourselves and say, I am.  Because I'm no better than anyone else, okay.  And anyone who knows me, would tell you I've never put on airs that way at all.  I've always tried to be the same, no matter.  And I think it comes back from my grounding from my foundation.  My family has always been a family that has had some little money.  It's never been a problem like that, so those kinds of things have never--material things have never really controlled what, you know, a lot of my decisions, so I don't get caught up in that kind of hype nor in self-aggrandizing myself.

Speaker 1: In terms of your family, did your father [Uriele Boze] get a chance to see you finish law school [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did see me finish law school before he died.  He did.  He was there when I got both degrees, okay.  That day, the ceremony, he sure did.  And he saw me work--he lived up to 1989.  He died in 1989, and we became very close.  And I got to know my father quite well, and that was one thing, I never really knew him, but as we grew, you know, I got to know my father very well and admire him, because I always questioned some of the decisions why he was not there for me.  And after a while, you know, knowing who he was, you know, and, and, knowing the kind of person he was, you know, you, you, couldn't, you know, I couldn't second guess him, because I wasn't there and, you know, and I wasn't part of the decision.  And I understood, and we became very close.  And we were close to his end, and I think about him and my mother [Iva Stewart Boze] quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I know that, you know, they would be proud of me, and--because I'm always proud of them.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And they would be proud and--what's happening to me today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They would appreciate it very much.
Story_ID: 251734
Speaker 1: Similar to legacy, but it's--I don't know if you thought about this, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Ha--how would I like to be remembered?  Not as Boogaloo [ph.] (laughter).  But a man who cared.  A man who tried to do the very best he could, and, I mean, some people say I'm--sometimes I have a, a, a hot temper, but, you know, I tend to care.  My clients know that, all right.  And I do--and I care about what I do.  I put my heart and soul in what I do.  You know, when I take on clients it's like they become a part of me, and I hurt when they hurt.  And when they hurt me, because they vent--because like I said, if you don't like people, and you don't do this--they vent on me because they can't vent on the defendants.  But like I said, at the same time, I proud myself of the fact that I write very, very well and I do a lot of PO [point of order] briefs, and one of the things that--a lot of people say that I do very well is in, so that--if I'm remembered for the fact that I care, and remember that I, I, I was a person who--a lot of people say I'm zealous, a lot of them say, when you hire me, you hire a bulldog.  You hire somebody who will, who will be on your side and who will care about what he wants to do for him, and I think people put a lot of trust in me, and that's why people send cases to me.  That's why I refer cases to other people.  That's why I can call a Johnnie Cochran; or I can call a Willie Gary; or I can call on O.T. Wells who was another former president of the National Bar Association in New Jersey; or Ed Myers, who was one of my very good friends out of New York City [New York, New York]; or Frank Seales [Jr.], you know, who was, you know, another young good friend; or Joyce London Alexander, who by the way, you should also interview if you haven't, the chief justice--the chief magistrate of the United States district courts of Massachusetts and an African American woman who just had an portrait unveiling in Boston [Massachusetts].  A very good friend of mine, okay.  Joyce London Alexander.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who was a very good friend of mine.  That these people I call my friends, and we have this network of caring, and they had the same thing.  And that's what I want to be remembered for, for that.  And I think I will be.

Speaker 2: Let's see.  (Singing) When we grow too old to dream Carver School will remember.  When we roam along the way, you'll remain in our hearts.  The old gold and blue to you we'll be true and when we come to our own end we'll sing of dear Carver School (laughter).

I was thinking in (unclear).  That's Cornel West and myself at a banquet in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when I was president of the National Bar Association in 1990--I think it was 1997.  That's Ron Brown's former, the secretary of commerce, son, Michael Brown.  We were in Africa with the secretary of transportation at the time, [HistoryMaker] Rodney [E.] Slater, and we had landed, I think, we were in Kinshasa, Zaire [sic.
