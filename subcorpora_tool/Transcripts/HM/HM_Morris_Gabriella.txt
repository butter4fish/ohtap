Story_ID: 667069
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John Morris] side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sure. Elise, E-L-I-S-E, not Elsie as she would say.  Middle name is Juanita, her maiden name LeNoir Morris [Elise LeNoir Morris].
Speaker 1: And the LeNoir is spelled?
Speaker 2: L-E- capital N-O-I-R.
Speaker 1: Oh all right.
Speaker 2: The black from the French.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now is there are story behind the name and wo- would you all be Cre- considered, would she be considered Creole or, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She probably would be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably on her mother's side, who was Ivy Anita Darensbourg [Ivy Darensbourg LeNoir], and Darensbourg is a French name.  She was born in DeRidder, Louisiana, my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she married a guy from Mississippi so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now so LeNoir is not necessarily a, a family na- I mean a surname handed down?
Speaker 2: It is, it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from her father. Her father was from Jayess, Mississippi, and they were not Creole.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe that was probably came from their owners. And that family was the blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were, they were not Creole.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right, so what was your--oh, you s- you gave us your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: No she was born October 25, 1916 in DeRidder, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: All right, how, how do you spell DeRidder?
Speaker 2: D-E capital R-I-D-D-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay. What can you tell us about your mother's family? How far back can you trace them and, and what do you know about them?
Speaker 2: I don't really know much more except my great-grandmother was a woman in, they lived in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And she took in laundry; I don't anything about her husband. I do know that this lady had thirteen children.  My grandmother was number seven and she outlasted all but one. She died at the age of 104.  So my, her daughter, my grandmother was a teacher and taught French, she married York Alonzo LeNoir [York LeNoir].  And I don't know when they were married, but they had four children, my mother being the second oldest of four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the rest were boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know much beyond that, I think the materials show I, I reflected that I'm adopted so I have, you know this is the family I grew up knowing.  And that's what I know about my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As far back.
Story_ID: 667070
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] talk about growing up and what it was like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh goodness yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: New Orleans [Louisiana] was a, a very lively place for Creoles and Cajuns and Catholics and zydeco and parades and everything that you might imagine.  She and her brothers went to Xavier Prep [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and most of them went to Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] for college.  The thing that--they've great stories of course about growing up from taking the streetcar to go shopping and you know.  Getting candy for a nickel and all those stories they tell you about growing up.  But I think one that sticks with me the most is about the, the church and how even in the church my mother's family sat in the back of the church.  And I had never understood how religion, a church could be a place where segregation was so obvious and so accepted. That always amazed me.  I was struck also by stories about the color line in Louisiana, because African Americans were all colors.  However, the way my mother being darker hued felt subservient to lighter hue people in New Orleans, really I think impacted her greatly.
Speaker 1: Was that, was that something that was enforced as she grew up or cultural, I mean culturally?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Those kind of--
Speaker 2: I, I think we have now saw, seen everywhere across the plant that color ev- plays a role as much as race in some cases.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So she was in her view deprived of the opportunity to be an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] or the top of her class or any other privilege because she wasn't as light as other girls.
Speaker 1: Yeah we've heard those kinds of stories (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before that something that's, that's--history's peppered with them.
Speaker 2: Yes absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, but she went on to Xavier University, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And she got a degree?
Speaker 2: In English I believe, she was very bright you know I think maybe a lot of people went to school young.  But she was sixteen going into college and was a Latin scholar as well, so she was very bright woman, very intelligent.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did she teach at the college level or, or?
Speaker 2: No she actually taught in elementary schools, preschool, and then while I was growing up she received her master's in special education.  So she went on to teach special education in junior and high schools.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Junior high and high schools.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Okay.
Story_ID: 667071
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: John, J-O-H-N, Edward, E-D-W-A-R-D, Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S [John Morris].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Meridian, Mississippi on August 31, 1915.
Speaker 1: All right and what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh my very little (laughter).  I met a sister of his who was a half sister and I met an older sister who was a nurse, walking down the street in New Orleans [Louisiana].  But they were not a family that was very convivial.  I never met his mother [Monica Morris], I never met anyone else from his family, I don't know much else about them.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Meridian is a town that Alice Walker wrote about, she's got a book about it ['Meridian'].  It's where [HistoryMaker] Joyce Ladner and [HistoryMaker] Dorie Ladner we've interviewed came from--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --as well, yeah.  And they had an interesting story about the name of Ladner.  She said that they were related to the white Ladniers.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That their name was Ladner, she gave an example of another family named Favre and the black relatives are named Favors (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well I wonder (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know--
Speaker 2: I gonna guess his was Morris and Morris.
Speaker 1: It probably--
Speaker 2: The only other thing I know about that is he claimed that they had a little, a lineage from Creek Indians, Native Americans which is entirely possible, but he never visited the town as far as I know.  When I graduated from college [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] and we drove back home, we went through Mississippi and that was the first and only time I've seen Meridian, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not a close family.
Speaker 1: It's a nice title for a book Meridian (laughter).
Speaker 2: Meridian (laughter)?
Speaker 1: We're talking about separating things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, fascinating.
Story_ID: 667072
Speaker 1: Anyway so what, what did your dad [John Morris] say about growing up, did, did he grow up in Meridian [Mississippi] or did he--?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do not know the story of how he actually got out of Meridian to go to New Orleans [Louisiana] because that was probably a story.  Because he--of course my parents met at Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  He was known however, for tall tales, so sometimes if he'd tell you a story, you, you wouldn't know if he was telling the truth or not (laughter).  They were always fantastical like hitting a baseball you know way on the other side of town.  Or going fishing by dropping bourbon on the water, and the fish would just jump up.  So he told stories like that so it was really hard (laughter) to tell you know what was real.  But he also was extremely intelligent man, he wanted to be a doctor and he, you know I don't have to tell you in the day my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] said doctors didn't make any money.  Because their only patients were other black people who didn't have money, and when they were engaged, she actually influenced him to drop out of college and go and work on the railroad.  Because she could see all the railroad wives had lace curtains, that it was a steady job, it wasn't like being a doctor.  You know to, almost to the end he could recite the periodic table to you; he could take apart a diesel engine.  He was a licensed electrician he was a real, a real, real bright man who because of his day was unfulfilled.
Story_ID: 667073
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents fell in love and met? Now, they met at Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] you were saying, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tell you the truth he was really quite fond of her grandmother, her grandmother was sort of a salt of the earth person.  And he would drop by to see the grandmother, and that's how they met, and he didn't have much affection for her mother [Ivy Darensbourg LeNoir].  Her mother was very, because she had been you know schooled in the French, she's very proper, very en Francois (laughter).  So he really liked the grandmother though, because she was just kind and nice and lovely.  And they met and at that time he relocated to Houston [Texas] because that was the starting point for the Sunset Limited on the Southern Pacific railroad line [Southern Pacific Railroad].  Which still runs by the way and it's the same route, it's very interesting.  And he wrote a letter to her father [York LeNoir] who was by then in St. Louis [Missouri] and I have actually seen the letter, and I've seen his response.  It's really funny (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us about it, yeah you have to tell this.
Speaker 2: It's very proper you know exp- you know requesting a hand in marriage.  And the funny thing was that her father's response was: "What, I'm very surprised, I'm not sure it's a good decision.  But if you and Elise [Elise LeNoir Morris] are bound and determined to do this, please you can have my blessing."  That was something that I found when my mother passed this summer that she had kept those letters.  I love how everybody was so formal.
Speaker 1: Yeah that is very form- formal, and were they both Catholic?
Speaker 2: My father [John Morris] was not, he was Baptist and he had to convert in the, the day you could not marry a non-Catholic in the church so he did convert.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now so they got married in what year was it, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know, probably '40s [1940s], early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say.
Speaker 1: All right and, well when you consider their personalities, their, their sense of humor how they walk, how they talk, the way they did things, I mean who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Mirror, mirror on the wall I am my mother after all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father says a man of few words, very few words.  Yeah and she, she's very interesting because it's clearly she ruled the roost.  But she did have that, that old school acknowledgement that you have to make him feel that he is making the decisions.  Which was really important because as he worked on the railroad, he was gone most of the time.  He was gone seven days, he was home three for forty something years.  Yeah it's, so it was you know she was in a position of having to make decisions, but also making him feel like he was still connected to the house, you know to the home.
Story_ID: 667074
Speaker 1: Now is there a story--now you were adopted--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you told us, and what, what's the story there, what happened?
Speaker 2: My parents had a son, his name was quite interestingly Llewellyn, Llewellyn Charles Morris [sic. Llewellyn Claude Morris], and he died in 1955 of a gunshot wound, a BB gun.  And he and his friend were playing with it and he was sent to the black hospital there was Jefferson Davis Hospital [Houston, Texas].  And he did not survive his injuries.  And I think you know they clearly wanted to have children and so they tried to adopt thereafter.  And they had been given a baby--'cause you had to, to keep the baby for about six months before you could actually adopt it--it turned out that it had a heart defect.  So my father [John Morris] (laughter) thought this was a way they are giving away bad babies, you're given to somebody (laughter).  So he was very negative about the whole thing.  But my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] had a friend, who was a nurse, Mrs. Rozitnaun [ph.] who was very fair and worked in a white doctor's office.  And told her they had a patient who had a baby and wanted it to be raised by black Catholic family.  And so that's how they came to adopt me at, I think I was nine days old when I went to the house to live with them.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is--your parents are biracial I guess in terms of?
Speaker 2: My, my biological family?
Speaker 1: Yeah biological family.
Speaker 2: I'm guessing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's--but I'm now in the process of, you see my ancestry.com (laughter) folder really learning more about the biological.  And then some things I was told I already know weren't true.  So you know you don't know.
Speaker 1: So you, you don't, you never, did you ever meet your biological mother or, or father?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So I--
Speaker 2: I may of wa- of from what I've uncovered I may have waited too late but there, there's clearly family.  DNA tests are fantastic (laughter) so I found a lot of people, a first cousin, a second cousin, a third, fourth, I mean there's lots of people out there.  But I'm still connecting the dots.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so now do you look anything like your biology- your adopted parents?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Which was a real problem growing up (laughter).  They were about forty when I was born, and my father used to joke, and he was very dark, and he'd say, "I can't walk anywhere with that girl, people think I stole that baby you know" (laughter).
Story_ID: 667075
Speaker 1: And then my parents [Elise LeNoir Morris and John Morris] decided they should adopt siblings for me because they were forty, they were old, maybe I should have some siblings.  So they went and adopted kids from two, two, brother and sister from Illinois, who are actually brother and sister.  And they were a little older than I was so I ended up being the first in the family, but the youngest at the same time.
Speaker 2: That's interesting yeah that's, that's--so how old were they when they--?
Speaker 1: They were like three and four, three and five something like that.  And yeah and I didn't look like them either, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My life has been a process of explaining and adjusting (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So well tell us about your brother and sister. What do they do now and what was it like growing up with them?
Speaker 1: Well we were so close in age; I mean we really were right in a row.  And I'm actually only eight months younger than my brother.  And I don't know, it's given me a lot of pause think about environment and heredity because we were clearly different, even though we grew up in the same family.  I think it might be 'cause they were older, so I think we, the dynamic was a little difficult, like maybe I was the favorite?  Was I the favorite because I was there longer, was I the favorite because I was lighter, I, I just basically never had time for that.  And I still don't, and I think it still persists. I'm very close to my brother [John Morris].  My brother is a hilarious man, he still is a little boy prankster, you know, we, we endured a lot of things like naps and, getting whipped if you got of bed.  And you know just, that was kind of normal 'cause he was just always, he would stand in the window and yell at the girls down the, the street, so (laughter).  Yeah so we did a lot of things together because we were so close in age.  But as we got older we all, we went to different schools for different reasons, you know.  I skipped a grade, you know so maybe someone didn't make the grade and so there was you know a lot of difference in, in sort of what we ended up doing.  But my, my sister [Monica Morris] does, has a longterm job at the Houston Airport [Houston Airport System] and she's got an IT [information technology] specialist.  And my, my brother holds a patent for an industrial product and, a draftsman and you know, he's, he's doing it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we were all, but we're very different (laughter).
Story_ID: 667076
Speaker 1: Now can you describe where you grew up, what neighborhood, what--now you grew up in Houston [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And was it Third Ward, Fifth Ward?
Speaker 2: Yeah none of those (laughter).
Speaker 1: None oh okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Which was, which another thing.  My parents [Elise LeNoir Morris and John Morris] located in Fifth Ward when they came to Houston, and they were very much part of the Our Mother of Mercy [Our Mother of Mercy Catholic Church, Houston, Texas] community of Catholics there.  And then there was this opportunity to go east, and there were new houses being put up there.  And you know that's where they moved, they, they started a parish there, Our Lady Star of the Sea [Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church, Houston, Texas] with other sort of likeminded folks who, who moved out there.  Now what we used to call it Clinton Park [Houston, Texas] we also called it the ship channel [Houston Ship Channel] area.  It was the turning basin for the Port of Houston, which you might know is fifty miles from Galveston [Texas].  So part of the success of Houston as a city was that with that Texas ingenuity they decided they would dig a channel so that ships and goods could come right into the heart of Houston, so that area was fairly industrial, not too far from Pasadena [Texas] with many, many smokestacks still--they're probably not smokestacks but they're towers that are used to process petroleum products.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So some would say it was smelly, some would say it smelled like money (laughter), so kind of our earliest memories are of what that smelled like. A very industrial heavy smell.
Story_ID: 667077
Speaker 1: What were--well we know what some of the smells were--but what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah well that was a, a big one at home, but you know after I was about nine I, I took the bus into town.  So you know it was great nice little neighborhood [Clinton Park, Houston, Texas], and I had neighbors even through high school who had never left the neighborhood.  That was very common; people were very much isolated to their location.  But we were able to, as little kids, get on the six o'clock bus and go into downtown Houston [Texas].  You know where basically you say your world expanded, you realized there things beyond your immediate neighborhood.  There were skyscrapers, there were buses and cars and lots of different kinds of people.  My neighborhood was a segregated African American community, and the only other people we had seen were the Asians that ran the store on the front street.  And you'd say I'm going to the front, that meant you're going to the, what they would call up here in New York [New York] a bodega.  Yeah that, that's what we had, so you know being able to transport yourself out of the neighborhood gave you a whole different vision of what the world looked like, which was very different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So there, there was a just a bodega near you in terms of food--
Speaker 2: We didn't call it that.
Speaker 1: You didn't call it that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't know--
Speaker 1: It was a store--
Speaker 2: --there were Asians and that's all we knew, they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what they, I think they called it the Chinaman's store is actually what they called it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the Chinese and that's all we had ever seen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did people grow a lot of their own food, was that, that kind of neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No.  No we had streets made out of oyster shell, or, oyster shells and cement mix. That were the first streets we had.  We had ditches, we didn't have paved roadways. But the ditches we, we (laughter) used to fish for crawfish and frogs and, it, it was rural, but it wasn't you know.  It was still part of the city. Not--my parents [Elise LeNoir Morris and John Morris] might've grown something in the backyard, I'm sure they did, fig trees, garlic.  You know just little plants but it wasn't a big, it wasn't a big yard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay the house was small (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandmother [Ivy Darensbourg LeNoir] grew though--
Speaker 1: Oh your grandmother grew, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In St. Louis [Missouri], she grew a lot of stuff in the backyard, corn and (laughter) don't know where she thought she was she was, she was in the city but she, she had a garden.  The house was fairly small but throughout the years my father being han- he added on to it, he added to on to it at least twice in my lifetime.  So it was the biggest house on the street by the time he finished with it.
Speaker 1: Was a two story house or?
Speaker 2: Two story that was a big deal when you lived in a two story house, so yeah he made it two stories. And then he--because it was only one a half when he first did it and we had a roof leak, then he made it a two story house with dormers and the whole bit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And put in air conditioning, now am I too old to tell you that air conditioning was a block of ice with a fan, because we had that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay now I heard that being used in theaters and but I never heard of, about it in private homes.  But that, that's actually what it was huh?
Speaker 2: It was Texas, it was hot when my, when I was about ten or so we actually got central air conditioning, which was unheard of, yeah we were pretty progressive (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah well okay, so air conditioning, a block of ice and a fan (laughter).
Speaker 2: Seems like you go down to the ready ice machine it's a block it go- it's a box, I mean it's not just a, I mean it was made that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what you were supposed to do with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 667078
Speaker 1: Can you remember your first school?
Speaker 2: Let's see you know my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] she taught school, so when I was a baby I went to school with her.  And, and it, it's really funny because all of those kids I grew up and I went to parties and they said, "I changed your diapers."  So I had to go back and say, "Why were these people changing my diapers?" 'Cause I went to school with her.  And then my first school was the, the neighborhood school, Clinton Park Elementary [Clinton Park Elementary School, Houston, Texas], and then my mother started teaching in the adjoining district which was Galena Park, Texas.  It's right next door but it was, it was a white suburb, so we started going to--there was, but there was a black school.  A neighborhood there right on the corner, so we started to go to Fidelity Elementary [Fidelity Elementary School, Galena Park, Texas] because she taught there, and I went there for, for first through third grades.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now at some point you, you started going to Catholic school, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: So how old were you when you?
Speaker 2: That was nine; I was nine, so that was when we start taking the bus to school.  Around that time there, the desegregation orders were coming.  And the way the district handled desegregation--that was Galena Park district [Galena Park Independent School District]--was to take the best black teachers and move them to the white school.  And bring, so they didn't bus children, they moved teachers, so my mother was sent to teach at the white junior high school at that time.  So I guess she thought this was an opportunity, now she could put us in an integrated Catholic school.  I think she was really keen on changing our environment. So we took the city bus to an integrated Catholic school for two years.  And it closed after the second year, because they said too many black students were coming.
Speaker 1: So they closed the school?
Speaker 2: So they closed the school (laughter) at which point went to another Catholic school which was actually in Galena Park, which was right across from the school where my mother taught, which was a predominantly white, there were only, I think there were only four black kids that went to that school.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I think I, I pretty much liked all of them. I would say, I would say throughout school, geometry was my favorite and then English or literature would be right up there.
Story_ID: 667079
Speaker 1: Okay so what were you interested in growing up? Did you--?
Speaker 2: Reading. You ask anybody in my family if it was time to do some work they said, "(Makes sound) She's off reading somewhere."  And I loved to read and we had a, a room, it wasn't really a library, but shelves, and we and all the encyclopedia and dictionary.  And my, my kids to this day used to make fun of me, "She'd sit there and read the dictionaries."  I loved--that was the way you know it wasn't a lot of television, that's the way I learned about the world, 'World Book Encyclopedia,' dictionaries.  Very crafty, I loved to sew, I like to make things, my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] taught me to crochet, so a lot of handwork embroidery.  And I like to, apparently I like to argue (laughter).  But I was not the child who was submissive, and I always asked why or why not, so.  But they always say you should be a lawyer because there some misunderstanding that lawyers were argumentative.  Lawyers are logical and that's why I should've been a lawyer, because I was logical.
Speaker 1: Okay so they try to say you like to argue so you're (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah that's what, but it's funny looking back on it, they think that because you question things that means you should be a lawyer but it's, that's really.
Speaker 1: That's not the quality that--
Speaker 2: It, it's about what I'm doing, which is I'm trying to draw logical inferences and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --understand you know why you are--
Speaker 1: Well were your parents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) making unreasonable demands.
Speaker 1: Okay well were your parents open to that, those kinds of questions?
Speaker 2: No, that was called the backhand slap (laughter). Children were to be seen and not heard.  My parents are very old school, you know they, you know they were older.  They didn't have time for nonsense they were very strict and they were very focused, they, they believed in discipline.  And you know I'm, I'm not talking out of school about corporal punishment 'cause they only said it, they never actually did it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they had interesting punishments you know like you stand in the closet and stand on one foot, interesting.  Why would I do that after you close the door you know what, we did it (laughter).  So they had a different kind of force within themselves as, as parents and disciplinarians it's quite interesting.  My mother could rattle her keys you would know exactly what that meant, it means get here now.  A tone, the way she would say your voice, so you know when I look at parents today and even think about my own parenting style.  You know we lost a lot in terms of parents can be your friends, but they're first and foremost they're your teachers.  So that's the rule we lived under.
Story_ID: 667080
Speaker 1: Now what about church; did church play a major role?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  Yeah I would say there was a lot of culture focused around church, my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] taught at the kindergarten.  My mother was one of the first, the first black queen for a day, I don't know if you remember 'Queen for a Day'?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes and she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes now this is a network--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --television program called 'Queen for a Day' came on in the afternoons, housewives all over America were watching after the soap operas.  It came on--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after the soap operas, I'm not sure if it was CBS, NBC or ABC 'cause in those days--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: --we had three, three stations really on most television sets.
Speaker 2: Right and we were very young, but she took the, the sort of kindergarten age children of the church and she made little capes and little hats and, to teach them music.  And she went on and she was able to get instruments and then I remember she actually won art, our breakfast room table and some other things.  But that was, she's a real go getter, you know she'd find a way to make something happen.
Speaker 1: So she was on this, this TV show.
Speaker 2: And she won.
Speaker 1: This, this nationally--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know broadcast show.
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: Okay and--oh I, the host was Ralph somebody I think, I can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah probably Ralph Edwards [sic. Jack Bailey] or something--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right. Back in the day he's one of those guys.
Speaker 1: Right I think so, I think so.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's her, her little bit of living legend history (laughter).
Speaker 1: And there'd be three contestants and then one would be chosen as you know you are queen for the day, you know I mean.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: You do remember it.
Speaker 2: Right yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah we, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were really little, but yeah she just went for it you know.  And we, I would say that was sort of the start of kind of how I recognized her driving forces you know she was a woman to be reckoned with as, as they say.
Speaker 2: So she was the first black queen for a day?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Huh, that's something we didn't know.  All right that's probably--was she referenced you think in Jet or Ebony or anything like that?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Prob- she probably I, I would guess she would be (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was really, I mean I was really little so I don't know of any of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that would be interesting to look that up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: To see if she was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah very interesting, so.
Story_ID: 667081
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher in school?
Speaker 2: I had quite a few. Mrs. Washington [ph.] was my second grade teacher [at Fidelity Elementary School, Galena Park, Texas]. It's funny, you always think your teachers are so old.  And you know it occurred to me she wasn't when she had her first child and, I'll never forget it 'cause she name her Missy Wonderful [ph.], which I thought that would never leave me.  But Miss Washington gave me my first B and it was in handwriting and I was not happy about it.  And she said to me, "You can't be perfect in everything," when she saw how (laughter) upset I was.  Mrs. Washington was also my teacher when we heard that Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had died.  And I will always have in my memory an imprint of her reaction, which was just visible, and it involved her whole body.  And that's when we knew that something terrible had happened, and it was also the time when we were practicing those raids when you had to get under your desk.  So you know so we were sort of confused about what happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah air raids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: --and nuclear--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --threat--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --reaction, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah so I remember it very well and I also remember very well my third grade teacher Mrs. Thomas [ph.].  Because she tried to teach us Spanish as well as English and a lot of that just stuck with me.  I liked that she wanted to draw more out of us than was expected, and that's why I really liked her.
Story_ID: 667082
Speaker 1: Now were you mistaken for Hispanic?
Speaker 2: Only once or twice (laughter) yes, and when I started going down--but I didn't know anything about this mind you.  You know in our community of Creoles and Geechees and whatever we called ourselves, we all, we had all kinds of colors.  And I never expected, I didn't think I was mi- I just know I looked like a lot of other kids, I didn't look like my family.  But I look like a lot of people we knew.  So it wasn't until I started going to catch the bus when people would come up to me and start speaking Spanish.  What why would you think I was Spanish (laughter)? So yeah that's one of the threads around my life of--.  In Texas it was you were Mexican, when I came up here, I was everything or anything, right, they didn't know where to start guessing (laughter).  Always had a lot of fun with that.
Speaker 1: Okay yeah if you, if you don't speak people don't have any idea.
Speaker 2: Well you know I have to tell you I did study Spanish in high school [Incarnate Word Academy, Houston, Texas], and one of the reasons I couldn't learn it, because I was afraid that if I could actually converse with someone they would think I was Spanish.  Nothing wrong with being Spanish, but I could only identify as being black, so I didn't know how to pretend to be Spanish (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 667083
Speaker 1: Now yeah the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination took place when you, in '63 [1963] you were like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in the second grade [at Fidelity Elementary School, Galena Park, Texas], yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah you were six I guess?
Speaker 2: No I was--
Speaker 1: Sev- usually seven is second grade but they--
Speaker 2: Seven.  I was seven wasn't I?
Speaker 1: You said they skipped you--
Speaker 2: But I didn't skip 'til sixth grade.
Speaker 1: 'Til the sixth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. And they, you don't hear about that anymore about people being skipped so much, but, but you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No you don't.
Speaker 1: --were just so far ahead of your class they decided to--
Speaker 2: Well you know they wanted to skip me in the first grade but this is true.  They had already skipped a light skinned girl, so they couldn't skip two light skinned girls in the same year.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Like I was telling you there's color politics (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Yeah it's--
Speaker 2: --plays out.
Speaker 1: --it's in- interesting just how color plays--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --plays itself out in so many scenarios.
Speaker 2: But that was my mother's [Elise LeNoir Morris] goal, you see. Your children are some vicarious object of their parents' all the time, see?  So I didn't think any, I didn't, I wasn't care, I didn't care about skipping a grade, but she did.  But I would say maybe part of that was she wanted me to be constantly being challenged.  And, and, and I would say the teacher in her probably the driver, that was probably it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so you skipped in the sixth grade and now you, you go on to high school at Incarnate Word Academy [Houston, Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: A whole new set of nuns (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, they, I really found what was interesting because it was the first time I had been around really large groups of, of white people frankly.  And the high school being across the street, I'll never forget rows and rows of girls doing the drill team and I hadn't seen that before.  And just terrible, I'll never forget seeing they, they, they looked the same.  It just shows you how it's exposure that creates the, the bonds with people, because I'd never seen that before.  So I do go off to in high school to the Incarnate Word sisters, it was fun, all girls (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  So what order were the, were the sisters of--
Speaker 2: I think it was called, I think it was Incarnate Word sisters [Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know there's several schools around the country.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I Googled the name and they're like, they're all over (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There're lots.
Speaker 1: All over the place yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah I think that was part of the, the mission of the order was Catholic girls education.  And I know a lot about nuns because my mother is, had started many organizations, Catholic organizations.  She started one named after Katharine Drexel [Drexel Society, Inc.], who is now a saint; and she had a lot to do with going to Rome [Vatican City].  And a very, very, very interested in that.
Speaker 1: Yeah she was the founder of Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Exactly when my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the school which--
Speaker 2: --my mother was in college she was an older woman but she would see her on campus, but she was always inspired by her, her works and so.  That's an organization that my mother founded and built.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So these were--I had Dominicans, I had (laughter) I had, I don't even remember the ones that I later (unclear) but the Incarnate Word sisters, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did, what was some of your activities in school that, were you, did you run for office or anything or?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was, you know I wouldn't say I was one of those extremely gregarious, overbearing passionate people.  But I think that, that leadership was always very interesting to me, and so I did, I ran for office.  I was my junior class president, I was the student council president and you know I, I you know was sort of my, my world I say anybody from high school would do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was considered a leader for some reason (laughter).
Speaker 1: Probably good reason (laughter).
Speaker 2: But I was always in sort of weird trouble like you know uniform violations and where, once again it was like why, who cares what, what you know it was so one of those things.  And I, they would always say you know, "You're a leader and you got to set the standard," right.  But--
Speaker 1: Was the, was the uniform violation pulling your skirt up higher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah and they--
Speaker 2: --one more roll.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Who cares, it's an all girls school. I mean it's not like anything was happening or wearing the wrong colored jacket on a free day or you know.  It was, it was insignificant things.
Story_ID: 667084
Speaker 1: But I started my hapless career there with my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] coming to our first open house, which was my first sh- first semester of freshman year [at Incarnate Word Academy, Houston, Texas].  And then when you walk in, it's the list of everyone on the honor roll, and she said, "Your name is not up there."  And we went around and we collected all of my cards and of course I should've been on the honor roll, I had all A's.  So she goes to the principal, "My daughter's name is not here, why?"  "Oh yeah that's a mistake, we'll correct it," she said, "No, you'll correct it now.  Today is the day when everyone sees who's on the honor roll. You will put her name there now."  And of course I'm sort of semi-embarrassed, but I witnessed lot of this stuff from my mother with her own way of holding her righteous indignation through all kinds (laughter) of scenarios.  That's what it takes to make that difference.  And that was very, that was very important to me, because it was really about standing up for what even- everyone else is entitled to.  You know that makes a diff- even that small little thing.  So ah, that's how they got to know my mom (laughter), I'm sure they didn't forget it, she was a piece of work, so.
Speaker 2: Well, she did the right thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah so you know it was--you know as, as dedicated as the nuns were to teaching girls, they didn't have a vision for women.  And it was you know funny tracks, you know almost like homemaker, secretary, they didn't have a vision that they're train- they're training girls for the world.  I think even today I'm not sure how much, how equipped they are to say women can do anything they want.  And I, I say that because you know counselors are supposed to say well you know you should go to school here.  Or here's some good, they never did any of that for me.  And when I got a notice from Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], I went there and I said aren't they supposed to tell you?  Oh yeah they said you're a likely, as if (makes sound) why would you wanna do that?  So that always bothered me you know that they did not, they sort of had in their mind limitations for girls, for black girls, brown girls.
Speaker 2: You think that, there's a difference in the limitations they had for, they had limitations for all girls.  But then for black and brown girls--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --special limitations.
Speaker 1: Absolutely my mother to this day said they, well not to this day but she would say they, they really cheated me out of the valedictory, I was salutatorian.  Because my number had all zeroes behind it, no well you can't average out four years and get all zeroes, you know to the decimal point.  And that it was important to them that I not be the valedictorian, so you know once again it's religious.  It's you know it's, it's important to challenge, but it's just important to keep plowing ahead as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667085
Speaker 1: Did they give you any specific counseling about college at all?
Speaker 2: Not at all, not at all. It's (laughter)--so you're, you're kind of on your own.
Speaker 1: So when you're a senior [at Incarnate Word Academy, Houston, Texas], I, I suppose your mother's [Elise LeNoir Morris] the one who really helped you, you know.
Speaker 2: A couple of things, I think I, I really was born at the right time, because it's sort of confluence of, of universities and colleges look at, knowing that they have to create diverse student bodies.  This all came together at the right time, so you know they were looking for me while I was looking for them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My mother always wanted me to go Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], if not, Rice University [Houston, Texas] and I had scholarships from both of those.  But lu- as luck would have it, all of the eastern schools--the, the Seven Sister colleges, the Ivies, West Coast, Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] all of them actually at one point had collected all of the envelopes--would look for students through the performance on the SATs I guess or whatever we took at the time, it was SAT.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And ACTs to recruit, that's, that really was my saving grace was, was the recruitment efforts of colleges looking for students who they thought could, could do well and achieve.
Speaker 1: Now that, that's right. Now that this is a time historically, was after the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] that institutions, corporations started revaluating their diversity policy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --if they had any, I mean other than no (laughter)--
Speaker 2: They said we better get something.
Speaker 1: Or just something. Yeah we better get some black--
Speaker 2: Get some on board (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, and so--
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean I clearly respect that I was the, the beneficiary of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah the largest black attendance in most of these major colleges took place right in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Right, in my class actually, class of '77 [1977] which entered Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] in 1973, was a huge class for Princeton.  I mean if I just do a graph it just, we had hundred kids, you know, black kids in my class, half of them women.
Speaker 1: And they never had that many before, right?
Speaker 2: Never, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So it was, it was interesting experience because you know the social economic range was wide as well.  I don't think you find that today, but back then I think they were saying, hey if you can do the work, we want you here.  So it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Okay so did they give you a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Well now the Ivies didn't have pure scholarships but their, their financial aid is made up of scholarships by and large.  I, I worked, I had a part of work study program as well, and then my parents took out a small loan for all four years.  So they made it work even better today because there are no loans that Princeton actually inaugurated this sort of, with this huge endowment.  That any student that's admitted will receive enough money to go to school without a loan. Now all the other Ivies have copied it.  It's a good idea.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: We've got all that money; let's use it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah so now had your brother and sister gone to college, did they go off to college to ahead of you?
Speaker 2: No they didn't, when I skipped a grade my, my brother [John Morris] ended up, we ended up in the same grade or something like that.  And my da- my sister [Monica Morris] went to a clerical college and then got married after that, and my brother went off to be a draftsman.  And then he went to the [U.S.] Air Force after that so no they didn't--
Speaker 1: Okay so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) go to college, so.
Story_ID: 667086
Speaker 1: So here you are you're going to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]. Did, did you have an idea of the significance of that in those days (laughter) that you're going to Ivy League school?
Speaker 2: I actually I did. And I did it because with this whole notion I should be a lawyer, I, I my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] somehow got us in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], even though we lived in the neigh- the wrong neighborhood.  So it enabled me to meet kids who you know wasn't unusual that your, your black families were a teacher and a postman or maybe a doctor or two.  But most of them lived in Third Ward [Houston, Texas] and so but my, my mother being as active as she was, she always wanted us to be able to whatever was accessible to us.  You know in those days if you wanted to go to the movies to see 'Sound of Music' ['The Sound of Music'], Jack and Jill had to buy out the theatre for us to go and see it.  So it was through that experience that I met kids from other parts of town who were either going to boarding schools, which I never heard of.  A lot of them had received scholarships from A Better Chance, and were going off everywhere.  So I think through that introduction, I, I, I sort of knew what these schools were.  I also had a chance to read a book called 'The Superlawyers' [Joseph C. Goulden] when I was in high school [Incarnate Word Academy, Houston, Texas], and it, it was a whole new vision of corporate lawyers, white collar lawyers.  It wasn't criminal defense work, I had a criminal defense attorney in my family, my mother's brother was a fabulous, a well noted California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay now--
Speaker 2: --attorney.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So who, who was he?
Speaker 2: Gerald LeNoir [Gerald LeNoir, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And actually brought a picture of him. He was a little guy, he was the youngest in the family, and he went to Lincoln [Lincoln University School of Law, Jefferson City, Missouri] for law school.  But his older brother, Aguinaldo [Aguinaldo Lenoir], was also a lawyer and he was the dean of the law school at Southern University [Southern University Law School; Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And he was teaching at Howard University School of Law [Washington, D.C.] when he passed, so we had two attorneys in my mother's family.  But my uncle Gerald was by far--he was hilarious and he was a crack attorney.  My father [John Morris] used to, when he would get off the railroad in Los Angeles [California] would go to court with him if he was in trial just to watch him.  And come back and tell stories about his--well he was very clever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he would say, "Does this look like the defendant?" And you know my, my uncle would've put lifts in his shoes or something like that (laughter).  But if you read Johnnie Cochran's book he'll say he learned to practice law from Gerald LeNoir who was my uncle, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I, that's kind of what I knew, I did not know about this other profession, the super lawyers.  And so in that book they talked about the Ivy League schools and lawyers from Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] or Columbia [Columbia Law School, New York, New York], so I, I knew where I was going, but I didn't know what to expect, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so you had an idea you wanted to be a lawyer because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.
Speaker 1: --because family saying you ought to be and then you had two uncles.
Speaker 2: Right and I didn't see myself in that, but I did see myself in this sort of corporate, super lawyer law firm arena.
Story_ID: 667087
Speaker 1: So also one of the friends I met in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] his father was an architect, and--John Chase [HistoryMaker John S. Chase], I just read an article about the eleven most notable black architects in, in this country.  And John Chase was one of them. And I would go to their house and I would see his blueprints he did up.  Mostly all the buildings in Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] and he is an interesting story because he was the one of the first blacks to go to graduate school at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] after Sweatt v. Painter [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950].  And there was no other black corollary school that could teach him architecture.  So he went to University of Texas and a very hard time as you might imagine, very hard time, so he was a very inspirational man.  Which is why I ended up majoring in architecture at, at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you had ideas of becoming a lawyer but you ended in, in architecture?
Speaker 1: Yeah most people want to be a law, when they major in politics or history, you can major in anything.  But I'm gonna tell you architecture and urban planning was better preparation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's an aspect to architecture around defending a thesis expressing it visually that you don't, you don't really get that in many other majors.  So I thought it was a great idea.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's interesting, you know no one's, I don't think anyone ha- else has you know expressed it like that.  I mean expressed that, that connection.
Speaker 1: Right it's, it's, the presentation component in defending a thesis in front of a group of people and, and they were just notable for like tearing your stuff off the wall (laughter).  Crazy stuff, just stand on your own two feet.
Story_ID: 667088
Speaker 1: Now Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] this is 1973, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Fall of '73 [1973].  What was it like? What, what was the campus like and you said a hundred you, you had the biggest--
Speaker 2: Class.
Speaker 1: --class of blacks students ever--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at Princeton.
Speaker 2: So the first thing is getting there. I, my--it wasn't like my parents [Elise LeNoir Morris and John Morris] wouldn't drop me off.  I see this all the time, your parents go drop you off (laughter).  Well we, we sort of, there are a lot of kids from Houston [Texas], mostly white, who went to Princeton.  I had my luggage and I had a Smith Corona typewriter that weighed about fifty pounds, (laughter); it was really heavy, it was all metal.  And what, we landed at Newark Airport [Newark International Airport; Newark Liberty International Airport, Newark, New Jersey] the last time it was in operation before the new airport was opened.  So the old Newark Airport. And what I remember most is being in this sort of suburban transportation, car, bus whatever we were in.  And the alley of trees, just going into campus, was nothing I'd ever seen in my life, I mean where was I?  It was mystical, it was amazing, it was a, like a procession to your future, it was amazing.  And it's a beautiful campus and it was just a golly moment, and for a moment I thought what, what made me think that I should be here? For a moment.  And there's a humbling experience when you get there and you realize everyone was a valedictorian (laughter) or everyone, everyone was bright and gifted in some way.
Story_ID: 667089
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I didn't have you tell that story.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: Of, about being cheated out of being val- the valedictorian.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you, I mean, well you, you--was there a way they did it that I mean you said it happened but was it just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No it was just my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris], I think from the first time she was there [Incarnate Word Academy, Houston, Texas], she realized what she was dealing with which when people were not playing fair.  And so you know when you're there on the awards day and they, they're counting ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four.  Not to mention I was the Betty Crocker Homemaker of Tomorrow (laughter) which I'll never forget because my brother [John Morris] was laughing out loud.  That I, that my average would be 95 point zero, zero, zero, you know everybody's was like five, four seven or weird numbers.  She's like, "How does that happen?" She said, "They gotta be better than that." And she wanted to make a big stink about it.  At the point I said, "Hey, I'm going to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], I don't really, this isn't my legacy, to me that's not worth it.  So who has the last laugh here," so.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We were fine, we didn't need to be all that.

Speaker 1: All right so you're on this beautiful campus [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: More black students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Amazing.
Speaker 1: --than ever.
Speaker 2: Well you still had to find them (laughter). You had to find them and it was like a, you know a golly moment.
Speaker 1: Now was there a black student organization or, or union?
Speaker 2: AGA- let's see there was association of black, black Princeton alumna, alum- no that's alumni. Black students, there was a black student association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I wasn't particularly active in like formal clubs and things like that, but you know it was, it was very funny times you know. You speak to a hundred people, they'll say this, "There was a black table." There was just a sense of conviviality and that that was just for the first time in my life.  I never been around people like that of all, of all races, but it just very eye opening.  I, you know I learned later we had a, a like a class went from 1970, class of '74 [1974] has done a lot of work interviewing students from that period.  I had no idea how miserable some many kids were that felt the sting of racism in everything they did.  From classrooms to social life to professors. And I, I was very, you know I was very saddened to learn that.  Because I was of the opinion that you're gonna have a problem wherever you go, so you deal with this problem.  Or you go somewhere else and deal with a whole new set of problems. And you know that came to me because I had a roommate who was visiting from Wesleyan [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut].  And she was running from a problem, in other words feeling less than but I was like you, you know you got a whole nother set of problems.  She went back, she was visiting, she's a good kid, and, but that really crystallize it for me, it's like it's not gonna be better.  It'll be different, but I, I really didn't find anything that really bogged me down that way, I really didn't.  I dated a really nice guy who was a senior and he was my date to my debutante ball.  And I ended up marrying him [Dennis Brownlee] forty years later (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you know we, we it kind of worked out, but I, I worked really hard I studied hard, and architecture is a very difficult major.  Because you spend a lot of time in studio and it was just the best, best experience of my life really, to then.
Story_ID: 667091
Speaker 1: So you're a architecture--had you had any drafting in high school [Incarnate Word Academy, Houston, Texas] or anything or?
Speaker 2: No we didn't have things like--the girls didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Oh so you--
Speaker 2: No drafting.
Speaker 1: So you were coming in fresh. You're--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) just starting you know and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I, I imagine others had some preparation before they showed up [at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness you kidding their mother wasn't--I mean their dad was an ar- , "My uncle, I have a firm to go through--to." It was, they were well prepared.  But you know I, I, I got through and I had some really interesting teachers who turned out to be sort of world class unbeknownst to me, Michael Graves was my thesis advisor.  And you know he turned out to be one of the New York Five and one of the most prolific architects, and at least at that time. And you know I, I think I do have an artistic side, and I do have a sort of a visual spatial orientation I, I, I'm interested in a lot of different kinds of things, so I really enjoyed it. And you know people would say things to you--like I designed a nursery school once.  And I, I remember making like a curved wall, I thought that would be just so much fun for a kid and you know what that would do to change their spatial orientation.  You know because you know minds are connected to that, you know we get clues and symbols through things in space.  You know we know where the bathroom is, we know where the elevators are you know.  So we send cues, and I remember Michael Graves saying, "Oh curve, that's a kind a thing a woman would do" (laughter).  Yeah, that's a great idea. It turns out he hired a lot of women, he wasn't nexis- you know sometimes he's not, you're not necessarily sexist when you say things like this.  So you know I give people kind of a decent birth you know I'm not gonna jump on them.  And I'm you know it's like, "You throw like a girl." "Thank you," you know, why not (laughter)?  So but I did realize to your point these kids were gonna go--the apprenticeship to be an attorn- an architect professionally is ridiculous, it's like ten years.  And if you go to a firm you may spend you know ten of those doing door knobs or bathrooms or, the point is to, to see how you can get a well rounded experience so you can pass an exam.  And they just weren't many models for that, and I think it was a good major, I never really seriously considered it professionally.  But I, I did have the feeling that if I did wanna pursue it, it would be a hard road.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you know or did you know of any African American women who were architects in those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not at all. There were a few but actually one of them shows up on this list of eleven architects that I just saw last month.  But, but few and far between.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but you did know John Chase [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 2: I think if I had wanted to I might've said, "Hey you know I wanna come back and practice with you." I think that would've been possible.
Speaker 1: Did he, did he give you any advice?
Speaker 2: I didn't really ask for advice, because I, I never really considered it as a professional endeavor.  I thought it was a great personal endeavor and just a part of the liberal arts education process.  Because you know you study art, you study history, you study planning. It's very broad based education.
Speaker 1: So you were really conscious that you were gonna become a lawyer.
Speaker 2: I'm still on the lawyer track (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still there (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 667092
Speaker 1: Now you minored in African American studies too--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And who was teaching there then?
Speaker 2: Francis Rose is somebody I remembered from those days and--
Speaker 1: La Francis Rodgers-Rose, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I don't--Howard [Howard F. Taylor], he's sociology, Howard I can't remember his last name; somebody watching this will kill me.  Anyway there was some great--there weren't a lot of black professors at, at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], but there were a few and they were, they were great people.  My personal advisor was Larry Ellis who was the coach of the, the track team.  And while I was there we started a women's track team, which I, as a senior I sort of, I'd say give lip service to; but I would say I was a part of.  I wouldn't say I was great (laughing) but some- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you ran huh?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I was younger, I you know I had gotten physical fitness medals and could run faster than the boys and so, I tried it.  You know it was, it was, it was a good thing to do, I think that the track team now is fantastic, but it has to start somewhere right so there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 667093
Speaker 1: So in, so, you, you graduated in '77 [1977] right [from Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you, oh also so you were in school and--seem like a number of lawyers I interviewed were in school during Watergate.  You were in school during the Watergate?
Speaker 2: I was in school during a couple of things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: There were some apartheid movements, the--we famously had the Shockley versus Innis debates about black innate you know genetic inferiority. So there were a couple of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now who did he debate, now William Shockley was, he wasn't a geneticist or anything, but he makes these you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He talks about black genetics, he said--
Speaker 2: He's a science--I don't know exactly--
Speaker 1: And his, his theory was, was what do, do you remember what it was, what his theory was?
Speaker 2: Genetic inferiority.
Speaker 1: Of black people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he ended up debating Roy Innis.
Speaker 1: Roy Innis, right.
Speaker 2: But we, we sort of, our job was to be outside to protest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Roy Innis was head of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know it's worth debating that thing because it's ridiculous, there's no scientific basis in it.  So but you know our job you know when you are on campuses is to let people know how you feel about these things. It shouldn't even be up for debate, it's a silly thing, so.  You know we, and, we protested against the, the, the investments and companies that did businesses in South Africa.  And there, I don't think people understood at that particular moment the full impact of Watergate.  And it's so interesting watching this concept of surveillance in the 21st century come to form, wonder what would Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] have done (laughter)?  You know if he were here today you know so technology changing, so basic bad behavior (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't think he's, he would, he, he didn't deny as much in the beginning as, as Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] is doing today.
Speaker 2: Well, they're, they're different people that's for sure.
Speaker 1: They're different yeah.
Speaker 2: They're different people.
Speaker 1: He basically just trying to keep down the discussion about it you know.  Nix- Nixon (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well Nixon did have a grasp on something called truth, and truthiness (laughter).
Speaker 1: So I mean did you, did you take special note of though, of the various lawyers who were paraded in front of the television cameras then?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and you know I recently saw Howard Dean [sic. John Dean] and I was--wow and you know it's, it's, government is so compli--who's this Haldeman [H.R. Haldeman] and who's this Ehrlichman [John Ehrlichman] and John Mitchell [John N. Mitchell] and Martha [Martha Mitchell] and Dean and his wife and what a cast of characters.  And here I was growing up our family--and Texas at the time was a Democrat state.  And it wasn't 'til John Connally and switching you know he was the guy that made the big switch to being a Republican, and then Texas progressively you know certainly more conservative.   But yeah this was, this was big stuff, this was kind of our first inside look because growing up, you're sort of campaign looking.  You just looked at the campaign you know, maybe you saw Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] taking the oath of office, you know just as you grow older you sort of get a little bit more knowledge in depth about what these things all mean.
Story_ID: 667094
Speaker 1: Law school, now wha- how did you choose your law school?
Speaker 2: Well I'd like to say it's the most fantastic place on earth (laughter) and it is.  But more than that it's the, it has the greatest value for such a great place.  At the time Texas had what was called the Permanent University Fund that was supported by oil revenues.  My entire law degree over three years probably cost thirteen hundred dollars, fourteen hundred dollars; it's ridiculous, and a great education.  So I could go back home, you know at the time my parents [Elise LeNoir Morris and John Morris] had made a tremendous sacrifice you know taking on these loans for me, which they never asked me to pay back.  I mean I had my own set of loans but they were, they, you know were very small.  So to be able to go to law school and not spend you know their retirement was a great idea, it's a great idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] and this is the same law school that was named in the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Sweatt versus Painter case [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: But now it's you know twenty years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess, so what was it like when you were there?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was great, I'm laughing because the BALSA the Black American Law Students Association [National Black Law Students Association], we, you know we had a yearbook and we take pictures.  And I remember somebody saying, "Why is she in that picture," (laughter)?  The same, I mean you know same dynamics everywhere.
Speaker 1: Oh you, you didn't look like you belong in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah with the, the, you know, yeah so funny.  I, I loved it; you know law school was real theatre and I don't remember, you remember the movie 'Paper Chase' ['The Paper Chase']?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: At the time, and John Houseman would say, "Look to the left of you, look to the right of you," you know, "one of you is not going to be here."  And but I didn't find it intimidating I don't know I go through these situations where I ought to be you know scared to death of you know people who are super smart and competitive and.  Law school this is what it was all about you know all my life people telling me I should be a lawyer.  So I loved it because I already thought like a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And there's part of what law school do- does is teach you how to think a certain way.
Speaker 1: Now they say the first year is the toughest year. Is that, was that true for you?
Speaker 2: Well I don't think so, I mean I think it's all, it's tough because those are, there are the basic fundamentals, your contracts your torts, your constitutional law, that's the foundation, the building blocks.  So it ought to be the toughest because you gotta get this right, and I just really I, I just loved it.  I became what, what they called a teaching quiz master so I was able, I, I was you know one of about twenty people who taught first year students research and writing.  That was you know that was my sweet spot I, I really enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 667095
Speaker 1: Did you have a chance to intern anywhere?
Speaker 2: I did. Once again beneficiary of these law firms that were all white shoe not for nothing, very white and saying we need to diversify.  So I was able to get a first year internship, which is unusual at a firm called Vinson and Elkins [Vinson and Elkins LLP, Houston, Texas], and that is actually where John Connally practiced after he was governor of Texas.  And that was a great experience and then the second year I interned at, clerked at Baker and Botts [Baker Botts LLP, Houston, Texas], which is of course named after James Baker's family and a very different kind of firm, and I ended up at Baker and Botts for my first big job out of, of out of law school.
Speaker 1: Okay now were you; were you one of the top students in the class?
Speaker 2: I think I was pretty good, I mean I don't remember averages.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, I think I did a pretty good job (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah once again were firms are looking to diversify?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's somebody at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: They did okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Black woman, they said well, we'll take a black woman anyway pass her off for other things (laughter) I don't know that's, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know well look I'm acutely, I'm acutely aware if that, if we're gonna go a hunting you know for diversity, maybe I want a woman.  And one I, and maybe I want one when I look at her, maybe that's not gonna be the first thing I see in my head is this is a black woman.  Look I, I know that. My problem is when I look at you, I'm looking out, I'm not looking this way (gesture).  So I have to always be reminded people look this way, they see something different from when I look out.  I'm, I'm always aware of that.  And I've seen where I've been first here or first there, and I, I know, not only am I getting advantage, but I also feel that I'm being given a responsibility as well.  'Cause I may be your way to ease it in the door, but I gotta keep that door open for other people.  For black men, for you know people of all colors, I mean I feel that, I feel that way.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's unique vantage point.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, that's right.
Story_ID: 667096
Speaker 1: Soo any--professors that stand out or fellow students [at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Lots of fellow students. First person I met is a dear, dear friend Rodney Ellis who's a se- he was a senator until very recently in Texas, one of my best friends.  And friends for life and I met a lot of folks there who, I think because we, we had that commonality of interest around legal issues probably developed more meaningful friendships than, than college.  Which is a little more random, right?  The most memorable professor turned out to be another Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] graduate, but I didn't realize he was so young.  He was actually in my first husband's [Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.] class and he was Lyndon Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] nephew, and he turned out to be a groomsman at my wedding.  But I remember he'd always want us to come and call the Princeton alumni for, for--when it was giving time, and he was my constitutional law professor a, a genius of a man.  Precocious but my goodness what, what brainpower he had and so he's most memorable.  'Cause he was still very young, but just, just, just exploding with, with innate intelligence and, and, and just this sort of academic leaning that was unparalleled just brilliant guy.
Speaker 1: So I take it he wasn't a Johnson?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: No he was Lyndon Johnson's sister's son.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah so he was not a Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 667097
Speaker 1: So you're, you're interning with Baker and Botts [Baker Botts LLP, Houston, Texas] and do, do they offer you a job while you're in law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah they offered me a job after my second summer with them, and it was interesting, they had more Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] alums there.  They're very different field, more you know very eastern in their approach to things and I'd say Vinson and Elkins [Vinson and Elkins LLP, Houston, Texas] at the time was a little, little more homegrown.  And they're both great firms but it was sort of like it was the last experience I had.  I had both of those experiences, there were only, each firm had one black male attorney, who really was the groundbreaker.  Sherman Stimley at, at Vinson Elkins unfortunately passed very, very young, but he was a terrific guy who was a mentor.  He wanted, he was really responsible for gathering young people even those still in high school.  Those interested in being lawyers, those in college, those in law school, just really trying to direct them to work in the big firms, he was a great guy.  And then at Baker and Botts, [HistoryMaker] Rufus Cormier who recently retired was the only black attorney partner at, at Baker and Botts, he was a terrific guy as well, little different manner.  But sort of austerely and calmly, confident great leader just a, a quiet man more of a quiet, quiet leader.  So I worked there for three years and, and basically the system, these are basically guys that didn't wanna hire women, I gotta tell you in that day.  And I only thing I think that really moved them was that they were having daughters who also wanted to be lawyers.  You see they have these, these movements actually just really helped propel us forward.  And they had to ask themselves why can't women work here, so there weren't that many women and they were very few, I think I was the second black person to work at the firm, so. But not a lot of mentorship overall in the firm, so I decided I should go to a corporate, a corporate law practice after that.
Story_ID: 667098
Speaker 1: Okay so you were three years and any memorable cases that you handled or?
Speaker 2: I--well--my goodness.  One of the things I really liked to do was just write briefs, I mean really found my--I was not good in front of a court.  I, my--it was great. So my first time in court was a very simple case, it was a stolen car I think we represented Avis.  And I'd go before a judge that I liked to call Roy Bean, Jr., I don't know his name, but he called me a little lady and he said, "Hey little lady why do you think you should win this case?"  And I said, okay this is not for me, and I discovered that I do not have a poker face (laughter).  This was probably--I should not be in this courtroom, but anyway, I, I won the summary judgment motion.  So I worked with another litigator who had a great case where we represented a group of sport fishermen.  So I am writing this, this, this equal protection case brief about why the ban on redfish fishing.  'Cause they were, remember blackened redfish in the day it was very popular?
Speaker 1: Blackened redfish.
Speaker 2: Yeah remember that in--Paul Prudhomme used to do it, would smoke up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yes that's right.
Speaker 2: --the whole house--
Speaker 1: That's right. In fact I saw--
Speaker 2: --in a cast iron skillet.
Speaker 1: --saw somebody eat one in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yep came out of New Orleans.
Speaker 1: --two, two nights ago, yeah.
Speaker 2: Which you a bunch of seasoning.  Anyway they had overfished commercially, redfish to do this, this blackened redfish.  But it excluded sport fisherman, so yeah it's a funny thing, but it was an equal protection case.  So I went with the lead attorney down to Matamoros, Texas [sic. Matamoros, Mexico] and I'll never forget we, we went into the courtroom and we were surround by very angry fishermen.  And that was the first time (laughter) that I ever felt like oh this could go wrong over fish.  But this is someone's livelihood.  I had a lot of great experiences at the firm [Baker Botts LLP, Houston, Texas]; I, I was involved in the sale of chemical plant.  And my mentor in the, in the litigation department, Joe Cicalone [sic. Joe Cialone], I'll never forget him, he leaned over to me and he said, "I am underutilized here," and he got up and he left me alone.  With all these guys who are selling the chemical plant so, so I had a lot of really memorable times there.  I remember working very hard. We didn't have computers, we had a pool and when you were working on a brief, I remember going in my pajamas to drop off material to be typed by the pool so it'll be ready in the morning.  I'd go to printing houses in the middle of the night, my father [John Morris] would pick me up because the printing houses were in warehouse districts.  And you would be there all night with red herrings checking offerings.  So I worked in securities and litigations and real estate, so I've been really well rounded experience there.  So it's funny because technology does away with the typing pool, it does away with slogging at the printing press, you know it makes a real difference.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 667099
Speaker 1: This takes us to about 1985, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, now, now did you get married around this time?
Speaker 2: I got married in 1985.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, good guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was working in, in Tex- in Dallas [Texas] for the Southland Corporation [7-Eleven, Inc.] and the Republican convention [1984 Republican National Convention] came to Dallas.  And I had a good friend who we'd worked together in Houston [Texas] he was at Fulbright and Jaworski [Fulbright and Jaworski LLP].  And he called me and he said, "I know you're not dating anyone," I said, "No."  He said, "Well I have a friend who's in Texas you should meet him, he's in Dallas." I said, "What's he doing here?"  And he said, "He's at the Republican convention," and I said, "I don't date Republicans, what's wrong with you," (laughter)?  And then he said, "Oh, nah you know he, he was, he was a missionary in Africa, but he was also an All-American football player and he went to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]."  So I said, "Okay I'll, I'll have, I'll, I'll go to lunch with him," so that was my, that's how I met my first husband.
Speaker 1: Okay now this is Leonard Coleman [Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes it is.
Speaker 1: Who ends up becoming the president of the National League (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was, yes.
Speaker 1: --in base- from Major League Baseball.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At one time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay so we just interviewed Jimmie.
Speaker 2: Oh Jimmie, yeah I know Jimmie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). Jimmie, Jimmie, Jimmie (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In, in Miami [Florida], right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Jimmie Lee [HistoryMaker Jimmie Lee Solomon].
Speaker 2: Jimmie Lee.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Jimmie Lee and I were on the board of the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] together.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay and he mentioned you too. So you got--now is this getting married is that one of the reasons why you moved to the East Coast?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you joined Prudential Financial [Prudential Financial, Inc.] in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Right in 1985.
Story_ID: 667100
Speaker 1: Okay all right, well tell us about that. How did, how'd you end up going to Prudential Financial [Prudential Financial, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting because as I was contemplating this move or we were planning it, you know Leonard [Morris' ex-husband, Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.] at the time was in Governor Kean's [Thomas Kean] cabinet.  And you know he knew, of course everybody in New Jersey and so was should I work at a law firm?  Should I work at a, a corporation, and I think we decided that since everything was just so busy and law firm work could be unpredictable in terms of your work hours, I should, I should narrow in on a firm.  So I , I did interview with a couple of firms, but it just so happened that I met somebody from a real estate team who worked with the guy who would be my boss, and said, "You should hire this girl."  But it didn't happen that way, my resume went to the general counsel and as it went down, the guy said, "Oh yes somebody just told me about her."  So I, I by that time I had specialized in real estate, so I joined the real estate group attorneys that advised all the real estate guys at Prudential.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had no idea by the way that a company like Prudential, which I thought was insurance company, had such an enormous real estate portfolio in real estate practice.
Speaker 1: The public knows Prudential from (singing), "Own a piece of the rock."
Speaker 2: I know why they give that up?  It's funny one of the first cases I had at Baker and Botts [Baker Botts LLP, Houston, Texas], we represented Prudential in Texas.  And we had someone who had a flood and they said, "Wait, you said your life, your home, your car, your whatever."  But you know you can't get flood insurance from anyone, it's a national program, so flood wasn't covered, so they sued Prudential and I took some depositions for Prudential back in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Full circle.
Speaker 1: So Prudential Financial is a lot of real estate you said, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay now how, how many African Americans were there when you got there, or, or women for that matter?
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you one thing not many in real estate, not many at all.  I think the firm, because, you know it's great to go through the archives and you see the old pictures of the guys in their suits sitting at long desks no women at all.  Women were, you couldn't be married, you, you know you're in a steno pool, I mean this is not unusual; this is the history of business in those days.  You know during the war [World War II, WWII], but when the guys came home, you had to go back home and women have had a very tough time in the workplace.  But there, there were quite a few I don't like--I think the East Coast you know from my experience in Texas were there were very few people of color at all working in that business where I was.  Coming to the East Coast was kind of refreshing in the fact that there were numbers of people, they had good positions.  And they were poised to move, so it was really great to see more black, mostly black men actually in real estate coming through, a couple of women.  And you know I, I got to run the office of, of lawyers for that region who were all white guys and they were great, terrific.
Speaker 1: Well were they any, was any, any particular of them like a mentor or a guide you know through the organization that kind of support you?
Speaker 2: No I have to say throughout my career, I've had very few, very close mentors and supporters very few that gave advice.  And I'm sure I'm not unlike a lot of folks who had to (laughter) find their way through it.  No. Later on there was a woman who was secretary of the company who really gave, you, really you know supported me for the job as head of the foundation [Prudential Foundation, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who I would say was a, a terrific mentor.
Speaker 1: You managed a team of legal professionals responsible for all real estate, investment activity, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, so you came in managing a team.
Speaker 2: I did not; I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of the team but in, within two years or so I, I managed a team.
Speaker 1: So you emerged from the team, right but basically--
Speaker 2: Well actually what happened was I was, I was in a regional office and then I went the, actually the corporate headquarters was kind of across the street.  And I went there to do work specifically with ERISA [Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974] and a third party business.  So we ran, we, we managed real estate for ourselves and for third parties for clients, that was fee based.  So I did that work and then I went back to, to manage the guys that I had come up with who were you know older, they were great guys.  They were professionals you know everybody had--the worse were the paralegals and the, the women.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know what they said?  Shame on me, I took a job from a man. Yeah, go figure.  You just have to ignore that (laughter) and move on, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so, oh did you know a [HistoryMaker] James G. Potter who's at Prudential?  We--
Speaker 2: That sounds familiar (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was born about the same year that you were, I don't know where it was.
Speaker 2: Potter, yeah I know that name, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I do know that name.
Speaker 1: He's somebody that we interviewed you know.
Speaker 2: Cool.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hi James (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right, I'm sure he's gonna watch all the interviews (laughter).
Speaker 2: Of course, hours and hours (laughter).
Story_ID: 667101
Speaker 1: First baby is born in '88 [1988], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Lennie [Leonard S. Coleman III].
Speaker 1: Yeah, now did, now what, what--how did that affect your career?
Speaker 2: Oh it was so interesting because I mean I took the, the requisite leave [from Prudential Financial, Inc.] but I had, I had no problem managing that.  And I, I never forget that my first review after I came back, which was sometime, there was a note in there about childcare duties.  And I became my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris]: "Excuse me, please give me instances when childcare duties have interfered with performance of my job please go."  It was nothing, it was an assumption, it was a stereotype, and he wrote that, I'm sure he never wrote it again in his life.  But I was not happy with that (laughter) not at all, so you know it was one of those things where they were getting used to dealing with professionals you know?  I watched this for a long time you know this is sort of an arch of how do we manage this?  How do we react to it, and they should've been more sensitive to it, I'm surprised they weren't, but like sensitive to saying stupid things to a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Make sense to me.
Story_ID: 667102
Speaker 1: Second child [Christiana Coleman] is born in '91 [1991], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's born in '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: Ninety [1990]? Okay.
Speaker 2: Is that right? Ninety [1990].
Speaker 1: It, it says '91 [1991] here but this--
Speaker 2: Does it really (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you, but you know better than I do.
Speaker 2: It was '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: Ninety [1990] okay, all right, all right.  So, so now in--so, were there any stories about the Prudential Financial [Prudential Financial, Inc.] before we go to the transition?
Speaker 2: The transition to?
Speaker 1: The foundation [Prudential Foundation, Newark, New Jersey], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know I thought real estate was a good blend of my interest in the place based world, real estate, and being a lawyer.  I mean I, I think that was a, a good you know melding of, of my interests.  And that was the case until the big crash in the late '90s [1990s] (laughter) when all we were doing was bankruptcy.  Oh it was really tough, well it was tougher on people who were losing money left and right.  But in terms of managing a business, you know you really were working on a bankruptcy every day.  That, that was, that was really tough, tough work, and I had the kids so at that time I, I think I took off a day maybe I worked four days a week or three days a week.  It was just you know business was drying up and basically we were settling, settling accounts if you will, so not very creative.  You know it was fun before, yeah so it was getting to be tough.
Story_ID: 667103
Speaker 1: Is it like George H.W. Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] was president around this time, right I think (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he was, before that he was running for governor of Texas and he was a great friend of my ex-husband's [Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.] who was in baseball.  Even though George owned an American League team, they both had the common interest in politics.
Speaker 1: You're talking about George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush], W. now?
Speaker 2: Oh dub, W. (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, H.W.--
Speaker 2: W.
Speaker 1: --was president of the United States but--
Speaker 2: Oh you're telling me George, that George Bush.
Speaker 1: --H.W. was pres- president and George W. was the pres- was the owner--
Speaker 2: Owner of the--
Speaker 1: --of the baseball team [Texas Rangers], yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I'm trying to remember when he ran for governor 'cause he, he did come to New Jersey to do a fundraiser (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah he, yeah I, yeah he may have been running about that time you know because he--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I can't remember how old the kids were.
Speaker 1: --was governor before he ran for--
Speaker 2: But he was a guest at our home. I, I really enjoyed him, he was actually a great guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah they say he has a good of sense of humor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Great sense of humor.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah he went out for a run in the neighborhood (laughter) he was a good guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah well then, the, well this I guess it happens later on but the, the State of Texas kind of what, but you're living in New Jersey now, right?
Speaker 2: I'm living in Jersey now been here on the East Coast for so long it's, you know, it's going back to visit family and that's pretty much my connection to Texas.
Story_ID: 667104
Speaker 1: So now you--you move over to the Prudential Foundation [Newark, New Jersey] as president in '94 [1994] right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: So you went in as president? Of the foundation.
Speaker 2: I did. Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were looking for a new leader. The foundation has actually been around since 1977 and they had a, a couple of people who had moved from different parts of the company [Prudential Financial, Inc.].  And the insurance part and the investment part and they brought an outsider in who had more non-profit experience in running a foundation.  And he was there for about four years so they were looking for a new leader so about sixteen of my fellow attorneys and I (laughter) wanted to get out of the legal department.  Along with who knows how many other folks (laughter) applied to be president of the foundation, and, I, you know, and this is where my motto fake it 'til you make it comes from.  You know people will see a job requirement that has thirty requirements you must you know jump high, you must swim low, you must do, and people get turned off by that.  Or they get intimidated and the realization is nobody's gonna have all of them.  That was the first time I realized that wait a minute, everybody's not gonna have that, you go, you know, sell what you have.
Speaker 1: Yeah what you're saying is very important (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause the, a lot of job descriptions do have so many qualifications--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that it's probably impossible to find anybody with all, all of them, right?
Speaker 2: Right, but people don't really know that especially if you haven't been looking for a different kind of job for a few years.  You know it's good to be--I, I remind my children when they're in the job market, fake it 'til you make it.  Don't assume everybody's got everything more than you do, you go for it.  And so actually when I applied the, you know the person ahead of that said, "I was hoping you would."  Because I had, unlike a lot of folks, a lot of non-profit experience, a lot of board of governors experience.  You know I mentioned this briefly about my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] creating organizations, but you know but I learned service from my mother and my father [John Morris].  My father volunteered for when he was in, in corps and he was in a Catholic group for vocations.  And they, they both you know took time outside of what they did every day to give some kind of service.  My mother was pilot at the Head Start program in Houston [Texas] when I was nine so I, I used to do that with her.  I'd go out and I'd give out milk and you know I would work the program with her.  So I, I learned that from her and when I graduated from law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas], I was on my first board, which was a mental health board.  And an art board ensemble in Houston and when I came up here I did the same thing, so I'd been on a whole theatre company.  I been on another mental health board and so they were looking for people who in addition to you know the skills you bring as an attorney or whatever else you do in business, you've got some notion of what a non-profit organization is with volunteerism is, what service is.  And I believe that was my competitive edge as they say.  I, I had a notion of what it was like.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To be there, yeah.
Story_ID: 667105
Speaker 1: So you come in as president and what, what state was the foundation [Prudential Foundation, Newark, New Jersey] in when you, when you started?  Who were they giving money to and what were their priorities?
Speaker 2: Right, I you know and I'd say at the time it was still the profession if you will was in its infancy, infancy.  And they had just done a reorg to say we gonna focus on children and that was the name of the--the focus on children.  And then they had education, they had all the other.  But they had been giving to about nine different categories of work, and they were more pr- reactive to what was coming in the box.  And I think over the course of the years I was there, I think we progressed with the industry.  And in really modeling ourselves after some of the big private foundations, you know starting with what are we trying to achieve?  What's your theory of change you know how are you implementing these programs, how are you evaluating non-profits?  How are you extending technical assistance and capacity building, this is what we're here for.  We're here to help them do their work, do their work better, to help people.  And so that was a really wonderful challenge, and one day I said you know you can focus on children all you want, but if you don't help their parents, you're not going anywhere.  And that was a real beginning for us of something very common a two generation strategy.  The children live and learn best when they're in solid family situations, whatever that looks like for something that kids can count on.  And I just always thought that and, and sort of education putting models in place, parents know what good education looks like.  I think those are hallmarks of some of the early work that I was really interested in.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so what, what would a typical grant be for; I mean what, what was the range of grants?
Speaker 2: I would say maybe ten to--ten thousand dollars to a million dollars over three years, a lil- I would say a million dollars is probably the largest typical grant.  However, there were big projects important in Newark [New Jersey] like the Newark Per- New Jersey Performing Arts Center [Newark, New Jersey].  Where the, the support was in the millions of dollars, if you will, over now it's more than twenty years old.  And it was wonderful to be at the beginning of a concept which was if you build it they will come.  And when they come, they'll make everything else work together, right so it's a hub center that's important in so many ways.  You know even as a symbol for people and you know despite what's going on, the arts are really key to you know our humanity.  And I will do anything to make sure that we continue to be able to express ourselves as hu- as people.
Speaker 1: Okay now what about--did, were, were there grants for African American art and Latino art you know the like, like expansion arts support like for--
Speaker 2: Well you know I think that most of the strategy was around place right, so things happen in a space.  My chairman used to say everything that happens nationally happens locally first.  So we picked some spots where we want to do work whether it be you know Los Angeles [California] or, or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], wherever it is.  You, maybe you pick a neighborhood you know because you have to support things on two levels you know a macro level and a micro level.  So the neighborhood we picked was in Newark, New Jersey where our majority populations were African American.  You know a, I would say it was colorblind to that extent you know we're gonna help who's in the neighborhood.  Our neighborhood in Philadelphia was mostly Latino, and so the arts groups were predominantly Hispanic.  And you know that, that was a system so we were working with systems and you know, pretty much they were place based.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay any, any groups on the low end of the, of the fi- financial scale stand out that you--
Speaker 2: Well you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) supported?
Speaker 2: It's important yeah when you're getting granular and local you know ten thousand dollars is a lot of money to an organization with a five hundred thousand budget, right?  So you might be your Boys and Girls Clubs of Newark [sic. Boys and Girls Club of Newark, Newark, New Jersey] and it might be La Casa de Don Pedro [Newark, New Jersey] you know might be the Ironbound Community Center [Newark, New Jersey].  These were all critical cogs in the fabric where they touch people on a very local level.  And I would say we should be very proud of in, in, in our programs giving people enough to get something done.  You know you don't why throw a crumb at somebody who needs a slice?  Or in our Social Investment Program [of Prudential Financial, Inc.] where we're not gonna charge you so much interest that you can't afford it, you know.  It's really about results. How do we peop- get people or allow people to achieve results that they're looking for?
Story_ID: 667106
Speaker 1: I remember going to a conference in Newark [New Jersey] in 1990 and--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990]?
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I just remember being there for a week, a weekend and just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a tough time.
Speaker 1: --thinking how crummy Newark was, it was just horrible.  It was a, one of the worst places I'd ever seen, I mean the neighborhood was falling down.  And you know recently I guess maybe about five years ago I went back to Newark for an interview, it improved so much.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was there, is there any, did Prudential play a role in the (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I think that was part of the challenge is that you know sort of the big building with the rock on it.  That's where everyone looks.  And I'd say one of the, the, the hallmark achievements now is to make that kind of funding more diverse.  You know obviously Prudential can't fund all of it, but I think it's like R and D [research and development] was in the old days.  What's the catalytic investment, what's gonna be the thing that you find and that you make happen that's gonna make other things happen?  And I, I think that's really important for that sort of big you know hundred pound gorilla, no a gorilla weighs more, right, six hundred pound gorilla.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter) a hundred pound is very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very small (laughter) baby gorilla (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is to, you know say not that I'm taking it all but I'm inviting you to help me, help us build a community together, you know it's important.
Speaker 1: Okay I'm gonna have to remember that hundred pound gorilla (laughter).
Speaker 2: He's not very threatening that one (laughter).
Speaker 1: So okay so what, is there like a, a, major, I mean one, one of these projects in, in New Jersey that, that was that catalyst or you know that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I mentioned the performing arts center [New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, New Jersey] and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it always will be because it, in it, 'cause it's very visible, right?  But the biggest an- issue in these communities now is the quality of our education, that's nothing you can see and touch.  But lots of people will write about it and having been for more than sort of twenty-five years looking at the history of state takeover and what happens to children in the middle of that you know?  So maybe it's great we build some new schools and new schools are important.  Because new spaces say a lot of things to kids about your worth it, we're here for you.  But mostly it's been funding programs around training teachers, training leaders, training parents.   These are things that are not visible but hopefully become a part of that fabric that helps to support what goes on you know going forward.
Speaker 1: Now Prudential supported at one time more than half of all the charter schools--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in New Jersey, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I had a great leader of a Social Investment Program [of Prudential Financial, Inc.] who said, "You know this charter school movement," this was (laughter) twenty years ago, "is gonna be important, can we sit for a moment," people need to do more of this, "sit for a moment and think about what kind of contribution with our resources we can make to this?"  And the answer at that time was to help fund what we called educational entrepreneurs. Because the fact was the schools got paid in arrears.  So you had to spend the money first.  We were meeting dedicated men and women who mortgaged their homes, who sold their cars, who put their own money on the line to try to make education better for children.  So why couldn't we give them money up front, and when they got repaid or compensated by the state, they paid us back.  So we think that was a very catalytic way to support people who were putting their own lives on the line for children.  And that's how we ended up funding so many of the local schools and then these big programs like your KIPPs and your North Stars [North Star Academy Charter School of Newark, Newark, New Jersey] and these you know big systems for charter schools.
Speaker 1: Now KIPP is Knowledge is Power Program.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what is that exactly?
Speaker 2: What is it? Well it's a, it's, it, it's probably easiest to describe as a big holding company with a, a philosophy of teaching and, and systems in administration that go into local communities.  And receive local support for, for individual schools.  So in Newark now they have a quite a number of charter schools.  And unlike some of these reports on how charters are doing in some cases no better than public schools, KIPP schools in Newark are the exception.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now when you're there [Prudential Foundation, Newark, New Jersey] you hosted New Jersey's first statewide educational summit, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  You know this was a time when they were (makes sound), thinking about national standards for schools, you know how revolutionary.  That kids across our country should all learn and achieve at the same, the same materials.  Or at least basic minimum standards, so you know it's communication in, in getting people involved is really critical to any effort that you wanna put forward.  You know we, we've seen that in some of what's happening in politics that if you want support, then you better make sure people understand what it is you're trying to do.  And get input from the people who count: children and parents.
Story_ID: 667107
Speaker 1: So when you look back at, at your time there, did, did you--how did you I guess shape Prudential's [Prudential Foundation, Newark, New Jersey] philanthropic--philanthropic mission?
Speaker 2: I, I would think I would say being passionate by being proactive, letting people know that we were there for them.  Making it clear what it is that we would support and by demanding and expecting results for the investments that we made.  It wasn't free money, it wasn't giveaway money, it was an investment in our communities.
Story_ID: 667108
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about couple more efforts here. Global Volunteer Day.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). Well you know I'd like to say we're at the forefront of a lot of things, you know corporate folks it's like getting out of your office.  What's in the world, who are working for, providing an outlet and interface for people to go out and give some kind of service to communities?  And our employees [at Prudential Financial, Inc.] loved it, and they loved it because they were able to bring their kids.  The kids need to be global citizens and they know it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now, now was that done in any kind of way in conjunction with Day of National Service [sic. National Service Recognition Day] with AmeriCorps or--
Speaker 2: We were before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were pioneers and we--part, part of my group was community outreach group and working with employees on, not just volunteering on one day, but we like to say it was symbol for what our employees do.  And why we equipped them to serve every day in their communities, right?  So it was symbolic but it was also you know to let the world know what kind of people work for us.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now what about community stewardship?
Speaker 2: What, what context is that?
Speaker 1: Well I thought, I thought it was a program is, it?
Speaker 2: I thi- it's part of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Community stewardship.
Speaker 2: --the same thing where--
Speaker 1: Same thing okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's concept rather than a program.
Speaker 2: Right and, and part of that is matching folks you know, you have certain interests, let me, let me find an opportunity that matches your interest.
Speaker 1: Okay that's the volunteer match that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.
Story_ID: 667109
Speaker 1: You developed the young entrepretun- entrepreneurs program [Prudential Young Entrepreneur Program] with Prudential [Prudential Foundation, Newark, New Jersey] too in 1999, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow, real trip down memory lane (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, this is like 'Queen for a Day' (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wow well you go further back.  You know people don't grow up and say I wanna work for that company.  You know a lot of kids in these neighborhoods you, you do know what you see, you know what you see.  And so many of them do have skills to run businesses, they just don't have information.  So we, we sponsored lots of kids, I mean if you go and you sell socks in a kiosk in a mall that's fabulous.  'Cause you know that means, that means you've taken controlled of your destiny, so you know when people come here from other countries, they, they're not thinking about I'm gonna go work for Exxon Mobil [Exxon Mobil Corporation] .  They figure out they think about the countries they come from, you have to be enterprising and love yourself.  So I think, in a recent article about the, the dearth and the reduction of number of black business.  What, what did our forefathers do? They started businesses, they owned radio stations, they owned newspapers, they owned cleaners, they owned the barbershop.  Our, our kids are missing that skillset so you know it was the beginning of this sort of movement around inculcating this idea of, what is entrepreneurship but self-reliance.  I just think we need, you know we can't teach that enough.  Even if you're in a company, I want you to be entrepreneurial, that's never a wasted skill.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so how many, how many stu- so you launched this in '99 [1999] and how, how many students did you launch it with?
Speaker 2: We did it in several markets so we also did it in connection with, with colleges, community colleges with entrepreneurial centers.  And it's really about connecting young people with resources that they can depend on for the future.  So in Newark [New Jersey] we worked with Rutgers [Rutgers University - Newark] in the business incubator there, just hundreds of kids.  It was great; it involved people who owned businesses coming in to mentor young people with businesses.  It was idea whose, whose time had come I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay I have here a note that, that the program participants received nine weeks of classroom instruction, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And ongoing mentorship and the opportunity to apply for start up loans of up to fifteen thousand--
Speaker 2: Fifteen thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: --dollars.
Speaker 2: You got good notes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm glad it's right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --I had done a, I had done an interview about this and the reporter kept saying, "So what's in it for Prudential?"  I'm like, "Excuse me, what's in it?" And so I was explaining this and the loans, and they said, "Ah, that's it, you make money on the loans" (laughter). And I was like, "No," (laughter), "it's a revolving fund, when they pay it back it goes to another student."  So it's interesting the amount of skepticism that's out there and I love talking to the press I don't know if Prudential PR [public relations] like me to do it but, just to correct some of these impressions.
Story_ID: 667110
Speaker 1: Now you were with Prudential [Prudential Foundation, Newark, New Jersey] how--are, are you still with Prudential?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, you're not (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I retired from Prudential.
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought you did.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So when did you retire from Prudential?
Speaker 2: Let me think nine- 2012.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so while at Prudential that's, that's when you get involved with United States Artists, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's one of the programs, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well the reason we joined it is because there was a component of this that was focused on artist housing.  And because of our involvement with the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark [New Jersey] and looking at the work of Strickland in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] you know we had this concept that artists were sort of the original urban renewal artists, because they take chances, they go into places and they, they, they just create these exciting spaces.  So this program was to use a panel to find the fifty artists in seven categories around.  You know visual artist, writers, dancers, weavers the seven categories of artist and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah became the thinking--just, I just wanna go back to that so people don't miss this who- whoever's watching this--became a, a theory of development that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --if you had a rundown slum or something was falling apart, everybody had abandoned--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then artists, if you can get artists to move in and support their rent and support--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Right.
Speaker 1: --their rent in some kind of way, then you might have like a, the core for development--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --around it, and Pittsburgh did that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And right, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah he wrote a book called 'The Creative Class' ['The Rise of the Creative Class,' Richard Florida] and there's a model that cities were using, like in Atlanta [Georgia] for instance Mtamanika Youngblood was using that while in the area where Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] grew up.  In creating loft space, it was a very exciting time.
Speaker 1: Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that--we were gonna give, we, the, the creators were going to do, it was a collaborative of funders, fifty thousand dollar grants to fifty artists.  And today they're holding celebrations in Chicago [Illinois] celebrating the tenth anniversary of the United States Artists.   So I was really honored to be a part of that original class, so that, that was kind of the Prudential thinking in that it got a little more difficult.  So the artist housing actually bifurcated off and it was, it was left to be a program that celebrated artists.  So but in its early days I think artists housing was the focus and that's why we were interested in it.  But it's, there're lot of great artists out there, I learned that.

Speaker 1: In 2007 you were in, you were on the founding board of directors of the Brick City Development Corporation.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah it was Newark's answer to an economic development authority, I think today it's probably, it marched back as a department in Newark [New Jersey].  But you know there were including a visitors bureau, convention bureau not that the space was there.  But in terms of visioning what can happen for the city, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's the first effort to really get an outside look at planning, outside in look at planning for Newark.
Speaker 1: Okay now Cory Booker was the mayor then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes let me see, was he mayor? I, god, I was around Newark so long from Sharpe James to Cory, yes.  So it was, was transitioning at that, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But Cory did create the Brick City it was done under his, his leadership.
Speaker 1: Okay and later on was renamed the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, right?
Speaker 2: No that was, actually that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No?
Speaker 2: --that authority preceded Brick City. So Brick City--
Speaker 1: Oh so that was, okay that was--
Speaker 2: That was a little back--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah Brick City was--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --really taking over some of those efforts from NEDC [sic. NCEDC] yes.
Story_ID: 667112
Speaker 1: In the interim--oh now in 2009 you remarried and we didn't say that you were divorced before.  But you got divorced in--
Speaker 2: Forgot to do that.
Speaker 1: Before and af- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: --(laughter) and then, then you married Dennis Brownlee--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who had been in school with you at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was, he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Somebody, a fellow classmate.
Speaker 2: We dated and now he's older, he was a senior and I was a freshman (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That happens a lot I, I find that people go through life.  He lost his wife and you know I divorced [from Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.] and you know so somebody you knew back, and you know they get together.  It's, it's actually quite common these days, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did he have children too?
Speaker 2: He did, he had two children, he had a girl, and a boy I had a boy [Leonard S. Coleman III] and a girl [Christiana Coleman], so we now have four.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Grown children.
Story_ID: 667113
Speaker 1: All right now as--in your position as president of the Prudential Foundation [Newark, New Jersey] you're called upon to speak publically quite a bit, right?
Speaker 2: Quite a bit, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or you, or you were, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so what tell us about the dynamics of that. Do--you know.
Speaker 2: Well there couple of ways that you, you know communicate broadly; I'd say one was press and so Prudential had a communications department.  They try to script you and try to stay on script and sometimes you would and you wouldn't.  Because you, you know they have a corporate point of view, and I might have a community point of view.  But that was fine and it was, because it was more casual. But the many times it was a lot of public speaking to large groups of people, both internally and externally.  So you know many times they try to write a speech for me but yeah I'd end up writing myself.  Because you know, I would know what I wanna say, so I always ended it with a lot of apprehension.  But it's like going to a party, maybe I don't really wanna go but when I get there I really do have a good time.  You know so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it worked out fine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So would you speak to community functions when they have their, their fundraising dinners and that kind of, that kind of thing, or would it be--?
Speaker 2: Yeah many times, so in, in many cases we, I got boxes of trophies and plaques and you know part of this job is to realize it's not personal (laughter).  It's not about you. So I, I took very seriously the responsibility to represent the company [Prudential Financial, Inc.] and, and all my colleagues.  And, and to really give a speech that wasn't dopey you know, just hey thanks but to try to leave something meaningful on the table for people.  And to just to give a sense that that we were serious about what we were doing.  And sometimes they would be major addresses to folks where there was no plaque involved (laughter) so.  I've had lots of experiences and my mother [Elise LeNoir Morris] was an incredible speaker and very natural.  But with that voice that we love to imitate it was a way of speaking; I don't know what (enunciates) southern women and enunciation--we always used to make fun of her.  But (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sure your mother had the, had the, was that the way she talked?
Speaker 2: Yes we--when (enunciates) she gave us speech you know enunciate you'll remember you spoke with me.  (Laughter) She was a real card.
Speaker 1: When you mentioned George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush] I know he, he used to do that, maybe though he was raised in Maine wasn't he, but he, he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah Maine.
Speaker 1: But he said--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he tended to say even his name (enunciates) George W. Bush you know he--
Speaker 2: Did he?  Well you know there were a lot of, of women, southern women, black women it, you know (makes sound).  Speaking and presentation and posture and boy there was a way about, a way about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't do that but I took my cue from her sort of what she said, trying to reach people, you know that's what I, attempted to do.  Even though as I said I was trepidatious (laughter).
Story_ID: 667114
Speaker 1: All right now tell us about Newark Trust. You're on the board of directors at Newark Trust.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For education.
Speaker 2: Yeah that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Newark Trust for Education [Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Really more that struggle to involve a larger community in what we were gonna do about education.  There's a really good book I read a cou- last month about what happened with the, the Zuckerberg [Mark Zuckerberg] grant, the $100 million grant.  That came to Newark [New Jersey] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is Facebook--
Speaker 2: --would--yeah the Facebook guy, and remember, remember that that Cory Booker and Governor Christie [Chris Christie] all made this big appearance on Oprah ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'].  And it, it's a really good history of takeover in New Jersey, and the forces that come to bear to try to give some direction to school reform.  So the Newark Trust for Education was supposed to you know was, was created to be a trust in repository of information of research.  Just to help guide education reform in Newark.  It's, it's very tough environment. I--anybody interested in education reform should, should read this and, and see how fast a hundred million dollars can be disseminated for these efforts.  Many people are very fond of saying, oh my gosh, what do you use fifteen thousand dollars a student, twenty thousand a student.  It's a, it's a pretty complex situation and, and I found that everyone involved in education over the years has been always well meaning.
Speaker 1: Did the money do much good?
Speaker 2: The money got the district out of a situation where teachers in fulfilling a contract and it did bring the first performance evaluation system to the district.  And that had been something that was very contentious over the years.  But you know most people who are employed get some kind of reform- performance feedback, so it's not an uncommon concept.
Story_ID: 667115
Speaker 1: Well tell us about Hatchfund.
Speaker 2: Hatch?
Speaker 1: Hatchfund. That, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What is that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter). Well it's in this outline--
Speaker 2: I'm thinking--
Speaker 1: --and I'm not sure why--
Speaker 2: --let's see, Hatch?
Speaker 1: 'Cause I didn't make the outline.
Speaker 2: I need context for Hatch.
Speaker 1: Hatchfund is an artist--is to--it raises money for arts projects and artists through posting them to an online community and matching them with support to find funding for their specific project.
Speaker 2: I don't, that's not, that's not mine, but it sounds like a great idea. It's kind of (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay well let's forget that one then we'll go onto--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in 2012 you founded Connective advertise- Advisors [Connective Advisors LLC] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Advisors, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this, and this is after you retired--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or as you were retiring?
Speaker 2: You know sort of after I retired and you know I think there was some prompt question about sort of difficult transition points.  And I think after just sort of an exhaustive career of, of doing all this very external work, thinking what were the assets that I want to use going forward, that's why I created that.  I had so much experience in non-profit management and, and governance. So that was my idea of how I was going to spend the next part of my career.  And I did a couple of projects, I did some RFPs [request for proposals], I worked with the West Coast advisor and then I got a client actually someone we had funded before.  And I worked with them on some great projects marketing, communications, diversity, and then they asked me to come for them.  So kind, that was kind of the (laughter) the life history of Connective Advisors.
Speaker 1: So is that the U.S.--
Speaker 2: U.S. Fund for UNICEF [United States Fund for UNICEF], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, UNICEF, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 667116
Speaker 1: All right, now I didn't ask you about the Harlem School for the Arts [sic. Harlem School of the Arts, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I think that comes even before, before we get you in UNICEF [United States Fund for UNICEF].
Speaker 2: Yeah I think that would be--happen about the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had been on the board of Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and had retired from that board, and some folks I knew who had some crossover.  You know they know you're interested in your arts, and I'll tell you this, this for kids and in very different.  And, but it starts, it always starts with the kids, so I always had a soft spot even my work with the New Jersey Performing Arts Center [Newark, New Jersey].  And the women's board [New Jersey Performing Arts Center Women's Association] you know we focus on, on art, young artists.  And even if you don't become the greatest pianist or the greatest dancer, you know I'm just not saying this.  Research supports the value of the artistic expression in anything that you would do in the future.  So this is a school that works after hours on Saturdays teaching kids in visual arts, dance you, you name it.  Script writing, musical instruments, it's a fantastically lively place that is seated you know in the heart of Harlem [New York, New York].  And you know in effort to make sure that we can raise enough money to sustain the building that we have to provide scholarships to kids whose parents can't afford.  This is what's happening because when you take arts out of the school, where do kids go to express themselves or start on a career?  That We McDonald, you might've seen her on 'The Voice,' she can tell you right there, she started singing at the Harlem School of the Arts.  And can't say enough about the encouragement she received and the stretch goals that, that really propelled her, and she came in second.
Speaker 1: Was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fantastic.
Speaker 1: --was Dorothy Maynard still around when you--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They named--the building is named after her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the people around here will, will know that the, the school fell into a bad shape financially.  And Bloomberg [Michael Bloomberg] tapped two folks who are both friends of mine to chair a, a revival of the school, and really with the help of the Herb Alpert Foundation.  Really just set this, the school on a new course and we have a new dir- executive director in Eric Pryor [Eric G. Pryor] who's a fantastic arts leader.  It's a very exciting time for the school.  But that's kind of what I (laughter) I, I really get excited about, these kind of projects.
Speaker 1: Okay Herb Alpert Foundation, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Tijuana Brass [Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass] (laughter).
Speaker 2: 'Girl from Ipanema' ['The Girl from Ipanema'] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Nice to see he's using all that wisely and wonderfully to help you know steward younger kids.
Story_ID: 667117
Speaker 1: Okay so in 2014 you were named senior vice president of the In-Kind Assistance Corporation in the UNICEF Bridge Fund.
Speaker 2: That's a mouthful isn't it (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah UNICEF Bridge Fund, so tell us about the UNICEF Bridge Fund and In-Kind Assistance Corporation.
Speaker 2: So the, the name is simply a holding company. In kind means you know for the work of UNICEF [United States Fund for UNICEF] they accept donations of, of things that will be used.  Like, like medicines and vaccinations, but that is just the place for the Bridge Fund.  The fellow who asked me to do this, I've known for many years, we both worked a lot in community development.  And we both saw that financing really helped to propel the creation of affordable housing units with a low income tax credit.  His idea was why can't we use some sort of financing to help in humanitarian field in the developing world?  What, what can we do, how can we use financing?  So he really created the Bridge Fund.  And it's very simply a way to get money to the field faster so it's an accelerant.  So you give me a grant but you're not gonna give me a check for three months.  Meanwhile, children are dying from famine, I gotta get that money there now, and because I'm a United Nations organization I can't borrow?  I have to have all the money I need right now to start a project.  So Bridge Fund has provided funds that get to the field immediately.  So that's what I do now, and it's interesting because it impact investing was a small part of my role at Prudential [Prudential Financial, Inc.].  It was one of the four areas that I, I oversaw and so now I'm just these days focused on this one particular fund, in terms of making sure we have enough funds available.  And that we interface with UNICEF and that we understand what's going on around the world so that we can get money and supplies there faster.
Speaker 1: Now as we speak here today there are, there's a huge crisis in South Sudan--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Somalia has a crisis--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So does North East Nigeria yeah you know and there other places around the world, so I mean what, what's?
Speaker 2: Wow you, you really hit on some, some interesting hotspots, Nigeria in particular.  You know Nigeria is the last endemic country with polio in Africa, and we had actually got it down to the elimination stage.  Which is right before eradication, and let the Boko Haram uprisings, you know you can't get into these villages and inoculate people.  And when there's a break in the action, these warriors from UNICEF go in and inoculate these children against polio.   It, it's amazing.
Speaker 1: And you call them warriors because of their courage, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely I, I think that, that sort of, the greatest gift has been given to me is to meet all kinds of warriors for people in the work that I do.  I can't say I'm a warrior, but I'm a warrior for warriors how about that (laughter)?  Afghanistan, will we ever get in there?  You know, the distress, the cultural issues. That's the other last place where there's polio.  And you're right Sudan has a famine, people don't know that. As a matter of fact, UNICEF deals with over two hundred emergencies every year, people don't know that.  So, so it's been a real privilege for me to get inside and to work with people who really are at the frontlines of where people are just dying, children are dying.  They're dying for reasons that don't have to exist.
Speaker 1: So is there any particular place that you have--do you, do you have a good story about I guess or, a good story where the culture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know the, the best stories I have to say in terms of our ability, it, it you know it's a shame that it gets this, right?  But there's a product the, that was created by a French farm and it's called ready-to-use therapeutic food.  It is a concentrated nutritious bar that's made mainly with peanuts.  And if you get this to children who are malnourished, you will save them.  And one of the first things Bridge Fund did was in Burkina Faso, saved hundreds of children from certain death.  We're doing the same things in South Sudan, but we're having a funding issue, there's a gap.  We're working right now to see if we can get some of this RUTF to South Sudan, but you know it's, it's war.  It, it's very, it's--we see this all the time, the refugee crisis now, refugees coming out of Syria, they can't get into Jordan anymore.  Jordan is packed, they stop at the border, there's no water.  So we work with a donor to help to reestablish boreholes to fe- to get water to ten thousand people every day.  De- I can give you stories about how people are suffering around the world it, it's.  And you know it just always reminds me of the starfish story, you know that with the kid throwing the starfish back.
Speaker 1: No what's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he said, "You can't help all of these star- look how many starfish, it's not gonna matter," and he says, "It's gonna matter to that one.  It's gonna matter to the one I save."  So the fact that you can't save them all doesn't mean that you shouldn't try.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667118
Speaker 1: Now you've also, you've been a board member of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], right?
Speaker 2: That is, that is kind of core central to me, because LDF has made such a difference in the lives of black people.  It has made, you know foundationally legally it's, it's, it's just key, it's everything to me.  From voting rights to Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]. My, my--Leonard's [Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.] uncle was part of the team for the Delaware case.  You know it's just kind of central to my family and to what I believe in terms of leveling the playing field in fighting fairly.  Yeah I, I can't even tell you how long I've been on the board (laughter) more than, more than a decade now.  Probably I'm senior status probably I've been here so long (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667119
Speaker 1: You mentioned before you were on the board of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for many years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you, I, I guess you knew Alvin Ailey there during the time period?
Speaker 2: I'm not that old (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, no? No he had passed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did not know him, I'm gonna tell you and I've said this before; I had the distinction and the great honor of, of receiving an award from Alvin Ailey--from the, the company.  But my first knowledge of Alvin Ailey, I don't know how I was watching television and it was his funeral.  And they were doing the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He had a--
Speaker 2: --ce- 'Revelation' [sic. 'Revelations,' Alvin Ailey].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well the final piece of 'Revelation,' and I saw this and I was, and they had a big picture of him.  And I just remem- I was at home, I was in Texas and I was watching this.  And I mean just the, the serendipity of one day being on this board and helping to continue the work of this guy from Texas, this poor boy from Texas.  It's like you know it's, it's, it's very meaningful and it was great. They're doing very well, so.
Story_ID: 667120
Speaker 1: Stanford University Center for Social Innovation [Stanford, California]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well I think that--and I was talking earlier about the, the professionalizing the corporate practice.  So you know there's a couple of schools, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] have a program, I've been to that one, and Stanford and I like to, to take and make sure that people who work with me have this experience to hear the academics and the scholars talk about this.  But I, I always found, it's part of my can I go back to fake it 'til you make it 'cause they're certainly faking it.  My apologies, because a lot of people have never worked in the field, so I think it's important for us to show up as well.  You know I believe in collaborative learning environment, so that you know hopefully they learn as much about what actually happens on the ground as we learn from their academic and scholarly approach to basically field building.  Which is very important 'cause it'll, it should be respected as work people do that you know that matters, it's very important.  So you know I had a great experience there, I met all kinds of people and, and you, you know as I said it's a, a great collaborative learning environment.
Story_ID: 667121
Speaker 1: Now you retired from one position already and you're--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I'm not afraid to do it again (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right. So what's your future, what do you see in the future (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a great question, I, there's so much I wanna do, and I have so many interests.  You know right now I'm working on getting a, a product patented because you know I'm a woman in the world and you know, I, I'd like to think there're some things I can improve upon that we do.  I see--you know when you get to be this age, it's like you're, you feel like you're a master of a lot of things very broadly.  And you know I'd like to go on, you know, keep consulting maybe and just doing this work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have no other grand design, I think I should, but you know I'm a true believer of in serendipity and when opportunity meets preparation.  That that's where the, the lightning happens, so.
Story_ID: 667122
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: Yes I, I say this to people all the time, I, I mentor young people and I look at resumes and people ask me to check things.  And I get resume envy which means boy you've done a lot of different fun things you know.  So I, I always struggle is it better to have built a strong deep body of work in one place?  Or would it have been better to have many different experiences in, and experience growth that way?  'Cause I'm interested in, in growth and contribution.  So I can't say I have any regrets but I do have that little envy of you know people and maybe it's more 21st century moving around a lot more and, and having different kinds of, of inputs.  So yeah I, I guess that would be something I would consider.
Story_ID: 667123
Speaker 1: Well looking back again at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, I wouldn't say I had a particular legacy other than my children which is of course what everybody would say.  But I have some great kids and you know I think we live on through you know what we leave, and not just, not a building.  But I think it's that I was able to assist people who are doing great things, and I think that's been my joy and my legacy and my opportunity.
Story_ID: 667124
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well you know I, I have a lot.  A couple of years ago people were talking about the schism between you know blacks who've made it.  And those who are, perhaps you would say are left behind, who are not prepared to go forward.  I have a lot of concern about what's happening with a core group of folks who are not getting out of the neighborhood.  Who are not being educated properly, who are not getting skills for 21st century workforce, who don't have hope and who don't have vision.  We have to do something about that, you know I, I look at Africans who come here.  I look at what happens with college admissions; I look at a great group of people who grew up thinking and knowing that they were a dominant culture.  That didn't have the chains and the barriers to them that are occasioned by our race who were enslaved.  They don't carry that burden; they're allowed to have a vision of being the greatest whatever in the world.  And I'm afraid that even after all this time, that burden has not been lifted from that community.  If you live what you learn and you learn what you live, that's what you know, how do we break that?  So I, I'm very concerned about it, and I'm happy to see a lot of peop- people are digging in trying to improve education.  Trying to you know awaken kids to technical skills and jobs and opportunities that are out there, but it's you know it, it I think it's still a, a big, big issue for us.  And even when I talk about to my friends about embracing just look in your family.  You have people who maybe aren't achieving, who don't get it, maybe you're the lucky one, and they say I don't have anything in common with them.  Well of course we do, so I think we need to continue to work on seeing the, the, the commonality and the, you know the way we can help each other.
Story_ID: 667125
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned your family, and, if you can give us a little bit more detail here.  Your husband [Dennis Brownlee] works with you on, in Connective Advisors [Connective Advisors LLC], right and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah he had a long career at iHeartRadio [iHeartMedia Inc.], he's been an entrepreneur, he was--actually laid the groundwork for what is now TV One; that was his company.  And he's doing his own thing in entertainment right now, and doing some productions, so you know I'm glad it's his dream, and I, I really love that.  And it's never too late to pursue your dreams so I'm happy to support him doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay and you have four children now, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah we have four and you know they didn't meet until they were all young adults and I think they, they're, they're each their own individual.  They're very distinctive, they bring different things when we get together.  And we have, you know we have a family vacation and you know that's one of the things we used to do my family, August was vacation time.  Because that's when the, my father [John Morris] got the month off, you know so that was one of the things we always did.  So we try to do that and stay connected at least through that, but most of them live in the area.  And my son [Leonard S. Coleman III] actually works about four blocks from me and I never see him so I get to (laughter) get to needle him on that, so.  And he's very supportive, I'm trying to find my birth family and my husband has always been encouraging on that front.  And actually it's my children who want to know this information, I've lived all these years without knowing it, and it works for me.  But you know I want, that's another thing I want to leave them is more information about you know the, their, their DNA, if you will.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667126
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't mentioned that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh the penultimate question (laughter), no I, I--it's very great wide ranging conversation, I don't think you missed anything.
Speaker 1: All right, well okay.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little different. Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think the concept of, of enabler in my own way is--first of all I mean I'd like to be thought of as someone who didn't just take up space on the planet.  You know I--as someone who made a contribution to, to society you know I really do.  And, and if that contribution is to help other people to do it, then so be it.

And you know we often were, were featured either honoring him as a president of the National League and that was a real thrill and dream for him.  And we did a lot of entertaining and cooking in those days.
