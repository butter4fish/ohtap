Story_ID: 76788
Speaker 1: Let me ask you some questions about your family background.  How far back can you trace your family?  I mean what do you know about the origins of your family--I mean your ancestral family going all the way back?
Speaker 2: Well I can certainly trace on my father's side.  I can trace back to my grandparents and I've heard him talk about his grandmother although I never met her, she was deceased before I was born but I knew both of my paternal grandparents, my grandmother and my grandfather.  My grandfather on my father's side was born in 1886.  He died in 1972 so I got to know him as a grown man.  I was in my thirties when he died or I was about thirty, thirty/thirty one.  My paternal grandmother was born in the early 1890's or late 1880's, I'm not sure of the exact date but she died in 1966 while I was in graduate school.  So I got to know her quite well.  They moved to Baltimore [Maryland] for a while.  They were from Chester, South Carolina and they moved to Baltimore in the '50s [1950s] for a while and then they moved back but I did get to know them quite well.  I don't know anything beyond that because I never knew my grandmother's parents nor did I know my grandfather's parents.  I did know my father talked a lot about my grandmother's mother, I presume that he knew her and so he used to tell me things about her.  I believe she was a slave was when he talked about her, that's all I know on that side.  On my mother's side unfortunately I never got to meet any of my mother's parents.  My mother's mother died when she was three or four years old, this was in the twenties [1920s].  And my mother's father died in 1940 or '41 [1941], before I was born.  I wasn't born until '41 [1941] but my father never even met him.  My father met him, went to the funeral and I think they had just been married a few months when he died so I never got a chance to meet him.  I did meet my mother's step mother because my mother's mother died when she was very young and my grandfather remarried and I did get a chance to meet my mother's step mother when my mother died.  My mother died when I was fourteen.  So I got a chance to meet her so I did meet her two or three times in my life but I never was close to her so I didn't know a lot about her.  Outside of that I knew nothing about my mother's parents or my mother's grandparents.  I doubt if my mother even knew them so I never knew anything about them.
Speaker 1: Did your mother or your father pass down any stories from the 19th century; stories of life during slavery?
Speaker 2: My father passed down some things about slavery but I don't really remember all the stories.  He talked about what his grandparents would tell him.  My mother never did because I don't know if she ever knew her grandparents.  My mother died at a very young age and so in the last couple of years of her life she was sick.  So I was still a young kid when my mother died but my father would tell me certain things that his grandmother would tell him about slavery.  I don't remember a lot of it though, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of it?
Speaker 2: The only thing I can remember is that they wanted to be--they remembered when slavery was over, she remember that when slavery was over.  I think the union soldiers came and told her that they were free, that kind of thing; I do remember that.  That's about all I remember, I don't remember, yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 76789
Speaker 1: Okay tell me about your father.  Can you give me his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Same as mine, James Hill, Sr., J-A-M-E-S, H-I-L-L, Sr.
Speaker 1: And when was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1917 in Chester, South Carolina and he died in 1996, I believe.  Yeah, he just died recently.
Speaker 1: Now what was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: He was a very strong man.  He believed in education.  He was a laborer for Bethlehem Steel Company.  He also was a union organizer and he was very involved in the union and he was at the steel company before they had a union.  So he was involved in the union from day one and he was very active in the union.  He worked for Bethlehem Steel for forty five years because you know in those days when you had a job, you had it for life; it's not like today.  People didn't job hop in those days and so he stayed there until he retired.  He had a long retirement; he retired when he was sixty two and he died when he was seventy nine.  So he was retired for sixteen/seventeen years.  When he retired, he basically didn't have a hobby his first year or two and then he took up gardening.  So he had almost an acre of land that he would farm and just grow vegetables and things of that nature.  Fruits and vegetables and that's what he did because rather than just sit home.  The first year he didn't do anything and then after that he did.  But he always motivated us to get an education.  He motivated me to continue my schooling because when I initially got out of high school, I wasn't really interested in going to college and he was the one who kept motivating me to make a decision to go to college.  So I did listen and I finally went.
Speaker 1: Was it tough on him being in the union when he first got involved?  Did he talk about?
Speaker 2: He talked a lot about the union and of course, I was around some of that time because he served as an officer--elected office at that time.  I think it was tough.  It was tough on everybody in the unions at that point because management did not want a union and so--and this was in the late thirties [1930s] when the union finally was formed.  So he was one of the organizers, he was very involved in the union and he stayed active in the union all throughout his career.
Speaker 1: Did he ever take you to any union events?
Speaker 2: Never went to any union events to my knowledge.  I know he used to go to union meetings every week or every month or whenever they used to have them and again, he used to go to conventions.  I remember he became an officer in the union after my mother died and I remember my grandmother would keep us when he would go to a place like California.  He took a course at Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania], that's really where he wanted me to go to college.  My father was not an educated man, he only went to the 8th grade but he took some courses there, the union sent him there and he had other various trips that he would go to when he was very involved in the union and that is when my grandmother would come and stay with us at the time.
Speaker 1: That was exciting--well exciting for him I suppose for being a part of something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was very exciting for him.  He enjoyed it, he enjoyed union work and he enjoyed his job.  I think that's quite different from today.
Speaker 1: He actually worked in the steel mill?
Speaker 2: Yes he did.
Speaker 1: Do you know what job he had?
Speaker 2: I know what he did at the end.  At the end he was a checker which means he checked the merchandise that came through, I guess or checked the steel.  In the beginning, I think he worked in the coke ovens.  That's where they had most of the blacks in those days; they'd put them in the coke ovens.  That's--he did that in the beginning when he first started there.  He had various jobs there but I do remember that and I know at the end, he was a checker.  He basically he didn't work so much in the mills as he was checking the merchandise or checking the steel as it came out before we shipped.

Speaker 1: How did you--I know that you didn't know your mother well, can you give us her full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Joyce Lee Hill, J-O-Y-C-E, L-E-E and Hill, H-I-L-L.  I knew her well enough; I mean I was fourteen when she died.  So I knew her.
Speaker 1: When was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in July 18, 1921, I believe.
Speaker 1: What was she like?
Speaker 2: She was a very kind, church going woman.  She was religious.  She believed in family--raising a family.  She stressed again education with us even though she wasn't around for me to finish high school or anything because she had died by then.  But she stressed the importance of education and stressed bringing us up in an environment where we--taught us to do the right things.  You know, to make sure we didn't get into any trouble and things of that nature and that's how she reared us.
Speaker 1: Now what did she do for a living, did she work?
Speaker 2: She didn't work.  Women in those days basically didn't work.  I mean if they had children, the father was the bread winner, he went out and basically that's what they did.  My mother also was a seamstress.  She took up sewing at night and went to the night school to take up sewing and she finished that and then she made her own clothes, make my sisters clothes and she would make clothes for people--various people and whatever.  She enjoyed sewing, that was one of her hobbies.  She didn't do it to make any money but that's basically what she enjoyed doing.
Story_ID: 76791
Speaker 1: Did your parents ever tell you about how they met?
Speaker 2: They met through my uncle, as a matter of fact; I was just with my cousin this weekend in Georgia--in Atlanta, Georgia.  The cousin's father that introduced them.  My father and my uncle were good friends.  They worked together and somehow or another he introduced him to his sister which was my mother and that's how they met.  I believe it was in church but I'm not a hundred percent sure of that.
Speaker 1: Now do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, one brother and one sister.  My brother, Warner Hill that's W-A-R-N-E-R and my sister Janet Jenkins, that's J-A-N-E-T, J-E-N-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Where do you fall in that?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest, my sister is next and then my brother is the youngest.
Speaker 1: Now did your parents meet in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Okay so they were both--.
Speaker 2: They both were from South Carolina but they actually met in Baltimore, they didn't know each other in South Carolina.  My mother was from Spartanburg, South Carolina and my father was from Chester, South Carolina.  On or about Chester, somewhere in that area, I just know Chester.  My mother was from Spartanburg--somewhere around the Spartanburg area.  They both grew up on farms outside of that.  That was a new city to them.  These are both small towns although Spartanburg is a lot bigger now than it used to be.  Chester is still a very small town.
Story_ID: 76792
Speaker 1: Now can you reflect back--really think about a way to tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: We lived near a railroad track and in those days you still had the steam engines.  So when it would go by, we had a tunnel that was near the house and that train would come through and all that smoke and the smoke would be all over the place, you could smell that.  I do remember that quite vividly.  I think by the middle '50s [1950s] most of the steam engines were gone.  They didn't have too many come that way but when we first moved over on Barns Street in Baltimore, that's what I remember.  I remember as far as that smell.  Sights, Baltimore was not a pretty city in those days. I mean it--I always wanted to get away from it because I always felt that there was a better place and so I wasn't that impressed when I was younger.  I always wanted to move out of there.  Baltimore was--the inner city was comprised mostly of row houses and Baltimore was very prejudiced in those days and we couldn't even go to certain movies in our own neighborhood but that's the way--that was just a way of life and you accepted it at that time--that point in time.  You would ask why they had an amusement parks you couldn't go to the amusement park.  Initially you couldn't try on clothes downtown, if you tried it on you had to buy it. You just couldn't, you couldn't put a hat on or a pair of shoes, if you did you had to buy it.  So you had to know your right size because you couldn't exchange it.  Now we weren't regulated to sit on the back of the bus or anything like that; we could sit on the bus, we didn't have those kinds of problems but--we didn't have colored/white water fountains, we didn't have that but there were a whole lot of other things involved at that time that it was a very prejudice place at that time.  I do remember that.
Speaker 1: What part of Baltimore did you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I grew up on the east side of Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay do you recall the name of it?
Speaker 2: Just east Baltimore, yeah.  You had East Baltimore, west Baltimore, south Baltimore, they didn't really call too much north Baltimore but they do now, I think.  Most blacks lived on the east side or the west side.  You had some that lived in south Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Is that the side that Edmonson Avenue was?
Speaker 2: Edmonson Avenue would have been on the west side.
Speaker 1: On the west side.
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact I worked on Edmonson Avenue, Emerson Village years later when I was in high school--I mean when I got out of high school.
Story_ID: 76793
Speaker 1: So what kind of a little boy were you?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Typical little boy things.  Play sports, play basically baseball.  Baseball was big when I was a kid for blacks because of Jackie Robinson.  So everybody wanted to be a baseball player.  I wasn't too much into basketball or football because we didn't have the exposure to it as we do today.  They weren't on television as much as they are today.  I had no exposure whatsoever to golf or tennis.  So the three sports that you looked at basically were baseball, football and what's the other one, basketball and boxing.  I liked boxing and I'm somewhat of an historian when it comes to certain sports; baseball, boxing so I studied those sports, I used to like to do that and read a lot and play games and always had the ambition of being someone important or at least I wanted to be at that point in time.  Didn't know what I wanted to be at that time, I had an ambition at one point of being or having a career in service, going to the Air Force or going to the Army or whatever.  That's because I had an uncle that was in the Navy for a lot of years.  And also I had a cousin that was in the Army.  They had been in for quite a while and I just wanted to emulate them so that was part of what I wanted to do.  I had never really met a businessman, black or white when I was growing up so I didn't know anything about business that was the furthest thing from my mind.  So at that point in time that's what I wanted to do.  So those were the typical kinds of things that I did.
Speaker 1: You were into boxing; did you try and box yourself?
Speaker 2: A little bit, yeah.  Not successful at it but a little bit.
Speaker 1: Were you a fan of the Baltimore Colts?
Speaker 2: A big fan of the Baltimore Colts, big fan of the Baltimore Colts.  The Baltimore Colts--that's how I really got interested in pro football.  A lot of people got interested pro football from the Baltimore Colts.  I used to work at the games selling peanuts, popcorn, cokes or whatever and I was around when Johnny Unitas first started, that was one of my heroes at that point in time.  Johnny Unitas, Lenny Moore--that whole team and I saw all of their games in '57 [1957], '58 [1958] and '59 [1959] because I worked the stadium just to see the games.
Speaker 1: Those were the big years.
Speaker 2: Those were the big years, yeah. Those were the big years.  I wasn't at the greatest game ever played because I was in New York so I didn't see that.  I saw the game on television but everybody was into the Baltimore Colts in those days and I was also a big Baltimore Oriole fan.  I used to go to a lot of the games.  The first baseball game I ever went to my mother took me to.  I think I was eleven or twelve and Mickey Mantle hit the scoreboard.  Nobody had ever hit the scoreboard.  He hit a ball and hit the scoreboard for a home run, I never will forget that.  That was a lot of years ago.
Story_ID: 76794
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school you attended?
Speaker 2: The high school? Dunbar High School
Speaker 1: I figured that but for some reason.  What about the grade school?
Speaker 2: In those days prior to 1954, blacks only went to three high schools, Dunbar, Douglas or Carver, that was it.  After integration they did start going to some of the other schools but prior to that they only went to three schools.  When integration hit, I decided to stay at Dunbar.  I had an opportunity to go to one of the other schools but I decided to stay at Dunbar.  Grade schools, I went to--they just named them by number and I went to PS135.  I only went to two grade schools, PS135 and PS143--public school 135, public school 143.  So those are the two schools I went to.
Speaker 1: What was grade school like?  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never disliked school.  Except for my first day--I still remember when I was in kindergarten, my mother took me to kindergarten, I cried the whole time and I beat her home--when she went home, I beat her home (laugh).  Somehow or another I found my way home, I don't know how but I found my way home.
Speaker 1: You were there when she got there. Yeah, yeah. So I think my father gave me a little whipping and took me back and then I finally stayed in school.  But I was very nervous about school when I first started.  But I still remember going in crying, I do remember that.  I didn't know I was only five years old.
Speaker 2: So what were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 1: Math was always my favorite subject--math and science were my favorite subjects all through school.  So I was always a big math fan and I always was interested in science, chemistry, physics, biology whatever.
Speaker 2: Are there any particular teachers that stand out?
Speaker 1: Grammar school?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: There was one teacher that stood out, Mrs. Williams she was my fifth and sixth grade teacher.  I thought she stood out, I mean she taught us a lot about life and having goals and I don't know if she is still living but I mean she was one that stood out.  Some of the others I can't remember their names but that one I do remember, she was my fifth and sixth grade teacher.
Story_ID: 76795
Speaker 1: Well, what about high school, when you get to high school do you have an idea--did you pursue a college prep courses or did you take--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was pursuing college prep courses but not with the intent of going to college.  At that time you had--you could pursue industrial arts; you could pursue business or college prep courses--not necessarily but a core curriculum to go to college so that's what most people took.  So I just took it like everybody else.  But at that point in time, I didn't have a lot of ambition to go to college.  I didn't know anybody in college so I didn't think about college.  Keep in mind my parents were not educated so I mean I wasn't thinking in terms of college at that point, not early on.  Even after I finished junior high, they had junior high schools in those days and when I got out of junior high school it was sixth, I mean, seventh, eighth and ninth grade.  My mother died while I was in the ninth grade.  So she died before I graduated from junior high school.  After she died, I kind of went wayward a little bit.  I didn't go to school, played hooky sometimes and whatever but never enough to fail.  I mean I always got my grades or whatever for that first year or so after she died because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.  So then I changed after I got to thinking about it a little bit.  I decided I'd better go and finish high school at least.
Speaker 1: Tell us about Dunbar High School.  Did they make a point of letting you all know who Dunbar was?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, Paul Laurence Dunbar a poet, yes we knew that.  We were called the poets; you know you had one in Dayton also.  So we knew who Paul Laurence Dunbar was.  In fact, we used to do some of his readings so we knew who he was.
Speaker 1: Dunbar from what I understand--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: He lived in Dayton, didn't he?
Speaker 1: Yeah he was from Dayton.  But the high school in Baltimore was a famous for producing musicians and athletes and all kinds of different people.
Speaker 2: Famous for producing basketball players, yes. Not at the time I was obviously because at the time I was there, when I was going to school there we were the first black school to win the city championship.  They called it the MSA, Maryland Scholastic Association championship.  We were the first black school to win a city championship in basketball.  We are talking about 1957/'58 [1958] somewhere like that.  So prior to that, no black school had ever won the city championship for basketball.  I don't know what the format is now, I think things have changed.  But they won a whole lot after that, I mean after I left school through the sixties and seventies. And you've got, you've got players in the pros now, Muggsy Bogues went to Dunbar [High School].  A couple of other players, I can't remember their names now.  Reggie Lewis who was a basketball player with the Boston Celtics, I think he died but I think he went to Dunbar.  There is a host of people that went there.  The coach who was a very famous coach was called Coach Sugar Cain [William "Sugar" Cain], he died recently but he was a good coach.  I don't know if he coached some of these guys but we had good teams then.
Story_ID: 76796
Speaker 1: So what were your activities in high school?
Speaker 2: A little track, ran a little track.  I was in the French club.  I think I was in the student council but the truth of the matter I wasn't very active in none of those.  I mean, I was involved but not very active in them.  I can't remember some of the other activities I was involved in.
Speaker 1: What was your social life like in high school?
Speaker 2: Social life in high school was going to parties.  You know, house parties was very common--very big when I was coming up as a kid.  You would have parties at the Y.  They would have parties in the projects, they would have party rooms and projects was not a stigma in Baltimore when I grew up as it is today.  We would go to parties there and people would have house parties in their basements and whatever and it wasn't like today I mean, where there were no drugs.  People would go and they would have a good time and you would go to the party say eight, nine o'clock and you leave at around midnight and you go home.  So my activities on weekends was partying, going to house parties or going to parties given by some club or something like that.
Speaker 1: Were there any gangs in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: No gangs like here.  There may have been a situation where a group of guys ran together and you might say there's John Jones and his boys or something of that nature but they weren't the kind of gangs that robbed and stole or killed people and things of that nature, it wasn't like that.  No there were no drugs; I never saw a drug in my life until I went to college.
Story_ID: 76797
Speaker 1: What were you thinking about doing your senior year, when you got to your senior year?
Speaker 2: When I got to my senior year, all I wanted to do was graduate and go into the service.  My best buddy at the time who is deceased now, we had talked about going to the Air Force and that was my dream at that point in time to go into the Air Force.  So when we got out of high school, we both went down to the Air Force recruiting office and they didn't have any openings.  This was in 1959, this was before Vietnam, this was in 1959.  So they told us that we'd have a waiting period of about four months, I didn't want to wait.  So we decided to go and try to join the Army.  So I went over to the army, they would take me right away.  So I passed the exams and then they told us that we could leave July, I think, July 20, 1959.  I changed my mind and they called and tried to get me to come in and my father had to let them know that I was underage.  I wasn't eighteen yet so therefore there's nothing they could do.  So I didn't go in at that point.  My friend eventually went into the Air Force.  He took a job; he eventually went into the Air Force that fall.  But initially he just got a job and worked there for a while.  At that point when it was determined that I wasn't going into the service, my father had a long talk with me and told me that I had three choices, go in the service, get a job or go to college but I couldn't lay around on him.  Obviously I didn't like what he said but what he said was true so I decided to get a job.  So I got a job working for Hot Shops Restaurant.  It's owned by the Marriott Group and they are no longer in existence but that's how the Marriotts got started in the restaurant business, most people don't know that.  So I worked at the Hot Shops Restaurant and that was the place that made me decide to go to college.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Here's how it happened.  I went to work there as a dishwasher making, I believe six dollars a day.  After being there for about three months, they promoted me to stock boy and made seven dollars a day.  My boss is the people that ran the operation, the manager and the assistant manager.  One had a degree from Duke [University] and the other one had a degree from Northwestern [University] and one day they gave me this test that they had to take and I passed that test.  They were shocked that I could pass the test.  The test was really that difficult but they thought it was going to be difficult for me to pass the test.  So then they came to me and wanted me, thought I should think about a career as being a cook and I didn't want to be a cook.
Story_ID: 76424
Speaker 1: Okay so you were making a decision to go up to school?
Speaker 2: What happened was is that I realized I could pass the test and then I also started realizing that they weren't that much smarter than me, they just had a degree and I started thinking that maybe I should consider going to college because I didn't really want to do this the rest of my life, washing dishes or being a stock boy and that's what I was.  I saw no future and they were talking about me being a cook, they weren't talking about a chef cook they were just talking about a cook and I didn't see no future in that whatsoever for me at that point in time.  Strangely enough cooking is my hobby now but that's another story.  So what happened is I went to the movie once with two friends of mine.  One was still in high school and the other one had graduated with me and was on his way to college and we started talking about what we were going to do with our lives. And so, the one gentleman said that he was going to go to Morgan State because he was on a basketball scholarship, he had played basketball.  The other gentleman said he was going to a college in Ohio called Central State College in Wilberforce, Ohio.  I had never heard of it.  So I said well what is this, I've never heard of it?  He says it's a black college.  I didn't even know they had any black colleges in Ohio at that point in my life.  So I said--I started thinking about it after we had gone to the movie and after we left the movie.  So I wrote the college--he gave me the address, I wrote the college and asked for a catalog.  I liked what I saw in the catalogs so I applied and that's when I decided to go to school.  So then I--for a while I would apply for, look in the paper for jobs to see what the job market was and I noticed that accountants were paying like $3,000/$3,500 accounting clerks and I thought that was a lot of money at that point in time considering what I was making.  So I applied to some of these jobs, I was very naive.  I didn't realize that they didn't have blacks in those jobs.  I didn't know at that point in time and so I applied to some of those jobs.  Most of the time they wouldn't even let me fill out a resume or if they did, it was just have you fill it out.  They knew that nothing was going come out of the job.  So I finally wised up on that.  So one day I was talking to a friend of mine, I can't remember his name now and he was saying I understand you're thinking about going to college.  I said yes.  He said what are you going to major in?  I said accounting; I want to be an accountant.  He said you mean you want to be a Certified Pub-a CPA.  I had never heard the term in my life.  I said what does CPA mean?  He said certified public accountant.  He said my uncle is a CPA; he makes $90.00 a day.  Now I didn't know anybody who made $90.00 a day so I said what do you have to do to be a CPA?  He said he doesn't know everything but that's the kind of money he makes.  So I went to the library the very next day and started doing research on it.  And so, the more research I did on it, the more I became interested in being an accountant.  It turns out his uncle really wasn't a CPA but I guess that's what he told him.  He was an accountant. I don't know his uncle's name but I do know the first black CPA in the state of Maryland.  I mean years later I knew who he was and I still know him, he's still there.  But he gave me the impetus though to think about being a CPA and to do some research on it and then after I did that, that's when I decided I wanted to be a CPA.  And so when I decided to go to college, that's when I decided I would major in accounting.  Initially, I was going to major in business administration because I talked with people and they said well you know accounting is very hard maybe you want to do business administration first then change over.  But when I got to the campus and I talked with my mentor there who was Harold Willis who taught your brother, taught both of us.  He told me that he felt that I should go ahead and major in accounting; if I didn't make it then change over to business administration and so that's what I did.  So and I never looked back after that.

Speaker 1: What was, what was Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] like?
Speaker 2: Central State at that time--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: A big change from Baltimore [Maryland], I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh it was a big change, I loved the school.  Central State at that time--what happened to me was that I had to get away from certain elements in my life.  I mean, I was a year older than most students.  I was nineteen, most students were right out of high school, some of the vets were older but I had worked a year.  Most of the students had never worked.  I wanted to get out of the environment I was in because I was in an environment where I was working and then from Thursday through Sunday I partied.  And so I knew I had to get out of that type of environment.  That's why I wanted to go away rather than stay at home.  The people that I was partying with were not going to college.  So I had to get away and out of that environment and get into an environment where I could study and that's why I chose to go as far away as I possibly could.  Now I did apply to four schools.  I applied to [University of] Notre Dame, Central State, Howard University and Penn State [University].  My father wanted me to go to Penn State because he had taken some courses there for the union.  I did get accepted to those schools, however my father could not afford to send me to none of those schools except possibly Howard but he couldn't afford Notre Dame, he couldn't afford Penn State.  So I winded up going to Central State, still was expensive in those days.  It was $1,400 a year for an out of state student which was a lot of money then.
Speaker 1: The out of state rate is much higher?
Speaker 2: Much higher, right.
Speaker 1: Did you get any assistance?
Speaker 2: I got some assistance; I got a job working in the cafeteria.  I also got a grant and after being there for my senior year, I'm jumping ahead of myself a little bit but my senior year I got a full scholarship from the Goodyear Foundation, they gave me a scholarship.  So I had a free ride my senior year.  In my senior year also, I taught as a tutor in the accounting department.  So I tutored freshmen and sophomores, anybody actually who had a problem in accounting, we would tutor.  Myself and Melvin Williams, the gentleman you asked me about early on.  So we were the tutors in the accounting department so we did that.
Story_ID: 76426
Speaker 1: Tell me about--I know the president of Central [State University] at that time was Charles Wesley.
Speaker 2: Charles Wesley, that's right.
Speaker 1: What about him?
Speaker 2: He [Charles Wesley] was a great man, a great humanitarian or historian.  He founded the university, I believe.  He founded Central State.  He had a lot of charisma, lot of charisma; great speaker, great orator.  He had a vision for Central State and the vision was to make it a top flight school and that was his mission.  Remember since you're from that area, there are two school there.  There is Wilberforce University which is a private school and Central State which is a state school.  So you do have two schools and there is some competition there.  The school used to be just one school and they broke off.  Now I didn't know all that history until I got there but the bottom line was that he wanted to make Central State--when you think about Central State, you think of a school that has great scholastic possibilities and great scholars and that was his impetus and he was there the whole time I was there.  He was the one who grew the school to what it was and those were the glory days of Central State.  I would say it would have been in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] were the glory days.  Now I happened to be there during the glory days.  They've had some hard times recently but in those days they were the glory days.  So I think he was a man of vision and he foresaw things that maybe some others didn't see at that point in time.
Speaker 1: He is co-author of several books.
Speaker 2: Several books, several books, right.
Speaker 1: Carter G. Woodson
Speaker 2: Right, he--you've got to remember, I mean, people like myself who was from Baltimore [Maryland], he had people from all over the country that went to that school in those days.  A lot of people from the east coast and they weren't just from Ohio, we had a lot of people from Ohio but you had a lot of people from all over the country just about.  I won't say every state but almost every state.  And so it was people that were proud to go to Central State at that point, I certainly was.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the professors and personalities around the campus that you remember the most?
Speaker 2: My mentor and the one that I feel that I owe everything to as far as accounting would be Professor Herb Willis.  He's deceased now, he died probably about seven/eight years ago but he taught me--he was the accounting department.  I don't think I ever had another teacher in accounting while I was at Central State [University].  So he taught me everything I knew about accounting.  His methodology was great, most of the people liked him, you'd learn in his class.  Either you learned or you didn't stay there.  I can just refer to your brother, he can tell you about him.  He was really a teacher, he was a great teacher and I learned a lot from him.  Another personality that I thought was a great teacher, some people necessarily didn't like him but he was a good teacher, Dr. Crump (splg.).  He knew business and that's how I first learned how to read the Wall Street Journal, and how to read stock prices.  I didn't know anything about that.  He taught us how to do that and he taught us a lot about business and so he was someone that stood out.  Ms. Carter who later became Mrs. Willis because she married Mr. Willis; she was the one who basically taught us how to use business machines, how to type, business decorum, things of that nature--things that you learn about business.  These were some people that stood out as far as I'm concerned; as far as in the business department.  As far as some of the other professors that I had respect for, I can't remember his name but he taught sociology.  I can't remember his name but I do remember one of the other ones who taught Physical Ed was Professor Baker who was--taught you how to be a man and how to be respectful, those kinds of things.  These are things you learn.  There were teachers who stood out.  Dr. Smith who was my chemistry teacher who I ran into not too long ago; I learned a lot from him.  So I've had some people that I learned some things from.
Story_ID: 76427
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of anything important about Central that I'm leaving out.
Speaker 2: Well the fraternity was important.  That was an important part of my life.  In those days--being involved with a fraternity or sorority was very important.  What people fail to realize was that the sorority and fraternity people were some of the smartest people on campus because you couldn't pledge unless you had a 2.5 or above average.  So therefore you just weren't--people had a tendency to think of fraternity or sorority people as people who really weren't that smart or just barely surviving.  But on our campus if you didn't have a 2.5 average or above, you could not pledge, period.  And you could not make the fraternity or sorority without the 2.5 average or above.  So therefore they tended to get the brightest and the best as far as those fraternities and sororities were concerned.  Also being involved in a fraternity or sorority gave you an opportunity to go to all the social events and to become a big man on campus or big lady on campus whatever you want to call it.  So the fraternity was very good to me and good for me at that point in time.  So I enjoyed the comradeship of meeting the guys and fellowship that I had with the guys.  We still have that fellowship as we speak today.  The other thing about Central was that since it was a small college and we had at that time about 2500 students, you got to know just about everybody because it's isolated.  It wasn't in a metropolitan area, it was on a farm.  So you got to know everybody because everybody was staying on campus with a few exceptions.  Some people lived off campus, I lived off campus for a little while but it was still close to--it was still in Wilberforce [Ohio] therefore I still was attached to the campus.  So basically you got to know everybody, everybody ate in the same cafeteria, everybody did everything so you got to know them.  The relationships you formed were lifelong relationships.  I have lifelong relationships with just about anybody in that school.  Even the people that maybe I didn't associate with much while I was there, if I run into them somewhere we still have that comraderie that you just don't get by going to some major school.
Speaker 1: You had a similar experience at (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: What were the, I guess--can you describe the--I don't know it doesn't always follow suit but what were the characters of the major black fraternities and sororities?  I've never asked anybody that.
Speaker 2: The characters?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is a certain--.
Speaker 2: Again they get the best and the brightest.
Speaker 1: What's the difference between say the Kappas and the Alphas.
Speaker 2: Not a lot of difference.  You heard things like the Kappas are partiers back in those days; they would say the Kappas would party.  Alphas were studious, the Cues, I have forgot what the saying was for them.  But that was more a figment of people's imagination.  The real deal was that it was comradery that clicked.  In other words you pledge with a fraternity because you like the guys in that particular fraternity more so than you did the others.  Not that you disliked them but you liked what that fraternity stood for or maybe you knew somebody who was a Kappa or somebody was a Cue.  I didn't know anybody really that was a Kappa except when I got on campus I met people there.  But I liked the style of the Kappas at that point in time.  I didn't have any disrespect for the Alphas or the Cues or the Sigmas but it's just at that point in time in my life I felt the Kappas was the fraternity for me.  Just like others felt that the other fraternities were for them.  The group of guys that was in the Kappas at that point, I felt were guys more to my liking; guys I'd want to associate with and I think that's how you pledged in those days.  I don't know if it's quite like that today but probably still is.  You pledge because of that.  A lot of people pledged because their fathers pledged.  My son he pledged Kappa because I pledged Kappa, that was one of the reasons and I guess he also liked the guys there.  I made him in the frat.  He went to North Carolina A&T [State University] but the bottom line is that I think a lot of people pledge because they like the guys they see and I assume the sororities are the same thing.
Story_ID: 76428
Speaker 1: Now did learning accounting change how you viewed the world?
Speaker 2: Learning accounting changed how I viewed the world in the fact that I started understanding in more numerical terms, started understanding business; started understanding how to read a balance sheet and that business had to be profitable along with other courses I took.  So studying accounting made me understand that accountants are very important to business.  As you know about these scandals now, you know they are the most important people to business because without good accountants those numbers are not good then you can't run a business without that.  A lot of businesses fail because they don't have good accountants.  Now I didn't know all that at the time but I started realizing that being an accountant was very important and I felt that it gave me some insight, excuse me, insight into things that I really didn't know before especially from a numerical standpoint and from a business logic standpoint.
Speaker 1: Now in those days on Central's campus, did you get many guest speakers or guest on campus to talk to the students?
Speaker 2: No not that much.  Are you talking about in accounting or just period?
Speaker 1: Just in general.
Speaker 2: They had guest speakers sometimes would come in from time to time.  There was an organization on campus called SAM--society of advancement of management.  Are you familiar with that?  I was a member of that and we had guest speakers from time to time and they would have a few guest speakers but probably not like they do today.  Remember back then for business, black people didn't major in business as much because they couldn't get jobs.  Fifty percent of all the majors on campus at that time were education majors and probably another twenty/twenty five percent were sociology majors and then all the other majors fell into that.  Business was a very small portion of majors in those days but education because you could easily get a job teaching in those days and you could get a job in social work in those days.  You didn't necessarily need a Master's for social work then as you do today.  Today it's pretty tough without a MSW but in those days you could get a job as--in social work.  So those were the two biggest major on campus at that point in time.
Story_ID: 76429
Speaker 1: In 1964--'63 [1963]/ '64 [1964] were years where there is major civil rights activity in the news and students were getting involved from the beginning of your college career all the way through.  Students all over the country, North Carolina A&T [State University] Fisk [University] down in Nashville, Tennessee State.  They had like sit down lunch counters and that sort of thing.  You all didn't have that problem in Wilberforce [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: We didn't have that problem in Wilberforce but I remember they did have a problem at Yellow Springs [Ohio].  Yes they had a problem in Yellow Springs where they marched on Yellow Springs, I wasn't involved in it but a lot of the students went to jail.  They turned the fire hose on them and a lot of students went to jail, they didn't stay long; they got them out.  I can't remember exactly what they were protesting; it was some protest in Yellow Springs.  You know where Yellow Springs is?
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: Yellow Springs is the home of Antioch College.
Speaker 2: That's right
Speaker 1: It's got to be one of the most liberal colleges--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right; it was liberal at that point in time.  But something happened in Yellow Springs and they went down and marched and several of the students wind up going to jail.  That was the biggest extent of it.  We didn't really--being in Ohio you didn't really have the problems.  We could go to restaurants in Ohio, we could go to places that you couldn't go down south because Ohio wasn't considered the south obviously.  It was a northern state.  We didn't have the same kinds of problems and issues there.  I'm not saying some of the students didn't do protests maybe elsewhere but we didn't have many issues on our campus to do that kind of protesting or we didn't go into Dayton [Ohio] or Xenia [Ohio] to do anything like that.  Just the Yellow Springs incident was the main one I remember.
Speaker 1: In '64 [1964] also is where--close by, close to Central State within maybe thirty miles is where they organized students at Western College in Oxford--they organized students for Freedom Summer in '64 [1964] where students all the way down to Mississippi with SNCC to register people to vote.  Do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: No because I graduated that June, so no I don't remember that.  I was gone by then.
Story_ID: 76430
Speaker 1: So what did you do after graduation?
Speaker 2: After graduation I got job interviews in my senior year and I had highest average in my class in accounting and I got a job offer from Union Carbide.  I got one from Timken Roller Bearing Company.  Are you familiar with them in Canton, Ohio?
Speaker 1: Timken, no
Speaker 2: Yeah they made roller bearings for railroads.  Timken Roller Bearing Company.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: T-I-M-K-E-N. I believe, that's been a long time and I got a job offer from somewhere else.  But anyway I decided to go to Union Carbide in Niagara Falls, New York because it sounded nice; it was a nice romantic place.  They had never had a black to work as an accountant in the company.  They were a Fortune 500 company; they were ranked probably at that time 24th/25th largest corporation in the Fortune 500.  So I got a job working there.  So I went to Niagara Falls.  Now they had told me that they wanted the best and brightest.   I had the highest average in the class.  They told me that they wanted someone who is real smart and whatever.  So I get there and I start working and after being there for about a month, I started realizing that besides my boss, there wasn't hardly anybody else that had a degree in the whole accounting department--that was a cost accountant.  They were bringing guys from the plant and teach them and promote them.  Second of all I found after being there I was noticing they would hire new people, they would rotate them.  They would go from one job-they stay on one job maybe three months, stay on another job three/four months but they didn't rotate me, they just kept me on the same job.  Well after doing that job for maybe a month or two; let's say two months it wasn't no challenge.  I mean, so I went to my boss and said--I can't remember his name--I said I notice everybody comes in here you basically rotate them, these are all whites and so he told me that the reason why--I wanted to know could I rotate and learn something else.  He told me that I was doing such a great job in the area I was in that he didn't see no sense in rotating me.  Well the bottom line was the job I was in, nobody really wanted that job and so they didn't have no intention on really promoting me or nothing.  So I would--I saw through that so then I got to the point where I knew I had to get out of there and so that's when I made the decision to go back to school and get a MBA.
Speaker 1: Now Union Carbide makes battery.
Speaker 2: Batteries that one thing they make, they make a whole host of things.
Speaker 1: Eveready
Speaker 2: Yeah they make that and a whole host of things.  So they are still a Fortune 500 company but they are not 24th, I don't know where they rank now but at that time they were ranked 24th so they were a large corporation.
Speaker 1: Did they have other black employees?
Speaker 2: They had black employees in the mill, yeah.  They had three plants.  I worked in one of the plants and they had black employees all in the plants and they had one black employee in the office, a young lady who was an employee there.  I can't remember what her duties were.  But I would ride with her sometimes going to work because that's when I--she would tell me different things and whatever.  She had been there a year or two.  But I was the first black accountant in the whole city of Niagara Falls.  They had never had a black accountant.  None of the plants had ever hired a black accountant before and I was also the first black accountant to work for Union Carbide.
Story_ID: 76431
Speaker 1: What was Niagara Falls [New York] like?
Speaker 2: Niagara Falls is a honeymoon capital, it used to be the honeymoon capital of the world and I guess at that time it probably still was.  I doubt if it is like that now.  But a lot of people go there for honeymoons, a lot of people got married in Niagara Falls, a lot of people are still getting married there.  It's still a big tourist town.  But the reason why Niagara Falls was attractive because of all of the water power they had there, they had a lot of industry there, a lot of industry.  So you had a lot of major corporations, a lot of chemical companies and all different kinds of companies had plants there because of the power from the water.  So that was the thing that made Niagara Falls exciting.  Niagara Falls had at that point about 100,000 people maybe 80,000.  The black population was only about maybe six/seven percent.  They didn't have a lot of blacks there.  You had more blacks in Buffalo [New York] which was twenty miles away from there but you didn't have as many in Niagara Falls and so yeah you had a very small black community in Niagara Falls.  So it wasn't a lot to do there.  I mean once you've done the honeymoon, the tourist thing, go to Canada, go see the Falls how many times are you going to look at the Falls.  So after you've done that a few times, that plays out so unless somebody comes from out of town, where you're going to take them and show it to them.  You're not going to go there every day so it was just a small town.  I wasn't so much against the town as I was I didn't see any opportunity for me there at the company I was working for.  That's when I made the decision to go back to school.
Speaker 1: So, but both of your children were born--.
Speaker 2: Both my children were born in Niagara Falls.  Right I got married in Niagara Falls and both my children were born in Niagara Falls.
Speaker 1: Did you marry a woman from--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I married a woman from Niagara Falls.  I met her in Niagara Falls and we got married, right.
Story_ID: 76432
Speaker 1: Alright. So where did you go to graduate school?
Speaker 2: University of Chicago.  When did I go or where?
Speaker 1: Where and when.
Speaker 2: I went to University of Chicago in September 1965.  I started at Union Carbide in June of '64 [1964], a little over a year later I decided to go back to school.  I told them I was going back to school, they knew that after I got accepted and I decided to go to the University of Chicago.  I got accepted really at the University of Wisconsin, University of Chicago, Roosevelt and somewhere else and I had no idea that the University of Chicago had the reputation it has.  As you know, today it's ranked number two.  It's always in the top ten but at that point in time in my life, I had no idea because I didn't know anything about--I'd never heard of MBA that much because I never knew anybody that got a MBA in those days.  And at that point in time in this country it was only about 150/200 black MBAs in the whole country.  People didn't push blacks to get MBAs because there were no opportunities in corporate America so you just didn't do that.  So I decided to go there.  When I came here--a friend of mine got married in Detroit [Michigan].  I was still living in Niagara Falls [New York] and I went to his wedding, I decided to come here to take a look at the campus with the thought--my whole impetus at that point in time was to go to the University of Wisconsin.  It was a big ten school, I had heard of it and I felt that this would be a good opportunity.  I knew about the University of Chicago because the atom was split there, I knew that much.  But outside of that, I knew it was famous for physics and that thing.  I didn't know about business because I didn't know a lot about business at that point.  So--but when I came here and went to that campus, I fell in love with the campus.  One of my Kappa brothers who I came and stayed with while I was here told me if you got accepted at the University of Chicago, you don't need to go nowhere else.  He said if I was you, I'd stay there.  So I fell in love with the campus and the guy, the dean told me at the time--the dean of students, I met with him and he told me that they had just started this new program that they give scholarships and I think it was ten scholarships or nine but I wasn't eligible for the scholarship because I didn't know anything about the program.  But he told me if I did well, we could see about trying to get some money.  It was $3500 a year at that point including tuition.  So I had to come up with the money.  I had about $1,000 so I borrowed money, that's how I decided to go there.  So I did decide on the University of Chicago at that time.  I was an accounting major and a personnel management major, I had a double major.  Today they would call that human resources, in those days they called it personnel management.  Maybe when you went to school they might have called it personnel management, they call it human resources today.  I was the only black accounting major in the whole school.  The difference was when I got out of the University of Chicago, I had like twenty-two job offers and by now, all of the big eight accounting firms at that time were now hiring.  I got offers from every one of them.  So that was the big difference when I got out.  Back track a little bit when I was at Central, I wanted to be a CPA but I found out that none of the CPA firms interviewed on our campus at that time and so I wrote a couple of them and I did talk with one of the firms and they told me that they would like to hire me but they used the word colored in those days or Negro and they said our clients probably wouldn't take too well to a colored person looking at their books or a Negro looking at their books.  Those terms are outdated now but in those days the term was still okay.  It was very disappointing to me.  So when I went to Union Carbide, I looked up about taking the CPA exam.  So I was going to study for it and try to take it.  But in New York at that time, you had to have three years experience in a CPA firm even before you could sit for the exam. You had to have three years auditing experience in a CPA firm.  So that ruled me out because where was I going to get the experience.
Story_ID: 76624
Speaker 1: But I didn't come here with the intention of staying here, I came here with the intention of getting an education and I wasn't ever going back to Union Carbide.  I wanted to be a CPA [Certified Public Accountant] so I took less money to go to a CPA firm even though I had plenty of job offers because I was sought after.  There was nobody else in the school that had a MBA that was black in accounting.
Speaker 2: How did Chicago affect you, itself?  You know this is a different place.
Speaker 1: When I got out of grad school, I had $2.68 in my checking account.  That's all the money I had in the world.  I had student loans totaling $7,000 from the University of Chicago and another $1,000 something dollars from Central State [University] and I had two suits.  I had maybe about $500/$600 worth of clothes, so I had a negative net worth of about $8,000 (laugh) that's the truth.
Speaker 2: That was a lot of money in those days.  That's somebody's whole year's salary.
Speaker 1: I said I had a negative net worth.  I didn't have--in other words
Speaker 2: That's someone's whole paycheck.
Speaker 1: I could have gone bankrupt, that's what I'm saying but I didn't.  Of course with student loans you had plenty of time to pay it back.  So I didn't have any money.  So when I got out, I took the job here because this was an opportunity for me to be a CPA.  Remember that was my goal, my goal was to be a CPA, we'll get into that, and they gave me an opportunity and that's why I stayed here and I've been here ever since.  I didn't think I was going to stay here all these years.  I've been here thirty years. Thirty--thirty five years now, thirty seven years since 1965.
Story_ID: 76625
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --So the plan was to work and then go back to--go someplace else?
Speaker 1: I hadn't--I didn't really know a plan because I went through a divorce back then.  I don't know if I want to get on that on the tape.
Speaker 2: No-
Speaker 1: But I mean I went through a divorce.  What happened was that my wife and I split up and so when we split up that's just right after we got out of school--after I got out of school here because she was going to Wilberforce [University] and so we had a long distance marriage and it wasn't--long distance marriage is tough and so it just didn't work out but we had two children and whatever.  So she stayed in New York and I stayed here and then I remarried a little later on.
Speaker 2: Did the children stay with her?
Speaker 1: The children stayed with her but they would visit me during the summer.  My oldest boy works with me now, I wouldn't say that in front of him, he's here now.  He's been with me five years; he actually runs the office now.  I put him in charge of the office, he's the--I made him president as of December 1, I moved up to chairman, CEO and so he's in charge of all the day to day operations and whatever now.  So he actually runs the office now.  He was with Arthur Andersen for about seven/eight years, he was a manager over there and he left there and came over here with us.  He got a MBA from [University of] Michigan.  My other son got a Master's from Roosevelt in hotel restaurant management.  He got a Bachelor's in Hotel Restaurant Management from the University of Buffalo and he works at Joliet Junior College and he's the head of all the food service there.  So both my sons got their Master's degrees and both of them came here.
Speaker 2: You're glad that they are both here?
Speaker 1: In a way, in a sense.
Story_ID: 76626
Speaker 1: So who did you get hired by after you got your certification?
Speaker 2: After I got--I wasn't certified.  What happened after I got my MBA, I got accepted to Graham Thornton.  I had done an internship with them, they were called Alexander Graham at the time and they hired me as an intern.  I was the first black to work for them also in the history of their company.  And so I worked for them and then after I got--after I finished school, I went to work for them full time.  So that's how I gained my experience.  I still have an excellent relationship with them even today as we speak.
Speaker 1: Now this takes us--where are we now in terms of time?
Speaker 2: We're in 1967, that's when I graduated and that's when I started to work for them.  So I worked for them for a couple of years and then I got an opportunity I couldn't refuse.  I went to work for Chicago Economic Development Corporation and they made me a job offer I couldn't refuse because at the time they were going to make me the number two person, I was very young then.  I was like twenty five/twenty six.  They had about twenty five people that I was going to be in charge of and they were a nonprofit organization so they were totally out of accounting.  I still had not gotten my CPA [Certified Public Accountant] at that point in time but I had the experience now.  I could take the exam but you still had to have the experience in those days.  So I had the experience but once you had a Master's degree that gave you years of experience automatically.  In the state of Illinois, I think you only needed one year's experience or that Master equivalent so I had that.  So I was able to take it or it might have been two years because I had the extra year.  But anyway I went to work for Union Carbide-I mean, I'm sorry, I went to work for Chicago Economic Development Corporation.  I was there number two man there and so I stayed there until 1970.  The reason why I left because the person that was my boss whose name was Garland Guice who is deceased now.  He was a young man, he was only about five/six years older than me so I had nowhere to go.  I mean being the number two man is fine if you are older, if that happened today and I was the number two man, I probably would stay on longer.  But when you're twenty five/twenty six years old and you're the number two man, you don't have no place to go so if you've got ambition then you want to do something else.  But by then I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to go back into a corporation, so.

Speaker 1: I started looking at other opportunities and some guys came to me and told me about an opportunity to go into a car wash operation where they had some money--I didn't believe the guy at first but he told me that they had $100,000 from some investors and that they were going to open up some car washes.  Well it turned out he did have the $100,000.  So I decided to take that route.  So I left Chicago Economic Development Corporation and went into the car wash business and we opened--we started by buying two car washes in South Bend, Indiana.  We used to drive there every day.  Then we opened up a car wash in Harvey, Illinois, another car wash in Gary, Indiana and one in Chicago [Illinois].  So we had five car washes off that $100,000 and we were collecting money also.
Speaker 2: What kind of car wash did you own?
Speaker 1: Self service where you wash the cars yourself.  And so we thought we were on to something--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, where was your car wash in Chicago?
Speaker 1: 77th and State, it's still a car wash down there, it's not ours though.  It's still a car wash down there, if you go by there.  Some other company, yeah. So what we did, we were rolling along pretty good, we thought we had an excellent relationship with the bank.  We had never borrowed any money.  From day one that we started the banking relationship, we showed our balance sheet, our balance sheet showed $100,000 cash and the rest in equity and so we thought we were doing pretty good.  Well we went to the bank to try and get additional financing so we could open up some more car washes, the bank turned us down.  So we were very upset about that and so we went back to the investors and the investors said well you know we've given you guys $100,000, we think we've reached our max, you really should be able to get on your own.  We both had degrees from the University of Chicago. We found out we could not get any money.  It goes back to the same thing again, if you are a black business man, they weren't loaning you the money in those days, this is 1970.  So we made the decision to sell the car washes, so we sold the car washes to an outfit in Texas called National Pride.  So we sold it, I made a little money on the deal and now I don't have a job.  We are in 1971 now so I don't have a job.  So I started doing--started interviewing for jobs but in the meantime I had some money I had saved from the deal with the car wash, wasn't a lot of money but it was enough to last me a little bit.  I decided I would study for the [CPA] exam again because I had taken the exam once but I didn't pass it so I decided I'd study again.  I started looking in the job market; I did not like none of the job offers because I got spoiled because when I was with the car wash operation, we were paying ourselves $25,000 a year which was a lot of money back in 1970.  The job offers I was getting was $15,000, $14,000 which was probably what I was worth then but I thought I was worth more, I wanted $20,000.  Never got the $20,000 job offer so I'm glad I didn't but at that time I probably would have taken the job if I had gotten $20,000.
Story_ID: 76628
Speaker 1: So since I didn't get it, I gave up looking for a job and decided to concentrate on the CPA exams.  So I studied for the CPA exam and so I passed the CPA exam.  So when I passed the CPA exam, I decided that I would start the firm.  So I started a firm in February 1972.  You can see my certificate on the wall, it show February 1972.  That's when I got the certificate and then three days later, I got married again.  So I told my wife that I was going to not get a job, she knew I wasn't working and so I said that what I wanted to do was to pursue this opportunity and I'll give it a year.  If things didn't work out after a year, since I had a MBA and a CPA now, I told her that what I would like to do is give it the opportunity then what I would do is just go and get a job.  She said okay, fine.  And so working out of the house and after maybe a month or two I hired my first employee because business was pretty good because I had made some good connections at Chicago Economic Development Corporation.  So I knew some people that helped me out quite a bit in those early days and basically all I was doing there was bookkeeping and taxes.  I wasn't doing any audits.  Then we kept growing to the point where before the end of that year, I had to move out of the house and by then I had about four employees.  So I took a place out on 87th and Jeffrey.  Are you familiar with that location?  So I took that place and I stayed there until 1976.  Somewhere in 1975 David Taylor joined me.  You know the name Hill Taylor?  Well David Taylor is deceased now, he died in 1980 but he joined me in 1975--late '74 [1974] or early 1975 somewhere like that.  I started analyzing the clients that we had and I noticed that out of the first fifty clients or so, thirty five of them went either bankrupt, out of business or liquidated.  So I started recognizing that I wasn't going to go far in this business if I continue to deal with those kinds of clients.  That the only way that I could really make it was to instead of trying to do everything or emulate the big accounting firms, that's what I was trying to do then.  I recognized that I didn't have resources and so the only way I felt I could grow was to get a market niche.  But I didn't know what niche I wanted to get a niche in or market I wanted to get a niche in.  So I started reading a lot about, started reading a lot and all of a sudden the Department of Labor came out with some laws that said that if you are a pension plan or have any type of employee benefit plan, if you have a hundred or more employees, you now have to be audited.  Prior to that it was a voluntary thing, you didn't have to be audited if you had an employee benefit plan.  So I thought that was an opportunity and I said you know what, this is an opportunity.  And so I started thinking about it and said you know I think that if I could prove to a major corporation that I can do this work, I believe I can have an opportunity.  Because when I was with Graham Thornton, I remember this was nuisance work.  You would go ahead and do the bigger audit and nobody really wanted to do it.  A little pension audit or a foundation or whatever so I felt that if I could get my foot in the door and do something like that, I felt I could grow it.  The only problem was no black accounting firm had ever done any work like this in the city of Chicago and I don't know anywhere else in the country at that point in time.  If it was, it was very minimal work.  I don't think there has been that many that have done that prior to me doing it.
Story_ID: 76629
Speaker 1: So I knew a guy over at Borg Warner, his name was Gordon Hegwin (ph.).  He was a black guy; he was the assistant treasurer at that time which was rare for a black to be in that position.  I told him about my story; he told me that he didn't think that no corporation would do this.  So I asked him to consider his corporation, would he consider doing it and he said he didn't think that they would buy it, you know.  A black firm doing the work for a major corporation but he would think about it.  So we would talk off and on for about a year and then one day he came to me and said you know what, I've been thinking about what you said and I have the opportunity that I might be able to help you.  He said we have a foundation that needs auditing.  He said there is no money in it for you but it could be a (unclear).  If you do a good job there then there's a possibility that maybe we can get you the pension audits.  I said okay.  He said do you want it and I said yes.  So we took it and we still have that job by the way.
Speaker 2: The Borg Warner Foundation?
Speaker 1: Yes so we took the job and we did a good job and the next year he called and said you remember I told you we might be able to give you this pension work?  Well we've got thirty six pension plans, we want you to do our audit for two years because the auditors they had at that time, they didn't like the price and whatever and they asked us to bid on it.  So we bid on it and we got the work.  That was the first exposure we had to pension plans.  We did a good job and we still have that client, that's our oldest corporate client. We've had them since 1978 so we've had them twenty four years, almost twenty five years now.  So after we got through doing that audit, I got a call from the President of Zenith and he was on the board of Borg Warner, he called and told me that he wanted us to do something similar for him at Zenith.  So we started doing Zenith and we still have part of Zenith now.
Speaker 2: Zenith closed.
Speaker 1: They closed but we still do Zenith data systems.  So it starts snowballing from there.  To make a long story short, we now have about thirty five to forty major corporations that we do pension audits for and we also do audits of pensions for some of the public corporations.  But we were the first firm to really blaze the trail to get into that.  We also were the first--we also made a decision to--we didn't make a decision on this but we somehow or another got involved in auditing nonprofits and so over the years we've made that our specialty and so we now audit about 150/160 nonprofit organizations.  We were also the first minority firm to do any work for the auditor generals for the State of Illinois, we're the first firm to do any work for them and that happened in 1974, I believe it was; we got that work.  So we now specialize in three areas, we specialize in nonprofits, we specialize in internal audits and we also specialize in employee benefits and we've built quite a reputation especially in those first two areas, the nonprofits and the employee benefits area.  Because people know us and know that we do that.  We're still building in the employee benefit area.  We found out that we weren't that good in taxes so we basically got out of the individual income tax business although we still have about 100 individual taxes that we do.  That's not a lot of taxes when you look at it considering firms like H & R Block or Jackson Hewitt or some of the small petitioners do a lot more returns than that.  But we can't compete with them and we recognize that so we got out of the business.  The same with bookkeeping or compilation if you want to call it, we're down to--I think maybe we've got a dozen that we do.  We just grandfathered that in and we got out of that business.  So we got out of the businesses that weren't profitable for us, maybe profitable to someone else but we decided to get out of those businesses and that's how we survive.
Speaker 2: So you had to make a lot of decisions of what to keep and what to let go.
Speaker 1: Yes, now we didn't make those decisions early on.  I mean some of those decisions that have come recently.  We just got out of the compilation business maybe about three/four years ago and we got out of accepting new income taxes about a couple of years ago. We just can't compete; those are just businesses we can't compete in.  We can compete very favorably when it comes to employee benefits or nonprofits or internal audits because that's what we do best.  We cannot compete when it comes to taxes or individual taxes.  We do corporate, I'm not talking about corporate, I'm only talking about individuals and we can't compete very favorably in trying to do monthly bookkeeping or compilation as they may call it.  So we feel others can do a much better job and so we refer other firms to do that type work.  Just like other firms may refer us to do what we do best in.
Story_ID: 76630
Speaker 1: What are the--looking back on this, what are--I don't know much about accounting but what are the highlights of a career as an accountant?  Are there some memorable--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think some of the highlights of being able to be a trailblazer.  We've been a trailblazer for the state, we were the first minority firm to do state auditing and that has open the door for other minority firms to do state auditing.  We were the first minority firm to do any work for corporations here in this state, that's opened the door for other minority firms to do it. I was the first black to work for Union Carbide as a cost accountant or as an accountant, I'm sure they've got other blacks now in their accounting departments worldwide.  I was the first to work for Graham Thornton, again that's open the door for other blacks to work there as accountants.  So these have been some highlights in my career that I think, that's been good.  I'm also very--I've been very involved in the profession.  I was on the state board of directors of the Illinois CPA Society.  I served on that board for three years.  I was also on the state board of accountancy, I was appointed by Governor [James R.] Thompson on the state board of accountancy.  I served five years on that, I believe.  I've been on committees with the American Institute of CPAs, so I've been on two or three committees with them.  So I've been very involved there.  I headed the task force for the State of Illinois to deal with whether or not we should do quality review and quality review means that we get audited.  So we did a study on that to determine whether or not the State of Illinois wanted to have quality review which they did do--a peer review we call it.  So those are some of the highlights that we've had and also the fact that we've maintained a very good reputation over the years.  People know us, people know our firm, they know what we do.  If you talk to anybody about accounting, not just being a minority CPA, we're noted now as being a good CPA firm.  You know, years ago you try to sell it based on minority but we don't try and sell it on that now.  We try to sell it on our experience and what we do and what we do best and that's how we do.  We can compete favorably with anybody our size and our size standards on what we do.  So that's how, what we look at.
Story_ID: 76631
Speaker 1: Has business--have you picked up a lot of not for profit business in the last few years with some of the changes in the tax laws?  There was a time when people could--foundations could donate money without a lot of financial statements and records.
Speaker 2: No that changed, that changed a long time ago.  Foundations are not going to donate any money without seeing their financial records.  We averaged in the last three years--we've averaged either a new client or new business every week.  So we don't have a problem getting business.  Our problem is making sure that we have a good core-good group of people--core people that can perform the work.  You've got to work at that because people today are not as loyal as they used to be.  I mean, so there used to be a time when you hired somebody, you know that you are going to get five, seven, eight years from them; not today because a lot of times you hire somebody today, it's not that they don't like working here but somebody else will grab them.  Clients grab them, other people grab them, they pay more money.  We're a small firm so they will pay more money.  A lot of people will go for the money whereas years ago they weren't as apt to leave for the money.  If they liked it here, they will stay here longer.  But today is a little different.  So it's always a challenge for us to keep people; we have to increase our benefits, you have to stay competitive and we try to stay competitive.  We don't have any problem recruiting entry level people and that's, we recruit primarily at Roosevelt, University of Illinois in Champaign, University of Illinois here, DePaul University and Chicago State are the primary places that we recruit.  We basically don't have a problem with recruiting anybody but to stay competitive; those are the kinds of things we've got to do.
Speaker 1: How many employees do you have?
Speaker 2: We have approximately forty.
Story_ID: 76632
Speaker 1: Do you have--what would you advise young people who are interested in accounting to do?
Speaker 2: Well the first thing I would advise them is to stay in it, that's the first thing to stay in accounting.  Second thing, the new rules are now you have to have five years in order to take the exam.  That rule came into effect a few years ago that you have to have five years of college in order to take the exam whereas you used to only have to have four years.  They have grandfathered in anybody who took the exam prior to that new rule can still take the exam with the four years.  But all these new kids that's graduated--that's majoring in accounting, they have to stay in school five years in order to take the exam.  You can still get a degree in accounting after four years but you can't take the exam until you've had an extra year.  So my advice would be to stay in the extra year and I would go and get a Master's--I'd get a MBA or I would get a Master's of Science or whatever.  I just wouldn't take hours because they don't specify what hours you have to take.  You can take any courses which I was somewhat against.  I always felt that they should make it toward another degree but you don't have to do that.  But University of Illinois offers a very good program where you can get a MS or something in accounting over a five year period.  Some of the other top tier schools do the same thing, they offer this degree.  So to me that's what I would do and I would stay in it.  There are a lot of opportunities in accounting especially based on the things that are going on.  As a matter of fact, I gave a speech at the University of Illinois a few months ago.  I spoke to some of the students and talked to some of the professors and they tell me they had the biggest enrollment in accounting of accountants in the last few years.  Because enrollment went down after the five year rule but enrollment has gone up tremendously since all these things have happened with Enron and some of the accounting scandals.  Accounting scandals have not hurt as far as getting students interested in accounting, it might hurt the profession somewhat but at least you've the student interest in accounting.  So I would tell them to stick it out.
Speaker 1: Everybody needs accountants.
Speaker 2: Everybody needs an accountant.  Whether it be a tax person although we don't do much individual taxes but somebody has to do it.  Whether you need a budget done or projections or whether you need a loan, you need an audit all kinds of things.  So everybody needs an accountant not necessarily that you are going to be in business if you are just an everyday working man, you need an accountant to do your taxes if it's complicated.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so plenty of work.
Speaker 2: Plenty of work.  You don't have to be a CPA [Certified Public Accountant], I mean you can work with government, you can work teaching, you can work in industry, you can go my route public accounting, nonprofit organizations.  There are all kinds of opportunities.  Every one of those organizations needs accountants.
Story_ID: 76633
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts on the Arthur Andersen scandal?   Do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: I think they got a raw deal.  I think that the people who were involved in the Enron deal should have been the people that should have gotten punished.  I go as far as to say even if you close down the Houston [Texas] office but to put 80,000 people worldwide out of work for what a few people did and I'm guessing twenty to twenty-five people involved in this, those are the people that should have suffered not the whole firm.  So I think they got somewhat of a raw deal.  I assume that government was trying to make an example; I just think it was not a good example, my personal opinion.  Now I don't know all the facts, I mean the government probably knows more facts than what I would know but most people I've talked to feel the same way.
Story_ID: 76634
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Hopes and concern for the black community is that they get rid of the drugs, that's one thing.  We instill in these young people how important education is.  It hurts my heart to see these young kids who don't want to finish school, drop out of high school.  The dropout rate is too high in the black community out of high school who think that the glamour is pushing drugs or whatever.  That is not the glamour because most of those people who push drugs either they are in prison by the time they are thirty or they are dead.  And so I think there's got to be a lot more education as far as teaching them how education works and that they should be more educated.  And that if they do that and become scholars then they have an opportunity to contribute and get decent jobs and be good paying citizens, that's my hope.  My hope is that they will see the light in the black community.  I'm not saying everybody don't see it, I'm just saying there are--has been some poor examples recently.
Story_ID: 76635
Speaker 1: Now you have been an active volunteer like you serve on the boards of a number of organizations.
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: On your resume you're on the board of citizens information service.  You used to be
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: Central State advisory board of the president, a lot of them.  How important is that to--most really successful people in business seemed to be very active--have a very active volunteer life.
Speaker 2: You have to give something back.  It's very important that if you've made some success in your life, you have to give something back.  I don't get paid for these boards.  I have been on a few paying board but I'm not on no paying board as we speak.  But the bottom line is that you've got to give something back.  So you've got to choose something that you might want to be involved in that you can help someone else and that's what I choose to do.  I'm on three university boards, I'm on the board of trustees of Illinois Institute of Technology, I'm on the graduate school there--counselor for the graduate school of business at the University of Chicago which is my alma mater.  I'm also on the graduate school--the business school at the University of Illinois on their advisory council and was at the president advisory council for Central State [University], as you know.  I'm no longer on that board but was at one time.  I'm on a host of nonprofit organizations including the chamber--The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, I'm on and other boards, Chicago Commons, and as you mentioned Citizens Information Service, The Community for Law and Justice that used to be called the Organization for Christians and Jews and it's called Community for Law and Justice now.  So I'm on a number of organizations and I'm active on those boards and I try to be active on those boards.  I give money to all of these boards and also I give scholarships to different organizations.  I gave the Illinois CPA Society a very generous scholarship.  I give scholarships to University of Chicago and the University of--NIIT University and so I just think these are things you've got to do.  That's why I'm active on a lot of organizations I belong to and I get a joy out of being involved in these organizations.  Maybe I'm on too many because I'm on quite a few.  So maybe I've got to take a look at that for the future since I'm somewhat semi retired now but I might want to take a look at that.  Also that's how you get clients too is that people see what you do on a volunteer basis and by seeing what you do on a volunteer basis sometimes you might get a call from someone that's seen what you do on a volunteer basis, they want you to do some work for them.  So that has helped too.  I don't get on a board just to try to get work but I have gotten work by being involved on some of the boards, that's not my primary purpose but it happens sometime, that happens to anybody if you stick around long enough.
Story_ID: 76445
Speaker 1: Sir you've seen the development of accounting go from ledger sheets to computerized spreadsheets and what does that mean?  It's been a lot of changes in the way accounting is, the form
Speaker 2: You have hit it on the head.  When I first started, we had big ledger books, paper tape for the machines, there was no PCs [personal computers], we had typewriters so there was no word processing, there was, we had mainframe computers, they did have a few mini computers but they weren't that efficient and they were too expensive for most people.  So basically when we first started, we were basically bookkeeping and accounting and a tax firm and all the taxes were done manually or typed.  So we did everything manually, we had something like thirty clients , thirty, forty, and about fifty clients at our peak as far as accounting clients and everyone of them had their own separate ledger.  They had this little black ledger and we would put together.  We did all the posting manually.  Everything was done like that.  We didn't get into the PC revolution and getting into the computerized statements until the '80s [1980s] and we were probably a little late because we didn't get into it until probably the mid '80s [1980s].  We got out of compilation, they didn't call it compilation then, they called it write up bookkeeping.  We got out of the business in the late '70s [1970s] because we couldn't compete when we moved downtown because we moved downtown in 1976 and we went from paying $250.00 a month to $3,000 a month which was a lot for us at that time.  We could not increase the fees of these people.  Most of these clients were paying us no more than $100 a month, some a lot less than $100 and so once we went downtown, those fees couldn't generate the kind of revenues in order for us to survive.  So we sold it to a couple petitioners on the south side that was interested in it so we got out of the business.  We got back in the business in the mid '80s [1980s] and by the time we got back in the business, if you didn't have a PC or did it on a computer, you couldn't survive because you just can't do it manually anymore.  So we went into that business.  Tax returns, the same thing, we still were typing tax returns until late '80s [1980s] and we changed over and went into computerized Turbo Tax which we have been using ever since and it makes a big difference.  I don't know how we did it manually.  The same with word processing, when we first started we did everything on typewriters, we even had carbon paper.  We would type up and type the reports, type it on carbon and that was very messy if you had a mistake or whatever.  We didn't, we had, the first word processing equipment we had was a mag card machine.  You didn't have a screen but it had these cards that you put in and you would type on these cards and that was a lot more efficient than a typewriter.  Then we went from there to word processing equipment that was before the PC had perfected word processing and then we went from there to the PCs. We didn't get into the lap tops until the '90s [1990s].  When the lap tops first came out, they were very expensive as you know but we started seeing that we couldn't compete-we were not going to be able to compete with other firms if we didn't get into lap tops because all of the people we start hiring in the '90s [1990s] were all computer literate.  Whereas the employees we hired in the '70s [1970s] and early '80s [1980s], they were not computer literate because they didn't teach those computer courses in school.  But they started teaching those computer courses in school in the '80s [1980s] and so anybody who came out, say after '85 [1985]/'86 [1986] were basically computer literate.  So at that point in time, it was much easier to get computers because the people you hired they understood computers.  The people we hired prior to that, they didn't have the computer training.  I myself, I didn't have any computer training.  I came out in '64 [1964] and they didn't have those kinds of computers when I came out of school.
Speaker 1: Xerox was new in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Xerox was new in '64 [1964] and I got my job at Union Carbide, that was the first time I'd seen a copier machine.  I never knew they had copier machines.  So to make a long story short, that's how we got into it.  Now today every one of our employees has a lap top.  When we hire someone, we automatically give them a calculator and a lap top.  They have that as their possession, it's our equipment but we give it to them.  We don't have an employee that does not have a lap top.  Now I can remember just a few years ago when we only had five or six lap tops in here so everybody didn't have one.  Now everybody has a lap top.  They can't operate without a lap top.  We don't use paper as much as we used to.  So we still have a lot of ledger paper but we don't do all the manual recording as we used to, they do it on lap tops now.  So it's made a tremendous difference because it saves a lot of time because if you've got changes to make, it's better than erasing it and trying to make all the changes, you can just make it on a computer.  So every person we hire is computer literate.  We will not hire anybody that's not computer literate.  So that's the biggest change I've seen.
Speaker 1: Have you lost people who just couldn't get with the computer?
Speaker 2: No not because they couldn't get with the computer.  If they are not computer literate, we won't hire them.  You mean people who have been here for a while?
Speaker 1: You lost people that never got with the computer.
Speaker 2: I don't know if we lost them for that reason, maybe we did. That could have been as we started getting involved with the computers, we could have lost some people because of that.  But even some of those people went back and took some computer courses or whatever because today if you're not computer literate, you can't operate in this business.  You have to be computer literate.  So we just won't hire you if you don't have computer skills.

Speaker 1: Okay. Just going back a minute to this Enron thing and some of the other scandals, what's your philosophy or ethics in terms of accounting?  Do you have a philosophy?
Speaker 2: Philosophy or ethics is that you do the right thing.  You do what--we all took ethics courses and we all know what the rules are set down by the American Institute of CPA, CPAs, the state societies, the FASB [Federal Accounting Standards Board] and all the different guidelines.  The problem is probably a little overblown because what you see is when you look at the majority of accountants, 99 percent of accountants are honest.  What you've seen is a situation where the media has exposed these large corporations and it's a handful of them, let's say a dozen or more corporations and if you notice these are all big firms that are doing this work.  These are not small firms and so if you isolate that in the scheme of things and put it in real terms, these are very few isolated cases.  It's looks big because they are big corporations and what has happened is a couple of things.  One is that in a lot of cases these corporation they'll say I'm the auditor for this corporation and this corporation now hires me away from my job.  So I no longer work for Hill Taylor now, I go to work for ABC Corporation and I've been working with you and you and I have been working together on this.  So now you have a lot of confidence in me when you come to do the audit next year because you worked with me on the audit the year before so now I'm the CFO, I'm the controller or whatever I am.  So you are less, what is happening is that in a lot of cases the auditor since you've worked with me before, you don't do all your due diligence like you should have and that's part of the problem where the independence problem comes into play that I see.  If a firm hires you away from your firm, you should not be involved in their audit for a certain minimum period of time.  I don't know whether it should be two, three years, somewhere like that.  I don't see how you can be involved the very next year and be involved in the audit.  I think that's some of the problems that have happened.  And the other thing is that you've had a few people that hung up on making the money.  They didn't want to lose the billing or to lose the fee.  So they compromise their integrity by doing things they shouldn't have done in order for them not to lose the fees and because the fees mean money to them.  So I think that's what happens. So you have a few isolated cases where you have some greed there but the whole industry shouldn't suffer because of that.  Because if you read the papers, you'll see that these are primarily in large corporations and these are isolated incidents.  It's not the whole profession, I guarantee you that.
Story_ID: 76447
Speaker 1: Sir, now how would you assess your own legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy.  I would like to think that I've added a lot to the profession because again as I told you earlier, I've opened up some doors that weren't open when I first started the profession.  I've given a lot of people opportunities.  We've had--I don't know how many employees we've had over the years but I know over 200, I'm guessing, I don't know the exact amount.  So I've given a lot of people starts.  I know for a fact, we have at least a dozen or more people that used to work for me that got their own firms now and got their own companies--got their own accounting firms.  Then you've got some others that are involved in other entrepreneurial activities.  So I think we've had some effect there where people have learned some things here and decided to go out on their own.  My legacy would be that I've given people the opportunity.  We've got a good viable firm here and we've got a good name and we want to try and keep a good name here.  It's tough, this is a tough business and when I got into the business, there was only a handful of accounting firms of people of color that owned accounting firms and most of those are gone now.  You've got couple still left but you don't have that many.  I looked up one day and found I was in business twenty-five years and I didn't do anything for the 25th year and then I looked around and then I'm saying well I'm going to be in business 30 years.  I decided to have a big blast for the 30th anniversary and I did and we had over 550 people show up for it.  So it was a nice tribute to us that the people thought that much about us.  Clients, business associates, friends, family the whole works was there.  And so my legacy is that we've built a good name and we hope the name continues and also the fact that my son is taking over day to day operations and very rarely in a minority business do you have a situation where the children will stay around long enough to take over the practice.  So I guess I'm blessed and fortunate that I have had that opportunity.  So I just hope it works.
Story_ID: 76448
Speaker 1: Did your father get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: Yes he did.  My father--as a matter of fact my father came to our first open house when we moved downtown.  We were the first minority firm to move downtown.  I didn't get into that but we've got a lot of firsts.  We were the first minority firm--CPA firm to move downtown.  We were at 180 N. LaSalle Street.  We got a big open house back in 1976 and my father came to it and so he got a chance to meet at that time some of my clients.  I'd only been in business five years at that point in time.  So my father got an opportunity to see some of my success.  Also the National Association of Black Accountants had a big banquet in Baltimore [Maryland] one year and he came to that.  So he came as my guest to that and so he was privy to some of the things I was doing.
Story_ID: 76449
Speaker 1: This question is kind of--slightly different from the legacy one but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as the person that gave people opportunity and try to help people no matter what.  That's how I like to be remembered.  Someone that gave people opportunity and did everything I could to help people.  Not necessarily by giving money but advice, counsel, money whatever you want to call it.
Story_ID: 76450
Speaker 1: One last thing what do you see as the future, what's around the corner for this firm and for black accountants?
Speaker 2: Well I hope for this firm that we still stay in existence.  I'm hoping that my son carry on.  I'm not fully retired, I'm just semi retired which means that I'm not going to be coming in everyday.  I've got some other activities that I'm involved now that I want to pursue.  But I'm still around here in the firm.  I'm leaving it up to him and my partner, Ken Yu who is my other partner who is Asian.  He's been with me 25 years.  The two of them basically are going to be leading the firm and we know the direction we want to go in because it's pretty well established.  We know that we are interested in non profits, employee benefits and also internal audits.  They might go in another direction somewhere down the road, I don't know, that's something to look at.  We want to continue bringing in good people and continue to be in business.  It never dawn on me that I would be in business for thirty years when I started.  Thirty years is a long time, it's a generation and so hopefully they'll be in business another thirty years and carry on a tradition.  So we'll see.   My son is young so he can last another thirty years.
Story_ID: 76451
Speaker 1: Well, one of the things that I would look forward to in the future is to see more blacks owning their own businesses.  Today as opposed to when I was in school, they have a lot of courses in entrepreneurialships.  The University of Chicago, for instance, has an entrepreneurialship center; University of Illinois has something on entrepreneurialship.  When I was in school that was unheard of.  In fact, most people wanted a job; they did not want to go in business for themselves.  Most people wanted to work in a major corporation.  I think we've got a lot of opportunities for people of color to really get involved in owning their own businesses because I think there are a lot rewards in owning your own businesses that you don't get in a major corporation.  And what do I mean by that?  I mean you are self motivated number one, number two you have to make your own destiny.  I mean, you can't depend on anybody else so therefore if you want to make money, that means you have to go out and you've got to work hard to do that because you can't depend on that salary you're going to get if you're going to work for a major corporation.  But once you do that and have been able to grow a business, you really appreciate it more because it's something you put your own blood and sweat and tears in.  There are many days I've went without a payroll and I wasn't always successful.  So once I achieved success where I was able to pay myself a decent salary and whatever and able to live generously then I started appreciating what I had done and I think that we should try to promote people of color to get more involved in owning their own businesses.  In owning your own business, though, you have to have a lot of discipline.  Success may not come in the first year, you've got to have--you've got to make sure that you have the staying power to stick it out and you've got to be a manager.  So if you do those things, then you will have an opportunity to see.  Someone asked me once, well what's the key to success in owning your own business?  There were three things that I said that I always quote to say.  One is you've got to be a salesperson.  In other words you've got to know how to sell.  The other one is you've got to be a good administrator.  So--which means that you've got to know how to administer the business--manage the business.  The other one is that you've got to be good technically.  Now very rarely do you find somebody that's good in all three of those.  Every now and then you can find somebody good in all three of those but most of the time you don't.  So in order to be successful, you've got to be good in at least two of them and you have to recognize that you are not good in all three.  You've got to recognize the two that you are strongest in and then the one you are weakest in.  You have to go out and buy that talent.  So you've got to say okay I'm not good at this, I'm going to have to go out and buy that talent.  So three years I started out being very good technically and probably a good sales person.  I wasn't sure whether I was a good administrator.  Now as time has worn on, I'm a good administrator and I'm also a good salesperson.  I'm not a good technical person as I was years ago because I don't keep up with it.  But I bought the talent and that's what you've got to do.  And I think that's one of the reasons why businesses fail.  I'm talking about any kind of business now.  It's that people don't recognize where they are weak at and if you recognize you are weak somewhere, you've got to find that talent somewhere to help you. Now if you don't have discipline and none of those, it's going to be tougher for you because that means you've got to go out and buy all that talent.  If you are not a good administrator, you're not good technically and you're not, what's the other I said,  a good sales person if you've got to buy all three of those then you're in trouble because that means you don't know what you're doing and that's what happens in a lot of businesses.  They don't know what they are doing. They go out and they start a business and they don't a discipline in none of them.  If you are lucky enough to be good in one of them then you need to make sure that you recognize that in time so you can go out and buy the talent--two of them, two of the disciplines.  But that might be hard because you might have the cash there.  But the bottom line is if you are good in at least two of them, you've got a great chance to succeed if you recognize it.  So that's what I tell people.
Story_ID: 76452
Speaker 1: Thinking back across your mentors and your parents and people that influenced you where would you say you got your skills in those three areas and when?
Speaker 2: Well the technical was easy; I'd say I got my skills there from the professor named Herb Willis.  He was the one, I believe that gave me all the technical skills or gave me or at least got me on the way to getting technical skills when I was very technical.  The marketing skills, I don't know where I picked that up from, I guess I may have picked some up--some of it from my father, people that I know because I never knew I was a salesperson.  You know, accounting is a soft sale; you're not going door to door.  I did sell encyclopedias one year and I was miserable at that, I could not make it well in that.  But the administrative skills I'd say I got that from going to grad school.  There's a Professor McKersey (ph.) that I--when I majored in personnel management who was my counselor and I think I can say that he helped me quite a bit as doing that.  The other way I gained some administrative skills was work with Garland Guice with the Chicago Economic Development Corporation because he gave me an opportunity-he's deceased now but he gave me an opportunity when I was twenty five/twenty six years old to manage people and I learned a lot from him because he was more my mentor in that respect.  At that time I was totally out of accounting and basically what I was doing was administration and he taught me a lot there.  So he was my mentor when it comes to that.  So those are the ones I'd say.
Story_ID: 76453
Speaker 1: One last thing real quick, this is shifting gears a little bit but in your experience and looking over the last thirty years when you deal with chief executive officers and directors of foundations do you feel that they are adequately informed about accounting for the position that they are in and do you feel there's been any change in that from where things were ten or twenty years ago and where things are now?
Speaker 2: Sometimes they are, sometimes they are not.  Sometimes--the majority of the times, I'd say yes but sometimes in the smaller nonprofit--if you're talking nonprofit organizations, the smaller nonprofit organizations they don't have the luxury sometimes of being able to spend the money to get the right person and they don't really understand finance.  So they sometimes will hire people who really don't understand all the rules of accounting and understand what they should.  So they sometimes will hire somebody less than what they should hire because sometimes they don't really put accounting as being a priority.  They look at programs and they don't look at accounting.  I think you mentioned to me early on about a program you took over where they hadn't done anything for years and that's the mentality.  The larger nonprofits yes because the larger non profits understand that they can't get money.  When I talk about larger ones, ones like the Red Cross or the Boys Scouts or the Girl Scouts.  They know they have to have adequate bookkeeping or they can't get any money so they know better.  But some of the smaller ones, you have to really educate them to this.
Story_ID: 76454
Speaker 1: I know you mentioned Mr. [Ken] Yu, you came up on the elevator with him
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: he is a partner with you and I noticed on your resume you are a member of the Jap Pan American Society and all that, what has that association meant to you--to the success--?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  The Japan American Society, I'm involved in that because I went to Japan at the expense of the Japanese government about ten years ago.  They had a program for international executives where they teach you how Japanese customs or moires show you how to do business, take you on a plant tours.  We're in about ten cities, teach you the culture.  I was there for a whole month, they had never had a black in the program before so I was the first black in that program and this is worldwide.  They had people from France, Germany, Australia, Canada, England all over the world.  They had about fifteen of us in the program and so I learned a lot from that program.  What it has done for me is it has helped me to understand how the Japanese do business and how other cultures-I've been involved with other cultures and how they do business.  As far as getting business, I haven't really gotten a lot of business from that.  I do have another venture that I'm involved in, it's a trading company that is a spin off on some of the contacts I've had with the Japan American Society but as far as accounting, no it has not helped me in that respect.
Speaker 1: Mr. Yu is Chinese?
Speaker 2: Mr. Yu is Chinese; he was from Hong Kong initially.  We recruited him right out of--he's never worked anywhere else but here.  We recruited him out of the University of Illinois I think 1978 or 1977.  Eugene Varnaro (ph.) was the one who recruiting him and he's been with us ever since and he's been a partner with me now for about eight years.
Story_ID: 76455
Speaker 1: You asked me about entrepreneurship and more blacks should get involved in entrepreneurship.  There is an organization called ABLE, called Alliance of Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs and it's comprised of about sixty companies and these are all black owned companies.  You have to black owned in order to be involved in it and they are all entrepreneurs and this is kind of unheard of.  We've been out there for about ten years now and the purpose is to increase our net worth and also to promote networking among minority members.  And so they are a very good organization and I was a past president of the organization.  The president now is a gentleman by the name of Jim Reynolds, I don't know if you know him.  But some of the other past presidents were [HM] Don Jackson who was the founder, I don't know if you know Don Jackson of Central City Productions.  [HM] Ralph Moore was another past president and [HM] John Rogers, Ariel Capital was another past president. So we have some good people in this organization and we always try to promote entrepreneurialship whenever we can.  So we do a lot of networking with this organization and it's grown from--I'm a founding member and it's grown from about fifteen of us to we have about sixty members now.  So I just wanted to mention that.
Speaker 2: That's an important thing to mention, important work.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Sure.
