Story_ID: 34524
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright now I'm going to ask about your family history, I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family separately from your father's side and then we will bring them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Elizabeth Mary Ellington.  Elizabeth is E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, M-A-R-Y, E-L-L-I-N-G-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is October 22, 1922.
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: Place of birth, Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what are the stories?
Speaker 2: Well what I can tell you my mother's side of the family is pretty sketchy in the sense of the sort of a fractured past.  She did not know a great deal about her father.  She didn't know a great deal about her grandfather.  Her father, Edward Ellington, I think his actually name was William Edward Ellington.  He passed away very early in life.  He was a chauffeur and he worked primarily for rich white people in and around the Chattanooga Missionary Ridge area which is an affluent section of Chattanooga and he also was known for his gambling habits.  He was a numbers runner and also was involved in bootlegging and host of other things.  And I guess a good part of that was part of survival during those days.  Blacks particularly in that area were not financially well off and to make ends meet.  My mom was a single child she did not have any brothers or sisters.  The family moved from Chattanooga to Detroit [Michigan] in the late '20s [1920s] around 1929, 1930.  My grandfather, her dad found his way up north partly because of his illegal activities of numbers running and someone told him that he was going to make a much better deal up in the Detroit area versus down in Tennessee so he packed up the family and moved up there.  My mother at the time, I know she was about seven or eight years at the time when that happened.  Soon after he had arrived up there and was kind of more involved with doing the numbers running type thing he was killed.  The short story at least the story that we know of was that either someone got into an argument with him over owing some money and he was shot.  My mother--when that happened my mother was not quite ten years old, I think she was nine or ten years old at the time that it happened so she did not know a lot and my grandmother did not tell her an awful lot other than the fact that it involved an altercation with some money loan and as a result he was killed.  Soon after that occurred my grandmother and my mother temporarily moved to Chicago for about a year, year and half.  My grandmother had some friends that lived there and she stayed there for about a year and then moved back to Detroit in the early '30s [1930s] about that time my mother was about eleven or twelve years old at that time they moved back to Detroit.
Story_ID: 34525
Speaker 1: Did your mother's [Elizabeth Mary Ellington Patton] family have other relatives in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.  They had other relatives in Detroit.  My grandmother's sister lived in Detroit [Michigan] she actually took care of us quite a bit later on in years.  And then also there were some uncles and aunts that kind of migrated north to Detroit.  The auto industry, of course is what migrated them there.  So from my mother's side that's kind of about all I can tell you because you know in that early part of her life.  She went on as she got older and was doing well in school; she earned a scholarship at Hunter College School of Nursing in New York.  That was in 1942.
Speaker 1: What high school did your mother come out of in Detroit?
Speaker 2: My mother graduated from Northern High School in Detroit.  In fact, an interesting part, she went to Breitmeyer Elementary School which is the same elementary school that all of my brothers and sisters went to.  So we kind of lived in the same neighborhood that my mother grew up in.  She went to Sherrod Junior School (unclear) and all of my brothers and sisters all attended there.  And Northern High school is where most of my brothers and sisters attended with the exception of my oldest brother and I who went to Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School].  Getting back to my mother--.
Speaker 1: She went to Hunter College?
Speaker 2: She went to Hunter College to nursing school in New York, I'm not sure exactly the date but somewhere right around the time of World War II, finished school and she had a payback assignment with the US Public Health Service where she was assigned to Ellis Island as one of the public health service nurses.  She had to do that for two years and then she completed that and moved back to Detroit.  Right about the time she well actually yeah right about the time she moved back to Detroit is where she met my father and he was at the time transitioning out of the army, served in World War II.  They happened to meet in New York at a Harlem USO [United Service Organizations] is where they first met.  My father who was from Pennsylvania was planning on going back to the coal towns of New Castle, Pennsylvania but my mother convinced him to come to Detroit with her and so that's how he ended up in Detroit.
Story_ID: 34526
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright let's just go to your father's side and what is your father's full name?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Thomas Carter Patton, T-H-O-M-A-S, C-A-R-T-E-R and P-A-T-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth and actually I had to look it up so I'm not sure if I'm telling, I think it's May 17, 1917 or it might be 1918.  I had to look it up and I don't quite remember what it is; I know its May 17.
Speaker 1: And he was born in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Actually he was born in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you know about his side?
Speaker 2: Well his side of the family, he actually is pretty detailed about his background.  His grandfather was a runaway slave and what he knew of his grandfather, actually got to know his grandfather pretty well.  His grandfather was very, very young didn't quite know what his age was at the time he was taken in by a family in a town of Lawrence, Massachusetts and estimated--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, well slow down a little bit on this one because this is--seems like you got a lot of detail--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah there is a lot of detail on this side.
Speaker 1: Do you know this story-how he escaped and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  He was very young, my great grandfather was very young and estimated age was between eight and ten, eight and twelve somewhere around that.
Speaker 1: So he was able to escape slavery, where was he enslaved?
Speaker 2: Well he did not know and even in the word escaped that's loosely interpreted to mean that he may have been with his parents, he may have been with someone else.  That part of his life he really didn't know other than the fact that he was with a group of people, they were running from slave owners and as they were sort of pigeon holed in different places he ended up with this family in Lawrence, Massachusetts who had the last name of Patton and he adopted that name.  And as my great grandfather got little older he found his way into working with the railroad and that brought him out to the western Pennsylvania area somewhere not quite in the New Castle area but somewhere in the western Pennsylvania where he worked in the railroad yard.  He also worked a little bit in coal mining but it was kind of associated with railroad work.  Where they were taking the coal onto trains and taking it to different places and that's where he ended up in the Wheeling, West Virginia area where my father was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's an interesting story it rings true on the level that a kid wouldn't know where he was from necessarily.  Explains how they were enslaved people weren't necessarily abreast of that kind of information.  Where they might know the place their own or the county, the state, you know.  Grade school kids now don't know the difference between the state and the city.
Speaker 2: That's right.  So in my great grandfather's story which was--he didn't know a lot of it.  I mean what I told you is all that has been passed to me and from my grandfather to my father you know they filled in some of the blanks but a lot of that may have unsubstantiated information.  But what I gave you was details about how they ended up in the Pennsylvania area and so forth.
Speaker 1: Well that's the story and people can try and pin it down but I don't think there is a way to completely pin down any story but that's the story.  So he ends up in Wheeling, West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandfather ends up in Wheeling, West Virginia which is where my grandfather was born.  And my father was also born there as well.
Story_ID: 34527
Speaker 1: My grandfather continued on in the business of working in the railroad.  Primarily he pretty much took his dad's job in working at the railroad yard that transported the coal throughout the United States.  So he started right about the time my grandfather was about to retire.
Speaker 2: So this is maybe in the late 1900s or 1890s?
Speaker 1: Yeah 1890s or 1900s or so.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this was your great grandfather the first Vincent William Patton?
Speaker 1: My great grandfather was Vincent William Patton.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So is the second one your grandfather, he was the second and he was an only child.  Actually, correction he was the only living child.  My grandfather had four siblings, two sisters and a brother.  The two sisters passed away before they were five, the brother was stillborn.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, continue with your grandfather.  Now he worked with the railroad yard--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: He worked with the railroad yard and then eventually migrated up to New Castle, Pennsylvania.  He met a mulatto woman and he actually met her up in Youngstown, Pennsylvania area and so forth.  She was raised primarily with a Quaker family but mulatto and so my grandfather when they married--her name was Catherine and that's what sent my grandfather to go move up into the New Castle area because that's where there was an opportunity for him to have the same job up in New Castle working in the railroad yard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father was born in Wheeling, right and then being raised in New Castle?
Speaker 2: And raised in New Castle.  Yeah he was just born there may have only lived there a matter of a few months.  At the time my grandfather and grandmother were already planning on moving up near her family.
Speaker 1: Now did your grandfather I mean your father work on the railroad too?
Speaker 2: Well my father he had a whole different approach kind of like I did in terms of you know, living in Detroit where the auto industry is where everybody went.  New Castle was a coal mining, railroad yard and he didn't want anything to do with either.  So when he turned seventeen which was 1935, '36 [1936] or something like that.  When he turned seventeen he went into the army.
Speaker 1: So he joined prior to World War II?
Speaker 2: He joined prior to World War II.  So he went into the army with the sole intent of just getting out of New Castle.  He wanted nothing to do with--nothing against his folks he just saw that there was a bigger world out there and he was very much interested in just seeing the world.  He was engrossed in books that told him about life and other parts of the United States as well as the world.  His only option particularly at that time was either join the army or the navy and during that time it was segregated services they had a quota.  He first wanted to join the navy and the navy said they didn't have any available openings for him so he ended up in the army.
Story_ID: 34528
Speaker 1: Not available openings for blacks--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: For black soldiers because as a black sailor his only opportunity as a black sailor was to be a steward.  He was okay with that because what he saw out of it was going out on a ship, going to see all over the world.  So his only option was to go into the army which he joined the army during the segregated times.  The army had two branches and that was the quarter master corp. which was for supply and the engineer corp. which was pretty much ditch digging.  So he chose the ditch digging life seeing as he saw it as an opportunity to sort of learn a little bit more of getting into the construction business.  He was first sent to El Paso, Texas where he went through his training and after El Paso he went to, I forgot where he went after that.  But I know there was another assignment that he went to before World War II occurred and then World War II he was assigned to the 306th engineering battalion which is now part of the 82nd airborne at that time it was not.  That particular battalion is now part of the 82nd airborne.  I tell you that because the significance of that is my son later when he joined the army he went in that very battalion so it is pretty interesting.
Speaker 1: Now your father had been in at the start of World War II which starts in 1941 had he obtained a sergeant position at the time?
Speaker 2: He was a sergeant at the time.  He was at the time a technical sergeant as the title was referred to and his job he became very good at doing surveys, road construction so he was pretty good at it.  He kind of worked his craft into doing road construction design and working with the corps of engineers that were building combat roads in World War II.  So he was sent with the unit to--which was actually an integrated unit although his particular group was all blacks but it was actually an integrated unit.  The army did not want that to be called an integrated unit obviously.  He was sent to Italy and was involved with a lot of the construction work on building or redesigning road work for--that occurred with the Battle of Bulge and that was one of his what he felt was one of his significant accomplishments was being involved with that.
Story_ID: 34529
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting, this Sergeant [Thomas Carter] Patton is clearing the roads for General [George S. Patton] Patton.
Speaker 2: Exactly and he was chided about that quite a bit and although he never met General Patton he had always wanted and liked to have just for the sole purpose of the name.  Throughout the time he was there everyone made comments about Patton's road that was built and their reference was to him versus to General Patton.  Although of course, as you know the history in the Battle of Bulge that was one of Patton's big accomplishments; my father had hoped at least somewhere that somewhere along the line that word got to General Patton that another Patton worked on this road but he always joked about the fact.  His war story was always about General Patton took credit for something that I did (laugh).
Speaker 1: So okay.  So he was in the war for--any other stories about the war?
Speaker 2: No other stories about the war.  That was the one that sticks out the most.  He was also sent to other places, toward the end of the war his unit was sent to do the final work on the Alaskan Canadian highway the Alcan Highway which of course, that was a remarkable engineering achievement that was done by an all black engineering battalion, I think it was the 555th I can't remember exactly who it was but my father's group was sent up there to do some of the work toward the end of the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said around 1945 or 6 that your parents meet in New York.
Speaker 2: My parents met in New York actually they met in 1944.  This was when my father came back from Italy or from New York I'm not sure I think he did some other assignment there as well.
Speaker 1: That would be the last (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was sent back and he was sent to Fort Jay New York which was sort of a receiving station which was located on Governors Island, New York.  The significance to telling you that was that my first assignment in the Coast Guard was Governors Island, New York.  My mom [Elizabeth Mary Ellington Patton] and dad met there at Governors Island, New York because the nurses from Ellis Island some of them lived on Governors Island on the quarters there.  My dad and mom happened to see each other on one of the ferries there from downtown Manhattan that goes to Governors Island and they kind of met first in that area and kind of stayed in touch when my dad was shipped off up to the Yukon Territory in Alaska to finish with the Alcan Highway project.  Then when that was done and they started to discussing about getting married and they married towards the end of 1945 and my oldest brother was born several months after that.
Story_ID: 34530
Speaker 1: So they settled in Detroit--?
Speaker 2: They settled in Detroit my dad [Thomas Carter Patton] initially--part of who was hiring at the auto industry and my dad initially worked for Ford Motor Company.  He worked on the assembly line for awhile, he didn't really like it but it was a job.  He took that for awhile and then he later applied for a couple of construction jobs.  He kind of went from one construction job to another based on when the availability was and around the time I was born in 1954 he took a job with the Michigan Army National Guard as an employee.  That particular National Guard unit in the Detroit area was in engineering which of course, my dad did that in the army so it was great fit for him.  So from 1954 until his retirement in 1974 he worked for the Michigan Army National Guard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you've got an older brother, did you have other siblings and can you name them?
Speaker 2: Sure, my oldest brother Gregory, G-R-E-G-O-R-Y, D-E-N-N-I-S and Patton was the first born.  Born in April 1946, April 17th I believe.  To this day he remains as--we are the closest and it's interesting because we are eight years apart and there are other siblings between us but for whatever reason there was this lot to the oldest brother which I think is kind of natural.  My brother Greg always provided to me as the person who was very forward thinking in life.  He was--he is still around very successful, very successful with school and everything Greg did I wanted to do.  Greg was an Eagle Scout, I wanted to be an Eagle Scout and I became an Eagle Scout.  Greg went to Cass Tech High School [Cass Technical High School], I wanted to go to Cass Tech High School and I did.  So after Greg graduates from high school because there are so many brothers and sisters and I will tell you about the rest of them there were ten of us all together.  He wanted to go to college and he knew that the only way he was going to go to college was to go into the military and he decided to join the Navy.  From the time he joined the navy at that time I was ten years old and he was eighteen, all I talked about during those years was I was going to be just like Greg and I was going to join the Navy.
Story_ID: 34531
Speaker 1: Alright.  So proceed with the rest of your siblings.
Speaker 2: So my brother Greg, of course goes to the navy and I want to go in the navy but I end up in the Coast Guard and that's a story I will tell you a little bit later.  The next sibling is my sister well we call her Sue but her name is actually Viola Lajean Patton, Viola is V-I-O-L-A, L-A-J-E-A-N and maiden Patton but later married it was Johnson.  She passed away almost three years ago from a series of strokes.  She had a very incredible life as well.  In high school she was a track star, went to Northern High School, in fact I remember going back to Northern High School, oh gosh twenty or so years ago before they were going to tear it down, walking down the hallway and they had this hall of heroes and it was exciting to see my sister's name among the track star elites.  She tried out for the '64 [1964] Olympics and was selected as an alternative in other words she did not compete in the events but she was standing by ready to go if anyone from the track team.  Her specialties were the 440 and hurdles, those were her specialties.  The '64 [1964] Olympics was in Tokyo if I'm not mistaken.  She ended up not going because they had enough but she was selected as an alternate which, of course is quite an honor for her to get that but that also landed her a scholarship to Ferris State College now called Ferris State University up in Big Rapids, Michigan where she majored in physical education.  She went to school and after that she became a school teacher moving back down into Detroit [Michigan].  Surprisingly, we thought she would become a physical education teacher because that was what she majored in but she opted to go into being a high school English and history teacher and she taught for many years in the Detroit public school system.  Tragic story of her husband, Clifford who was a Detroit police officer who was gunned down in the line of duty, this occurred somewhere in mid '70s [1970s] at a traffic stop and he was shot and killed by the driver who was an escaped convict, later determined.  Then about ten or so years after that her youngest son was also killed by accident, unfortunately.  He was going over to see his girlfriend and he was going through the back door, the father thought there was a burglary, actually the place had been burglarized just before that, and of course he didn't know that then when my nephew went back there unfortunately he was shot by the father.  So there were a couple of very tragic incidents that occurred with my sister.
Story_ID: 34532
Speaker 1: The next after that is a brother named Frank.  Frank was an interesting guy, he was born--oh let me back up my sister Viola was born a year later after my brother.  She was born in May of 1947 and then a year after that well a little more than a year after that in September of 1948 my brother Frank Edward who--Frank was named after my grandmother Frances [Ellington Patton], the Edward was named after my grandfather, Edward.  For awhile he unofficially changed his name to Ellington partly--when he was going through school he thought it was cool to have a name of Ellington and they could call him Duke (laugh) but it was kind of an unofficial last name change and most kids in school knew him as Frank Edward Ellington although it was Patton.  When he went into the Marine Corps. right about the height of the Vietnam War, he opted to go into the Marine Corps. versus waiting to get drafted partly he was somewhat rebellious.  He was a very good person but rebellious in the sense of he didn't like school, he loved the women, you couldn't tell him anything but he was a very smart guy.  So he went into the Marine Corps. as a--his option my dad said go into school or go into the military and he said alright I will go into the military.  So that's what he did he went into the Marine Corps.  We were kind of nervous because it was the height of the Vietnam War at the time and he did a tour in Vietnam.  Never talks about it, to this day I'm very sure that he has experienced traumatic--post traumatic stress disorder and every once in awhile he will leak out a little bit about what happened during his time in Vietnam.  But a typical marine, he loved being a marine no question about it, in fact when he came back and got out and he went into the reserve for awhile, kicked around, jobs here and there and then he went back into the Marine Corps. and did a career and he retired after twenty six years as a chief foreign officer.  His job primarily toward the end of his career--he was assigned to the rifle range at 29 Palms California.  He was kind of known as what they call them, armor--he is a guns guy; he still is a guns guy.  He retired comfortably living in the Detroit area right now.  He has been married a couple of times and he is doing quite well.
Story_ID: 34533
Speaker 1: After that comes my sister Stephanie her middle name is Quintella maiden Patton.  S-T-E-P-H-A-N-I-E, Q-U-I-N-T-E-L-L-A.  She is two years older than I she was born in 1952.  She pretty much led a nice, uneventful life in the sense that we used to call her the drama queen.  There is no drama about her because she is kind of just there and we use to make fun of the fact that she was too mild and laid back.  We would create stories for her to try and get her going but she is doing quite well; after she finished high school she had a great success story.  Went to work for Kmart, first as a cashier and then running the customer service desk and she moved around the various Kmart stores in and around the Detroit [Michigan] area.  One day a lady comes into the Kmart in south Flint, Michigan and goes to her that she has a problem with a purchase that occurred and my sister helped her out, took care of it and got her a refund or whatever that was needed.  The lady turns out to be the CEO of Kmart, she tells her husband about how well this woman took care of her and so the next day or maybe the next week or so, the CEO of Kmart comes into the store and he goes up to my sister and says "You're getting kicked upstairs."  The CEO decided he wanted to have people who were really involved with customer service to be running the customer service program for Kmart.  I mean it was just like that, one day she was just above a minimum paying job into a middle management and later an executive job.  Of course, Kmart sent her on to school and she got her degree at Wayne State University and pretty much ran the Kmart customer service which later became quality assurance program for many years and she took the buyout retirement in the early '90s [1990s] when Kmart was acquired by Sears; actually the story is Sears acquired--Kmart acquired Sears versus Sears acquired Kmart however that went.  But she took the early buyout and now is very involved in working with the church and so forth.
Story_ID: 34534
Speaker 1: After me another brother who is two years younger than me born in '56 [1956].  His name is Francis Charles Patton, F-R-A-N-C-I-S, C-H-A-R-L-E-S and he goes by Chuck his middle name another sibling that bore the name of my grandmother; so he got Francis while the older brother got Frank.  Chuck another great young man; in fact while I revered my oldest brother as my role model and mentor, I revered the younger brother for his innovation and ingenuity.  He is an accomplished artist, he was--after high school he went to Northern High School as well and after high school he went on to Central Michigan University.  Played football, was very good in football, in fact he got a scholarship playing football but the funny thing was he hated football, hated it with a passion but it paid the bills to get him into college.  Art is his thing and it still is his thing.  After college he went to Boston [Massachusetts], took a job with a gentleman by the name of Stan Lee who runs Marvel Comics and started out as just doing gofer stuff and worked at a side job working in an art frame store and later Stan Lee elevates him to becoming an illustrator and he later becomes involved with writing and producing many of the comics that are in Marvel comics such as 'The Avengers', he has done 'Justice Legal America' which I think is DC comics, I'm not a big comic guy but anyway if you Google his name it will tell you everything he has done.  He is an Oscar and an Emmy award winner.  The movie 'Spawn' he was the illustrator for that and the television show 'Double Dragon' where he got his Emmy he was the producer and illustrator for that.  Currently he lives out in the Hollywood area and sort of a freelance cartoonist, illustrator.  And he teaches on the side as well, a lecturer at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles], USC [University of California] and other places but he is a great guy.
Speaker 2: Alright, I will say that again.  I read about your brother in "Black Enterprise", right?
Speaker 1: Right, that is correct.
Speaker 2: There is an article about him and other black cartoonists that are really making a big splash now especially when a lot of these comics are being turn into movies.
Speaker 1: That's right, exactly and there is very few black cartoonists around so, you know I didn't realize it.  I like I said I revered him very well.  My daughter has been a big fan of his and she kind of--that's her role model and mentor because my daughter--she tool art in college because of Uncle Chuck.  I went to meet my brother one day when I was in San Diego on business, I was still on active duty at the time and they had this comic convention, "Comic Con" they call it.  So I go to see him and I am kind of wandering around to try and find him so I stop somebody and I asked them, well I am looking for Chuck Patton and this lady said you and about a couple of thousand other people are looking for him.  That's when it really hit me wow he is big and then when I saw him and I saw people swarming and so forth he is just a mellow, laid back guy.  In a crowd you would never know that he is one of the most successful guys around.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's quite a world.
Story_ID: 34535
Speaker 1: After him comes my brother Robert Reginald Patton, R-O-B-E-R-T, R-E-G-I-N-A-L-D.  He passed away two years ago of a heart attack which was very unfortunate.  He went into the mortician business and living in Cincinnati [Ohio] area.  Interestingly, he wanted to be a mortician since he was eight years old.  In fact, as a child this use to scare us a lot, he called us into his bedroom and he stretched out in the bed like he was stretched out in a coffin and it used to really give us (unclear) (laugh).  But yeah he wanted to be a mortician, how did that come about, the only thing I can tell you is that my grandmother, my maternal grandmother Frances [Ellington Patton] she was a big church going lady, big big church going lady and as we were growing up we all went to church.  Now we would go to church with my grandmother you don't go to one church, you go to--its sun up to sun down.  You go to one service you're done, then you go to the next service so by nine o'clock maybe ten o'clock at night you might come home around that time.  That's how my grandmother used to deal with all of us until we got a little older and we started doing our own thing.  My brother Bob, he stuck with it.  And so as a result of all these churches was funerals and my grandmother went to as many funerals as she went to church.  She knew all these people then she started going if she didn't know people because she knew the funeral director and so forth and my brother would go with it.  All of sudden he wanted to be a funeral director, a mortician that was his dream and he did it.  As I said, unfortunately, he passed away two years ago.  The next sister is Mary Elizabeth Washington now but Mary Elizabeth Patton.  Mary actually took my mother's name but just switched it around.  If I were to show you a picture with my mother and my sister Mary you could not tell the difference.  They looked exactly alike; they even have the same mannerisms.  We often called her mom; we would call her mom before my mom passed away.  We actually called her mom junior when my mom [Elizabeth Mary Ellington Patton] was alive.  Mary is the director of the YMCA [Young Man's Christian Association] in Detroit [Michigan] been doing that for a number of years.  She is married to a now retired Detroit police officer who served for about thirty years as a police officer.

Speaker 1: The next sister Catherine who got her name from my paternal grandmother; her name is Catherine Frieda Patton and Cathy is--she runs a or is co-owner of the physical security business in the Detroit [Michigan].  She--after high school she kind of moved around from job to job, wasn't quite sure exactly what she wanted to do, married a couple of times.  She actually had a very good job working for Big Lots and she got involved with doing the security part of it, didn't know much about it but I guess she kind of walked into that job and it kind of taught her how to, you know maybe I should do this on my own.  So she went into a partnership with a couple of former co-workers and they are running a security business.  And then last but not least my brother David; David Duncan Patton we call him Duncan Hines (laugh) D-A-V-I-D, D-U-N-C-A-N.  David's the baby and will probably always be called the baby.  David actually is the only one of the ten of us that went to work in the auto business and so of course, it is what he had always done.  He has had some struggles of sorts because he has been laid off a number of times and has gone back.  He is back working now he is working with Chrysler, working in the plant I'm not sure exactly what he does now but tool and die was his trade.  He started out working at Ford, he spent a lot of long years working at Ford and then he went over to Chrysler in fact, he could tell you some stories in the sense of the struggles of working in the auto industry but that's what he wants to do and that's what he likes to do.  That's the ten of us I don't think I missed anybody.
Story_ID: 34537
Speaker 1: Now this is probably the most detailed story I have ever heard of siblings.  I mean really, but it's good, these are great descriptions of your brothers and sisters and speak to your family history.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, several (laugh).  One earliest childhood memory and I'm going to say this on camera because when I was talking to a couple of siblings both via email and on the phone they all told me don't talk about this so I'm going to talk about it.  My earliest childhood memory which I think has been very helpful for me is imagination.  I grew up with this fascination of imagination.  In the sense of that things that I like to do that I always wanted to do I would play them out.  For example, and this is the part where my siblings said please don't talk about this, baseball.  I love baseball but more importantly I love the Detroit Tigers; I eat, I sleep, I drink Detroit Tigers, you look in my office you will see Detroit Tigers.  So at age seven I went to my first Detroit Tiger's baseball game and I played that whole game in my head so much that when I came home after the game I went in the back yard and I played like I was in Tiger stadium.  I was the crowd, cheers; I was the umpire yelling strike, ball; I was the pitcher, I was the batter.  We had this apple tree and I used to take a stick made out of a bat and I would throw the apple up and hit it and if it went in certain directions that was a hit, that was an out, that was a home run and so I was doing this everyday by myself (laugh). In fact, my brothers and sisters--the older brothers and sisters they would bring friends over to watch me because they say "look at that fool out there" (laugh).  So this imagination thing like I said I was just doing--I would take a tennis ball sometimes, I used to throw the tennis ball up against the garage so it would be like a grounder to get it and so forth.  I did that for a long time, yes I was in high school doing it (laugh) but it kind of like took my mind off of things.  It turned into just playing by myself which I kind of enjoyed doing.  I wasn't an introvert, I don't consider myself an introvert in fact, people that knew me never looked at me as an introvert but that was that one thing that was just me that I wanted to do.  If the Tigers lost that day I was going to make them win because if the Tigers lost I would immediately go out to my back yard and I was going to win that game for the Tigers.  At the end of the season the Tigers were 100 runs and no losses.  I tell you this story because that whole thing about imagination was--going through this it also helped me in school because I would then--in listening to--in my studies everybody's struggles in math and so forth I kind of took math which was one of my troubled studies and I played certain things out of it that I started doing better in school.  So I became a very good student just on the basis of using my imagination a lot.
Story_ID: 34538
Speaker 1: The Tigers won the World Series in '68 [1968] when you were fourteen, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes I was.  In fact, that was my television debut as a matter of fact; I ran down to the channel two station it was not very far from where I lived.  They let us out of school early that day to watch the game on television.  After it was over with a whole bunch ran down to the station and it was crowded out there.  When the newsman came out I'm standing there and he said, oh what do you think about the Tigers winning and you know put the mike in my face and of course, he tried to take the mike from me and I'm talking about all the players and how good they were and everything.  So I consider that was my television debut (laugh).
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite player on that team?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, Norm Cash first base number twenty five was my favorite player.  There were a lot of reasons that I liked about him.  One was the guy just hit home runs all over the place, he was my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What neighborhood did you grow up in or did you move around?
Speaker 2: No I stayed--I was born and raised in the same place.  The section of the Detroit area the name had changed over the years but early in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] when my mother [Elizabeth Mary Ellington Patton] grew up there it was called Black Bottom.  And I'm sure if you look in the history it tells you a lot about that.  Around my era at that time it was somewhat of a non descriptive area, they called it the North End.  The reason why it got the title the north end is that there is a section of Detroit where Hamtramck, a suburb of Detroit and another suburb of Detroit, Highland Park they bordered each other and there is a little part of it that's Detroit, the northern part of Detroit before you go into any one of those suburbs so you refer to it as the North End.  It was actually a pretty neat area because it was about six blocks from a historically known fisher building; it was not quite two miles from downtown Detroit.  You used to walk everywhere to some of the neatest places around the Detroit area and so forth.  And it was very close to the Dodge plant it was called the Dodge main plant and with Hamtramck and Highland Park--Hamtramck was predominantly a suburb and this suburb was right in the middle of the city and Hamtramck was a suburb which was predominantly polish which was created somewhere after World War I and it was like going into a foreign country.  Hamtramck was four blocks from my house and it was like walking into Poland because the street signs are in Polish they had all these stores and it was really, really neat.  The Highland Park side which was about a six block trip from me on the other side from my house was at that time was primarily Jewish and primarily Jewish so it was like walking into Israel and it was just pretty neat.  And because of having those two sections I learned to grow up in a diversity area although my section of town was predominantly black just knowing what the Polish section and Jewish section of the town that I didn't quite live in a 100% all black neighborhood.  And the value of that for me was learning diversity very early in life.
Story_ID: 36771
Speaker 1: So you are on the north end and so your neighborhood was a neighborhood of single family homes?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was primarily single well no the neighborhood was actually duplex.  There were probably more duplexes than there were single family homes.  We lived in a single family home and I know my side of the street was about let's see three or four single family homes on one side of me, two on the other side and then after that they were all duplexes an upstairs and downstairs.  Across the street was pretty much all duplexes and these homes were built right around the turn of the century to the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].  Sadly, the whole area is gone.  You google my old address and what you will find is lots.
Speaker 1: When you are describing Hamtramck and Highland Park those are suburbs but they are within the metro area of Detroit so they are surrounded by urban areas.
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly which was unique, there are very few metropolitan areas that had the suburbs embedded in the middle of the city and it was very unique.  And even more unique they were very different; they did not take any real shape or form of the city of Detroit.  When you were in Hamtramck you were in Hamtramck and when you were in Highland Park you were in Highland Park.  But you could be in other parts of the suburbs in Detroit and you may recognize Detroit in the different areas.
Speaker 1: So we always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In my neighborhood.  Oh gosh--.
Speaker 1: In just--period, you know.
Speaker 2: Well from the sights standpoint because I lived very close to a high traffic area, hearing cars and horns and so forth was common.  I would liken it to almost saying you're living in New York City, Manhattan but you don't have the closeness of the New York City lifestyle but certainly out either window you would hear trucks, buses, cars, fire engines and so forth you would always hear those things throughout and it was not deafening I mean to any visitor into my old neighborhood would find that as such but that was just the way it was.  From the smell side and I got a smell that just sticks in my head, chitterlings.  I hate chitterlings to this day because almost every household in that block they were boiling those chitterlings at least two, three times a week and that was a smell that I just could not handle.  Every time you say the name I smell it, I never touched them.  My brothers and sisters loved it but I don't want anything to do with it.
Speaker 1: Did your family--did you cook them at home?  I mean did your parents cook them?
Speaker 2: Yes they cooked them at home and that was my day to go hang out somewhere else (laugh).
Story_ID: 36772
Speaker 1: As a child I had nowhere to go but when I got a little older and I got into my early teens I had friend I could go hang out with.  Or actually I spent a lot of time in the library, the Detroit Public Library in downtown Detroit [Michigan] which was about a thirty minute walk from my house and it still is one of the best libraries in the country and I use to go down there an awful lot and spend most of my time in there.  It was really neat because when I went to high school, I didn't take the bus a lot, I mean I could but I usually took it in the morning but coming home I would walk home partly because I liked to stop at the library.  And I would do my homework there and sometimes it got me in trouble because I would stop at the library and I would do other stuff at the library and I would get home late and my mother and father would be upset because I didn't tell them where I was.  We didn't have cell phones back then but they kind of got used to knowing that's where I was.  I just loved--that's one of the places when I go back to Detroit I just loved going to the library.
Speaker 2: Did you go--now Detroit is unique in that the big public library, Detroit Institute for the Arts has all these things in the same area.  Did you take advantage of the museums?
Speaker 1: Oh yes absolutely there was or there still is I know at one time they closed it down, there used to be a downstairs under the Detroit library which was also connected to the Detroit Institute of Arts there was a underground area that they rebuilt to look like the 1800s early 1900s of Detroit.  I mean it was only like two or three blocks worth of what it look like but it was just so cool.  I went down there millions of times and every time I went down it was like it was the first time I went down there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Any other sights and sounds?
Speaker 1: Well yeah and this is why it was so neat living in the area I lived because also about six blocks from me to the west of me was the old General Motors headquarters building that was on Second and West Grand Boulevard.  The ground floor they would put all of the various cars, showroom and you could walk into the showroom floor during the business hours and look at the cars and so forth.  A bunch of us kids because the guard or the guy that was working there saw us all of the time and we were good kids we didn't mess up or anything, and he got to know us and he would let us sit in the cars.  We used to get in these cars and this was where my imagination would go and we're driving places or I would get into the car if no one was with me and I'm gone somewhere, I'm driving I75 and then I started getting into the road atlas was like my thing because I couldn't wait until my next trip to General Motors to get into the cars and go drive somewhere.  Those were some of my entertainment.  I think about today about entertainment, how much did it cost you, it cost me nothing.  I mean, like I said play baseball in the backyard by myself, I'm driving cadillacs (laugh) and it was just--all it cost me was the time of walking to get to where I had to go or if I went to the library and go through the books or go down and walk through the underground area and so forth.  I'm putting myself back in time it was just really, really neat.
Story_ID: 36773
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: My elementary school was Breitmeyer Elementary which is the same elementary school where my mother as well as all of the kids--we all went to Breitmeyer School.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Breitmeyer?
Speaker 2: B-R-E-I-T-M-E-Y-E-R.  And I was just only a couple of blocks from where I lived and the--most of my teachers at Breitmeyer taught all my--all the teachers taught my brothers and sisters but actually many of them taught my mother [Elizabeth Mary Ellington Patton] too.  My kindergarten teacher was my mother's kindergarten teacher which was pretty neat.  My science teacher was my mother's science teacher so we had quite a family relationship at the elementary school.  Junior High School was at Sherrard, which is spelled S-H-E-R-R-A-R-D Junior High school which is actually right next to Breitmeyer separated by the playground.  The playground was kind of a dual purpose between Sherrard and Breitmeyer and I went to the seventh, eighth and ninth grade there.  Same thing my brothers and sisters and mother all went to Sherrard Junior High School.  We had a famous teacher there as a matter of fact she had already on television the woman that was in Sesame Street, I can't remember her name; the black woman that was in Sesame Street.  I can't remember her name but she was a teacher at Sherrard Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was the one who was off for many years?
Speaker 2: Right, for many years, yeah for many years.  I used to see her but by the time I got to Sherrard she was already on Sesame Street.  In high school I went Cass Technical High School, C-A-S-S.  This is a unique school the neighborhood high school was Northern High School and most kids go to their neighborhood high school after junior high school.  Cass Technical High School is what is now these days referred to as magnate schools.  And Cass was the only type of magnate school in the Detroit [Michigan] area so it was a citywide competitive high school to get in.  The requirements to get in first of all you had to have at least a B plus average and you had to be recommended by both your elementary school principal and your high school.  So you had to have two recommendations to get in and it was very competitive because there were kids that when I got in that wanted to get in, they couldn't get in.  When you got selected into Cass Tech you made it to the big time as they say.  Cass Tech was a pretty well known high school both in Detroit and around the country which graduated some big name folks like Lily Tomlin, David Allen Grier went there, Diana Ross, Vince Patton (laugh).  It's a very well known in fact, Smokey Robinson attended Cass Tech but after the first year he said it was too tough for him so he went to his high school which was Northern High School.  He ended up actually in the same grade as my sister Sue.  They went to Northern High School together and my oldest brother Greg graduated with Diana Ross.  So after high school--.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute--.
Story_ID: 36774
Speaker 1: I don't want to get to high school yet.  Going back to Breitmeyer, were there any teachers or mentors there of significance?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  At Breitmeyer, I think there was a good and bad thing due to the fact that your mother [Elizabeth Mary Ellington] went there.  Given the sense that many of the teachers were still there and bad in the sense they knew mom and you knew not to act up and so forth so we were all pretty much on the straight and narrow.  There was a lady there that I will never forget she was my math teacher, Mrs. Shannon.  Mrs. Shannon took a wonderful liking to me for I'm not sure why.  In the sense of the fact I started out with her and everybody said she was a mean teacher.  My oldest sister Stephanie couldn't stand her because she said she is such a mean teacher.  So I was a little frightened by having her and I started having her in the fourth grade but as it turned out we hit it off pretty well.  Around the fifth grade somewhere around the fifth grade Mrs. Shannon came up to me asked if I could attend a dinner with her and her husband and she thought it would be nice if I would go.  I just found that wow the teacher is asking me to go and of course I wanted to go and I went and it was a educational program I don't quite remember the program that much but other than the fact that her asking me to go.  She was always very involved with me in terms of asking how I was doing; she would see me during the day and would ask about my other studies.  She was kind of like a mother to me; she was probably like my grandmother's age which at that time was probably in the late 50s or so.  But she always stuck out with me to the point of--I don't know why I became her favorite.  I don't think there was anything that I know of that I did anything significant or insignificant.  I was a good student but there were students that were better than me but yet she kind of really put her arm around me and so sticks out to this day as probably one of the teachers that I will remember most.  The other person was the assistant principal; her name was Ms. Poskell, P-O-S-K-E-L-L.  Ms. Poskell who had been there for many years, my oldest brother [Gregory Patton] was there when she was there and so forth was another person that was very, very just dynamically nice to me.  Ms. Poskell was white, Ms. Shannon was black but Ms. Poskell was white and Ms. Poskell--in fact, kids at that time were making fun of me because they had heard about me playing baseball by myself.  My older sister [Viola Lajean Patton] was telling everybody about it so the kids started making fun of me saying I was crazy but she defended me.  She got in front of a crowd one day, and it was amazing you know they were just ragging me a little bit and she said you all better to learn to have that kind of imagination because you are going to need it later in life and she just gave everybody a lecture and so forth.  But she was just another person that was very helpful to me.  In junior high school I had Mr. Stoddard, S-T-O-D-D-A-R-D.  He was my shop teacher and I struggled in that class because I mean, I didn't-I never got into making things and he was another guy that took a lot of effort with me and when he found out that I was in the boy scouts and was trying to work on my projects for Scout he would stay after school with me to help me in doing some of the wood working projects a little better.  He may have done it for other people, I don't know.  I always saw him in there with me with doing that in fact, he attended my Eagle Court of Honor.  I invited him to come I didn't think he was going to show up and he and his wife came and he attended my Eagle Court of Honor and I was very overwhelmed with that.  I stayed in touch with him for many years even after I went into the Coast Guard and so forth.
Story_ID: 36775
Speaker 1: In terms of boy scouts now is a good time to ask you about that.  You got involved in boy scouts around, I guess you started about eleven and where was your troop headquartered?
Speaker 2: Troop 604 which was headquartered at St. Joseph Presbyterian Church located on Woodward and Pingree if I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a fabulous looking church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You entered the boy scouts were you ten or eleven?
Speaker 2: I was eleven actually I wasn't quite eleven yet.  Since my birthday is in November it was September before my eleventh birthday I became a boy scout.
Speaker 1: This was around 1964?  So you were in the boy scouts until what?
Speaker 2: I was in the boy scouts until graduated from high school, 1972 I stayed in it all the way.
Speaker 1: Now you became an explorer at one point?  When did you receive your eagle scout?
Speaker 2: I received my eagle scout in December 1968 which was pretty quick I did it in four years.  And I got to tell you I some of these names that I'm mentioning like Mr. Stoddard, Ms. Shannon, you know these people helped me at that level when I was going into scouting.  Another name to mention is Mr. Lee he was my Spanish teacher in junior high school.  Another gentleman that just sort of--always seemed like he had time for nobody else but me but I know as I look back he did that for a lot other people.  But those names that jumped out at me, they took their job as being teachers very, very seriously.  Not just for how they worked with me but I have watched them work with troubled young people my classmates and so forth; troubled in the sense that they had problems at home.  I recalled Mr. Stoddard bringing a bag of groceries to school one day and giving them to one of my classmates to take home or actually he drove my classmate home with the groceries.  And I have seen Ms. Shannon when one of the kids in the class father died, sharing in their grief of that and of course, she went to the funeral and things like that.  So it was back in the days when I think about teachers which my sister Viola Sue had she been alive today she would say those same names because Ms. Shannon her favorite.  Ms. Shannon was actually her role model of why she wanted to be the kind of teacher that she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36776
Speaker 1: In high school, I got to tell you about high school I had some good folks up there in high school.
Speaker 2: So you had good grades and recommendations from these two principals so you could get into Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School].  A lot of people that we have interviewed from Detroit went to Cass Tech.  Did you have a vocational goal in mind at Cass Tech?
Speaker 1: I did.  I wanted to do what my brother Greg did (laugh) it's as simple as that.  My brother Greg majored in design drafting technology so that's what little brother was going to major in.  And my brother Greg had already willed all of his drafting stuff like the drafting table, and T square he had all these other things and he kind of willed that to me so I didn't have to buy anything it was already there.  So I majored in design drafting technology although once I got into it I don't want to do this but it got me there and I was okay with it.  I think the only part of the design drafting part was I really wanted to be a better artist because this was where the little brother was an influence to me.  He was drawing comic strips, comic books when he was five years old.
Speaker 2: Hold on one second, pause one second.  Okay we are talking about Cass Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Influences and teachers at Cass Tech well Mrs. Musson, M-U-S-S-O-N she was my counselor who was also my brother's counselor so the pattern here is that my brother kind of paved the way for a lot of things for me I think.  He was a model student so there was pressure on my part.  I never wanted to be better than my brother I just wanted to be as good.  I never put a goal of I'm going to try and compete because I am not a competitive type person but I wanted to always get into his room.  So Mrs. Musson was one of those very, very fantastic influences--in fact, she was going to talk me out of joining the Coast Guard or at the time the Navy because I know when I first interviewed with her she says okay what do you plan on doing after Cass and I said well I'm going into the Navy.  She says like your brother and I said yes absolutely and she said you know I told your brother that if he held out he would get a really good scholarship and he said nope he wanted to go into the navy.  Is that kind of where you are and I said yes ma'am I want to do exactly what my brother did.  She supported it but you know she did try to you know every once and awhile when she would sit down with me about my grades.  We had to meet with her three times a semester to go over our grades.  From the tenth grade on she was already mapping scholarship plans for me but I just didn't want any part of it.  Greg didn't get a scholarship so I didn't want one.  But she was just a wonderful lady and I really really, I mean taking care of me.  I got sick in the eleventh grade and came down with pneumonia, I was really bad and I was out of school for about six weeks which I was fearful at that point that I was going to miss the grade.
Story_ID: 36777
Speaker 1: This is 1971?
Speaker 2: 1971 and Mrs. Musson came to my house because one thing that she didn't want me to do was to go back to school sooner than I needed to.  And then she went to every one of my teachers to do what was necessary to keep me in with the class.  This was before the days of internet so it was question of somebody getting stuff to me and getting stuff back and Mrs. Musson everyday came to my house to pick up stuff and to take it back.  She did it every day and I have to believe that she would probably do something like that for somebody else but I choke up to just over that thought at just how she took such a significant interest in me to the point it was above and beyond the call of duty so to speak.  As a result I kept up with the class and made honor role that year.  I'm really owing it all to her.  As I found out after I went back to class, some of the classmates and even some of the teachers were telling me how she kind of marshaled the force together because she had a couple of teachers that well if I got to this for that person then I will do it for that person.  She armed twisted a few people saying we got to do this and they did.  So if anything I really owe an indebted gratitude to Mrs. Musson for making that happen because what really would have happened was I was either going to be put back a grade I don't think they would have taken me out of Cass but I would have been put back a grade because of missing school but she stuck with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you started Cass Tech in '69 [1969] okay.  I didn't ask you about 1967, '68 [1968] and that's like one of the--those are cardinal years because of the riots and other things.
Speaker 2: Well in 1967 during the Detroit riots I was not home, I was at Boy Scout camp.  In fact, I was to come home that weekend.  Boy Scout camp was at Charles Hall Scout Reservation which was located in Brighton, Michigan just west of Detroit.  Of course, we had a radio there and so I had just finished my star scout requirements no actually my life scout requirements to really start working on eagle.  When the Detroit riots broke out the camp director came to many of us and told us we could stay here another week if you need be or if your folks want to come get you they can come get you.  And so I was kind of like--I hadn't heard from my folks, I didn't know what was going on and so forth but my sister, Sue she actually drove out to tell me what was going on and said if you want to stay here another week that's fine.  Mom and dad will come and get you but everybody is fine at home.  The neighborhood--although our immediate neighborhood was okay but go two or three blocks to the left of us or two or three blocks to the right of us and it was a disaster war zone.  The corner store that we always frequented of course was burned down.  My sister was telling me about that famed Algiers Motel (unclear) which actually was about five blocks from where I lived--five or six blocks from where I lived which, of course because it was still within that area which was somewhat of a buffer zone and she said that there were police and firemen, National Guard, apparatus all over the place.  She described what was going on there; I didn't come home until that next week.  When I came home that following week other than seeing the destruction I didn't experience the other things that went on over there.
Story_ID: 36778
Speaker 1: We are going to get started.  Alright, yeah go ahead.
Speaker 2: What I remember about the significance about what Algiers was is that I had a paper route and I would pick up my papers in front of Algiers Motel that was exciting because the Algiers Motel was really a hangout for hookers and drug dealers.  I used to deliver the "Detroit Free Press" and about five o'clock in the morning is when they dropped the paper off.  About five o'clock in the morning was when all of the workers (laugh) would be getting off work and so I knew Algiers Motel because that's--they would always put the papers right there near that little driveway.
Speaker 1: Now during this time with so much going on in Detroit, the political tensions were high then the world series (laugh) but during this time were there any--did your family kind of keep up with the political life in the city.  Were they like involved in any organizations to bring change?
Speaker 2: Yes my family was very-particularly my grandmother [Frances Ellington], my mother [Elizabeth Mary Ellington] was too to some degree, I think my mother was the reader and she wasn't really caught up in the discussion.  But her mother, my maternal grandmother was really involved.  Number one she was the church lady and what also went with that was all of the involvement that the Detroit areas churches that focused in the area of civil rights.  When Dr. [Martin Luther] King came to town my grandmother was involved with some of the organization of that.  Whenever there was--she participated and demonstrations marches, she participated in one of the Kresge pickets, the SS Kresge drugstore picket.
Speaker 1: Just to be clear now Detroit [Michigan] was, I guess officially desegregated.  There were not black folks in city government or hired for different things and where there should have been demonstrations.
Speaker 2: Right.  Most of the demonstrations were a show of unity.  Like the Kresges' demonstration, the Kresges department store demonstration which was on the corner of East Grand Boulevard and Woodward.  It was at the time when what was going on down in the south and just because of the name of Kresge that they heard whatever churches organized and they were going just to protest to get the Kresge family to be involved.  It was really about the Kresge family which lived in the Detroit area by the way.
Speaker 1: That's the Kmart family
Speaker 2: That's right; yeah it is that's the Kmart family.
Speaker 1: They own the same stores in the south that segregated lunch counters.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  That's right and it was to get them involved to denounce what was going on and it was very successful because they did as a result of that.  My grandmother was very involved with doing those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: What was her church home?
Speaker 2: Well she had a lot of church homes (laugh).  You know to this day I don't think there was a home church and if I had all my siblings together we probably would all fight over which one she frequented the most to call it her home church.  That woman did about four or five churches a Sunday and a couple during the week that were different.  But she had this pack of people that she worked with.  She was not a minister in fact, her profession was domestic worker and she was a school teacher early on in life but didn't do it for very long.  She probably did it may be less than ten years and then she got more involved with being a domestic work like her sister, my great aunt and was doing a lot of domestic work up in the Detroit--the Northern Detroit suburbs, Southfield, Laker Village those are the ones I think at the most.
Story_ID: 36779
Speaker 1: I remember as a child, I was a probably a teenager at the time and I was in the car with my brother Greg, we were going to pick up my grandmother [Frances Ellington] and aunt from work.  We were pulled over by the police because we were two little black kids in a car going up--we got pulled over and the cops asked us what are you doing here and we said we are going to pick up my grandmother.  The police officer made us get out of the car; search our car without a warning or anything like that.  I remember that happening at the time and other types of minor harassments.  Myself as--when I was able to drive and I would go pick up my grandmother and my great aunt I would get pulled over too as well.  In fact, I was home on leave this is where I got really upset, I was home on leave, I was in the Coast Guard probably not quite a year and I came home on leave so I was going to surprise my grandmother that I was in town.  So my grandfather let me borrow his car and I drove up there and of course, I'm in uniform and I get pulled over.
Speaker 2: Are you on your way to Southfield or where?
Speaker 1: (unclear) Village which is in that area actually maybe it was Bloomfield Hills, I think it was Bloomfield Hills anyway it was in that area I think it was Bloomfield Hills.  Once again I get pulled over.  The first time I actually got pulled over myself because usually I was in the car with my brother when that ever happened.  And the policeman of course, and I'm being polite, I get out of the car but then I said, you know if you are going to search my car I need a reason why you are searching my car and the guy says by the way where did you get that suit and I says well I'm in the Coast Guard and he says yeah right.  The guy just goes right into my car and I tried actually I stood my ground and I started getting shaky about it afterwards because I expected to get arrested at that point because I had told the guy he couldn't get into my car, I says you want to arrest me go ahead, tell me what the charge is, if you want to search my car I will wait for a warrant to search my car but you do not have the authority to do that.  Shall we call another police officer, shall we call the Michigan State police whoever you want to call but you are not getting in my car.  So the guy kind of looks at me, puts his hands on his gun, kind of gives me this authoritative look, walks back to his car and just says get out of here.  So that was an incident that I will never forget.  Most importantly, I'm in uniform, you know that was really shocking to see that happen, this was 1973 when this once occurred.
Story_ID: 36780
Speaker 1: Well back to the '68 [1968] period, Dr. [Martin Luther] King's last major speech before he goes to Memphis [Tennessee] is in Detroit and I know that they recorded--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right and at that event was where my grandmother [Frances Ellington] was very involved.  She got to meet Dr. King at that point so that was the first time she ever met him.
Speaker 1: So this is a--so you start Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School] only a year after Dr. King's assassination.  It was a conscious effort around the country to do some race reform.  I'm just putting that out there.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I also need to tell you about the March on Washington [D.C.] at '63 [1963].  If you want me to tell you that now or later?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well it goes back to my maternal grandmother.  We call her mama Frances by the way.  In her many churches (laugh) well the churches they were organizing to come to  Washington in August '63 [1963] and I was too young to really know what was going on to be honest with you.  But she snatched myself and my sister Stephanie and my brother Greg because he was going to be one of the drivers and we were going to come to Washington to do the march on Washington.  I just wanted to go, it was a trip, it was just going to be pretty neat and I had no idea what this was all about.  My oldest sister was a little bit more in tune on what was going on of course, she was two years older at the time.  So we pile into this station wagon and to this day I think about it was like this clown car, you know, people getting out and keep getting it out (laugh).  But I remember my sister and I in the very back along with these two other kids driving here to Washington, D.C.  We arrive--we drove all day, we left very early in the morning and we got to D.C. about one--I'm not sure exactly what time it was but it was very early when we got there.  Maybe we drove at night but it was a while ago.  Long story short, we couldn't get into D.C. right away and when we got to the outskirts--we got somewhere in the northwest side of town.  Maybe up by Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  I remember Walter Reed, so we ended up parking somewhere up there because you couldn't get a car into Downtown D.C.  The plan was we were going to park the car and take a bus; well everybody was doing the same thing.  So we couldn't get a bus because the buses were all full, every bus that would go by.  So after spending time at the bus stop, we all decided to walk.  So we take this walk down Georgia Avenue, all the way to the mall.  It's not a very long distance may be two and half, maybe three mile trip altogether.  But it was a--but what I remember most was it was a very, very hot day, very humid.  I remember that.  I was a little kid but this was an adventure.  I was nine years old and it was a great adventure to me.
Story_ID: 36781
Speaker 1: I just remember the adults who were walking were very much complaining and worried and things like that.  My grandmother she kind of kept telling everybody to shut up and just walk (laugh).  So we get to the mall area and so we miss the actual march because of the walk.  So we get to the mall area where Dr. King is about to speak.  When we get down to that area the first thing we try to do is inch our way as close as we could.  So somewhere along the reflecting pool and my grandmother and the crowd that we were with said okay this is about as close as we are going to get.  So we kids take off for the reflecting pool thinking that's a swimming pool and we are going to jump in.  There was somebody out there telling everybody to get out of the pool.  Of course, we jumped in the pool, kids were-they quit yelling at us, they gave us because there were too many of us.  Right about the time when the event started, this is the thing that I remembered most.  We got out of the reflecting pool quickly and with the how many thousands of people that were there.  A hundred thousand or whatever number it was, but what I remember most is that it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop when Dr. King spoke.  Now, again I couldn't tell you anything that I paid any attention to other than the fact that I looked about me and realized how everybody was just so quiet, how they were all facing in the direction toward the Lincoln Memorial and there were speakers out but we were so far back that we didn't--there weren't any speakers back--but you could hear almost as if you were right up there on the steps.  Because today when I walk--I remember taking my kids to that very spot--somewhere around that spot many years ago and at the time that I did that, I was telling my kids the story, I looked down and saw how far away it was to the Lincoln Memorial but I felt at that time when I was kid that I was no more than ten feet.  It just made me feel that way because of the just the energy and the fact that you know--his voice.  To my dying day, I will never forget that moment.  How magnetic it was and getting everybody really tied into the listening of that speech.  And I feel honored to be one of the hundreds of thousands that were there although at that time that age I didn't quite understand it then but has time has gone on I grasp a little bit more about it.  But that's a moment that I will never forget was being there.
Story_ID: 36782
Speaker 1: That's a good story.  I'm glad you told us that.  Now was your grandmother in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] or NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Definitely NAACP, definitely the NAACP.  I couldn't tell you about any organizations.
Speaker 1: The NAACP that would have been the group because they kind of had a rivalry in some ways.  Some groups went with CORE in different cities and other cities went with the NAACP.  In my town the group was CORE.  Okay.  Now back at Cass Tech finally.  Anything--now you had good grades I think at Cass?
Speaker 2: I had good grades.  I did very well; I didn't have straight A's when I ended up graduating but about a 3.4, 3.5 GPA.
Speaker 1: Yeah, during the days of Sly and the Family Stone.  Did you have a favorite musician then?
Speaker 2: Well I got into jazz thanks to my brother Greg.  Again I emulated so much of him but the fun part of my emulating my brother was I really enjoyed what I was getting into.  So I can't recall the year but when Dave Brubeck's "Blue Rondo A La Turk" came out that was my introduction to jazz.  So in high school my jazz interests was quite intensive, Sonny Rollins, Lee Morgan, Stanley Turrentine, I can go on and on.  I was just engrossed in the jazz and I luckily got a part time job working at the jazz radio station which happened to be in my neighborhood.  It was then called WCHD, FM; the radio station was WCHB, AM and WCHD, FM were owned by two brothers well not brothers they were friends that were dentists.  Wendell Cox and Haley Bell in fact WCHB was Wendell Cox Haley Bell they were dentists, black dentists and they were one of the first black owners of radio stations.  And how I got the job was I was a paper boy and although I delivered the morning paper I used to deliberately hold that paper back so that I could take the paper in myself when they were opened.  So I could just go in there so I got them to get to know me a little bit.  I met one of the DJs and I was telling them about the song and he said you are awfully young to be knowing all of that and I said oh I'm really in to it.  He let me in one day to sit and watch his show, and watch what he was doing on his show.  And then I kind of offered I said I can help rearrange some of the music for you so when you get it and so forth and so on.  And I kind of started working there for no pay and eventually found me a paying job where I was like a gopher for the radio engineer, Mr. Neeley (ph. splg.) and so I had that as a part-time job which was really cool.
Story_ID: 36783
Speaker 1: Yes that is.  I'm glad I asked you about that.  Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School] is known for producing musicians from all the way back to the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Donald Byrd Cass Tech graduate.  In fact, my class Kevin Tony, pianist for the Black Byrds he and I went to Cass Tech together and I got to know him pretty well.  He knew I was working at WCHD and he thought that was pretty cool.  So the payback because he had--in our senior year in high school Donald Byrd was already recruiting him to come to Howard and Donald Byrd came to Cass Tech and Kevin said you got to go meet one of my buddies and I got to meet Donald Byrd which was pretty cool.
Speaker 1: That's great.  There big hit here at [Howard University] under Donald Byrd's instruction their big hit was 'Rock Creek Park'.  A lot of musicians now come out of Cass Tech in Detroit.  Now you didn't take music yourself did you?
Speaker 2: I did not take music myself.  I took piano lessons sometime between--I was like maybe eight to eleven years old.  I took piano lessons along with my older sister and we just took them.  Again, part of this was because brother Greg played piano, I wanted to play piano but I wasn't that good at it.  But I learned to play piano a little bit but up to eleven years old Boys Scouts kind of got in the way and that took up a lot of my time; between that and my baseball games.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Did you have a favorite subject at Cass Tech?  I know you took the college prep courses.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes, History, Civics, History were my favorite subjects.  As a matter of fact I ended up taking--in my senior year because I was so involved with History and Civics.  There was another government class; it was called Civics Government or something like that.  I didn't have to take it but I took it because I was just really in to it.  But history was and it still is one of my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: Now you were in school during what was like a mini revolution in black history because you were being taught in the public schools for a period of time.  Did they teach you that in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Cass Tech they taught it which I was--I got to say I was really blessed the fact of going to Cass Tech because Cass Tech was teaching black history before the rest of the city of Detroit high school or school systems.  They taught a little bit of it but very intense black history was taught at Cass Tech by a, gosh I can't remember his name but at the time he was a professor at Wayne State [University] and he would teach this class over there and so I was able to take the class.
Story_ID: 36784
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you participate in the black book stores in those days?  I know that Vons, I think--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely Vons Bookstore, how can I forget that.  Vons was probably the place to go.  There was another place called it was on Dexter Avenue and it was a little bit out of my way but I used to go there a lot.  I think it was called Dexter Book Store if I am not mistaken.  But it was another black book store that had a significant amount of information there and I actually even I still had a sincere desire and interest of wanting to go in the military a lot of things that were covered around the black history era was about don't do anything with the government.  But I still wanted to do it.  But I looked at it as more of an understanding of how oppression has built up to where there was a sense of the country is not doing the job that it should do in the area of civil rights and so why should I become part of it.  I did follow it but it never relinquished my desire and goal that I was going to go into the military and people knew that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your senior year you graduated, did you have any distinctions or anything when you graduated?
Speaker 2: No I did not, correction yes I did.  My only distinction when I graduated from high school is I took the top junior ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] honors, honor student award and that's awarded to a graduating junior ROTC senior that not only had the best grade point average but also they measured you in activities and things that you did and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said you were a swimmer too, right?
Speaker 2: I was on the swimming team.  I wasn't the greatest swimmer on the swimming team.
Speaker 1: Now was that in preparation for the navy?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  That was exactly why I was there that was in preparation for the navy.  In fact, when I signed up for swimming they said you can't take ROTC and swimming, you got to take one or the other and I said I want ROTC, I need that for my military life and I want to take swimming because I need that for the navy.  Again, Mrs. Musson she made it happen.  She just said was--her answer to me was okay you're going to be in school longer than most people because we are going to add an extra class and she said you can do that.  She kind of bent the rules for me but that's not the way it was supposed to happen.  The rules were when you took extracurricular activity things it was one or the other and I took both thanks to Mrs. Musson.
Speaker 1: So when you graduated in 1972 there were about 600 something graduates?
Speaker 2: Yeah 650 or so graduates.
Story_ID: 36785
Speaker 1: How long did it take you to go to the naval recruiter after graduation?
Speaker 2: Well actually it was before I graduated from high school because the military has a delayed entry program.  When you become a senior and you are at least seventeen years old and your parents' permission you are allowed to sign up.  In fact, that's what my brother did.  So I was actually counting the days.  I had this calendar in my room that I was checking off the days for my seventeenth birthday.  Because when I started my senior year my birthday is toward the end of the year.  I'm checking off for my seventeenth birthday.  So my parents--that's all I talked about.  My bedroom was plastered with everything navy and my brother was sending me stuff in the mail and so I'm waiting on the seventeenth birthday.  Well the navy recruiter that I used to go see at the recruiting office which used to be near my neighborhood, they closed and they moved downtown to the Federal Building.  So I hadn't been to that navy recruiting office but from age ten to age sixteen and a half I was in that other recruiting office every day.  So the recruiter kind of knew me and so my--to the point where my parents knew the recruiter too because there were a couple of times that he actually drove me home one day or so.  And my brother had already become an officer; he had gone through OCS [Officer Candidate School] and he was already an officer.  And so on my seventeenth birthday, I got up that morning which was on a Sunday. And I said alright, tomorrow I'm going down to the recruiting office.  I got the papers already because I had been down there and I had the papers a long time ago.  My daddy then signed it and so he went on and signed it, no issue.  So after school, Monday I made a bee line, in fact the only time I ever cut class in my high school I cut class that day because Monday was one of my long days, it was--the class was going to over by like five minutes to four and I was afraid by the time I got to recruiting it would be five o'clock and they would be gone so I cut out at three o'clock.  Made it down to the Federal Building and I had never been down to the Federal Building before.  So I walked in and asked someone where is the recruiting office and a lady pointed me to this long narrow hallway and that's where all the recruiters were.  So I walked in and at the very end of the hallway a guy was sitting at his desk on the telephone in his navy uniform and I thought there it is.  So I make a bee line into the office, he is on the phone and just as I walked in he says have a seat I will be right with you. And I said okay, so I get ready to sit down and just as I get ready to sit down and I look up at this picture on the wall; the ships are white not gray and it says Coast Guard on the ships.  I walked in to the wrong recruiting office.  Back then the Coast Guard uniform was the same as the navy uniform the only difference was the hat.  I just saw this guy in the sailor suit and that's where I went.
Story_ID: 36786
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay so I go to the recruiting office, well the recruiting office is at the Federal Building in Downtown Detroit [Michigan].  I look down the hall and I just see this guy in a navy uniform and I walk in.  So I sit down before I sit down I look on the wall and I see these pictures of ships, navy ships are gray but these ships are all white and they have emblazoned in print Coast Guard.  So I walk into the wrong office.  I did know, actually I did kind of know that the Coast Guard uniforms were the same as the navy uniform; the only difference was the hats.  So I'm embarrassed, I made eye contact with this Coast Guard recruiter instead of me just saying I'm going to find a Navy recruiter I decide okay I'll pretend that I'm paying attention to him and then I will go find the Navy recruiter.  So he is on the phone, he is talking to somebody about the Coast Guards so I am kind of nervous.  Instead of sitting down waiting for him to get off the phone I kind of wander around his office and I am looking at all the pictures and I am looking at all the stuff he had on the wall and I fix my eyes to this citation for Coast Guard unit commendation.  These are awards that are presented to an entire unit when the unit does something in the military.  This particular unit commendation was for a rescue that the ship that this recruiter was on and it was a rescue of over three thousand people off a cruise liner up in Alaska that ran aground, took on water, there was fire.  Anyway I'm reading this and it is fascinating, like reading a novel of how it happened and how the crew came aboard to put the fire out, rescue some people that were injured.  Again, I go back to this imagination thing where from my days of imagination of playing baseball at the stadium.  All of sudden this imagination jumped into me being there like I'm watching a movie of this rescue so I was hooked.  So I'm reading this the recruiter notices that I am really into this citation, he looks up at me from the phone, he says I guarantee you will have one of those in your first enlistment in the Coast Guard.  That was it, all of a sudden seven years of all I want to do is join the Navy went out the window in just that comment and that visit.
Story_ID: 36787
Speaker 1: At that time did you appreciate the difference between the Coast Guard and the navy or did you understand the difference?
Speaker 2: No I did not.  I did not appreciate the difference between the Coast Guard and the navy.  I knew the Coast Guard existed, I knew the Coast Guard was a military service but that's where it ended.
Speaker 1: Did you get confused about whether it was actually part of the navy?
Speaker 2: No I knew because I was in junior ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in high school and so actually teach you all the services.  So I knew I wasn't confused in the sense of what does the Coast Guard do regarding that it was just--the Coast Guard is no different than the Army, the Air Force or the Marine Corp.  It wasn't the Navy that's the way I looked at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  If it was the aspect of rescuing people and helping that drew you into it.
Speaker 2: It was the aspect of--for the first time all I said was I wanted to go into the Navy because my brother is in the navy.  I never once asked myself the question "Well if I get into the navy what am I going to do?"  Still I'm going to do what my brother is doing.  So what came into my mind at that time and it was actually repeated by my mother when I came home is I've walked in my brother's footstep long enough and now it is time to walk in my own.  So it was the first time that all of sudden I put myself into that situation wow is this something that I want to do and the answer is absolutely.  This is going into an organization that is a military service but it had a multi mission, humanitarian responsibility and things that I learned in the boy scouts were relevant and things that I wanted to do were very relevant.  So it all fit and it took that few minutes in the recruiting office to bring it all together, it was just like magic.  So after that whole thing hit me and when the recruiter did get off the phone and I did talk and ask questions, I mean the good news was a lot of things that I learned about the Navy were relevant with the Coast Guard particularly with the rank.  The ranks were the same and a couple of other things that the Coast Guard and the Navy does together.  So all my brain washing of the navy did not completely go out the window.
Story_ID: 36788
Speaker 1: So I went home and when I got home I told my folks what happened and thinking they were going to be all excited about it, my dad wasn't.  Well actually he wasn't, he looked at me kind of like I did something wrong and I was a little surprised because I been talking about going into the Navy all this time why is this any different.  So he got up from his super easy chair that he always sits in and he goes over to the china cabinet which that was his--he had a drawer in the china cabinet that was his man drawer.  It is his man cave today, my dad had his man drawer, it had stuff in it.  When it comes to dad the only thing I can think that he would pull out is either a belt, (laugh) cigars or what else has he got in there.  Well he pulls out his road atlas; I always liked looking at his road atlas.  But I was confused now why do you have to pull out the road atlas.  He takes out the road atlas, sits it on the dining room table and he says come here.  Opens to the state Maine he says this is the state of Maine and then he says that's Boothbay Harbor, that's South Portland and he names some other little town and I noticed that they are all on the coast and then he flips the page and he goes to Oregon and Washington State.  And he picks out a couple of little towns and I'm trying to understand what's the deal here.  Finally he goes to Michigan and he says he points out a couple of towns in Frankfort, Escanaba and a few other places and then he said what about Tawas, Michigan. Tawas is spelt T-A-W-A-S. He says remember when we went to Tawas, Michigan several years ago, yeah I do remember that.
Story_ID: 36789
Speaker 1: My father's definition of vacation back in those times was we would get in the car and drive somewhere, we stop, get out, look and he says there it is let's go.  So we were going to Mackinaw Island (sic, Mackinac Island) [Michigan] well we really didn't go to Mackinaw Island we went to the bridge, looked out and saw Mackinaw Island and then we drove back.  That was his definition of a vacation.  So we stopped in the town of Tawas, Michigan which sits-it sits like right here in the thumb of Lake Huron area and Saginaw Bay.  So I say okay I remember stopping at Tawas, Michigan where we stopped to get gas.  He said what happened when we got to Tawas, Michigan and I said oh yeah I do remember what happened.  What happened was we pulled in to the gas station and this is back in the days when there were gas station attendants and just when we pulled into the gas station the gas station attendant was waving us off.  My dad said "What's the matter" and the gas station attendant said "We don't serve niggas here, if you want gas you don't get it here, and get out of here or I will call the sheriff."  That's all he said and my father drove off.  My mother was yelling to him, "He can't tell us that" but my dad said yeah but you know I don't have any counteract a shotgun or whatever else that (whatever name he called him) had so let's just go, we don't need gas here.  I don't have time to deal with fighting with fools like this and we have kids, let's just go.  So that's what I remember about that, I was about eight years--this is probably 1962 maybe 1961, somewhere around that time so I remember that.  It still didn't make any sense so okay you are showing me these towns and then you ask me to tell you about Tawas, Michigan what's the story here.  He said, "Son there is a Coast Guard station in Tawas, Michigan and there is a Coast Guard station at every one of those little towns I just showed you and there are no blacks living in those towns that I just showed you too."  So I actually was a little impressed with my dad the fact that gosh he knew more about the Coast Guard than I thought he did.  So his point to that was to tell me as I'm all excited about going into the Coast Guard is you better think again.  Because you are going to end up in one of these places, you're going to end up with somebody like that guy in Tawas [Michigan] and it's not going to be very pleasant.  So right while he is having this conversation with me, my mother who hears this conversation in the background, comes over to both of us and she says, "Stop if this is what he wants to do, this is what he is going to do."  And then she repeated what I thought what I said to you earlier when she said he's has walked in his brother's footsteps long enough, it's time for him to make a decision to do something that he wants to do.  My mother also said, "You know things are never going to change unless somebody becomes a part of the change."  And that was my decision to go into the Coast Guard (laugh) so my mom kind of put it all in perspective and said to me well you know if that's where you end up at one of those types of assignments in the Coast Guard, we taught you how you deal with that.  You don't get angry, your way of getting even is to show them how smart you are; show them that you can do what they don't think you can do.  She's got her finger in my face telling me in such a way that you are going to make it and you don't let people scare you off because you are the only black kid that's going to be around that area.  It didn't scare you off when you went to scout camp and she started rattling off these other places I had been and done and I was the only black kid and this shouldn't scare you off as you become an adult.  That was my decision to go into the Coast Guard.
Story_ID: 36790
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about the day you were inducted or I guess recruited into the Coast Guard.
Speaker 2: Into the Coast Guard.  Well right after high school I was so involved in wanting to get into the Coast Guard right away; I wanted to go right away, so I graduated on a Thursday and I went into the Coast Guard that following Monday.  I went to Cape Maine, New Jersey which is the southern tip of New Jersey and that's where Coast Guard recruitment training center is located.  The company that I was in there was about sixty of us, there was actually about four or five blacks that were in my company.  I was actually surprised, I'm hearing from everybody else and the literature that I was looking at, the recruiting literature you didn't see any black faces at all.  So, you know, what my dad had said really had a lot of truth to it gosh there is not a lot of blacks in the Coast Guard.  And I talked to a few people that said there is not a lot of blacks there do you really want to go in there?  I say yeah I do, it's what I want that they have.  So to my surprise when I got to boot camp I did actually see quite a few but it wasn't a large number but more than I had anticipated.  I mean I really thought I was going to be the only black in boot camp.  So about two or three weeks of boot camp--about two or three weeks of boot camp you go through a period called classification.  That's where they actually sit down with you and tell you what your scores that you took to get into the Coast Guard and what you qualify for, what kinds of schools.  Back then they didn't have what is now called guarantee schools in other words, you knew all this up front before you enlisted but at the time I went in you knew after you got in.  And, of course, it was during the Vietnam war era too so the Coast Guard was actually the choice service because your chances of going to Vietnam was quite slim to none although they did have Coast Guard people in Vietnam.  They didn't really have to offer anything it was just the fact that hey the other services were going to Vietnam and here's the Coast Guard so a lot of people went into the Coast Guard.  So I'm sitting in my classification day and I sit down with a career counselor who goes over my scores, the general classification test score is this, your math test score is this, mechanical test scores and so forth.  So he gives me this combination of what those scores come out and he says these are the schools you qualify for, you need to think about that.  Just a day earlier of this classification day, I happened to walk pass--actually I had walked pass it many times, a framed picture that was in the hallway or as we call it the passage way at boot camp at the time.  There was this framed picture that looked like a master chief which has the rank of an eagle and there is two stars above the eagle.  Well this picture was interesting because it was an eagle with three stars over the eagle.  Now my book said that the master chief was at two stars but I see a picture of what I think is a master chief that has three stars so I'm confused.  So I go to my drill instructor which is called company commander and I ask sir there is a picture of what I think is a master chief in the passage way and he's got three stars.  And the chief who was my drill instructor, company commander gets right in my face and says that's the master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard.  Well what does he do?  He tells the commandant what to do.  Well the commandant is the commandant of the Coast Guard, the four star admiral.
Story_ID: 36791
Speaker 1: Learning a little bit more about this beyond his pointed answer to me was the rank of the master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard is a very new rank which is why my book didn't have the rank in there it was actually created in 1969.  Congress created a senior enlisted rank for each military service, actually created it in '67 [1967] the Coast Guard didn't get theirs until 1969.  They created the senior rank to each service; one person out of all of the senior ranks on the enlisted side is selected by the service chief to be the direct representative ombudsmen to the admiral or the general.  And there is nobody in between you, I mean there are people who are senior to you in rank and so forth but structure wise you're right with the four star and so those ranks are called the senior enlisted advisor rank.  So like I said, it was fairly new and only one person gets it for a four year period.  So I get a little interested in that so getting back to the classification day and the career counselor is explaining all this to me and I'm looking at the list and I don't see what I'm looking for.  So I ask him a question, a very honest, simple question well what school do I go to become the master chief of the Coast Guard?  I was very honest to ask him that and my company commander happens to be standing behind me and grabs me by the collar, this was back in the days when they could touch you, grabs me by the collar and yanks me out of my chair and just starts pushing me toward the door "march".  I don't know what I said or anything, "get down and give me fifty".  So I did fifty pushups, this is July when it is hot so I did fifty pushups.  I was actually afraid I couldn't do fifty but I did fifty pushups.  I stopped and snapped back to attention sweating and so forth and still confused.  Why--what did I do, what happened here so he says to me, he gets into my face he gets about that close to me and he says the day you become the master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard that's the day I walk on clouds and then he told me to leave.  So I was kind of shaken up with what that meant and so forth, the only thing that I knew was true was that two years before I became master chief of the Coast Guard that chief did die so I guess he was telling the truth the day he would walk on clouds (laugh).
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Story_ID: 36792
Speaker 1: Alright, that's a good story.  So training is about three months, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Initial basic training is ten weeks, it's actually twelve weeks.  They don't count the first two weeks that's called your forming week but it is ten weeks of training.  After you complete that then you go on to wherever so I selected eventually since I found out what it takes to become master chief of the Coast Guard, there is no school for it.  The fact that I worked at a radio station before I came in the Coast Guard, so I kind of knew little bit about radios and stuff like that so I'll be a radio man which is a ship board radio operator.  So I went off to radio men school which is located in Petaluma, California that's about sixty, seventy miles north of San Francisco and that's a six month school.  And it was unique in that school, a couple of things that worked in my favor was as a boy scout I had taken a merit badge for Morse Code so I already knew Morse Code and they were suppose to teach me Morse Code.  I also took the merit badge on radio--amateur radio operation to know a little bit about tuning transmitters and stuff like that.  And I go to radio school actually having the fundamentals of what the first month with them-what the school was about.  Needless to say I did exceptionally well in radio school or RM school as we call it.  Well everybody was learning Morse code and I already knew ten to twelve words per minute which is considered a novice, you have to graduate with eighteen words per minute.  By the time everyone was learning their six words per minute I was already copying and receiving eighteen per minutes.  By the time I graduated six months later I was up to twenty eight, thirty words per minute.  Now the understanding of that you got to know Morse code the fastest that any person can ever send and receive is in the low thirties, thirty four, thirty six is what they said is the absolute best and that's with no errors.  So I was already at the twenty eight words per minute with no error type of thing when I graduated from radio school.  So I clearly had a skill that a lot of the folks in the Coast Guard was interested in what my skill set was.  Because on the ships where we do and my first ship in the Coast Guard was an oceanographic ship that did what was called ocean stations.  We did the north Atlantic was based out of New York City in fact, was based out of Governors Island where my parents met which later became a Coast Guard base, Governors Island.  So the ship the Coast Guard colored Dallas we would do these ocean stations and they were in sectors so our assigned area was ocean station bravo which was--the best way to tell you where it is if you drew a straight across two hundred miles from Boston that was pretty much the area coverage that we had.  So we would do weather observations, track an iceberg, we had scientist on that would do depth checks and all kinds of things.  This was the days before satellite took care of lot of this.  So my job as a radio operator was really I was sending weather reports back by Morse Code and also any of the transatlantic flights that were coming across they had to check in at ocean stations because even though it was still the '70s there was still concern about aircraft flying across the Atlantic and Pacific without having continuous communications because it wasn't anything like it is today.  So I would also receive radio relay information from aircraft and we would do some rescues, we were sort of like a triple A station out there and freighters, fishing vessels that would come in around the area would have a call for help and we would be sometimes within a couple of hours getting to them.  And we did all kinds of different things so it was pretty neat.
Story_ID: 36793
Speaker 1: There could really be some bad weather out there too, right?  The term north eastern is prime--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was in a north eastern and off the Grand Banks [of Newfoundland] and it was not fun (laugh).  But I did that for two years and almost three with my first assignments about two and half years.  And the recruiter was true to his comment to me.  He said within the first full year of the Coast Guard I would earn my unit commendation.  He was absolutely right.  So two years into the Coast Guard we were involved in a "medevac" a medical evacuation situation with a vessel that the captain had fallen, hit his head and was bleeding profusely.  It turned out that the vessel was a then Soviet (unclear) and this was during the days of the Cold War and so forth.  So there was a significance of the Coast Guard supporting this because we were dealing with the Russians and there was also concern that--one of things that we did out in ocean station is that we also kept track of the so called fishing vessels that were really soviet spy vessels, they really were they just said they were fishing.  Well this happened to be one of those so called fishing vessels.  So the story goes is that we had to--we were going to assist and we to get permission from the State Department so we had to radio back the state department in New York where they had the rescue coordination center and we had a doctor to give us information on what to do.  Now I was the radio man on watch and I had to relay that information to the soviet vessel.  The Russian sailors were known for being very fast with Morse code in fact, they are even today even though Morse code is not used anymore they still use it and they are in the thirty plus range.  None of the guys on the ship could keep up with them except me.  And there were times before this case just to sort of keep up my speed, I used to follow their messages and copy their code and things like that which I had to do anyway because it was for--we would check them out to see if they were spying, you know.  So the captain of our ship said he wanted me to stay on the circuit because I was the fastest code copier.  My chief radio man on the ship didn't care for me because of my skin color.  Very true to the words of what my dad was concerned about me being in the Coast Guard although he was concerned about me living in a town where there were no blacks.  And never thought about being in New York and it just so happens that my chief officer is about as racist as they come and he let it be known that.  So when the captain said he wanted me to be on the circuit, instead of the chief that was a slap in the face to the chief because first of all he's the chief, he is the leading radio man on that ship and supposedly more proficient than anybody else and to have the captain tell him that your junior man is going to handle this matter it really just pierced him in the heart.  It was very grueling because I had to stay on that circuit for nine hours sending and receiving messages.  The  medical information that I had to get to the Russian ship to make sure that they were taking care of them properly, if I missed a word it could have become catastrophic in terms of the care.  And the fact that this was a state department issue because the state department certainly did not want to be in the position that you try to do a rescue and the guy dies on us then you may end up with an international incident, who knows it could flutter into that.  Long story short is that we got on scene, our hospital corpsman on our ship went aboard, took care of the injured guy, we brought the man onto our ship which was also another issue because of the fact we are bringing a Soviet sailor on board there was concern that the guy was going to ask for asylum but we were able to bring him back to New York.  He did survive, I never knew what happened after that if he went back to the Soviet Union or did he claim asylum, I never knew any part of that story.  But anyway we got a unit commendation for it and I received a Coast Guard letter of commendation for my work on this so here I am no more than two years in the Coast Guard what my recruiter said well what happened, happened.
Story_ID: 36794
Speaker 1: So this medical evacuation of the Russian ship, that was 1974?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy four [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay, I got that right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you received a commendation.  So you're on your way up in the Coast Guard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, the next assignment after, well, after that--well, first of all, let me go back and tell you what happened after, after we got back to New York, and, you know, this issue with my, with my chief--actually, I need to back up a little bit more about the chief as a whole because what I need to tell you this, and is when I first reported aboard the Dallas, which was February '73' [1973], when I first reported aboard the Dallas, I checked in.  And, you know, they taught you in radio school that you gotta, you know, salute, you know, say your name, rank and serial number and request permission to, you know, come aboard and so forth.  Well, I did that.  And then they, said, oh, okay, you're gonna work for Chief Wood.  And so they sent me down to the chief's stateroom.  He, so I knocked on the door, and I'm getting my spill together to say, "Seaman radioman, Patton 405979, reporting."  So he opens the door, and I said "Seaman radioman" and he slams the door.  I never even got the rest of it out.  So I said, well, what did he--did the door slip past him or whatever.  So I knocked on the door again, and "Seaman radioman Patton", and he said, "Ah no, I've never asked.  I don't wanna hear that."  He says, "Okay."  I says, "Well, I'm reporting aboard."  He says, "Reporting aboard for what?"  I says, "I'm your new radioman."  He says, "Oh, no, you're not gonna be one of my radiomen."  And I just stood.  He says, "Look, why don't you go up, go back up to the quarterdeck and have them send you down to the galley, and you can work with the rest of the black boys down there."  And then he closed his door.  That's all he said.  And I'm like, [blowing] what, you know, (laughter) you know, it's going back to my dad's story in his concern about me coming in the Coast Guard.  You know, I--that was, it's like, it started coming back to me, wow, my dad was right, you know.  But then I was confused to the fact that, well, but he told me I would have these problems if I went to Booth Bay Harbor [Maine] or Newport, Oregon.  I didn't know I'd have this problem in New York City.  So I went back up to the quarterdeck, which is where the, when you--it's kind of like you receiving position on the ship.  And I talked to the person who had the duty, and then I told 'em, I says, "Well, I went to see Chief Wood, and he told me to come back to see somebody to go to the, the galley, 'cause he says he's not gonna have me work there."  And he says, and the guy says, "Oh, yeah," he says, he said "That guy is a super redneck." He's, you know--
Story_ID: 36795
Speaker 1: So the quarterdeck guy, a petty officer, he picks up the phone, and he calls the operations officer.  And the operations officer whose a lieutenant, comes down on the quarterdeck, greets, me, you know, a very pleasant gentleman.  And I tell him what happened.  So he says, "You stay right here."  And he goes down to the captains, no, to the chief's stateroom, and a few minutes later he comes back.  He says, "You're okay, Patton."  He says, "We're gonna have one of the other radiomen come and show you around the ship and show you where you're gonna be staying and so forth."  And that's, and then he said, "If you have any other problems with Chief Wood, you let me know."  And, of course, I'm thinking, uh-uh, I'm starting off wrong now with this chief.  And it was.  The chief was, you know, was evil, you know, to say the least.  He would--and on the ship we had a couple of other blacks on the ship.  We had--the crew was about 184 people, and six blacks and two Filipino folks were on the ship.  Of the six blacks, three of them worked in the galley as cooks or as trainers to be cooks, along with the two Filipino folks.  So I was actually, as far as being a radioman, I was actually in an assignment that I was not a cook 'cause the other, the other black Coast Guardsmen on the ship, they were seamen.  They were what they called strikers.  They didn't have a specialty so they were assigned to the deck force, and they were the ones that would do the painting of the ship and all of the "gopher work".  And part of the people that go into those jobs, they're either waiting for a school or they do not have a score high enough to go into certain schools, and they can test later and so forth.  But here, I'm in a, in a specialty rank that there were no other blacks on there but me.  So needless to say, Chief Wood wasn't too happy with me being there.  So he would, he would call me names.  He, you know--and he would call me "Steppin' Fetchit".  One day he was, we were on the flight deck where we have what we call morning muster.  That's where we all get together and the captain comes out and gives the order of the day and what we're doing and so forth.  And we were still in port.  We weren't underway yet at that time.  And he would, and after we would have quarters, he would yell, "Hey, Steppin, get over here, I need my shoes shined," you know, or, you know, he just, just a mean man.  So I was, you know, I--and listening to my mother's [Elizabeth Mary Ellington Patton] advice about, you know, you don't get mad, you get even, but get even in the sense of, you know, show 'em that you're not stupid, and don't bow down to his level.
Story_ID: 36796
Speaker 1: All the guys on the ship--a lot of the guys on the ship were taking college courses.  And so I decided to take a course just because I wanted to--I wanted to take a course, but at the same time, it was to just stay away from Chief Wood because if I was ever around him, he was gonna, you know, I would--he would give us, give some racial comment of some sort, and it would just get me angry.  And then also I thought about, you know, I'm gonna take a class because I need to start taking some college classes because that's what my brother, Gregg, did.  So again, getting back to Brother Gregg.  And so as it turned out, I, as I started taking some of these college courses, my communications officers who was actually the direct supervisor, that the chief is under him, he made a big deal of it.  He would like, whenever I--like back then, the college correspondence course for the Military was called USAFI, which stood for Armed Forces Institute, U.S. Armed Forces Institute.  And what it is, it's a, USAFI was a program--it's now called SOCP, Service Member Opportunity College Program.  But USAFI was, you would, say you wanna take English, and then there would be several colleges and universities that would offer it.  So I would take English from University of Wisconsin, a correspondence course from the University of Wisconsin, or if I took a math class, University of Pennsylvania would offer it, and then I'd take it there.  So you take these courses from all these different schools.  And USAFI would sort of bank your credits.  So when you eventually would sign up for a college or university, they would help you, and your college credits would get immediately transferred to it.  So it's a way to protect your credits, and also your military experience would also be credited to that.  So I was taking these USAFI courses, and I was taking English, I was taking math, I was taking history and a host of other things.  And so, every time I would complete one or complete a course or complete a grade, my communications officer, he'd make a big deal of it.  He would, at morning muster, morning quarters, while they were giving whatever the plan of the day was, he'd say, oh, and Patton just finished his English class, and he got a, he got a ninety-eight on his last test.  Everybody give him hand, you know, and I mean it was actually (laughter) embarrassing that he was doing that 'cause I know other guys on the ship were taking, and he wasn't getting that excited about it.  But he kept doing this for me, and well, it, but then after the third or fourth time he did that, I was telling one of the guys, I said, "Gosh, you know, I wish the heck that the comma or the Comms officers wouldn't do that."  He says, "Haven't you noticed?"  I says, "Noticed what?"  He says, "Chief Wood."  I said, "What about Chief Wood."  He says, "Ah, nah, he says every time Lieutenant Hull does that, Chief Wood gets excited, he gets all upset".  I says, "No kidding."  He says, "Yeah."  What, you know, just the next time--I said, "Well, you know, as a matter of fact, I do have another class, another course lesson coming in."  He said, "Well, watch next time."  And I did, and Chief Wood's standing over there, he's throwing his hat down and, you know, he's ah, you know, he, you know.  So this was getting, this was making him mad.  So all of a sudden, I found out how to get even with him, you know, and it actually just motivated me to take more courses, do better on each one of them, and, you know, 'cause I just kept going at it, and going at it.  And so it was getting Chief Wood upset.  And so, and so to tell you that part of the story is that's how my college education started in the Coast Guard.  And it was, it was really by, you know, things to do to get Chief Wood upset, and my fighting--my way of getting even with him, as my mother [Elizabeth Mary Ellington Patton] and grandmother would tell me to do.  So-
Speaker 2: So you made it out of spite--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, out of spite.
Story_ID: 36797
Speaker 1: So fast forward to when we came back after the medevac, and I'm going down the brow or gangplank, as most civilians call it.  There's Chief Wood down at the dock, and he's standing there with his wife.  And I said, oh God, 'cause he, you know, here I come.  Now, he's got an audience, his wife.  So usually when he used his Steppin Fetchit or whatever, it always had, he always had to have an audience so he can just say it.  So, you know, I'd just come off of this Medevac.  I got an award, you know, ain't nothing, this--whatever he says to me, I don't care.  So let him do it.  So I come down.  He says, "Patton, get over here," and I just know, okay, let me listen to him ridicule me in front of his wife, and that'll be it.  And he says, "I wanna introduce you to my wife."  And he says, "Linda, I wanna introduce you to the best radioman on the ship."  I liked to fainted when he said that (laughter).  I couldn't, I--at first I looked.  Did that come out of his mouth?  And, you know, that was his way of saying he was sorry to me.  And he, I mean that was about as far as it went at that point.  But many years later, I, you know, I crossed paths with him.  Actually, he contacted me after I made Senior Chief.  And he called to tell me he was sorry.  He said that he never forgot what he did and he said after he retired and things went on, and then he started hearing about things I was doing in the Coast Guard later, and he says, so he tracked me down.  And he called me and said he was sorry, said that--and asked for his forgiveness.
Speaker 2: That's a story.  I've heard of some of those kinds of stories before where people do that.  You wonder what motivates folks to--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, upbringing.  And I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.  It's just what, you know, he was born and raised in Alabama for starters, and, you know, and he was certainly in the height of that Civil Rights era from the side of the Edmund Pettis Bridge and where he stood, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Didn't the Coast Guard as a--and I've heard people say that a lot of military officers are from the South.  Was this true in the Coast Guard at--
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it's true in the Coast Guard, only because the Coast Guard, for the most part, from a large number, there's a, there's the real staunch connection is the Northeast.  That's where the majority of people--I mean you'll find people from the Northeast from the Coast Guard.  I mean there's quite a few in the South as well, but I think the Northeast is where the predominance is.  In fact, that's where a lot of people retire, which I can't understand 'cause the cost of living's so high up there (laughter).  But it's the Northeast.
Story_ID: 36798
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so what was your next assignment then?
Speaker 2: Well, after, and this is neat to tell you this story because after I left the Dallas in '76' [1976], I was transferred to my hometown, Detroit, Michigan.  And I, which is pretty neat to get transferred to my hometown.  And although I didn't stay there very long.  I got there, and I got there in February, '76' [1976], and when I reported aboard, my immediate supervisor was a Master Chief, Two Star-Master Chief by the name of Hollis Stevens.  Master Chief Stevens, when I reported, when I gave him my service records.  And I was gonna work in the communications center at the Coast Guard Air Station.  And he goes through my record, and then he looks at me, and he says Patton.  You got sixty-four semester hours of college credit.  What are you gonna do with it?  I mean so all that time I was on the ship, I amassed all these credits from taking classes, college-level exams as well correspondence courses and then my credit for being in the military.  So I ended up with sixty-four hours 'cause my USAFI transcript was in my record.  He said, well, what are you gonna do with this sixty-four hours?  And I said, nothing (laughter).  He says, what do you mean, nothing.  I said, well, I'm stationed in Detroit now, Master Chief, and I gotta a girlfriend here, and, you know, kind of like the idea of just, you know, my free time, to spend time with my girlfriend and, you know, and get to know my job.  I would like to qualify to be an air crewman, you know, flying the helicopters and so forth.  And so Master Chief didn't like that answer.  Now, I went from a chief that treated me really bad to a Master Chief that was definitely a nurturing, mentoring kind of guy, but he had a funny way of doing it.  And he, for the first couple of weeks, he kept going after me about taking college courses.  And the Coast Guard Air Station is co-located on an Air Force base, Selfridge Air National Guard Base is where it's located.  And so there's colleges that are on, so I didn't have to take a correspondence course.  I could go to school.  And I, and I--and working in the communications center was shift duty, so I would have two, 12-hour days, two days off, two, 12-hour days like two, 12 off, like 6:00 in the morning and 6:00 at night, two days, two days off, and then 6:00 at night till 6:00 in the morning.  So anyway, so it was pretty flexible.  And so he, he--I'd come to work, and he's showing this little chart of how I can go to school full time (laughter), and I'm like, what the hell I wanna do that for?  (Laughter) You know, I'm like I don't wanna do it.  And he says, no, you could, you know, you should do this.  He says you, you know, look at how close you are, and then he starts talking about becoming an officer and, you know, my wanting to be Master Chief of the Coast Guard kind of wore out a little bit.  Anyway, I'd just reenlisted in the Coast Guard.  And I kind of enjoyed it, and I'm getting to know my girlfriend who later becomes my wife.  I, you know, this isn't what I wanna do.
Story_ID: 36799
Speaker 1: Now, did you know your wife in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So she was as Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School]?
Speaker 2: Yep, Cass Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we get in this discussion.  It wasn't an argument or anything like that, but the man was just so nice that I says, okay.  I'm gonna shut him up.  I'm just gonna take one class and then I'll, and then he'll leave me alone.  So if I just take one class, and he'll leave me alone, I can go about my merry way.  So one class becomes a full load (laughter) 'cause I started getting in school, and that very schedule that he laid out, I was able to do it.  And, and as a result, I was able to work on a bachelor's degree.  Well, the other story about Master Chief Stevens is he becomes the third Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard.  So now, my interests about wanting to become Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard has reignited, especially after the fact that this man, not only reached out and touched me, but he got very involved and became a very significant part of my career, particularly the professional side of getting my degree 'cause he showed me how I could do it.  So my dream of wanting to become Master Chief of the Coast Guard was, was right there.
Speaker 1: So what was your degree in?
Speaker 2: Social work.
Speaker 1: Social work, okay.  And why--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And my first degree was in social work.
Speaker 1: Why social work?  What did--
Speaker 2: I was taking, some of the courses that I took kind of led into psychology and when--there was, there were two schools on the base.  There was Pacific College and then there was also Mercy College, with--oh, actually, it was not called--well, there's Mercy College, but it was, it was called Shaw College of Detroit which later is part of Mercy College now.  It was Shaw College of Detroit.  So, so I had completed all of my prerequisite stuff.  So it was now looking at, well, what kind of degree field could I go into.  Well, I thought about, how about helping people, and I kind of like the idea of getting involved with helping people.  And I was reading part of the syllabus that explained that some of the coursework that was gonna be done was working with the American Red Cross Service and Military Families program.  And I thought that was pretty neat.  So, I signed up to do that, and that led to a degree in social work.  Tandemly, I was able to work on another degree at the same time in communication, in communication, although I didn't really quite define doing that right away because Pacific College was an approved USAFI [United States Armed Forces Institute] program.  And Shaw College was not.  So my credits went to Pacific, but then, but I wanted to take these classes at Shaw College. So I talked with the, with both guidance counselors at the--one was the Educational Services Officer for the--it was an Air Force Educational Service officer.  And the other one was the guidance counselor that was working for USAFI.  And they allowed me to take these courses somewhat tandemly.  So I was able to get two degrees, you know, from two different schools.  It was really, and that was the beauty of USAFI because your credits went into a bank so no matter what happened, you were getting credits from this particular school program.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is 1976 or so?
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976], um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, something else happens in '76' [1976] that you told me about when we were looking at the photos.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You, yeah, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I get to, well, I get to do some recruiting while I'm--at the same time, and so I'm, I move to Chicago [Illionis] to work at the air station there.  They were shorthanded at the air station.  So I start working as a, both at the air station and at recruiting.  So two days a week, you'd be a recruiter and three days a week, you'd be on duty as a radioman.  I went on--I had to go do a recruiting event which was located at McCormick Place in Chicago.  And so I bring my table, got my recruiting literature set up there.  And this guy walks up to me, and nice, handsome, respectable, black man, and sticks his hand out, and he says, Alex Haley, Chief Petty Officer, U.S. Coast Guard, retired.  And I said, Petty Officer Patton, U.S. Coast Guard still in (laughter).  I didn't know who he was.  So he, well, he started telling me about he was in the Coast Guard and, you know, and things he did, and he was, you know, and we just chatted.  And we, so, and the subject was strictly on the Coast Guard.  So, he starts talking to me about the, about the things he did in the Coast Guard, and so, you know, nice gentleman, wanders off.  Two hours later, he comes back to my table, and he says, have you walked around and looked at all the exhibits here at the, at the Expo event?  And I said, well, no, I haven't.  I'm the only one here.  He said, well go ahead, go walk out.  I'm, I'll watch your table, and I'm retired Coast Guard, I could do that.  And I said, all right, you know, I guess you could.  So I wander around, and I'm looking at the different exhibits that are at this event, and I come to this table.  And I see these books piled up.  This book says, "Autobiography of Malcolm X", Alex Haley.  "Roots: American Saga", and it was a big poster that also said, "Television Series coming soon", Alex Haley.  And I said, I've--Alex Haley?  Is that the guy that's at my table? (Laughter) And so I go back to the table immediately, and I says, "You didn't tell me you were a writer.  And he said, ah, you didn't ask."  (Laughter).  And we became very good, close friends, and we, you know, we chatted a lot.  I was writing to him back and forth and, you know, people didn't believe, and they told me--I told them when "Roots" came out on television and so forth, I said, "Hey, I know that guy."  I used to talk--yeah, right, sure you do.
Story_ID: 36801
Speaker 1: And interestingly, later on in my career, I had--I was transferred, I went to school, Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute which is in Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, and I was learning to be a civil rights counselor facilitator which is a position that each of the services have.  And one of the instructors happens to be Bill Haley, William Haley, who is Alex's son.  So I really got to know them pretty well, and in 1989 I was stationed back at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C.  And we were, I was on the planning committee for the Black History event.  And I said, how about getting, if I call Alex Haley and ask if he'd come and be a speaker?"  And they kind of looked at me and says, yeah, right.  I says, no, really, I know the guy.  I (unclear) the guy, and I call him.  I'll get him to come out.  And they said, okay, yeah, right, okay.  If you do it, yeah, you can handle it.  So I did.  I called him up, and it worked out perfectly because Alex's brother at the time happened to be the mayor of Bethesda, Maryland which is a suburb of D.C.  So he says, yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm coming out to go to something with my brother.  So this works out perfect.  And so needless to say, I had him come out to the, to the Black History Ball in '89' [1989], and at the end, after he gave his speech and we presented him with a memento for being there.  He says, I got something for you.  And he called me back up to the podium, and he hands me this autographed picture that says--and at the time, my rank was Senior Chief, 'cause I had told Alex that one day I wanted to become Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard.  And he, so he handed me this picture, autographed by him, and it says, "To Senior Chief, Vince Patton, good luck in the pursuit of your ultimate goal, to become the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard, Alex Haley, Chief Petty Officer, U.S. Coast Guard, retired."  And, you know, he gave that to me like, I'm what three ranks away from that ever happening.  And that was in 1989.  So, of course, it's one of my honored possessions of items that I have.
Story_ID: 36802
Speaker 1: Okay, now, back in--so you're in Detroit [Michigan] and then in Chicago [Illinois] for a brief period of time, I take it--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --not a long period, as a recruiter.  Then, now, you actually spent a lot of time going to school.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And so, where did you go next and what school was it?
Speaker 2: Well, well, while I was in Chicago, when I--my temporary assignment in Chicago became my permanent assignment (laughter) in Chicago.  The problem, and what happened was--and this was just happening at a time, the Coast Guard was now getting serious about minority recruiting.  And it, which was great, and because, you know, I didn't ask for recruiting.  I was actually pretty happy with just doing things in the Coast Guard.  In fact, my assignment to recruiting happened when the chief came to me and said, hey, you're going on recruiting duty.  And I says, "I didn't ask for that."  And he said, "Well, you're going."  And my job was solely to, to do minority recruiting in Chicago.  And that was a very, very tough climate because first of all, the scores to get into the Coast Guard are pretty high, and other than going to places like, in Chicago, you know, you had Lane Tech [Lane Technical High School] which is probably an equivalent to Cass Tech where I went to high school, where some, you know, the best and brightest young people went.  Most of those young people were going to college, and they were not interested in going in the military.  Many of the other schools that I would go and talk to people, particularly, Cabrini Green [Alternative High School], Western High School, I'm trying to think of some--Calumet [High School], many of these high schools, the people were interested, but their scores did not qualify for 'em to get into the Coast Guard.  In fact, it was a running joke.  It's kind of a funny thing that I was getting more people in the Army than the Army recruiter.  And I was actually the Army Recruiter of the Year in 1977 (laughter) 'cause I was--and it's the truth.  I was Army Recruiter of the Year 'cause I was sending people to the Army.  And the, Loyola University was running a program called the Educational Enrichment Program.  Also, it was known as Youth Motivation Program, and it was to, one was to focus on getting young people interested in finishing high school.  During the '70's [1970s], I can't recall what the actual numbers were, but the dropout rate was, was the highest in the country in Chicago than anywhere else in the country.  And it was astronomical.  So the, one side of the problem was keeping kids in high school.  The other part was boosting certain academic skills so they would successful in graduating.  So they weren't just getting a high school diploma, but getting a high school diploma and getting a good job or going to college and so forth.  So Loyola University was running this particular program, and I kind of stumbled on it by way of, I got an invite to participate in this youth motivation program, and what they really wanted was to talk about what we do in the Coast Guard, the skill sets and things like that.  And I found this was pretty neat, really exciting.  And I was getting a lot of young people that I had talked to were very interested in wanting to join the Coast Guard, but they, they just didn't have the skill sets to do it.  So that's where this Educational Enrichment program came in handy.  So the director of the program, she suggests that I should enroll into Loyola's graduate program.  And I, I said, "Well, you know, actually, I'm kind of done with school (laughter)."  And, of course, I went, gave her the whole story of how I ended up doing my degrees and so forth.  And she says, "Well, this is a good program."  You know, this will pretty much help you.  So, okay, so I contact my, my chief in charge of recruiting, and I tell him about it.  And he was all for it, Rich Longcar (ph.).  He was all for it.  And so he went to Coast Guard, the Coast Guard district office which was in Cleveland [Ohio], and said, you know, if Patton is in this program, he would become a bigger influencer on people interested in joining the Coast Guard.  So the district approved me to go to school.  So, so I--I mean I was, I wasn't just going to school.  I mean I was recruiting.  I was helping things out.  We were, the youth motivation programs that we were doing, we were doing things like, I was getting kids to go down and visit the Coast Guard.  We had helicopters coming into the high school and landing and, you know, and so we did all kinds of this stuff, and it really did pay off.  I mean it really did.  We were, I, as a result, I was getting good people in the Coast Guard, and at the same time, working on my doct--on my master's degree.  And as I write a, my dissert--my thesis was on setting up an education enrichment program for the Coast Guard, similar to what was, what Loyola was doing.
Story_ID: 34571
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were reviewing in your master's degree the how the Coast Guard--
Speaker 2: How the, yeah, so I found, well, and--
Speaker 1: How you matriculate in the Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and how would this school work in the Coast Guard?  For example, I go back to when I first reported aboard ship, and I was explaining about we had people who were non-rates, people who didn't have a skill, you know, they were either waiting on schools or they were just doing manual labor.  Well, many of these people that were in the non-rate, manual labor pool were minorities, mostly African Americans.  In other words, they got the scores to get into the Coast Guard, but they didn't have the score to become electronics technicians or radiomen or health services technicians or any of the other types of specialty fields that they had.  And so if the Coast Guard, you know, on one side they were serious enough to yank me out of my job, to be a recruiter, then they have to be serious enough to offer a program that was going to help folks to succeed in the Coast Guard.  And this wasn't mostly--although it was focused toward the support for minority recruiting, I mean it was open to everybody.  And we had a lot of folks that went through that were also non-minorities.  But more importantly, we were getting people in, and they were, and they became more productive in the Coast Guard.  Instead of spending four years, and their highest rank that they could achieve was pay-grade E-3, which was a seaman or a fireman, if they were working in engineering, without a specialty skill, you know, here's an opportunity for them to reach petty officer, as well as many of them went on and became chiefs, master chiefs, officers, warrant officers.  You know, they excelled in the Coast Guard.  So the Coast Guard took that opportunity for me to do that.  And so I, my thesis was on the development an educational enrichment program, which was adopted in the Coast Guard.  And the rest, as they say, is history.  It ran for six years, which actually was about as long as it should have.  I mean it was a program that, as the educational systems began to get itself better, we were getting minorities in, and so forth, that it, that the education enrichment program had ran its course.  So it was an opportunity that I was able to take advantage of, and some people say well, gosh, you know, you were in the right place at the right time.  Well, maybe, but I had the right kind of people that helped me out.  So the other part to tell you this Chicago [Illinois] experience, which leads me to my doctorate degree, which is also kind of funny, is I, you know, doing my recruiting thing and going to school.  So the District Commander, which is the Great Lakes District, which is called the Ninth District, is out of Cleveland, Ohio.  So the District Commander flies into Chicago to go to speak at some event.  And the Coast Guard's small, so we, you know, usually you kind of double team to do different things.  So they needed somebody to be the Admiral's driver, he was a Two-Star Admiral.  So, I kind of got volunteered.  I (laughter) didn't volunteer.  And my chief, Chief Longcar who was the chief of recruiting, he wanted to go with me to meet the District Commander.  We pick up the District Commander at the airport.  We drive him toward downtown, and Chief Longcar probably says to Admiral [James S.] Gracey who is the admiral, he said, Petty Officer Patton's working on his master's degree at Loyola University.  And he explains how I got to do it and what I'm doing, and Admiral Gracey, says oh, yes.  I remember this thing.  So then Admiral Gracey says to me, that's great Patton.  When are you gonna become an officer?  And then I says, I'm not, sir.  And he says, you're not?  And I says, no, sir.  He says, well, why not?  I said, well, I wanna be Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard some day.  And he kind of got quiet.  And then after we let the Admiral off, Chief Longcar starts yelling me.  He says, you gotta quit telling people that, says, people don't believe you.  So, you know, Admiral Gracey, he didn't believe it.  He thinks you're being a smart ass for saying that.  And I said, but it's true.  He says, yeah, but you just gotta temper your tongue.  Just tell a guy that you, you'll do it some day or something, but just don't tell people that.  Okay, so I kind of let that go.  So, after my tour of Chicago, and I get my degree, I get transferred to Cleveland, to the district office.
Story_ID: 34572
Speaker 1: So this is '80' [1980]?
Speaker 2: This '79' [1979], right after I left--
Speaker 1: This is '79' [1979], so this is after your Masters degree, right?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: All right, in '79' [1979].
Speaker 2: So, actually, it's 1980.  It is 1980.  It was after my Masters degree.  So I get transferred to Cleveland, and I wasn't there very long.  I'm there for close to eight months.  I come in there, I come into the work--I was working in personnel at the time.  My, my commander calls me into his office.  And he says, Patton, come in my office.  All right, and he says, have a seat.  And I was getting ready to sit, said, have a seat at my desk.  And I says, seat at your desk?  He said, yeah, you're gonna get a phone call.  Somebody wants to talk to you.  Who's that?  You know, and he says, well, you'll find out.  The phone rings.  He says, that's for you.  I answer the phone, and he says, this is Admiral [James S.] Gracey.  Well, Admiral Gracey, who a few years before was the Ninth District Commander in Cleveland, later become the commandant of the Coast Guard.  So I've got the Commandant of the Coast Guard, the Four-Star Admiral on the phone, and I'm like, wow.  So I'm thinking, running in the back of my head, I says, okay, did I make him that mad that he waited to become (laughter) commandant to chew me out for saying I wanted to be Master Chief of the Coast Guard, what, you know.  And he, so he tells me, he says, "Patton, I got a job for you."  And he says, "You still wanna be Master Chief of the Coast Guard some day?"  And I says, "Yes, sir."  He says, "Well, then I got a job that I think you might wanna do if you really wanna become Master Chief of the Coast Guard some day.  And I says, "A job sir?"  And he says, "Yeah."  He says, "I'm changing the Coast Guard's performance evaluation system, both the officer and the enlisted program.  We just selected an officer that's gonna do it, and the Chief of Personnel just paraded in a whole bunch of officers that were gonna work on the enlisted system, and I says, how come an enlisted person can't do it?  And the Chief of Personnel said, well, we don't think there's an enlisted person qualified to do it."  And then Admiral Gracey said, "Yes, there is.  There's a guy named Patton.  I met him in Chicago a couple years ago.  Go find him."  And that was his order (laughter).  So, so he said to me, we're gonna put you on a plane and come to Washington, D.C. and then we're gonna sit down and talk to you.  And if you're interested, and if you qualify into a doctoral program, we're gonna enroll you into a program, and you're gonna, your dissertation is gonna be on the development and implementation of the enlisted evaluation system, just as we have the officer doing it for the officer program.  So I get transferred here [Washington, D.C.] in '82' [1982], and sure enough I get enrolled into a full-time program with the, at American University, and with the sole purpose of that was working on the, my dissertation to develop the enlisted evaluation system.  And it's the system that is still in existence today, which I'm surprised at, after it had been completed in 1984 and implemented in 1985, I'm, you know, here it's been, what 28, 29 years now that the system that I created and put into place is still in existence today.
Story_ID: 34573
Speaker 1: That is something, all these years.  Can you explain what the enlisted evaluation system is?
Speaker 2: Yes, previously, the Coast Guard's performance appraisal system for officers and enlisted, it was all just strictly numerical, and it was kind--very arbitrary that a person would assign, with this set of marks, who did a good job, what they did and so forth.  So what one rating in terms of if you got a--the top scale was 4.0, just like a school grading system.  If you got, you gave somebody a 3.7, and depending on, if their rank was a, like an E4, that's really good, you know.  But if you were an E7, getting a 3.7, that's really bad 'cause you're kind of average.  And it was kind of interpreted that whatever the number, equated to the rank.  So if you were an E7, and if you got a 3.7, you were average.  You needed a 3.8 or 3.9 or 4.0 to be considered good.  But that's not how the paperwork was written.  It was, you know, it said those types of things.  But it was, it was a very antiquated system that dated back to the 1950s, and, in fact, it was a Navy system.  It was actually the Navy's evaluation system that the Coast Guard was using.  And what the problem was is that the Coast Guard made personnel management decisions on those evaluations.  So you didn't necessarily have, get the right person for the right job or for promotions and so forth.  And so--and everybody said it was unfair because, like I said, a comparison of evaluations were not quite accurate.  The officer system was similar, different.  Numerical, but it was kind of the same thing.  So when Admiral [James S.] Gracey became commandant, it was kind of a running cry to him from a lot of people that we gotta change this system because the Coast Guard at this point in time, we were starting to--too many people were staying in.  And we were putting people out under reduction of force.  And so we let some good people go, you know, as a result of that.  So the commandant decided that there has to be a better way to do this.  And first he was going to commission a study and get a civilian contractor to do it, and then he says, yeah, I don't wanna do that.  He said, why would I do that when I really should get--I know there's talent in the Coast Guard who can do that.  So that's when he said, he says, it's cheaper for me to send two people to graduate school and use their dissertations as the study than me spending whatever thousands of dollars and people to do that.  So it was a smart move on his part, and, which worked out pretty well.  So the evalu--so what I did, and the officer system is similar to this 'cause actually, I started working very closely with the guy who also was in graduate school with me who was the officer, was that we, we scaled it in terms of what we had to define.  Well, what is marginal performance?  What is considered expected?  Not what's average, but what's expected?  What's expected of you when you come to work?  And what do you we call superb?  So the only way to do that is that I had to travel throughout the Coast Guard, both myself and Nick Allen, who was the officer.  And we would interview people from all different types of vocations.  So it was a great thing for me because I learned more about the Coast Guard that way because although, I mean here I was, my specialty field, first was radioman, in communications.  Then it later became personnel, and that's, you know, that's all I could have known.  But then I started hanging out with people who were machinery technicians, people in the aviation field, people who were in law enforcement and so forth, to get a perspective about how the different jobs are and to try to come up with a common language that everybody knew.  So, so as a result of that, we built these anchored phrases, margin performance, expected performance and superlative performance.  And we built the evaluation system off of that.  And then that has turned into probably one of the principal personnel management tools that the Coast Guard is using even today in defining who gets promoted, who goes to officer candidate school, who gets put out?
Story_ID: 34574
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back to Loyola [University].  And then on to American University, but who were your mentors there?  Who were the teachers that really were important or if or were there any?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a, there were a host of people and, you know, (laughter), I'm gonna have to look at that book, my book that has all the names on it.  But there was a gentleman named Thurman Beavers who was one of my advisors at Loyola.  He was also the, the head of the Army ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] department as well.  So I, you know, he and I kind of, kind of connected by virtue of the fact that, you know, I was active-duty military and I didn't really have anybody to go to.  And he was already--because the Army was already sending officers to Loyola to go to programs.  So he kind of kept an eye on them as well as their ROTC program.  So I kind of got adopted by him to, he kind of helped me along the way, and showed me through different types of things of what I had to do.  Beyond that, my thesis advisor whose name I can't remember right now, he was a nice guy.  I mean he was, he kind of helped give me some basic--but he didn't really give me guidance.  The real guidance actually came from the Coast Guard because I, you know, I would tell 'em what I needed from the Coast Guard, and he would give me the academic approach of how to do that.  But I had to write things in such a way to get the Coast Guard to buy the enlisted evaluation program concept.  So I really didn't have as many folks academically from Loyola that were--not that they weren't supportive, but that were key principal people that I worked with.  Now, on to the my doctorate program, I actually did.  There were several people.  One is my advisor, Myra Sadka, M-Y-R-A, Sadka, S-A-D-K-A, who was dean of the School of Education.  She was just a phenomenal (unclear).  She kind of reminded me of back in my grade school days with Mrs. Shannon, I mean just, I mean--when I was assigned to her, she, as my advisor, the challenge was, it was my academic advisory board for my dissertation would be one thing.  But I wouldn't get my degree unless the commandant of the Coast Guard said, this is it.  This is what I wanna do.  And so Myra was very good at, as much as the advisory board didn't wanna do it, she made them work together with the Coast Guard more closely.  So I didn't feel like I was chasing my tail on doing things because some of the frustration people have when working on their doctorate degrees is that the, you got an academic advisory board that come from different focuses and angles on what they want.  And so you end up doing a number of research things, some of it that's useless because one advisor thinks it should go this way, I mean the board, on the board, wants it to go this way.  And then when you meet before the board, you know, they just tear you all to pieces.  But Myra facilitated that opportunity for me to ensure that I was, that I was gonna get a (unclear) either a smooth thing.  I mean it was a lot of work, but the things that I did were relevant, much, much more realistic and practical that when I had to defend my dissertation, she coached me superbly, and, and, and she went the extra mile by when I had to make my presentation to Admiral Gracey, because, I mean he was the ultimate decider.  I mean if, if he didn't like what I had, I mean that was it.  You know, I, and it was a one-shot pony.  It wasn't go back and figure it out.  It was thank you, and we'll take what we think we have and, you know, go back into the field.  And that's it.  But she, she coached me and worked me through it.
Story_ID: 34575
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have children by this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had two children.  My first wife is where my son was born.  And he--who was born in '76' [1976], and my second child was my daughter from my second wife who passed away.  She was born in '85' [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay, this is after the PhD?
Speaker 2: Yes, right after, yep.
Speaker 1: Now, while you were in school, working on your PhD, even though you were working hard I'm sure, you could not fail to notice the election of Harold Washington as Mayor of the City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter), now, you--Washington at the time, was, you know, actually, I got so engrossed into things at times in the early '80's [1980s], as the politics was going on that I didn't, I didn't pay attention as much as I really wanted to.  I actually, I actually had to do a backtrack.  It was somewhere during my second tour in Washington [D.C.] that I had to look back to, "What did I forget?"  "What did I miss that was going on here in Washington," that I missed out on.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I'm thinking you're in--Loyola, Harold wasn't--I mean Chicago politics was--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, Chicago, you're talking about Chicago politics.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, oh, my--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --oh, Chicago politics, oh, God.  If he, if you--
Speaker 1: And here, it was Marion Barry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but Chicago politics, oh, my goodness.  Yeah, that was, that was a science (laughter).  That was during the time, let's see, 'cause, let's see Daley, and what was her name?
Speaker 1: Jane Byrne.
Speaker 2: Jane Byrne and then Bilando, Biando--
Speaker 1: Bilandic.
Speaker 2: Bilandic, yeah.
Speaker 1: Michael Bilandic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was, that was during that era.
Speaker 1: And I guess when you, just as you were getting ready to leave, they were starting up the campaign for Harold Washington--
Speaker 2: Right, for Harold Washington.  I was leaving when the Harold Washington was coming.  But I remember him.  He was president of the Council at the time, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: No, he was in Congress at that--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was in Congress, okay, yeah, yeah, but I, yeah, but I remember, I remember him because he was always on, in the news, even before he was running for office at the time, but, yeah, oh, yeah, Chicago politics.  I, what I--let's see, what I remembered most about that was the big snowstorm that got--was it Jane got fired for that, right?  Was it--
Speaker 1: Bilandic got--
Speaker 2: Oh, Bilandic got fired for that, that's right, Bilandic got fired (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, they didn't vote for him.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Yeah, well, that story--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: All that was going on, and then here, Marion Barry, I guess, his various dramas or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Marion Barry drama, I, like I said, I kind of was so busy, I just missed, missed part of that until he got arrested (laughter), and then I had to go back and say, wait a minute, who is this guy, you know?
Story_ID: 34576
Speaker 1: Okay, well, Washington, D.C.  All right, so you got your PhD, you earn your PhD in '84' [1984], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so, how much closer were you then to becoming the Master Chief--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't quite close yet.  I had just been promoted to Chief Petty Officer, which is pay grade E7.  And after I got my degree, I was offered, once again, the offer to become an officer again.  And Admiral Bell, who presented me my diploma at my graduation, he put a, he was a tough salesman.  He says, look, he says, you don't have to go to OCS [Officer Candidate School], you don't have to (unclear).  He says, we'll promote you to lieutenant 'cause there was a--and there still is, there's a direct commission program that promotes you straight to 03 instead of becoming an 01.  And he was gonna send me to the Coast Guard Academy to be an instructor to work in the--he didn't quite define what kind of instructor but he also, he was gonna kind of give me whatever I wanted.  And I told him, no, no, sir, this isn't what I wanna do.  But he was, he was pretty hard, and that, and I mean really hard on me, that I almost--he, what he did was, he played, his trump card was, "Think about your family," you know, he gave me the "Think about your family, think about the things you're gonna do," and he, he almost got me.  And I said, I'll do it, and I went as far as, it was--I had my uniforms with the lieutenant stripes put on 'em, and in fact, the day I got it out of the cleaners, 'cause it was like the next week or so, I was gonna get commissioned, and then transferred to New London [Connecticut].   And I, I was taking 'em out of the cleaners, and I was, when I got home, and I hung it up in my closet, I looked at it, and it just scared the daylights out of me in the sense that, I said, well, I don't know if I wanna do this.  And only because this direct commission was to permanent teaching staff at the academy because you don't leave the academy.  You're there forever, and you get promoted while you're there, but I would just be there.  And I wanted to go back in the Coast Guard.  I mean, and I just said, "I can't do this."  So I called Admiral Bell up, and I says, "I'm sorry, sir."  "I can't do this."  And he says, "Really?"  I says, I said, sir, you know, nobody wants--nobody loves the Coast Guard more than I do.  And the opportunity I would tell anyone that want an opportunity for promotion to take it and so forth, but this isn't what I want, you know.  And he says, well, keep in mind now, only one person gets to be Master Chief of the Coast Guard.  And what happens if you don't get it?  I says, well, I think about what I got in the Coast Guard.  I mean the Coast Guard sent me to school.  You know, and unprecedented sent me to school twice, you know, to--and bent the rules so to speak to let me go to school because they don't let enlisted people go to school.  Officers go.
Speaker 1: And were you the only PhD enlisted man in the Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am, I was, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was at the time.  So he says, okay.  All right, good luck (laughter).  That's kind of how he said it.  And I didn't look back.  I mean I, you know, I did not look back.
Story_ID: 34577
Speaker 1: So, well, how do you--I can understand why they would wanna use you at the academy because you had just revised, you know, the--how you move up and down in the Coast Guard--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and a procedure, and so what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, after I did that I called my assignment officers or detailers as we call them.  And I said, it's time for me to go back to sea.  And he like dropped the phone and he says, what?  Yeah, I says, because, you know, and he says, well, you know, you can get any assignment you want.  Why do you wanna go back to sea? 'Cause he kind of looked it like with your background and, you know, you're kind of--isn't this kind of a step down for you?  I says, no, no.  I says, look, I'm serious about wanting to be Master Chief for the Coast Guard some day, and if I wanna become Master Chief of the Coast Guard, I need to be in the Coast Guard.  And although I've had some great opportunities of what I've done so far, I need to go back operational.  So, he, he fulfilled my wish and got me orders to Coast Guard Cutter Boutwell, B-O-U-T-W-E-L-L, which at that time was home ported out of Seattle, Washington.  And the Boutwell, it still is commissioned, is a high endurance cutter that primarily patrolled the Alaskan waters.  So it meant that I had to go to boarding officer school because I had to--because one of the jobs of being a chief onboard is you're gonna be one of the boarding officers.  So my primary job was to be the personnel officer on the ship, but everybody has a operational job in addition to whatever your primary job is.  So my, my operational job was to be a boarding officer, and also I had shipboard jobs, such as I became a helicopter landing signal office.  I learned how to do navigation on the bridge, and also, I was back in the real Coast Guard, you know, which was quite a shock to a lot of people that I chose to go back and to do that.  And in this case, I had really never did any of those things.  So and I wanted to do it, and I mean I really--and I thought more of--I didn't think about I never--I wanted to do if I ever became Master Chief of the Coast Guard.  I started thinking about, well, you know, the day I get out of the Coast Guard, if I hadn't gone back and done those things, people would say, you were in the Coast Guard, and they start talking about all these exciting things.  And I say, well, you know, I spent all my time in school (laughter).
Story_ID: 34578
Speaker 1: And it just didn't set right with me, so, so I went to the Boutwell, and, which I define that as it was my best tour in the Coast Guard, next to being Master Chief of the Coast Guard, of course.  But it was my--and why was it my best tour in the Coast Guard because every piece of literature you pick up on the Coast Guard about the Coast Guard was in that job.  We did everything.  We handled oil pollution spills, you know, we did search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, drug interdiction, we did it all, and, you know, and it was just, it was--and not to mention the fact that ship is one of the most beautiful looking ships in the Coast Guard that I just really enjoyed that assignment.  And going back as a chief, you know, also meant an awful lot for me being that, in my first ship, you know, encountering a chief that treated me poorly, you know, now going back as a chief and never forgetting where you come from and ensure that people onboard needed to be mentored and I promoted the educational program on the ship because, you know, saying, hey, it started for me, and we got a couple of the officers as well as myself that signed up to be underway instructors for service member opportunity college program, which was the forerunner name of USAFI.  So I got to teach school while I was underway at the, you know, it just, it was just great.  And we were family.  I mean the interesting thing is that 184 people on that ship and, of course, the number fluctuates with people coming in and going out, I am in touch with almost ninety percent of that entire crew.  On my Facebook page, I mean we actually are, all stay in touch 'cause it was just a, it was a remarkable crew in terms of people work together.  It was, it was the Coast Guard that I wish I had when I joined, and that made me feel good that here we're now into the mid-'80's [1980s], and I'm seeing the Coast Guard that I had hoped that anyone coming to join, that would have, that you had the teamwork.  You know, we had women on board at the time too, and things just, just worked out.  They rolled pretty well.
Speaker 2: What was the, you mentioned all the activities or some of the activities the Boutwell was engaged in.  What was the predominant--was there any one thing that was like the, you know, the predominant duty?
Speaker 1: Well, the, probably the best sea story, predominant that I could tell you is, my last cruise before I left the ship.  We were, we were actually coming back, we were coming back from Alaska on a fisheries patrol.  We were tired because fisheries patrol, is you go out for about two, two and a half months.  And you're in for about 30 days to refit to go back out again.  We stayed out a little longer because the ship that was to relieve us had some mechanical problems, and they had pulled into Vancouver, British Columbia, and they were laid up for about three weeks.  So we spent an extra three weeks out.  And so the crew was a little irritable, 'cause, you know, everybody wanted to get home, and I mean we don't spend that much time in port anyway.  And then so as we're coming back, we get a call from the drug enforcement agency [DEA] that tells us that their intelligence gathering reported a mother ship about ninety miles off the coast of Oregon.  And, and told the captain, and wanted permission to steam to the, to that location.  And the mother ship is, these are vessels that have all the drugs onboard and smaller boats come out and, you know, that's the big drugstore, basically.
Speaker 2: Where was the ship coming from?
Speaker 1: The ship in question?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was coming from somewhere in the Far East, ballpark guess was it came out of Thailand, but, you know, but it, and it--there's some interesting twists here in the story.
Story_ID: 36803
Speaker 1: So would you say that the predominant activity of the Boutwell was trying to keep drug ships out of--
Speaker 2: The primary activity of the Boutwell was really fisheries enforcement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although, although--and primarily because, you know, there weren't a lot of drug trafficking going on up in the Aleutian chain area where we did.  And, and fishing up in Alaska is big business.  So we were seldom ever pulled off to do any drug interdiction because the fishing interdiction was just as important.  I mean both with foreign fishing fleets, people catching endangered species, you know, particularly whale and some--I mean that was, you know, keeping the Japanese because they were the ones that were catching the whales.  And then you had the Russians coming across the line.  It was a big issue.  So to the point that, while the ship is capable of doing drug enforcement, ninty-five percent of our job was really fisheries enforcement, which was pretty big.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So it was pretty interesting for us to be called to do a drug interdiction.  And we were pretty--and so it kind of pepped us up.  I mean the captain, he called the executive officer and myself to the bridge--well, actually, to his cabin to tell us that we're not going home.  And me as the personnel officer was also the morale officer.  He goes okay, you know, pulse everybody.  Make sure nobody is upset.  If there's any serious issues going on at home, you know, make sure that that's taken care of.  So here's where my social work came, comes into play with working with the crew.  So I make the announcement that we're going to, we're going on a drug interdiction run.  Of course, we couldn't tell everybody what was going on at the time.  And we meet up, we get to the vessel.  It was called the Motor Vessel in Encounter Bay, and we see the vessel is listing.  Obviously, the cargo was shifted.  So the intelligence from the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] told us that it was a hostile vessel and to proceed with caution and so forth.  And so we make the announcement on the radio that we're, that we're coming to board and noticing that they were listing, we asked if they were in trouble or in danger and so forth.  So there was no response back.  As the vessel, as the Boutwell gets closer, a bunch of guys come out on the deck of the other vessel, and they start shooting at us.  And immediately the captain of the Boutwell, first of all, we evasive maneuver--well, they had rifles.  They didn't have anything--I mean it's kind of stupid.  They're coming out there with shotguns, and we got this big, giant gun that could blow 'em out of the water (laughter) on our--but nonetheless, they, you know, the drug dealers aren't very smart, I guess.  So we, we make a move, an evasive maneuver, call on the boarding team to go aboard to make the boarding, and I'm a member of the boarding team.  In fact, I'm the chief boarding officer.  And it just so happens that, you know, we have a cycle, and I was the next team, I'm Team Charlie, and Team Charlie was up.
Speaker 1: So were you used to doing this?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, well, used to doing, used to doing boardings and so forth, but when they're shooting at you, that's a different story (laughter).
Story_ID: 36804
Speaker 1: This was the first time you experienced that?
Speaker 2: It's the first time I experienced that.  Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what made 'em stop?  I mean did they just stop and retreat or what happened?
Speaker 2: No, no, they, they stopped.  The captain made a call back to 'em, telling them that they, they're to put their weapons down, stop or face consequences.  That was kind of his--so they try to take off.  We fire our 50 caliber, we fire across the bow to make them stop.  They didn't stop.  At that time, the captain orders the boarding team to get into the small boat and for us to be out of the way 'cause he wanted us in the water, and he wanted us away from the action right away.  And as we get in the water, then the Boutwell steams toward the Encounter Bay, and then the .50 caliber opens up onto the stern of the Encounter Bay to hit the engine room, which they did successfully to stop 'em.  And, and when they, and once they stopped, the Boutwell then moved up close, and we had armed people out on the deck with the 50-cals trained, and got a reasonable distance to allow the boarding party to come around and for us to board so they can, they can protect us as we're aboard.  And, of course, the, you know, crew gave up, when we got there.  And so, long story short, the Encounter Bay had, it became, it was the largest drug interdiction in Pacific at that time.  It's been surpassed.  It was a $72 million street value of marijuana, $20 million value of cocaine also that was on board.
Speaker 1: Twenty thousand, you're saying--or 20 million--
Speaker 2: Twenty million dollar.
Speaker 1: Oh, $20 million worth of cocaine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were bails and bails and bails of it.  And--
Speaker 1: And this was from where, I mean where was the Encounter Bay from?
Speaker 2: It was, it was registered, it was registered in Panama, although the, it's point of origin was unknown really.  It was, evidence gave that it came from the Far East, perhaps Thailand, but the information wasn't quite that accurate, other than the fact of what we got.  But more importantly, the vessel itself served as prosecuting evidence on the conviction Manuel Noriega.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Because of the fact that he had ownership of that particular vessel, and probably called the shots of where they were going, and it probably funneling his pockets with whatever the drug purchases that were made.  But it, but it became--but the vessel itself served as part of the prosecution of Manuel Noriega.
Speaker 1: Noriega, who was known in those days as the "Little Pineapple".
Speaker 2: Yeah, with his pock-marked face.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Salvador, right?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: In Panama.
Speaker 2: In Panama.
Speaker 1: Well, that's something.  That's, this is in 1985 or--
Speaker 2: No, this is 1988.
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 2: July of 1988.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My last trip before I came off the Boutwell.
Story_ID: 36805
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were on the Boutwell from '85' [1985] to '88' [1988]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985] to '88' [1988].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, all right, what happened next?  Now, what--
Speaker 2: Well, after that, then I was getting promoted to Senior Chief, and I was transferred back to Washington, D.C.  The way the Coast Guard saw it is that, okay, you've had your fun.  Now, it's time to get our money's worth out of you.  We sent you to school to do things.  So they created a job, if you wanna call it that.  Actually, the job existed, but there were, it was run by a civilian.  But it was called Training Management--it was a Training Management role.  And it was, all of the enlisted programs, enlisted school programs that we have in the Coast Guard I managed it.  So that meant I was responsible for the quality of the curriculum, the assurance of the credentialing of our instructors, budgets and things like that.  It was a fun job.  It was a very busy job, and what made it fun was it wasn't a desk job because in order to be proficient in understanding training, you had to go out there and see what people were doing.  And when any curriculum changes were brought to me, you know, and I didn't necessarily have to understand what they did, like electronics.  We were, at that time, the Coast Guard training was getting more involved with fiber optics and things like that, and we didn't have a program package together, so I had to go evaluate it.  I, you know, evaluate by looking at what the other services were doing, looking at what private sector was doing, and looking at, if someone goes to this training, what are the gonna with it, and where is it gonna go and so forth.  So I, I--it was a, it was a busy job.  I actually traveled quite a bit, but I was back out there.  In other words, I was, while I wasn't like I was on the Boutwell, I did get to go, when I had to go visit the ships and so forth, I went during, when they were doing operations which was when I needed to see them.  So it was a wonderful job.  It was, I really felt like I had my cake and ate it too because I was able to do a staff job, but in an operational way.
Story_ID: 36806
Speaker 1: And so I did that assignment until 1993, and--no, I'm sorry, 1992.  I gotta back up, in 1992.  And I was selected to the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is 1992?
Speaker 1: Right, um-hum.
Speaker 2: U.S. Army--okay, Sergeants Major Academy.  Now, is that in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 1: No, that's in El Paso, Texas.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  And it's a, it's a--although the Army runs the school, it's a joint service--it's now nine months, but it was six months when I went through, a six-month school that you go through.  It's kind of a staff college basically.  And they're sending you to that, you know, when they send senior enlisted to that, it's to prepare you for an assignment when you become a command-level Master Chief or a Command Sergeant Major as in, as the case may be in the other services.  And that was a great assignment 'cause I got to, you know, play with the Army (laughter), and I, and that's where I went to Jump School 'cause one of the curriculum is you--I had to do something Army.  And I didn't--I, well, I'll say, well, the last name is Patton.  Now, I'm gonna go play in tanks, of course.  But then when I found out that you gotta learn how to take the tank apart and put it back together, I didn't want anything to do with that (laughter).  So I said, well, what else could I do?  And then, and I said, ah, I always wanted to go to Jump School.  Yeah, (laughter) so I went to Army, I went to Army Jump School, and I, at the ripe age of 38, 39--well, 38--well, actually, it was 39 when I went.  So, which everybody else in the class were like 20.  But, so, but it, it was a great program.  I enjoyed it.  It's a prestigious school.
Story_ID: 36807
Speaker 1: Generally, people who go through the Sergeant's Major Academy will end up in high visibility assignments as the case worked for me because after that, I was tagged, I made Master Chief, and President Clinton had just come into office at the time.  And the, President Clinton had made a promise about he was going to address the gays in the military.  And each service had to provide some people to be on the taskforce that addressed the gays in the military.  So I was the Coast Guard representative.  And I spent, it was about eight months at the Pentagon.  The first time I ever got into the Pentagon.  So I actually worked in the Pentagon.  And to review the policies (unclear) then, and as a result, that's where "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was created as a result of that.  My job there was basically, I wasn't a policy guy.  I was, I did, I was doing research with the, well, I call it evolutional research, looking at the situation socially.  Again, this is where my social work background came in handy a little bit and my doctorate came in handy from the research perspective, to address how social changes occur within the military.  So I, I kind of made it at least from an argument's standpoint, supporting that should the policy come to openly allow gays to serve, that it wasn't gonna be a big deal.  And the reference for that was the Executive Order 99801.  That was the Executive Order that Harry Truman [President Harry Truman] signed integrating the Armed Forces in 1947.  So, and actually, in my involvement of working that, I became an advocate of supporting gays in the military.  Well, number one, gays were serving in the military.  And it was not an, you know, so it was, you know, and number two, I mean I knew people who were gay.  And it always bothered me only in the sense of they were very exceptional workers, and if they were ever found out, we'd kick 'em out, you know.  And then we were keeping people who were doing things, you know, that you really don't wanna keep people in.  So it always bothered me that when I knew people who were doing, you know, exceptional workers, that, but yet we had this policy then.  We were throwing people out.  So one would say that "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was not good.  I'm of the opinion that you had to crawl before you can walk.  I don't think that "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", if it was abolished--if we went straight from eliminating the requirement that, you know, that gays could, you couldn't say you were gay or anything like that and went to straight to that, in that era, I think we would have had an awful lot of problems.  And that was what I addressed in there.  I felt there had to be an interim.  And I took a lot of heat, particularly from Gay Rights advocacy groups, you know, saying that we didn't go far enough.  And, but I, I was really of the belief that if we were gonna do this right and, first of all, you know, people gotta come out of denial, that, number one, there are gay people in here.  I did not like the idea that we did, that, you know, that you have this "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", but, but the other part was "Don't pursue", which very few people looked at.  And that was, it eliminated that, like, when a security clearance was done on somebody, and you found out the person is gay, they're out the door, you know.  So now, you eliminated that.  And that allowed people who, those exceptional performers that would, you know, if they did have a lifestyle that they were able to keep it under wraps and they didn't have to worry about it.  And so it was the, it was the best that I think at that time, to meet at least an opportunity.  But I felt all along that, like I say, you gotta crawl before you can walk.  And as time would go on, that it's no big deal.  I mean we're gonna get into a situation where our children and our children's children who care less about what people's sexual orientation and religion and so forth is, but it's about what they do.  And I think that's what the whole thing is about, you know, can you do the job?  And gay people have shown time and time--at least to me, that I know, that they can do the job and they have done the job.  And I'm, I'm happy to see that we have created an openness in the service.  And what problem has it caused?  Nothing, you know.  And the services that people were concerning, that, well, you know, people are gonna get out and all that.  Nobody, you know, everybody's worried about it.  It hasn't caused a single problem at all, as I thought it, exactly as I thought was gonna happen.  It was nothing.
Story_ID: 36808
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, also there's a problem--when the Tail Hook was an incident--
Speaker 2: Tail Hook was right around that time.  And the--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in the early '90's [1990s], right, exactly.
Speaker 1: --of sexual harassment--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --of a woman, and the, who was, her name again?  That resulted in a lot of discussion about how, you know, which is still in news--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --today, how to deal with proper--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's still a problem right now, you know--
Speaker 1: --of rape in the military.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, exactly, but, yeah, Tail Hook was going on at that time and, which also brought on the additional fears about, oh, gosh, we got, we got women and now we're gonna have this thing about, you know, we're gonna have gays in, you know, and all this (unclear).  You already got gays, already in, I mean and my whole view out of it was, was that I just didn't think that it was right, that we would kick 'em out because of, they're gay.  You know, there are things in life that I don't like, but I deal with it, and I work with it.  And that's how everybody should look at it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So do you think, now, you were on--you were with a group that was recommend--making recommendations, right?
Speaker 2: Right, correct.
Speaker 1: And were you the only minority on the group?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was not the only minority.  I was the only Coast Guard person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was not the only minority.  There were fifteen people in all, and one of the members that was on there is now a Three-Star General, General Vincent--oh, I just forgot his name, Army general.  He was a colonel at the time--gosh, I just drew a blank of his name.
Speaker 1: African American?
Speaker 2: African American, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ah, gosh, I can't think of his name.  Vincent was a--the only reason why I can think of his name, Vincent, 'cause my name is Vincent.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was a colonel, he was an Army colonel.  He's a Three-Star General now.
Speaker 1: That's easy to look up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But there were--what do you think?  What would you say about the makeup of the group?
Speaker 2: There were, it was very diverse.  It was, it was very diverse.  There were women as well, you know, men, and there were fifteen of us, so Colonel Vincent, I can't think of--it'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Were there--this is an interesting question.  And I just thought of this.  Were there any gay members of that group--of course, they couldn't tell.
Speaker 2: They couldn't tell.
Speaker 1: They couldn't tell and nobody could ask.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.  That's right, now, do I suspect that there was a gay member?  Yes, I do.  I suspect that there were two people who were gay or are gay.  But, and there was also a couple of very, very hardliner people.  One was the, was a Navy Chaplin who was an extremely hardliner, fundamentalist, Baptist denomination person that was also on there.  And, of course, yeah, he was pretty interesting.  But, you know what I found, you know what?  He was give to arguments.  And then he would stop the argument 'cause he found the argument was taking it to where (laughter)--he was arguing against, you know, then he'd, ah, you know, I guess that isn't right, you know (laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: So it happens in those kind of (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous) going back in a circle.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, and so he was, he had to do a very fine line on that because, you know, he's supporting his religious denomination in addition to the fact that, you know, he's supposed to be on a panel that's supposed to be very open about the thought.  But it was interesting.
Story_ID: 36809
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's during the Clinton years, and what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, after that assignment was done, I was then sent to Haiti to Operation Support Democracy as the senior enlisted advisor to Joint Task Force 160.  And the Joint Task Forces, actually, it was a--it was created out of, when Aristide was returned to power in Haiti.  And, of course, there was an uprising that occurred in that area.  The UN Peacekeeping Force was set up.  And the United States does not get involved in peacekeeping missions very often.  You know, you don't hear the United States getting involved, but actually they have been doing an awful lot.  So it was a, it was the U.S.'s turn to be the lead country in peacekeeping.  And so, so this unit set up was called the Joint Task Force 160.  And that was the organi--the command unit.  It was commanded by a Marine, a Four-Star General, General Sheehan, and I was his, his command enlisted advisor.  So this was an opportunity--and I became the first Coast Guard enlisted person to go into a joint assignment 'cause officers always went into joint assignments.  But they never sent enlisted, and so having gone to Sergeant Majors Academy, and the type of assignments that I've had, General Sheehan selected me and the fact that Operation Support Democracy actually had a bigger Coast Guard focus because in addition to the Haitian uprising, there was a Cuban-Haitian exodus coming to the United States--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and we had--
Speaker 1: Boat people crisis.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the boat people, yeah, and we, and, you know, and it was the largest--it's still on record as the largest alien migration operation since the Mariel boat lift of 1980.  So it was like a three-ring circus of things going on.  You had the uprising going on in Haiti that we had to quell.  We had Castro letting people out of prisons and, you know, (laughter) and Cubans, and giving 'em boats to come up.  And then you had Haitians who, because of just the uncertainty of what was going on, and it was, and--I mean it was a very violent time.  I mean I think--something I'd like to do one day is to write a book about Operation Support Democracy because it was, indeed, a military action that very few people know about.  I mean I wear a, one of my awards that I have is an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, which usually is awarded as a result of someone that is in a military action combat type of thing.  And, you know, when they see me with it, what did--you know, did you go to Vietnam?  I say, no, no, I was in Haiti.  Well, when did that happen?  So, but it's, but it wasn't an incident that hurt.  So I, so between 1994 and the end of '95' [1995], I was stationed down there as the Senior Enlisted Advisor.  And then, immediately after that I was transferred to, first to Governors Island, New York as the Command Master Chief for the Atlantic area.  And that's the--that now puts me in like the Number Two position of Enlisted Assignments in the Coast Guard.
Story_ID: 36810
Speaker 1: And you're back in the place where your parents met.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's back where my parents, back where my parents met and my first assignment in the Coast Guard.
Speaker 1: Governors Island.
Speaker 2: So I go back to Governors Island to become the Command Master Chief for Atlantic area.  And that's working for a Three-Star.  The Atlantic area is every Coast Guard unit East of the Mississippi, including Europe because we do have Coast Guard units in Europe.  So my responsibility was, as the Senior Enlisted Advisor, was the health, well being, care, focus on operations on the whole Eastern seaboard.  And we closed Governors Island--actually, it was May of '96' [1996] as a matter of fact.  And then I was transferred to Portsmouth, Virginia, same job.  It's just that we moved to Portsmouth, Virginia.  And then in 1998, I was selected as Master Chief of the Coast Guard.
Speaker 1: So it's '98' [1998] that you were chosen as--
Speaker 2: Right, May of '98' [1998].
Speaker 1: And well--
Speaker 2: I think today is the anniversary if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: May the 24th.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you knew that was coming by then, right?  (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, well, everybody else knew it, but, you know, I didn't wanna jinx myself.  I didn't, you know, I knew I was close, and when you become the area Master Chief, you actually are sort of the deputy or the assistant to the commandant--I mean to the Master Chief of the Coast Guard because, you know, and the Master Chief of the Coast Guard is all over the place.  And sometimes the Master Chief of the Coast Guard needs somebody to fill in.  So oftentimes, I got to fill in, so I really started learning the role of the job.  But then there's a Pacific area Master Chief that has the same responsibility as well.  But, you know, I knew that in measuring what I did, and of success, that I had a great shot.  But, well, I, I'll be honest.  I was, I did not want or feel to be cocky that, I got it, for Number One.  The person that gets selected as commandant picks you.  And Number Two, even if it's somebody that knows you and loves you, and in this case, the person who was selected as Commandant turned out to be the Three-Star Admiral that I had worked for when I was the area Master Chief before, and he was Chief of Personnel when I was in training.  So, and so I had two opportunities of working with him before, and, of course, we got to know each other pretty well.  So I mean that certainly, I gotta say is, gave me at least some advantage, but the commandant of the Coast Guard has an agenda, and because the commandant gets picked by the President, and the President has an agenda, and the President talks to all of the senior flag officers of the Coast Guard and picks the commandant based on who meets his agenda, you know.  And so sometimes that agenda doesn't necessarily match with who you pick for your Master Chief.  So it just worked in my favor, and--
Speaker 1: So who was the commandant who picked you?
Speaker 2: James Loy, L-O-Y.  And a wonderful man.  He later, after he retired, went on to become head of Transportation and Security--in fact, he stood up TSA [Transportation Security Administration], so you could either love him or hate him for that (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he's the architect of TSA.
Speaker 2: He's the architect of TSA, yes, he is.
Story_ID: 34587
Speaker 1: All right, you were telling us during the break how you got it together so fast.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Admiral [James] Loy. I think, yeah, he did a smart thing 'cause this was all done on the fly when TSA [Transportation Security Administration] had to be stood up, of course, you know, on the heels from 9/11, Admiral Loy, right as he was retiring, you know, what he did was, he looked into the Coast Guard.  He looked at people who were successful.  He would ask me if I--I didn't want any part of it (laughter).  But, and not because I didn't wanna do what he did.  I loved it, but I was, my life was focusing a little different.  But he identified people who were very capable to get things going really, really fast, and I think that, I think for the short while, I think people don't realize that, you know, the Transportation Security Administration and the whole layout of it was done in a matter of days, not weeks, months, years.  It was a matter of days 'cause Admiral Loy retired in 2002.  And, you know, went to work probably that afternoon.  TSA was already kind of stood up in name only by, by former Governor and then later becomes Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Pennsylvania--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Loy put the mechanics together and, you know, I don't think I'm exaggerating if I said he did it inside two weeks, to make things happen 'cause if you remember back in that time, right after 9/11, we had, we had private security, contractor security, and then we, and then we called the National Guard up to hold the fort, so to speak, until the TSA people were properly trained, put into place and so forth.  So--
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back to '98' [1998].  So when you're chosen as the Master Chief of the Coast Guard, so what was that like?  What were the highlights of that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, the highlights.  Well, first off, you know, I have to say that in the course of my wanting to become Master Chief of the Coast Guard, I was challenged with one question.  And that was by Hollis Stevens, the Third Master Chief of the Coast Guard, my mentor, and he says, "Well, if you wanna become Master Chief of the Coast Guard, what are you gonna do when you get there?"  And that was, that was--that made sense.  So I, so what was important to me, first of all, was education, the fact that, how I had the opportunity to earn my education while I was in the Coast Guard, and given the, given the opportunities to excel academically in the Coast Guard because of that, that we've gotta do a better job in our education program 'cause, because quite honestly, when I got into education, nobody came to me, and said, hey, we got this great education program.  Why don't you sign up and do it?  I did it because, number one, I was upset at the chief I was working for.  And the guys that were taking the correspondence courses on the ship, these guys were in college at one time, and they joined the Coast Guard 'cause they were gonna get drafted.  And they just wanted to keep the college up before they got out.  So I kind of, you know, snuck into that little crowd there, not because somebody really encouraged me to do that.  But as time went on, and like I said, as I, you know, as like standing up the education enrichment program.  The enlisted evaluation program, the over hall of the Coast Guard Training Program when I became a training manager, all that kind of became my platform when I was selected as Master Chief of the Coast Guard, that a couple of things.  One was that we not compromise on what our training programs were, to ensure that the budget issues that we were formulating and working with, that we were going to do a better job at that, and then the professionalism of our enlisted workforce as a whole.  Enlisted people were not picked to do certain types of jobs because that was what officers did.  I had an opportunity serve on a Joint Task Force and U.N Peacekeeping Mission, to serve in a study, presidential defined study.  You know, these were things that I got to do.
Story_ID: 34588
Speaker 1: And I wanted to increase that for enlisted workforce, which I did.  The other important things that were even more noteworthy was getting the, not just the enlisted workforce of the Coast Guard, but get everybody in the Coast Guard to be much more aware about the service itself, that here we are, Coast Guard, created 1790, by Alexander Hamilton under the name of the Revenue Marine Cutter Service back then.  Very few people in public know about the Coast Guard and know that, what the Coast Guard has done over the course of years and have served in every war.  When you see a picture, when you see a "D Day" invasion picture and those little landing crafts out there that are bringing the troops to shore, they were all piloted by the Coast Guard.  You know, these are things that people don't know about that or even in, during the Iraqi War, the Port Harbor Umm Qasr (ph.) (unclear) is managed by the Coast Guard.  And one of the concerns that when the Iraqi War came out was from the first Gulf War when Saddam Hussein turned on the oil pipe lines and emptied oil out into the Gulf, you know, the Coast Guard was there to clean it up.  So to prevent that from happening, the Coast Guard has that, has that area covered and taken care of.  So there's just a lot of things about my service that I think people need to know about.  And so I really beat the big drum about raising the visibility of the Coast Guard as a whole to everybody, for everybody to know that we're the fifth Armed Service.  We're actually the nation's oldest continuous military service.  We're actually older than the Navy, realistically, although the Navy does define 1775 as their date, but truth of the matter is, it was 1791 when Congress officially proclaimed the Navy the United States Navy.  So, there, I meant there's just a lot of things like that.  But, and my bragging--
Speaker 2: The 1775 is kind of a romantic kind of a thing--
Speaker 1: It's, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 2: --based on what John Paul Jones (unclear) (simultaneous)--encounter with a British ship--
Speaker 1: Exactly.  That's right.  But it was not a Navy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, the truth of the matter was it was not a Navy.  So there's a lot of things that people don't know about the service, and I made a big, big push on.
Story_ID: 34589
Speaker 1: The, probably the biggest thing that I think about the most is 911 because I was Master Chief of the Coast Guard during the time of 9/11.  And within a couple of days after the, the Twin Towers were hit, Admiral [James] Loy, myself, we were in the Secretary of Transportation at the time, and, which was Norm Manetta and a few other people, we got on a plane.  Well, of course, nobody could fly out anyway, except us.  And we went up to New York.  And this was like Day Three, I think.  And, and I got to see the destruction of Manhattan.  You know, it was still smoldering.  It was, I remember the cloud, you know, just clouds of smoke were still there.  And, you know, ash all over the place.  I mean it was, I mean it was several feet of ash.  I mean there were parts of Manhattan that was up to your knees of ash.  And it, and it--when I walked the Ground Zero area there, and I mean as I tell the story, I can still smell it.  I could still smell how it is, and, you know, and of course, I was stationed there twice before.  So I, so I'm going into familiar turf here, and I know where such and such place was and so forth.  In fact, I reenlisted in the Coast Guard on top of the World Trade Center.  So, you know, so I knew a little bit about it.  But here's a story that I don't know if many people talked about, that I keep in my head, is within a few blocks of the World Trade Center, stands this little church called the Trinity Church.  It's located Rector Street, Rector and I think it's Broadway.  I'm not sure, but Rector Street is the East-West street.  And it's a few blocks from the World Trade Center.  Now, everything around the World Trade Center was demolished, completely gone.  It was rubble, it was piled--and it was literally piles of ash.  Trinity Church, which by the way is--the graveyard of Trinity Church has the grave site of Alexander Hamilton, the father of the Coast Guard, lays and rests there.  Admiral Loy went over--and I went over there.  And we looked around and saw all the destruction of everything.  And the graveyard certainly had debris as well as ash and so forth.  And we took a look at the church.  The church stood like nothing happened to it.  It had one broken window as a result of a tree falling up against it.  And, of course, it was covered with ash, but the church stood like nothing really happened to it.
Speaker 2: It's one of the lowest structures though in the area, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, right, it's one of the lowest structures.  So you know where it is.  So we, first of all, I remember looking at that in amazement, and I walked into the church and talked to the Vicar there, and he was, you know, of course, they--the church became an aid station as well 'cause there were people still in there that were being treated, firefighters and so forth.  And as I walked out, Admiral Loy said to me, he said, he said, "Master Chief, why don't you get some people to clean up this church, okay?"  And I said, "No problem."  So I, I contacted my Command Master Chief for the New York area, and I said, "I need some volunteers."  Get me some volunteers to come up, and I want the, I want the churchyard cleaned and do as much as you can around the church and so forth.
Story_ID: 34590
Speaker 1: He got 25, 26 people together, brought 'em up.  And I says, okay, well, I'll be back in a couple of days, and we'll see how you're doing 'cause we were gonna--Admiral Loy and I were gonna go over to Pennsylvania to see the Ground Zero over there, and, of course, we were gonna come back after to go back to Washington [D.C.].  The next day I get a phone call from the Command Master Chief, and he said, "When are you coming back up here?"  I says, "I'll be back up tomorrow."  He says, "Okay."  I said, "Well, how's it coming?"  He says, "Ah, I think you'd better come see this.  I don't think I can explain it to you."  I said, "What?"  He say, I think you'd better come see this.  I said, "Is this something I need to come like right now?"  You know, he says, "No, it can wait till tomorrow."  So next morning, I was able to get a National Guard helicopter to take me up to New York, and the Master Chief met me at the helicopter port there on 34th Street and took me over to the site.  And he still wouldn't tell me what was the problem.  He says, "Ah, you just have to see it."  I said, "Okay." So anyway, I get there, and the place is spotless.  And when--first of all, let me tell you.  This, while the church was not damaged, the debris and everything that was in there, that had to be a week's worth of work, clearly had to be a week's worth of work.  There was thousands of pounds of things that needed to be moved out of there.  The, I this is two days.  The place is spotless, like nothing ever happened.  And I'm I--the first thing I did was I fell to my knees in prayer.  I mean just like, you know, I was just overcome with this whole thing that happened.  And I, and so I had to ask him, what happened?  And he points over, and he shows me stacks and stacks of garbage bags of where the ash was put in 'cause he said that they can't throw the ash out 'cause they were--it's all considered crime scene material and all that.  But it was, I mean it was, it was several feet high.  And I wish I'd had a camera to show it, but, and anyway, I said, "Well what happened?  I mean 26 of you guys did this?"  He says, "No, Master Chief.  This is what I gotta tell you."  He says, "We all came over, and we all started working.  And then all of a sudden, there were people all around that were working, doing other things, doing rescue recovery work and all that.  They stopped what they were doing, and he says, before I know it, there were close to 300, 400 people over here.  I couldn't even walk."  And he said, "Nobody said a word other than help me move this, you know, help me with this and all that.  And they cleaned it up, just like that."  And it was, he said, he said, "To be quite honest with you, Master Chief," he says, "Between my burst of tears when I saw this going on.  I also thought these people were Zombies because they didn't quite say much of anything."  And my point to that was, I says, well, you know, sometimes you gotta, sometimes you gotta give it to the Almighty here that get involved and look at the fact that there was a spiritual sense of togetherness that everybody had to have and to see a sense of belonging, a sense of, they had to see a confidence because all around them was destruction and death and a thousand reasons to feel bad.  And that little church was the one reason to make them feel good about.  And, it's like I said, it was--I, I don't know how to explain it beyond the fact that that happened.  And, you know, the people in the church were saying how this went on, but it was just amazing.  It was a true miracle that I saw at that point.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is right after 9/11?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 34591
Speaker 1: So, what else, now, as a Master Chief?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a lot of things that, you know, I mean in the line of accomplishments, I think the real accomplishments that I wanted to do is what, that I set out to do happened, was about the education and about the training.  I mean there were some creature comfort things that people wanted.  They wanted a better working uniform.  And I pushed and got that for them.  The recognition programs that we had needed to be enhanced, to be more supportive by--throughout the Coast Guard, as well as other places.  And I was able to do that.  But I, I kind of, I kind of look back and say, well, I think the biggest thing that I wanna say that, what I accomplished was, you know, I just kept the flame burning of all the guys that were before me that did remarkable jobs, that I wanted to--it's kind of like walking in my brother's footsteps.  I mean I never, I never set a goal to wanna be better than him.  I always set my goal to sort of walk in the same manner as he did.  And I think that's kind of what I felt I did during my tenure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, your leaving, did it correspond to Commander [James] Loy's?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Yes, and that's kind of how all the positions are done, is that you leave with the commandant.  You come in with the new commandant and you leave with the commandant.
Speaker 1: All right, so he left in 2002?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, and that's when you left as well.  Now, was this, the photo we have of the, of you doing the push-ups back there, reflected back on the push-up incident.  Did that happen when you left or when you arrived?
Speaker 2: It was on my day of retirement.
Speaker 1: Day of retirement, okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, if I'd thought about it on the day I had started, I would have done it.  I didn't think about that then.  But, yeah, if I had thought about it, I would have done it the day I started as well as the day I retired.  But all my, at my retirement ceremony which typically is held where you're at, which was Washington, D.C., I wanted to hold my retirement ceremony where it started.  So I went back to Cape May, New Jersey, and I don't know, if it was just on the part of the Coast Guard, but people understood why I wanted to do my retirement ceremony there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is lifetime mission fulfilled here.  And so in 2002, and you're able to do 50 pushups there on the spot?
Speaker 2: I did (laughter).  I can't do 'em now (laughter).
Story_ID: 34592
Speaker 1: All right, so you go out to California.  Now, you teach at UC-Berkeley as an adjunct professor, teaching the philosophy of ethics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and how that happened was, well, you know, let's back up to that day on Rector Street.  And probably it was about the end of September of 2001.  You know, it just stayed with me about how that all happened, and, you know, I was--I never defined myself to be a, an exceptionally religious person.  You know, the days of my grandmother, you know, with all the churchgoing, it kind of sort of wore me out (laughter) so to speak.  But I mean I was, I've been very spiritual throughout my life, but to witness an incident like that, it kind of caused me an opportunity to take some pause.  So, as I was about to retire, and, of course, Admiral [James] Loy was the first person that said, we're gonna keep this team together, and you're coming over to TSA [Transportation Security Administration] with me, and I told him that I would love to stay with him, but I couldn't.  And I cited my reason which was that event on Rector Street, which he never questioned it after that.  He knew what it was.  So what I really wanted to do was go to--I wanted to go to, I wanted to go to divinity school.  And I, it wasn't as much as I--that my thought was, oh, I wanna be a minister.  I wanted to take a break, as--primarily.  I wanted, and I cannot believe that, what thing do you take a break with but go back to school.  But, I guess that's me, I guess.  So I, so I enrolled into Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, which is a ecumenical seminary and multi-denomination religion, and that was kind of what I wanted.  I really wanted to have an academic slash theological understanding of religion.  So I took that opportunity during those two years.  So, but as it happened, when I started, when I got over there--actually, before I left, I get a phone call from the head of the philosophy department at University of California, Berkeley, who was retired Air Force Colonel, and he ran the philosophy department at the Air Force Academy, called me up.  I didn't know the guy from Adam.  He, he--but he knew me.  And he called me and says, hey, I'm taking over this job at Berkeley.  Rumor has it you're coming out here to live.  And I says, yeah, I'm gonna go to school for a couple of years and--and he says, well, how would you like to teach, teach a class?  Oh, I don't know, I--he said, well, it's a class that'll work very well with what you're going to school for.  And I said, and so he says, the U-C Berkeley had just changed its policy that the ethics was going to be taught as a prerequisite.  And they moved it from the School of Business into the School of Philosophy.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, I could, we could make some jokes about that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but we won't, we won't do it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, so.  So he asked if I would become one of his adjunct professors, and so I--it was a kind of a kick-the-tires kind of thing.  So, yeah, I'll do it, you know.  And I had a lot of fun, and the good news of it is, is that when I was gonna do that, then it actually got me out of two classes that I needed (laughter) at GTU [Graduate Theological Union] 'cause they said, oh, you know, you gotta do facilitation and so forth, but if you're teaching philosophy of ethics, then, you know, there's your credit.  So, it just blended nicely, and I got paid for it too, so (laughter) it worked out.
Story_ID: 34593
Speaker 1: Okay, now, soon thereafter or at the same time, you start as executive director, part-time of the Haley's Comet Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a, and that was kind of one of those pick-up jobs that I--I was doing a little bit of it.  I wasn't executive director then, but actor, John Amos, who I actually met through Alex Haley, right, you know, of course, right after "Roots" was done and so forth, Alex called me one day.  And he says, hey, I need a favor from you.  He says I, he says a friend of mine, John Amos, he's a big-time sailor, and he's having a problem, he was buying a boat or something, and he was having trouble with getting it registered, and he wanted to know if I can call him.  I said, well, Alex, I don't know anything about registering boats.  He said, yeah, but can you just talk to him and find somebody that can help him out?  I said, sure.  So that's how John and I first, first kind of met.  And that was like 1990 or so.  So we kind of traded--and I helped him out.  I, as it turned out, I actually knew the answer and was able to help him out.  So right after the time I became--well, when Alex Haley died, I was one of the--in '92' [1992], I was one of the pallbearers at his funeral.  And that was the next time I saw John Amos.  Actually, that was the first time I physically saw John Amos.  And we had, gosh, we kind of talked for quite a bit and stayed in touch.  And then, and he was talking about building this organization for kids 'cause he said, he says, you know--and he is, he's a, he has another sailboat now, but he had a, he had this sailboat that he was fixing up.  It was an old sailboat, and so he thought by getting kids to help with him doing it, he said, it's cheap labor, and it keeps the kids off the street.  He was getting these kids out of Newark to come and do it.  And as it turned out, he found that what it was also doing was teaching kids about teamwork and, you know, attention to detail and working together, you know, those kinds of things that he thought, why don't I create an organization to do that?  So during my tenure as Master Chief of the Coast Guard, he kind of said, hey, I'm gonna do this, and he had his wife be the first executive director of it.  And he says, well, this is just a hold until you come in.  I said, well, I--John, I'm gonna do other things too.  He says, and not a full-time job, just need you, you know, mostly during the summers, I need you to help me with fund-raising and that kind of--I said, okay, I can do that.  So, so after I retired, I took that on, and it was part time (unclear), (laughter) part time in the sense of that, part time in definition, but there were times I had to do a lot of work and help.  And he would, he would fly me out to certain places, like, for example, one of his big contributors is the guy who owns West Marine.  It's a big Marine supply company and so forth.  And he wanted me to meet with him and talk with him and so forth.  So we kind of met with him, talked with him, and he became a big contributor to Haley's Comet Foundation.  And then I, and then also during my time as Master Chief for the Coast Guard, I'm sorry, as--yeah, as Master Chief for the Coast Guard while John had it going on, I would get some help from some of my coasty friends that would come out and teach seamanship and sailing skills to the kids.  So we were working this thing quite well, and after I retired, I took it on for a few years until he hired somebody who became a full-time job.  And he's since have backed off on it, and he's doing that same kind of thing, but not as that foundation now.  He's working the National Guard.  He actually rolled that in with--the National Guard has a youth development program, and John was in the National Guard.  He was in the New Jersey National Guard.  So he's been working with them primarily.
Story_ID: 34594
Speaker 1: Okay, I never knew he was in New Jersey National Guard, yeah.  All right, so then in 2004, you went to something called "Monster Worldwide".
Speaker 2: Monster Worldwide.  That's the story about that, and actually, I was finishing up divinity school.  I went down to do my summer missionary work, down in Haiti, and actually, I wasn't sure what I was gonna do after that.  But I actually thought about doing some, doing more of this missionary nonprofit-type work.  I was still trying to figure out what I was gonna do.  So anyway, I get a call--no, I didn't get a call.  I get an e-mail from the president of Monster, sends me an email.  I'm down in Cap-Haitien, Haiti.  And he says, hey, I'd like to talk to you.  I got your name from somebody, mentioned the name of somebody.  And he said, Monster just purchased the website "Military.com" and we're gonna turn it into a business model where Monster is going to be involved with helping transitioning service members and veterans find jobs.  And your name was given to me as someone who would be the right guy that can kind of run that.  And I said, well, this sounds too much like a business type thing.  That's not, I'm not into that.  So thanks, but no thanks and kind of let it go at that.  Follow up email after that was, well, can you--you know, let's sit down and talk.  Can we at least talk about it because it's a little bit more than that, and trust me, I think it might be something that you might wanna do.  And the guy was becoming a pain in the neck.  I mean after about the third email, after I told him, I says, I--in all caps, I email him back.  Fine, if you wanna talk to me, I'm Cap-Haitien, Haiti.  I'll be here till the end of August.  Come see me.  Oh, the end of September, come see me.  And it was all in caps.  I figured I'll never hear from the guy again.  About a week goes by, and I'm working the food distribution warehouse that's run by the UN [United Nations].  And one of the workers come running over to me with a card in his hand, and, you know, they called me Reverend down there.  He said, Reverend, Reverend, I got a card from the Monster.  He wants to talk to you. (laughter).
Story_ID: 34595
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So the worker, you know, he runs in, and he gives me this business card.  And I'm like you gotta be kidding me.  This guy really came down here.  Well, of course, the guy is the owner, and he's got his own plane and everything.  You know, once you think about that.  Wait a minute, the guy is a billionaire.  (Laughter) So, but the fact that he came down to see me, I said, well, this must be serious.  So we sat down, and I invited him in my office, which was stacks of rice (laughter).  And we sat there, and we chatted for a little while, and I made a deal with him that I would do it for about six months 'cause I said, okay, I'll see how this goes.  I'll do it for about six months, and if nothing works, then that'll be fine.  He said that, no, that's fine.  I just need to get this off the ground.  Well, I stayed there for seven years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So obviously, it went very well.  And it's a very interesting job in that, well, first it was building the, like I said, the business model for Monster, which is pretty good on the area of, you know, posting your resumes and working with companies.  What was missing was educating companies about the value of veterans, and having the need to have people who served in the military and what they can do and so forth, and looking at folks that has certain types of skills that companies were looking--or spending money on training people for that.  He had people already that were doing that.  So I got to do an awful lot that I felt that worked very well in support of our veteran community.  I was, I also testified before Congress, both the Senate and the House Veteran Affairs Committees, to talk about veteran, hiring veteran skills.  One of the things that we did at Monster, we created a, an online tool called "Military Translator".  And the tool was to, for people who were in the military, they type in their specialty skill code, 'cause you have either letters or numbers and so forth.  And then up pops what the civilian equivalency of that is.  Now, such a tool exists, but it exists in the way of mostly on paper, or when online tools that do exist to that were not very exhaustive in defining what the type of work that the transitioning service member of veterans were doing.  So we kind of mastered that during my time at Monster, and, which I considered as probably one of the, the biggest accomplishments and so forth over the course of my seven years of working there.  And I had a great time there.
Story_ID: 34596
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So from Monster, you went on to work for, let's see--
Speaker 2: APCEA.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, this is where we are now.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, so 2011, you started here at AFCEA, and explain what this organization is?
Speaker 2: AFCEA stands for Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.  It's a nonprofit professional development trade association that focuses in the area of science and technology for the defense, intelligence and Homeland Security communities.  The organization has been around for sixty-seven years.  It was founded in 1946 by a gentleman who is one of the cofounders of National Broadcasting Corporation.  He later went off into the War, during World War II and as a Brigadier General, was a technology officer that perfected the use of microwave in military operations.  When he got--after the War, and he went back into the private sector, what he wanted to do was try to keep the dialogue of industry, academia and government going together because in his words, the success of many of the military technology that occurred during World War II was as a result of having a free and open dialogue where research and development from the industry and academic end and working with government, produced such successes.  And so, therefore, he created this organization, AFCEA, and in our sixty-seven years of existence, we've been very involved with doing conferences, workshops, professional development courses, in all areas that tie into information technology for the defense intelligence and for Homeland Security.  My job is, I'm vice president of the Homeland Security department, and my job really is all about everything that does with--that goes on with Homeland Security.  The connection with the department of Homeland Security, emergency management, emergency response issues, critical infrastructure, cyber security, risk assessments, those are just, those are those I can think off the top of my head 'cause this job changes every day (laughter).  But I, I'm involved with working with both industry and with government and academia to address those areas.  And we kind of function a little bit like a think-tank 'cause some of the things that we do are research and development areas.  And those things that I mentioned, which are think tanks, as I like to call 'em, are managed by a committee.  We have a cyber committee, and a Homeland Security Committee.  The makeup's of these committees are people from the profession who are both government as well as industry, and academia.  And try to solve issues and concerns.  For example, just this past week, we worked with the, with Georgetown University Law School to address cyber security as it relates to law, as it relates to legal issues.  Cyber security is, of course, is one of the up and coming types of technology professions across the board.  I mean truth of the matter is it's really been around.  We're just giving it a new name.  When you think back to the days of when radio first started, you know, you had legal issues involving radio transmission and frequencies and communications.  So we've just sort of moved on into the higher level of technology as it address with information technology.  So those are some of the things that I work on.  It's fascinating work 'cause it's--I am not a geek, by definition, but I like innovation, and I like, as we go forward in technology in the kind of things that we do.
Story_ID: 34597
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, I have to ask this.  Did you go to Haiti in 2011 after the earthquake?
Speaker 2: Twenty-ten [2010].
Speaker 1: Twenty-ten [2010], okay.
Speaker 2: The answer is, yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went back, actually, I went in March of 2010 as a volunteer.  The International Rescue Committee, who is one of the organizations that I, during my time when I was in seminary, that I had worked with.  And I was doing my summer missionary work with, were looking for volunteers to come down to help with the management of the relief process.  And I volunteered and spent three weeks down there.
Speaker 1: So it seems like you've developed sort of a bond with the people of Haiti in terms of going down and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, and, well, being stationed there certainly has started to help to build that development of a bond.  And the historical presence of Haiti as a whole in terms of, of a country that, you know, when you, as it dates back to its infancy, it's just had so many problems of sorts.  But, but as an African descendant, you know, it's, it is a little piece of my home, as it is with any of us that are, that have African ancestry, to do what we can to help out.  I mean so I've kind of taken somewhat of an adoption so to speak, in working with Haitian community.
Speaker 1: Okay, and as a--and I heard you mention, I guess what's inferred is that you have a ministry, you know, beyond what you actually do at work?  (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'm--my faith is Unitarian Universalist, and we have a number of defined ministry programs that we are involved with.  I consider myself a community service-type minister, working with our Unitarian Universalist service committee which does outreach to underprivileged areas, both in the U.S. and as well as overseas.  And I kind of balance both of that because an awful lot needs to be done here at home too, and I really pay attention to the kind of things that we do here at home.  I volunteer once a month.  I serve as a, as a trauma response minister for the Northern Virginia Trauma Response Ministry Team.  And what that means is, is that from 6:00 o'clock Friday evening till 6:00 o'clock Monday morning, I am on call to work with any number of trauma response areas such as the Red Cross will contact me to help to, perhaps if there was a need for pastoral care from a family that's been, you know, burned out from a fire.  The local police, fire department could contact me for any number of reasons, anywhere from talking to a grieving family of some form of devastation or even to the police and to the firefighters as well that may have gotten involved in some kind of a traumatic thing.  For example, finding a dead body, you know, which during my time in the Coast Guard, I've seen a few, and, you know, there are some concerns that rests with that.  So I, so it's, it's kind of an opportunity.  This is my best giveback that I have where, and like I say, I do it as a volunteer that I'm able to take everything that I have learned in my life and, and use it at any given time during that, what I call my "duty weekend".  And it's, it gets busy.  I mean I, sometimes the, I'll do a crisis action hotline call.  I'll, you know, the fire department will call me and say, you know, can you come down and cheer the folks up, and, you know, it can be--it varies.  And it's different every month when I do the job.
Story_ID: 34598
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, you have been here for, what two years now, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, coming up on two years.
Speaker 1: APCEA, do you have a goal of some other occupation before you retire or from here or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I think, you know, the next goal in life for me, at least from a retirement standpoint, I'm probably gonna be continuing to do what I'm doing now, and that's--if there's anything that I'll probably look at next, I--the volunteer ministry work, I'll probably do more of it, but it will remain volunteer.  I don't think I'm in a position nor do I want to make it as a vocation.  And I'm financially okay.  I, you know, working has now become a hobby now, which is a fun thing.  I enjoy what I do here.  I, I enjoy working at APCEA because as I mentioned about what we do in terms of focusing on the science and technology, but what I didn't mention is that we also generate scholarship programs in the science, technology, engineering and math.  Again, and I love this part because this is a great giveback because we do this program from kindergarten all the way to college.  We'll raise money for teachers, science teachers in grade school to promising individuals working on their Masters and doctorate programs.  And it's all across the board, and I think that what always gives me a shot in the arm, and I enjoy what I do, is when we present a scholarship to somebody or some, some event or so forth.  In a couple of weeks, we have a team of students coming up from Arlington, Texas that are being honored at a science event in Washington, D.C.  And we're gonna give them a grant for--mostly because of the things of what they do, and, of course, they need the money to continue with the work that they're doing in innovation.  But I would say for me, as a good friend of mine always said, "Living the dream".  I think I'm already living it, that, you know, there's nothing else out there right now.
Story_ID: 34599
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Have you ever thought about running for office?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the answer's no (laughter). I have thought about--I, I don't like to be too restrictive.  I think my purpose is really to try to help to influence others in the manner that I'm doing in.  I've got nothing against politicians but with the process, I don't think it's gonna sit very well with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could, if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: No, no, you know, I think, I think if--'cause every time, I think about that.  And I've been asked that question before.  But when I think about it, that mistake, as traumatic as it was at that time, was a very valuable learning experience that led to something even better the next time.  I mean if I could have designed it myself, it wouldn't come out that way.  So I mean it's, yeah, I've made some mistakes, things didn't go right.  But it's what happened after the bump that has been truly amazing and remarkable that, I don't think I would have changed it.  You know, the good news is, the mistakes that I've made in the past, they didn't kill anybody, they didn't hurt anybody or anything like that.  So, but so that said, is that they were mistakes that certainly warranted the opportunity to learn from.
Story_ID: 34600
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, as we sit here today, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, certainly concerns that I have within the community is, is the sense of understanding of about embracing our history, heritage and traditions.  I think we have, we're losing a little bit of that.  As I grew up into--you know, particularly, in the '60's [1960s] when it was just kind of like, it was somewhat thrust upon us by way of some of the advocacy may have been a little rough, but for the most part, the approach to where--about who we are, and what we do and how we make a tremendous, positive, progressive impact on this country, certainly should be widely noticed and to continue to promote that.  I see that kind of backsliding a little bit, and I think it's partly because the African community, the African American community today, as we positively progress in a sense of diversity, equal opportunity and so forth, that, you know, you do have to remember where you came from, you know, maybe not individually, but collectively as a whole.  For example, I think of my parents.  I think of my grandparents, you know.  I think of the opportunities that they did not have that I have today and to be reminded of that.  So I embrace even more of the value of the successes that I have, and why it's important for me to understand that.  Coming from a large family where we didn't--we didn't have a lot.  We didn't have a lot of money.  We didn't have a lot of anything, and today, that I'm, you know, I don't have to worry as much financially as my folks had to worry about back then.  It--how it has made me stronger that I, you know, how I--I don't throw my money away.  I don't do ridiculous things and so forth, and, but more importantly, is that I don't get caught up into myself to feel that I gotta be better than somebody else.  The, some of the things that are happening in the African community--African American community today, advocates and promotes the being better than someone else or being better than what your past is.  If anything, whatever negative part of your past that you look it, embrace it with the understanding that how you've overcome it, and how you've moved forward.  Those are the, those are the things that I would like to see more of that happening.  Now, how do you get there?  Well, I think it, a good part of that is, is mentoring, is the fact that people like myself that have achieved whatever our defined American dream is or was, is that, you know, we've gotta, we gotta reach back.  It's like a good friend, Al McMichael always said about, you know, giving people a hand up, not a hand out.  And we've got to promote that hand up atmosphere, and get people to start paving their path.  That's how I did it.  I mean that, you know, and my story, it was about--it sounded like to some degree, people gave me things.  But no, what they gave me was an opportunity.  And it was up to me to make something out of that opportunity.  So that's what people have to have, is that give them the opportunity, and then to take full, 100 percent advantage of it and then pass it on, you know, take that same opportunity and move it on.
Story_ID: 34601
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we always ask this question too, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what would you consider to be your legacy today?
Speaker 2: My personal, core values are people, passion and performance, the three P's, that's my--that's--and if I were to define my legacy, if I were to define my mantra, my ego, it would be those three P's.  The sense of belonging, and involvement and working with people.  Passion is to focus on the sense of belonging about our history, heritage and traditions.  And then that history, heritage is about, is reminding ourselves about where we've been and how we've come along.  And like I said, embrace 'em.  You know, you know, I still to this day, still embrace, although, you know, like my family still said, please don't talk about it.  But I've been out there in the backyard at 7575 Cameron Avenue, Detroit, playing all nine innings all by myself, and vividly feel like I was there, gave me that sense of history, gave me that sense of wanting to have the passion of how I felt, what winning was.  And, you know, winning a game is one thing, but winning the opportunities that you seek is even greater.  And performance is probably something that I take more from the comment of my old boss, Admiral Jim Loy, "Preparation equals performance.  Prepare well, so you can perform well."  You don't learn how to be successful overnight, and it doesn't come to you by osmosis.  You've got to practice.  You've got to study, you've got to learn.  This is where that education part hits me more.  I mean, you know, I never set out to get a doctorate degree, or to get any kind of degree, to be quite honest with you, other than the fact that I only wanted a degree 'cause my brother had one.  And I wanted--and had I not gotten into my own ditch to start working through, I probably would have missed--I would have missed an enormous opportunity of life by being able to understand what performance was.  So, so that's my legacy.  It's, it's the three P's, and did I live 'em and did I accomplish what those three P's are?  I think I have.  I'm very satisfied with--if a piano hits me on the head when I walk out the door, you know, there's nothing to look back and say, God, I wish I should a done.  I've done it.
Story_ID: 34602
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you told us about your siblings and your parents.  Tell us about your children and I don't know if you're married now, but--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not married now.  And I don't mind talking about my marriages.  I had, my first marriage, you know, it, my sweetheart I had in high school, and they--the unfortunate problem with that was I had the--I was in this desire drive to do the things I wanted to do, and it meant not living in Detroit.  And that, of course, became an issue, and we parted company very amicably.  There was, you know, that was a good thing.  It was just, it was no problem.  And we had, you know, we still--you know, definitely, continued to stay in touch, the raising of my son, which my son is getting married on June 8, which he's pretty happy about.  And I'm very happy for him, and I'm gonna become an instant grandfather 'cause his fiancee has a 10-year old son.  And I'm pretty excited about that.  My, and what my son does today, he is a information technology help desk assistant, you know, when people have problems with their computer and so forth.  He works at Sharp Electronics here in the Washington, D.C. area.  He's an Army veteran.  He served four years in the Army, served in my dad's [Thomas Carter Patton] old regiment.  He was with the 306 Engineering Battalion of the 82nd Airborne.  In fact, he didn't know it at the time he joined the Army when he went into that unit, that it was his grandfather's unit.  And, of course, when he found that out, it was just, you know, he was very proud of--and he's still very proud of him.  He, you can find his car on the street because his license plate is 306, you know (laughter), and that's what that means.  So he's, he's been great.  He's, did things that Army recruiting commercials tell you to do.  He went in the Army, did his time, got out, went to college, got his degree, and moved on with his life and doing good.
Story_ID: 34603
Speaker 1: My daughter is from my second marriage.  Her mom died just before I became Master Chief of the Coast Guard.  It, she died in January of 1998 of a heart ailment.  She had heart problems for quite some time, and I was gonna get out of the Coast Guard.  I mean in fact, I was right on the heels of them selecting me as Master Chief of the Coast Guard and I--'cause at the time, my daughter who is now 27, she was, let's say, '85' [1985], '95' [1995], yeah, she was 12 going--yeah, she had just turned 12, going on 13.  I, you know, I'm, here I am a single parent.  I'm gonna be taking care of her.  And I was gonna get out.  And my wife's family, as was--my wife had said to me all along 'cause we kind of knew that, or at least two or three years ahead, that she was not going to last very long because of her ailments.  But she made it clear to me that I wasn't gonna stop my dream.  And I kind of blew her off like, yeah, okay, well, when you're gone, I--you don't know what I'm gonna do (laughter).  And, but being that adamant about it, and her family, you know, they kind of circled the wagons around me, and, you know, 'cause a lot of people didn't know that during my tenure as Master Chief of the Coast Guard, that I did it as a single parent. Some people did, but I didn't make it--it wasn't a big deal.  You know, I had great support, and then my son, who had gotten out of the Army, you know, moved in and so he took up the gap there too, which was good because he got to know his sister a little more.  So, that worked out.  I remarried in 2004 after I finished divinity school and moved back to Washington, D.C. area and a lady that I had actually served with in the Coast Guard.  And unfortunately, it was a case of just careers just didn't match.  She had some very significant focused areas of things that she wanted to do, and I had things that I was doing.  And we just weren't seeing each other, period, and that was--actually, what brought that on.  And so it was a question of being real and honest to ourselves, and, you know, do you wanna have this long distance relationship or (unclear) you know, just chalk it up for--we thought it would work, and it didn't.  So, you know, it didn't, but, you know, and again, another person who I'm, you know, very fond of, and we stay very close together and so forth.  So.
Story_ID: 34604
Speaker 1: All right, now, is there anything we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, not anything else we need to discuss.  No, I think I gave it all to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I did.
Speaker 1: Well, we thank you.  Now, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as, you know, my favorite saying is, "It's all good", and I would like to be remembered when those three words, kind of encompass what "it's all good" means to me, are the things that I, not just have accomplished, but the things that I've loved in life, and that, and clearly, you know, I go back to "people, passion and performance".  That kind of ties into that.  But the people part, this love for people.  I mean it's, sometimes it's to a fault to some degree.  Not that it, not to the point that I've had people use me, I mean everybody goes through that, but it, but to the point of where, you know, sometimes I become a little over extended because I wanna, feel like I gotta help everybody.  But that's me, I kinda like that.  I mean it's--I'm not happy if I'm not working or being around people and so forth, which is quite odd because my, you know, as a child, my pastime was doing a lot of things by myself (laughter), which I still kind of do that a little bit of thing.  Now, I don't play the baseball games anymore.  But (laughter), but I, I'd like to just be remembered for what I say to everybody, and I have a big sign in my office that says, "It's all good".
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 34605
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, tell us about this first one.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, that's me at the helm of the Coast Guard cutter, Capstan, which is a small harbor tug, and I was working with the, the chief who is in the orange, I'm sorry, the yellow.  He's the officer in charge, Chief Ares Mendy, from what I remember.  And in back of him, in the orange is the operations officer from Coast Guard Group, New York.  During my time as Master Chief of the Coast Guard, I got a chance to go around and visit a lot of units and, of course, I wanted to get underway.  So they let me drive the boats every now and then.
Speaker 1: Okay, about what year is this?
Speaker 2: Oh, this picture was 1999. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a picture of my mom, Elizabeth [Mary Ellington Patton], myself and my young son, Nick [Patton], who I would say that picture was taken, 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Oh, it's on the back, oh. '77' [1977].  Oh, good, okay, 1977 (laughter)
Speaker 2: Okay, is there something on the back of that or not?
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, this is a picture of me in the Command Center at Coast Guard Air Station Detroit, where I operated the communications center.  So one of the few pictures of me working in communications.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of me at recruiting, Coast Guard Recruiting office, Chicago, and that was 1976.  I think that's a 1976 picture.
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977], okay, 1977.
Speaker 1: This gentleman to my left is the third Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard, Hollis Stevens, one of the people who I have credited with my success in the Coast Guard.  Our picture was taken, actually before I became Master Chief of the Coast Guard.  So it's just, it was great--it's great to see that picture there, but that's 19--
Speaker 2: Ninety seven [1997].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety seven [1997].
Speaker 2: This is '94' [1994]--
Speaker 1: Oh, '94' [1994], okay.  Yeah, I know I wasn't Master Chief of the Coast Guard then.  I was too thin (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy which I was the only Coast Guard person in that class out of a class of 406 people, El Paso, Texas, and that was taken in 19--
Speaker 1: Ninety-seven [1997].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-seven [1997].
Speaker 1: That's my boot camp picture.  The company was called Tango 85, and that picture was taken in 1972.
Speaker 2: That picture was taken 1990--no 2002.  In fact, I know exactly when that was taken, in 2002 at the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter, Blackthorn Memorial in St. Petersburg, Florida.  I was the keynote speaker at that event.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, that's my program for my ceremony for my retirement, October of 2002.
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976] is when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when I re-enlisted.
Speaker 1: So you should say it though 'cause you've got a mic.  I can't--they can't hear me.
Speaker 2: This picture is my first re-enlistment in the Coast Guard taken at Coast Guard Air Station Detroit.  I was actually in a helicopter about 2,000 feet up, and that was in, in fact, that was in April of 1976.
Speaker 1: This was the, this is the class at Loyola University.  My group class that we were part of the counseling psychology symposium, and that was taken in 1978. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: That's me in a helicopter in 1999.  From the looks of the background there, I was probably visiting Coast Guard units down in the Caribbean area.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the Coast Guard recruiting team in Chicago, Illinois in 1977?
Speaker 2: Right.
