Speaker 1: This is my photographer, Scott Stearns.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You've met him.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: My name is [HistoryMaker] Randall Pinkston.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or as you all used to call me, Willie Randall Pinkston, but (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: So, what do you--are you familiar with The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Just a little.
Speaker 1: A little. Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Well nutshell, it's a nonprofit organization founded in 1999 by the lady you just met upstairs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson. It is now the nation's largest collection of video oral histories of African Americans, nine thousand hours, about three thousand people--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --collected in 180 cities. It's the first large scale attempt to capture testimonies about the black experience in America since the Works Progress Administration [Work Projects Administration]--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --enslaved narratives, the audio recordings back in the, in the '30s [1930s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know about them.
Speaker 1: Yes. So--
Speaker 2: So, I, I know some of that history actually.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And now that you're saying that--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --my mother actually took some of that history.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She recorded some of the--
Speaker 2: No, she, she--well, she wrote at least her, her grandfather's [Andrew W.E. Bassette, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Grahpa [ph.] as she called him. And I know it because she was supposed to ask him about slavery and he said, he refused to talk about it.
Speaker 1: But he remembered it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she did it, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you--is that when--
Speaker 2: In the twent- the '30s [1930s], it would be, thirty--'40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: So, so your--
Speaker 2: Mother was the--
Speaker 1: --mother, that's your--that's Ruth's sister?
Speaker 2: It's Rachel's sister (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rachel, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Rachel's sister.
Speaker 2: Ida [Ida Bassette Haddon].
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Rachel Noel's sister?
Speaker 2: Right. Yes. She actually did that and she told me that story. I had forgotten about that. And, and so he said, "These are, these are times that I, I just am not going to talk about."
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask you about that again later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because right now I'm just doing this introductory thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: (Unclear). So, anyway it--The HistoryMakers has digital archives and when our interview is done you will get access to it--
Speaker 2: Oh terrific.
Speaker 1: --and you can access it on your smartphone or laptop, whatever. It's also available at twenty-four colleges and universities, including Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Chicago Public Library [Chicago, Illinois]. And the idea, Dr. Richardson's primary idea is that this collection can be used by researchers and authors you know as they want first person accounts of their lives and their family. So, that's what The HistoryMakers is all about.
Speaker 2: Terrific (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any questions?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Okay. Scott, are we up and running?

Story_ID: 622320
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father. His name, his place and birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: His name was Wallace James Haddon [Wallace J. Haddon]. He was born in Abbeville, South Carolina. And I believe he was born in 1922.
Speaker 1: His occupation?
Speaker 2: He was a dentist.
Speaker 1: Do you know where he attended dental school?
Speaker 2: Yes, he attended Howard University [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And undergraduate as well?
Speaker 2: South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Right across the street from Claflin College [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes. He attended South Carolina State with his mother [Ursula Gray Haddon] (laughter).
Speaker 1: His mother was in college at the same time he was in college (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the same time. Can you imagine?
Speaker 1: We'll, we'll circle back on that. What stories do you remember your father sharing about his family when--with you about his childhood, his upbringing? What stories resonate in your mind?
Speaker 2: So, he had a very rich childhood, but his mother went to work in New York City [New York, New York] in the summers. She taught school as he was growing up, an older person. But she worked in New York City in the summers.
Speaker 1: What did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, she--he stayed with relatives during the summer.
Speaker 1: His--do you know what--grandparents or--?
Speaker 2: No, grandparents were dead and his father [James Haddon] was dead. His father was a railroad attendant, fireman and traveled and died very early of pneumonia.
Speaker 1: So a--so that, was that the--was that an unusual job for an African American at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. He was the first generation of African Americans that had that job.
Speaker 1: Because they had been prior to then port- Pullman car porters if they had--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think before that they--not anything.
Speaker 1: Or not at all.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, these are the people who stoked the fires for the engines.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Not a, not a pleasant job but a well paying job.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, he had a pretty hard childhood.
Speaker 2: Well, just give me--some parents have a tendency to tell the same story over and over again.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What was one of those stories from your dad?
Speaker 1: I think, mostly he talked about being bossed by his older sisters [Georgia Haddon Maith and Anniese Haddon Burton] (laughter)--
Speaker 2: What did he say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because they were older and because my grandmother had to work hard, she left them in charge a lot, lot.
Speaker 2: How many siblings were there in--
Speaker 1: He had two older sisters.
Speaker 2: Two older sis- was he the youngest?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Did they also attend school, attend college?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: South Carolina State?
Speaker 1: I'm not positive where one of them went. I think so. The second one was at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you know his--your, your aunts?
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew them well. They were--one was a school teacher and one was a librarian at, in Baltimore [Maryland].
Story_ID: 622321
Speaker 1: So describe your father's [Wallace J. Haddon] stature, his style, his voice.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was 6'1" and a, a large man. He had a booming voice. When he came in at night you knew when he was coming home. He was a dentist so he worked long hours but he was very fun to be with when he, when he got at home, if he wasn't too tired. If not, we knew to kind of be quiet so that he could rest.
Speaker 1: So, it's you and your brother [James Haddon]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did he do things with you? Did he take you to the park? Did he go bike riding? Did he play cards, board games?
Speaker 2: We had vacations that were connected to the dental association, the National Dental Association. So, that's actually my recollection of summers, when he would take off, we would travel by car usually to wherever we were going for the National Dental Association. And that was the time when he really relaxed. He played golf. That wasn't including us, and it was clear that he enjoyed doing that with some of his friends. But I think like many other families the, the most fun that we had, on the weekends at least when it wasn't the summertime and when he wasn't involved in the traveling for the summer, was with my mother [Ida Bassette Haddon], yeah. She spent a lot of time with us.
Speaker 1: We're going to get to your mom in a minute. But let me ask you a little bit more about your dad.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did he sing, did he play an instrument?
Speaker 2: He actually played the piano once. When we bought a piano, he sat down and played a, a religious hymn and that was the last time I ever heard him play. But he had played all, I--apparently as a, as a young child but he was not someone who used the piano.
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: My mother was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did anyone encourage him to play again?
Speaker 2: He wasn't the kind that you would encourage if it was clear he wasn't interested, but he just wanted to tell us that he actually did know how to do this.
Speaker 1: And it sounded fine (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he showed it, yeah. Well, not so good but--
Speaker 1: But you recognized the hymn?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I understand that he was involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: What did he do with the NAACP?
Speaker 2: He was the president of the chapter for I'm sure twenty-five years, thirty years. He was very much committed to civil rights. Moving north at an early age, for me, when we were, when, when I was five meant that we basically were uprooted and, but--and moved to a town where he thought he could thrive as a dentist.
Story_ID: 622322
Speaker 1: You were born in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes. He--while he [Haddon's father, Wallace J. Haddon] was in dental school.
Speaker 1: While he was in dental school?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, the move north happened after he graduated from dental school?
Speaker 2: After he graduated from dental school and worked a couple of years.
Speaker 1: In, in the Washington area?
Speaker 2: Actually he was working in Virginia for a couple of years I think.
Speaker 1: Do--I know you were a little girl then but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --do you recall whose decision it was to go to Passaic, New Jersey?
Speaker 2: I know that he went north to New Jersey because there were a number of his classmates from Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] who were also locating there or who had lived there as children or at least young adults. And so, he knew that it was a place that he could have connections, both medical doctors and, and dentists. And so, my recollection was that he went up for several weeks before we did and looked around and was actually introduced to a doctor, I'm trying to remember his name, but a doctor who put him up in, in his house and showed him around Passaic. And it was because he had done some, some checking out of the North Jersey [New Jersey] area. His friends had mostly lived in the more southern part of New Jersey, Red Bank area and so, he thought that moving closer to New York City [New York, New York] would be of advantage. And I also know that there were at least a couple of very thriving factories, which had contract relationships with dentists and, and doctors and so he went for that reason to Passaic because U.S. Rubber [United States Rubber Company; Uniroyal] was there and a couple of the asbestos case factories as I recall were there.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't too far from Paterson [New Jersey], which had--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Wright-Paterson [sic. Curtiss Wright Corporation]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --airplane--
Speaker 2: Yes. And Paterson had many more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --factories than, than he, he saw in, in Passaic. But Forstmann Wool [Forstmann Woolen Company] was also there. So it was a really thriving city when he moved there. No African American dentists in Passaic, but some nearby and a doctor that really did show him around. I think that the name was Gibbs and I think that they, that family may also be history makers from that standpoint.
Speaker 1: So, there was an African (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) G-I-B-B-S.
Speaker 1: So, there was an African American enclave in Passaic?
Speaker 2: Very small. The doc- a couple of doctors and school teachers.
Story_ID: 622323
Speaker 1: Do you recall whether your father [Wallace J. Haddon]--so when you're growing up this is as you know the--it coincided with the Montgomery Bus Boycott movement that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --brought Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to the fore.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Freedom Riders.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sixties [1960s] and the March on Washington. Do you recall whether your father ever traveled to any of those events (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes he did. Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh. Well where did, where did he go?
Speaker 2: He definitely did the March on Washington and I think he did a couple of others because he was the president of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. And my recollection about that is that their bus broke down on the way down. I'm not sure where, but that was very frightening for him because he grew up in South Carolina and so--
Speaker 1: He knew.
Speaker 2: --he knew that that, that was danger.
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] think about him going? Did you ever hear any discussions about whether he should or should not go or how involved he should get in this, the--?
Speaker 2: I think she supported his decisions that way. You know her family was a family that were also civil rights advocates, lawyers, and people who are really concerned about making sure that people had rights. So, I don't think there was any strong discussion about him not going. There was discussion about me not going later on when I was trying to do things like that.
Speaker 1: Do you know why your father became almost immediately engaged with the NAACP? Was that something he had done in Washington [D.C.] or was it something his parents had done? Do you know what his motivation was?
Speaker 2: So, I would attribute it probably to his mother. His mother was a very, very active woman in her own community of Abbeville, South Carolina. And after she became a school teacher, she became a point person for very many people, black and white, who lived in South Carolina and had left to go north because she tended the black cemetery as many people did in the South.
Speaker 1: So, that would be Ursula Gray Haddon?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything of, of the approximate year that she was born?
Speaker 2: I tried to think back to about--I, I would say in the 1880s.
Speaker 1: Eighteen eighties [1880s]. And her husband was James Haddon?
Speaker 2: Yes. And I don't know much about him because he died when my dad was very young. I know that he was a fireman.
Speaker 1: Would you describe your dad--well how would you describe your dad in terms of disciplinarian?
Speaker 2: You know my father was tall and bellowing and you didn't test his patience more than once. And mostly it is because, at least my image of him, was very hard working and enjoying peace and quiet as an--as someone coming home after a long day at work. And it took many years to develop a thriving business that--and he had one, but it meant that he was not always full of fun when he was at home. He was resting or having a drink or going out with his friends.
Speaker 1: You, you--and--but you don't recall him sitting down for conversations with you even as a teenager?
Speaker 2: As a teenager sure.
Speaker 1: As a teenager.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, what kind of things did you discuss?
Speaker 2: He would--we would talk about his, his upbringing. We would talk about his view of civil rights. We'd talk about his view of the environment, the civil rights and other environment in the United States. He was a strong advocate of family rights and, and mental and physical health. He was very active in the mental health community also in, in Passaic [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Well what prompted that interest?
Speaker 2: I think you know people were looking for board physicians and so he was on those--the board.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: He was also very active in the county associations as well.
Speaker 1: What about politics 'cause I, I'm assuming that you, you are old enough to remember the, the Kennedy/Nixon [John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Richard Milhous Nixon] debate on TV where you know almost everybody--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in America was watching it. Do you remember political discussions?
Speaker 2: Yes. So, the political discussion that I remember was that he was asked to run for freeholder in, in Passaic, in Passaic County [New Jersey] and he lost. He knew he was going to lose. I think that that was in connection with his presidency of the NAACP. But he thought it was important for black people to start running. What is ironic I guess about it was that he ran on the Republican county line because they were looking for someone to contest the Democrats who were often the winners in the area. So, he knew he was going to lose, but it got his name out there and you know he thought that that was very important for black people to not only vote but also to be a part of the--
Speaker 1: Did he run again?
Speaker 2: --political system. No, he only run--ran once. It took a lot of time and he was you know, he was making a point I think.
Speaker 1: You, you call it ironic that he ran as a Republican but on the other hand as you know, because of the legacy of Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --many African Americans were Republicans (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For a while.
Speaker 1: --a long--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it's--and some 'til this day remain.
Speaker 2: 'Til this day, yes.
Speaker 1: Was your dad a Republican?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No? Oh, he just did that for the--?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah.
Story_ID: 622324
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother [Ida Bassette Haddon]. Oh, I'm sorry one more question.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did your dad [Wallace J. Haddon] have a favorite saying, something that you know he might say about his children or about his wife or about life in general? Did he, do you recall any mantras or sayings of his?
Speaker 2: You know I don't, I don't recall him having those kinds of sayings. I think he says, the one would be the, what is it, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." I know he used to say that.
Speaker 1: About which one of you?
Speaker 2: Not, not either one of us necessarily, but about people who didn't get it together.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now to your mom. You, your mother's name, date of birth if you know it and place of birth?
Speaker 2: So, can I say a couple of other things about my father (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure, yeah. Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Because my, my grandmother [Ursula Gray Haddon]--
Speaker 1: His mother.
Speaker 2: Yes, raised him basically on her own and because he was the boy, he was the coddled boy. And so, you know I know of pictures and I know of adventures that he was able to do as a young boy whereas his sisters [Georgia Haddon Maith and Anniese Haddon Burton] were homemakers and were not able to do those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: What kind of adventures?
Speaker 2: You know, wander far from home. He, he was in the Merchant Marines [U.S. Merchant Marine]. Yeah, he, he was in the [U.S.] Army later but he was in the Merchant Marines earlier.
Speaker 1: Was it World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, that was I think his way of not going directly to war, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause the Merchant Marines--
Speaker 1: --during World War II he was in the Merchant Marines?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was a very dangerous thing as you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because a lot of the machines were blown out of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know much about that time. I, I you know, I know pictures--I have pictures. But I think what I would say is that his view about childrearing, because that's what you were talking about, really changed a bit because I think he basically was very much chauvinistic in terms of the, the dad's the boss and the household kind of centers around his activity. And he in fact was a hard worker. My mother on the other hand was a homemaker, but she was also you know a very, very intelligent and well educated person. And so they were a good team from one extent because she knew when to step back, but she also knew when to assert her, her interests. And so, I learned from both of them about being a strong, strong leader and being forceful in my views.
Speaker 1: And you still have these pictures of your dad in the Merchant Marines?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do actually.
Speaker 1: Do, do you--but you don't know where he went, what countries (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't.
Speaker 1: --he visited, what ports of call?
Speaker 2: No, he never talked about that much, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, I should ask, so--
Speaker 2: So, I think that you know they both shaped my sense of both what you might want to do more as a woman, but also what it means to be a strong person in the household.
Speaker 1: Did he suggest some courses of study or careers for you or he just left it up to you? Was it--did he have a desire for example that you might follow him into dentistry?
Speaker 2: No. He actually talked about women in his class who didn't succeed because he said they didn't have the dexterity because in those days it was, you know--
Speaker 1: Heavy duty equipment.
Speaker 2: --it was a lot of push and pulling. However, there were, I remember there were one or two women who actually did graduate and became really good friends of his and colleagues because they were, they were able to succeed as, as dentists and they thrived. And they were really like old boys actually as I remember. It's an interesting account of the professional development because women didn't become dentists very often during those early days.
Story_ID: 622325
Speaker 1: While we're still on your dad [Wallace J. Haddon]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --what do you remember about your grandmother [Ursula Gray Haddon]? Did she have some grandmotherly advice for, for, for her, for her granddaughter?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was a very, very strict up bringer and so I don't remember her being--having much of a sense of humor or a kind of whimsical outlook on life. I think she, she would probably say, "Work hard and you- you'll succeed."
Speaker 1: And she lived in Abbeville--
Speaker 2: Abbeville, South Carolina, yeah.
Speaker 1: What that's like a little town?
Speaker 2: Yeah. She lived to be 103.
Speaker 1: That's the one who went to college with your--
Speaker 2: With my dad [at Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: And when she graduated from college she became a schoolteacher--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or continued to teach school?
Speaker 2: She actually, I think she actually taught before that. She was--
Speaker 1: Because she--
Speaker 2: --in normal school or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --teach without a college degree.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was like a, like a junior college you know post-high school thing. And then she went to get her full degree while he was there.
Story_ID: 622326
Speaker 1: To your mom now.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Your mom's name, date of birth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ida--
Speaker 1: --place of birth.
Speaker 2: Ida Bassette Haddon, Hampton, Virginia, 1922.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her family?
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Her parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so her father was a lawyer and mom was a school teacher, high school, school teacher.
Speaker 1: And her father was Andrew William Bassette [Andrew W.E. Bassette, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Andrew William Ernest Bassette.
Speaker 1: Andrew William Ernest Bassette.
Speaker 2: The third [sic.].
Speaker 1: The third.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And her mother's name?
Speaker 2: Phoebe Estelle Bassette [Phoebe Perry Bassette].
Speaker 1: And that's your namesake (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, not the--I, I don't have the Estelle.
Speaker 1: You don't have the Estelle but you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --got the Phoebe though?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, let's just talk about the name for a second because as I was looking at the research information I saw Phoebe repeated--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in your maternal lineage.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know how far back it goes?
Speaker 2: There's another Phoebe before that. And then there's her mother. My mother's mother was named Phoebe.
Speaker 1: I've got--
Speaker 2: And then there's--
Speaker 1: --one 18--1857 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, then her mother was named Phoebe.
Speaker 1: So, this is pre-Civil War--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --we got a Phoebe.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Actually we got one in 1800.
Speaker 2: So, I can, I actually--
Speaker 1: Phoebe Gibson.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Born in--
Speaker 2: So, I have the picture of that family, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You have Phoebe Gibson's picture, the one who was born in 1800s, in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then her--
Speaker 2: It would be--yeah, yeah. It's--you know it may be a drawing, I'm not sure. A daguerreotype maybe.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. So, your, your Aunt Rachel [HistoryMaker Rachel Noel]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --seems to be the family historian.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had many of the pictures, but actually the person who had the most pictures was my Aunt Julie, that's Julie Bassette [Julia Bassette], that's A.W.E. Bassette IV's [sic. Andrew W.E. Bassette III] wife. Yeah, I hope I have the numbers right. I'll go back and look at that.
Speaker 1: Oh, Andrew William Ernest Bassette IV's wife?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 622327
Speaker 1: We're talking about your mom [Ida Bassette Haddon].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your mom's date of birth, place of birth and her parents [Phoebe Perry Bassette and Andrew W.E. Bassette, Jr.]. So, to the best of your knowledge, was your mother's grandfather [Andrew W.E. Bassette, Sr.] your family's first college graduate?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did he go? Was it Hampton--
Speaker 2: Hampton.
Speaker 1: --Normal [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: It was a normal school, yes. It was--I actually saw it. It's a, it's a one room basically school. It was the progenitor of Hampton (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hampton, Hampton--
Speaker 2: --right Institute, right.
Speaker 1: Well, Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first, right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, it was normal school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then Hampton Institute--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and now Hampton University?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, we saw it--
Speaker 1: And, and I guess it was organized initially for the freed--
Speaker 2: Yes, freed slaves.
Speaker 1: --freed slaves.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So your family has a, a long legacy of education?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Is that, is that something that people talked about or you just kind of took it for granted?
Speaker 2: No, we had--we always talked about it and my Aunt Rachel, [HistoryMaker] Rachel Noel was very much committed to education and a school was named for her in Denver, Colorado [Rachel B. Noel Middle School] because of her, her hard work with the school board [Denver Board of Education] there as school board president.
Speaker 1: So, she is also a HistoryMaker?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your Aunt Rachel. And I read that she had something to do with desegregating Denver's schools [Denver Public Schools].
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, I actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: --have done a lot of work on that. So, she was on the school board during the time that there was the first set of cases that came before, ultimately came before the United States Supreme Court, several times actually. And that's the Keyes case, K-E-Y-E-S [Keyes v. School District No. 1, 1973].
Speaker 1: So, was this, is this pre-Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh this was after Brown? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah this is, this is, this is one of the first northern, quote, northern, but it's actually west, school desegregation cases. And so, it established a lot of the law related to the fact that you would experience segregation in the North not by law but in the way that lines were drawn, schools were built and teachers and other people were deployed. A neighborhood based segregation created the opportunity for segregation in the North.
Speaker 1: And, and what was your aunt's role in up--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --tackling that?
Speaker 2: So, she ran for school board several times and she ran with other people who were committed to desegregation and integration. And as a school board member and also as a school board chair, she would put forth resolutions for desegregation and when they did not prevail, she would say let the record show. And when--you know, that X and Y. And when new buildings were built and when people were reassigned, she would also make sure that it was included in the record of the proceedings and it was those proceedings that were used in the school desegregation case and in the state supreme court [Colorado Supreme Court].
Speaker 1: And bussing was ordered?
Speaker 2: Yeah, bussing was ordered.
Speaker 1: In Denver?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: And you--
Speaker 2: Not only was bussing ordered but they had to go back several times because they were recalcitrant.
Story_ID: 622328
Speaker 1: Describe your mother [Ida Bassette Haddon], her stature, her style, her voice.
Speaker 2: My mother was a very fun loving person who was also very, very smart. And she was a mathematician before coming to Passaic [New Jersey] with my dad [Wallace J. Haddon]. She worked for the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].
Speaker 1: She worked for NASA?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was the NACA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was she one of the--
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.
Speaker 1: She was one of the Hidden Figures?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, she is.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, page eighty-one (laughter) in the book talks about her, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, she was theoretically--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) one of the women in the room when that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that are portrayed in the movie ['Hidden Figures']?
Speaker 2: Yes. And she would talk about those times, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you knew about this long--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --before the book?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever express any, I don't know, I, I don't want to put words in, in, in her mouth or yours. But what did she say about the fact that whenever we as children growing up saw the image of Mission Control, it was all men and all white men and no women were anywhere in the room?
Speaker 2: So, it's funny because she was part of that black women cadre that did the work and she talked about the camaraderie of that group. She didn't talk about it as all black but the experience that I would know that she would have at that time, because I knew you know that she lived in the segregated South would be that they were black. So, I know people actually here as well as in Virginia who were part of that group and who you know had a lot of fun and, and joking and good times working together in a very white, male dominated environment. So, my first recollection of her talking about this in a direct way was when I brought my Weekly Reader home, if you remember that, that newsletter that all children bring home. And it was about one of the first space shuttles going, going up. And my recollection though it may be a little faulty here was that it was Shepard [Alan Shepard] and she said, "I know him." And she said, "I worked with him." And at the time he or someone like him was one of the ones that broke the sound barrier [Chuck Yeager] and worked at NASA and, and she, she knew him as a younger person engaged in that kind of work.
Speaker 1: I think that would probably have been not the shuttle but the Gemini missions [Project Gemini].
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was in third or fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we were, we were about the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, contemporaries. Yes.
Speaker 1: --period of time because we also remember Ham.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now see when you--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --when I say Ham you know who I'm talking about right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: For the people watching, (unclear) Ham--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Punch the buttons.
Speaker 2: You're right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He lived.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right. So, she, she--
Speaker 1: That's fantastic (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother, my mother was a very unassuming person so you would never know that about her.
Speaker 1: Did she save any of her papers, any of her work, any, any, any documentation?
Speaker 2: I have some documentation. Not, not a lot but some, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, not like work papers but you know indication that she was employed and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: And so you know other women who were with her at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, in fact I'm going to try to track down someone who comes up here whose sister was one of her good friends then.
Speaker 1: Have you--
Speaker 2: Oh, and Katherine is coming. Katherine Johnson [HistoryMaker Katherine G. Johnson] is coming to Rutgers [Rutgers University - Camden, Camden, New Jersey] in September or October, yeah 'cause I'm, I'm going to have a chance to talk to her.
Speaker 1: So, I was going to ask you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --had you thought about a symposium or something--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we're doing that with the 'Hidden Figures' [Margot Lee Shetterly]. We had one read for the students.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a smart student. Did you ever write about this in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I did not. No, neither did my brother [James Haddon] as far as I know, no because she--I, I, I have to really emphasize how unassuming she was. She--I think that that was in part because of the relationship she had with my dad who was you know the man of the house. But we all knew and he knew and he talked very often that she was the smarter of the two you know. That, that she was brilliant but she never talked about it, never bragged about it, never--just talked offhandedly about her experiences.
Story_ID: 622329
Speaker 1: So, she [Haddon's mother, Ida Bassette Haddon] had to have worked there before moving to Passaic [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, when--do you know the time period?
Speaker 2: Sure, uh-huh. So, I know it because I was born and that's when she stopped working there [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics; National Aeronautics and Space Administration], yeah. So, she--or a couple of years after. So, I think she started around '48 [1948] or so, in 1948. So, when they talk about the '60s [1960s] or the, the '50s [1950s], it really started in the '40s [1940s]. I think they, they did in the 'Hidden Figures' movie have a picture of them breaking down in an old car. But--so, she worked until 1953 or so and that's when my father [Wallace J. Haddon] went to South Carolina to go to, in the [U.S.] Army. So, from pre-'40 [1940]--pre-'50 [1950] while my father was in dentist--I'm sorry--while my father was in dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], she, she was working in Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Hm, fantas- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In '52 [1952] or '53 [1953], they went to, to--he was sent to the Army.
Speaker 1: I--so--
Speaker 2: So, she went to South Carolina so that's when she ended her job there.
Speaker 1: She almost had--tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a computer, yeah.
Speaker 1: Human computer.
Speaker 2: She was--right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: When did, when did you--okay, so you come home as a child with the Weekly Reader and your mother tells you, "I know this astronaut [Alan Shepard]. I used to work with him."
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean you're third grade so, okay I can understand you're third grade and it's like, "Oh really? Okay, fine." And you go and watch 'Popeye' ['Popeye the Sailor'] or whatever was on TV at the time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Kind of goes by. But at what point in your life did you come to recognize the significance of what your mom had done? What--when did it dawn on you and, and how did it dawn on you?
Speaker 2: So, my, my mother was not the outgoing person. Her sister was. And so, we always talked about Aunt Rachel's [HistoryMaker Rachel Noel] achievements, not as much about my mom's. And my mother was, as I said self-adhesive--self-effacing. And so, she didn't talk about it and--in terms of some--
Speaker 1: But at some point you discovered it. When was that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I would say it was as a high school student [at Passaic High School, Passaic, New Jersey]. She was a guidance counselor at that point and she talked more about you know her--what she had done in the past.
Speaker 1: And did you understand how important it was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: When did--so, that's what I'm--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) really ask- I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think we really--
Speaker 1: When was the moment of--?
Speaker 2: --understood it until she had died and really saw some of the things that she had accomplished, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, not during her lifetime?
Speaker 2: Yeah, putting it together, no. But as I said she was overshadowed by my, my--my aunt's significant was nationally known, yeah. And these--it is the case that the 'Hidden Figures' book [Margot Lee Shetterly] exposed a great deal of what was just either commonly accepted in, in Langley Field [Langley Air Force Base, Virginia] and Hampton [Virginia] you know there were a lot of other women who worked there and it was during the time of the war [World War II, WWII] so you know, women--that was the first time that they were employed in those kinds of positions. But it wasn't, it wasn't picked up. And I have to say to you that I was reading--you know, I, I--the significance had--was known to me, but I was reading The New York Times last year I guess it was when the movie was just about to come out and Shetterly [Margot Lee Shetterly], the author, was talking about her research in The New York Times. And so, I'm sitting there reading The New York Times and I said to my husband [Frank M. McClellan], "That's my mother. I know what she's talking about. That's my mother." And so, there was a, a website direction at the end of the Times article so I went on the website and got her phone number and called her. And she said, yeah, your mom's in the book.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 622330
Speaker 1: So, Rachel B. Noel [HistoryMaker Rachel Noel], do you know who Noel was? Did you ever meet your Uncle Noel?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, yes. His (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's--what was his first name?
Speaker 2: That's Edmond [Edmond F. Noel].
Speaker 1: Edmond. And what was his line of work?
Speaker 2: He was a doctor, medical doctor.
Speaker 1: Medical doctor, okay. Back to--I just wanted to get--'cause I didn't--
Speaker 2: He also, both of them--he, he--his family, the Noel family in Mississippi were really strident--
Speaker 1: From Mississippi?
Speaker 2: --civil rights people. Right.
Speaker 1: Where in Mississippi, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I visited with them in Jackson [Mississippi] and my, my cousin Angie Noel [Angela Noel], N-O-E-L again, and Buddy Noel [Edmond F. "Buddy" Noel, Jr.] are their children so they have a lot of pictures.
Speaker 1: And, and where are they?
Speaker 2: Buddy is in, in Denver still, Denver, Colorado.
Speaker 1: And Angie?
Speaker 2: She's in Oakland, California.
Speaker 1: Did you ever--is the name Debbie Noel [ph.] familiar?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who's that?
Speaker 2: That--Devvie [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Deb--
Speaker 2: That--uh-huh, I know her.
Speaker 1: Was, was she a--
Speaker 2: So, she's a cousin. She's their cousin.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she is?
Speaker 2: I think she's uh, she's in, somewhere in the Northwest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she's from Denver.
Speaker 1: Is she in broadcasting?
Speaker 2: I don't know that, maybe.
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: I can, I can find that from Angie.
Speaker 1: I knew a Debbie Noel who was a, who was a, who was a radio deejay.
Speaker 2: So, we called her Devvie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] and my, my mother and my aunt were really, really close and so we would either visit them or they would visit us every two years. So, I know the Noel family really well.
Story_ID: 622331
Speaker 1: So, the same question for your--about your mother [Ida Bassette Haddon], did she have any favorite sayings, things that when you think about your mom, kind of you know you can hear her saying this thing, this saying, this piece of advice that she always told you what?
Speaker 2: So, I, I think I wrote this down, but I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I had to think about it.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's in my, it's in my--she--
Speaker 1: You can't remember what your mother used to say to you?
Speaker 2: Not, right this second 'cause you asked me earlier so I'm blanking this out. It's so funny, yeah. So, I'm going to, I'm going to get in the car and I'm going to remember this, but I don't remember right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is called old age.
Speaker 1: Or deliberate mental block.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: So, let's say you stayed out too late and you came home. What would your mother say to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, "You'll pay for this." What did I say?
Speaker 1: You just said, you'll pay for this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: No, I'm saying is that what I said? No, I don't think I did.
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean when we were (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think, yeah, I think it's in, in my work.
Speaker 1: And so did, did, did she--so I asked you about your father [Wallace J. Haddon] as the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --disciplinarian, taskmaster.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What about your mom? What kind of disciplinarian was she?
Speaker 2: You know she used the emotional approach so she would say that she was really disappointed in what you did or didn't do.
Speaker 1: What do you think your most--
Speaker 2: And that, that you were you know not living up to your expectations and name, things like that.
Speaker 1: So, in your teenage years what do you recall as being a particularly egregious violation of family protocol?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother as I said was very family centered and so, I think it's actually her brother Andrew, A.W.E. [Andrew W.E. Bassette III], and his family had come to see us and she went out to do something and left me in charge. And I went out and left them home and they went on to another part of their trip. And so, she was so very, very disappointed in me.
Speaker 1: You mean you left them at the house?
Speaker 2: Just for a--yeah, I was going to see a friend down the street or something.
Speaker 1: And they left before you came back?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they said that they were getting ready to go and they were--so by the time she came home they were, they were almost ready to go. And she--
Speaker 1: And, and you weren't there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--because she was very, very family centered and family was, was the, the one thing that she believed held everything together.
Speaker 1: And what did she say to you about that?
Speaker 2: She said that she was very disappointed in me and that--she cried actually and told me that that was you know, that was un- unforgiveable.
Speaker 1: And not she raised you.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you understand?
Speaker 2: Yeah, profoundly.
Speaker 1: How old--
Speaker 2: So, I'm very family centered now and you know I'd never do that, something like that.
Speaker 1: How, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I think I was about thirteen. I went to--I just went down the street to play with some friends.
Speaker 1: And where was your brother [James Haddon]?
Speaker 2: Who knows (laughter).
Speaker 1: He was your younger brother.
Speaker 2: But--yeah, I was going to say again, my family was very much the father, the mother, the daughter, you know the son is going along with the father. So, it was only after I was older. And you know, I think probably that's one of the main reasons why I went to a women's college--
Speaker 1: Because--
Speaker 2: --because I, well number one, I was, I was coming into the college age at a time when many of the Ivy League schools were still male and women, female. So, it was a choice that way because I was making that choice. But I think Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] had already integrated so to speak, race--not racially but gender wise and several other places, but I decided not to go there and I went to Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] in part because you know I really thought that this was a place where women were respected for the work that they did.
Speaker 1: So, what I'm hearing between the lines is that in a way you were maybe subliminally troubled by the gender roles in your family?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm. Yeah, I'd say so in retrospect. Or what I might say is that that vision found its place when I went to college.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't that your father was unkind or cruel--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: --it was just that he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or, or didn't expect me to do well in school, believe me.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, he had high expectations of you.
Speaker 2: High expectations.
Speaker 1: Or, or that your mother was a wallflower--
Speaker 2: And that I would --
Speaker 1: --and, and, and was you know depressed.
Speaker 2: No, she was not a wall- no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: But you just didn't like the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were roles.
Speaker 1: --delineation of gender roles--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --that, that they had accepted?
Speaker 2: They were more defined gender roles, yes.
Story_ID: 622332
Speaker 1: And it wasn't that because your mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] couldn't have been as much of a leader as your dad [Wallace J. Haddon] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no question. And she, she did do more after he died, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Oh, what did she do after--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, she was on the--not the school board but some school district--
Speaker 1: Advisory?
Speaker 2: --committee, yeah. Advisory committee, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was her--she, she, she was a teacher?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did she teach math?
Speaker 2: So, she started out as a math teacher. She started out as a science teacher. I think she was placed as a science teacher and then went to, to--her first love was math clearly. So, she went to become a math teacher and then she later was a guidance counselor.
Speaker 1: Teaching math in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes. Teaching math in junior high school.
Speaker 1: Junior high school.
Speaker 2: So, the other dynamic I would say is that there were two junior high schools in Passaic [New Jersey]. You won't be surprised that one [Lincoln Junior High School] was white and one was black although no segregation of course. She taught at the black school and you know we moved very early after moving into a real house, we moved into the white area of town. We were the first black people in that part of town and so we went to white schools, predominantly white schools, and when I say predominantly I would say that I was the only black person in my class, two. There were--there was another boy.
Speaker 1: I, I want to talk about your school experience--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, in a, in a minute.
Speaker 2: And I think my brother [James Haddon] probably had the same experience until he got into junior high school and by that time it was, it was fairly integrated.
Speaker 1: So, did your mother sing? Did your mother play an instrument?
Speaker 2: My mother played the piano.
Speaker 1: Did she make you take piano lessons?
Speaker 2: No, she encouraged me to take piano lessons.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: I wasn't a very good student.
Speaker 1: Did you take them?
Speaker 2: Yes, eight years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long?
Speaker 2: Eight years, yeah.
Speaker 1: For years.
Speaker 2: Eight years.
Speaker 1: Was she involved in The Links [The Links, Incorporated], Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was involved in the Jack and Jill. She was not, not involved in Links. She was involved in Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Girls--oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Girl Friends, yeah.
Speaker 1: Girl Friends, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so am I.
Speaker 1: Oh of course--
Speaker 2: And Links.
Speaker 1: --that's a lineage thing, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You have to pass it on.
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's going any, any longer.
Speaker 1: Someone tells the story about how the E got added to your mother's maiden--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's that story?
Speaker 2: So, my mother always said that the Bassettes were at one point--oh, the, that the name, that the spelling Bassette was at the time of his--her grandfather was a way of distinguishing the black from the white Bassetts, so her grandfather put the E on that name as a way of delineating the black part of the family from the white part of the family. I later learned that there were some black Bassetts who didn't have the E on it. But we always knew that the, the--my grandfather was fiercely proud and I'm saying grandfather but it is great-grandfather 'cause it was her grandfather.
Speaker 1: That's the A.W.E.--
Speaker 2: Bassette I [Andrew W.E. Bassette, Sr.].
Speaker 1: The, the one born in 1857 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or it may be--
Speaker 1: --who graduated from--
Speaker 2: --the second.
Speaker 1: --from Hampton Normal [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, normal, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: So, his family there must have been one or two who didn't have the E on it because I now know that there's a line of blacks who don't have the E.
Story_ID: 622333
Speaker 1: So, tell me how your parents [Ida Bassette Haddon and Wallace J. Haddon] met and where they met?
Speaker 2: They met in Hampton. My dad was in the Merchant Marines [U.S. Merchant Marine].
Speaker 1: Oh. Oh, when he was at port--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --not, not in school--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --'cause he went to Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah. No, this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she go to--
Speaker 2: --before he went to Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was she at the time?
Speaker 2: In Hampton.
Speaker 1: At, at, at, at Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: She was teaching in Hampton--well in--
Speaker 1: Oh, she was teaching?
Speaker 2: --Newport News [Virginia] I guess, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, so she was teaching before she went to work for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]?
Speaker 2: No, she was, she was at NASA at that time.
Speaker 1: She was at NASA.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, this is the NACA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics] at the time, national aeronautics--
Speaker 1: Computer whatever, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not computer but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --something. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so--
Speaker 2: She was working there in Hampton.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: So, were they at a, I don't know, at a dance?
Speaker 2: I--somebody introduced her, I don't know. I don't know that part.
Speaker 1: You, you don't, you don't know the story of their courtship?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: They never told you?
Speaker 2: Well, what I do know is that he was there and in the Merchant Marines and I think he was introduced through my Aunt Rachel [HistoryMaker Rachel Noel] and her cohort of friends.
Speaker 1: But you don't know how (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know how exactly but I do know that it was clear that my father was not going to stay in Hampton, Virginia because the Bassette family was so profoundly a presence there. And so I think part of his decision first after going to the [U.S.] Army in South Carolina, his decision to go north was built on not, not coming back to Hampton.
Speaker 1: Let's just make this plain. Are you saying that your mother's family was too dominant for your dad to deal with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they was--it--they were clearly a presence in, in Hampton, yeah. And so, you know, he was striking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they like him?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, certainly her brothers and sisters liked him--sister.
Speaker 1: What about her parents [Phoebe Perry Bassette and Andrew W.E. Bassette, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know about that part, I really don't.
Speaker 1: So, do you know how long they courted before they married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you know the year of their marriage?
Speaker 2: I think it's '48 [1948] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay. And once they married then your mother continued to work in Hampton?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he went to school at Howard?
Speaker 2: Yes. So, then I be- then she became--I became pregnant. She became pregnant with me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so once I was born I think we were at least back and forth between Hampton and D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So, you said your father went to the Army after getting out of dental school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or after getting out of college?
Speaker 2: Oh I'm--after dental school.
Speaker 1: So, he was an officer--
Speaker 2: He was the Merchant Marines--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and then he got drafted in the Army.
Speaker 1: Oh, he got drafted in the Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '50s [1950s], '54 [1954] or something like that.
Speaker 1: So, do you know if he was working at a--as a dentist in the Army?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and how long was he in the Army do you know?
Speaker 2: It see--felt like two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because we moved, remember I--so, it's like '53 [1953] to '55 [1955] or something then we moved to New Jersey.
Story_ID: 622334
Speaker 1: So, we'll just back up our interview for a second and I was asking you earlier about your mother's [Ida Bassette Haddon] favorite sayings. And you have remembered--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --one, one of which is?
Speaker 2: Yes. "I ain't studying about you." And she would say that when she had really, really reached her limit. She never swore and so, that was her hottest point. "I ain't studying about you."
Speaker 1: Did, did your daddy [Wallace J. Haddon] swear?
Speaker 2: A lot, yeah. He made up for it (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Did you ever (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then she'd look like, "Oh my goodness."
Speaker 1: "Don't say that around the children."
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your brother, James [James Haddon]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what, what year was he born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: And so that was--he was born in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] also then?
Speaker 2: No, he was in Abbe--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: He was in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was born in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: When my dad was in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: So, you all moved to South Carolina from D.C. or--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, see I, I don't think I actually lived in D.C. My father was at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So, my mother was still in, in Hampton [Virginia] teaching. And she would--
Speaker 1: Oh, so--
Speaker 2: I know we would go up to visit. I, I was one year old.
Speaker 1: Right, of course. Of course.
Speaker 2: You know, so--
Speaker 1: I got it. I got it. So, she's, so she's at--
Speaker 2: She had a baby (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She's at Hampton--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with, with her family.
Speaker 2: Yes, support.
Speaker 1: And they, and so she could go to work and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --someone could take care of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know--
Speaker 2: And that's when she was at the NASA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics; National Aeronautics and Space Administration].
Speaker 1: And do you know who took care of you?
Speaker 2: Well, while she was at work?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My Aunt Julie [Julia Bassette].
Speaker 1: Your Aunt Julie?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. And--
Speaker 2: That's her sister-in-law, my--A.W.E.'s [Andrew W.E. Bassette III] wife.
Speaker 1: Okay. Your uncle's--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --wife?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you know A.W.E.?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Now he was an attorney?
Speaker 2: No, he was a doctor.
Speaker 1: He was a doctor.
Speaker 2: Surgeon, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who was the attorney in the, in--?
Speaker 2: Charles, that's Charles Edward [Charles Bassette].
Speaker 1: And who was he to your mom?
Speaker 2: Brother.
Speaker 1: Her brother--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was an attorney?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, A.W.E. and Charles were attorneys--were, were her brothers.
Speaker 1: Were her brothers.
Speaker 2: One was a doctor, one was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: And then she had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, when I say that I'm fourth generation, my daughter's [Cara McClellan] fifth generation, I'm talking about generations because my mother wasn't a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Gotcha.
Speaker 2: But her brother was.
Speaker 1: But her brother was?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And her father [Andrew W.E. Bassette, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: --was a lawyer.
Speaker 2: And his father [Andrew W.E. Bassette, Sr.] was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: And his father was a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At the time when you could sit so to speak--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: --and read and then pass the bar.
Speaker 2: Read, that's right. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Her father went to Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 622335
Speaker 1: So you're three, four, five years old.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you're living for the most part in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Describe your house.
Speaker 2: It was a really beautiful old house on North King Street, which was one of the prominent areas where, at the time, black people lived in Hampton [Virginia]. Urban renewal came in much later and took all of that away so you can't even really locate where that house was, but it was on the corner. It had a large backyard. I can remember playing in that yard just vaguely and I probably know it more through, through pictures. But, but my dad [Wallace J. Haddon] didn't own that house. That was the Bassette house.
Speaker 1: And who lived in the house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my Aunt Julie [Julia Bassette] and her family and my, my mother [Ida Bassette Haddon].
Speaker 1: And, and your dad when he came to visit?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then would go back to school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Aunt Julie and Uncle Andrew [Andrew W.E. Bassette III].
Speaker 1: And, and what about the neighborhood? Describe the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was a collection of you know two story houses, just very nice houses. However, on the next block was a medical building and a med- medical and lawyer building and that's--that was the Bassette building so that's where the doctors and the lawyers had their offices.
Speaker 1: Your family's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --offices?
Speaker 2: Yes. So, my mother's father [Andrew W.E. Bassette, Jr.] was a lawyer and he was in there. His brother [Burl Bassette] was a doctor and he was in there. Another brother [Edward Bassette] was in Richmond [Virginia] so, they were the foundation for that, that office.
Speaker 1: So, theoretically--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --if your father had been inclined when he finished dental school, he could have moved into the Bassette building and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --made it a trifecta?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'm laughing 'cause I--knowing my father, that never, ever would have happened.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because he's a very forceful man, very chauvinistic, but also you know his own man.
Speaker 1: Independent?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think that that was a consequence of being the man from very early in his life, you know because his father [James Haddon] died very young.
Speaker 1: So, approximately how old were you when you moved to--oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute. So, in this house on North King Street--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --do you, do you, do you remember how it smelled, let's say around holiday time?
Speaker 2: So, my, my Aunt Julie was a nurse who married her husband the doctor and became a housewife. And so, she cooked all the time. So, you know there was all--there was breakfast, lunch dinner, I know that. And you know--
Speaker 1: The aroma of food in the house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was always something being cooked, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was a typical breakfast?
Speaker 2: Bacon, eggs, lots of biscuits you know, things like that.
Story_ID: 622336
Speaker 1: Holidays, what--did you, do you recall celebrating holidays in that house?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause we would come back even after we moved to New Jersey we would come back for that.
Speaker 1: Thanks--
Speaker 2: So, that was not the, the main Bassette house though. By the time I got older, the main Bassette house was in Richmond. I--my--the other brother, the brother who was a dentist actually was--had, had a house in, in Richmond, Virginia. So, so I don't know that I included this in, in much of what we have here but, so, he is A.W.E. II's [Haddon's maternal grandfather, Andrew W.E. Bassette, Jr.] brother. And I think I told you that there were a number of sisters and brothers. And so, two of the sisters lived with him. His name was Edward [Edward Bassette]. Two of the sisters, Louise [Louise Bassette Brown] and Maime, lived with him in this huge and rambling house in Richmond. Well, it was--it's actually in Varina County [sic. Varina, Henrico County, Virginia], which is outside of Richmond. On the, oh goodness what is--James River. And I say that because that really became the central place that all of the sisters and brothers of my mother's [Ida Bassette Haddon] age would come home to. So, we'd go to Hampton [Virginia] but we'd also go there because that's where my Uncle Ed lived. And there was lots of room. So, the two sisters who lived there, Lou- Louise and Maime--
Speaker 1: Maime.
Speaker 2: It was--it's Mary--
Speaker 1: Mary.
Speaker 2: --but Maime, Mary B. Scott [Mary Bassette Scott], they also I think had been school teachers at some point but I, I'm not positive about that. But they, they had unsuccessful marriages and so they came back to live with Uncle Ed.
Speaker 1: So, Rachel [HistoryMaker Rachel Noel]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --had, had moved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 1: --to Denver or there would have been four sisters?
Speaker 2: No, Rachel's my mother's sister. This is--these are--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: These are--
Speaker 1: Your father--
Speaker 2: These are--no, these are my mother's father's sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh okay, okay. Your mother's father's sisters.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, Edward--
Speaker 1: --May and Mary--
Speaker 2: Mary and Louise--
Speaker 1: --and Aunt Louise are your mother's aunts?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I gotcha, okay.
Speaker 2: They're my great aunts.
Speaker 1: Your--and your great aunts, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Understood.
Speaker 2: So, they lived with Edward, their brother. And they were, they weren't spinsters 'cause they had been married before but they lived with him. And I'm telling this story because they were also very forceful woman and so they each had, had a segment of the house (laughter). I mean to the point of having a parlor and everything separate from the other. And he had--
Speaker 1: Wait, each segment had a parlor?
Speaker 2: Yes, a par- you know a sitting room.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Let's call it a sitting room, a bedroom. So, they received their friends and guests--
Speaker 1: In their section (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in their parts of their house. And my Uncle Ed also had a separate part of the house and he received his--he was mostly a loner but he's the one who supported them.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about writing a book about your family?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So funny, but this is, I mean this is the really funny thing because when you came to visit them you had to make the choice as to whom you were going to eat with because they also had--
Speaker 1: They had separate dining?
Speaker 2: They had the same dining area but they had separate kitchens. My Aunt Lou had a kitchen, Louise, had a, a kitchen on the river and it was screened in and I usually would go for breakfast there. But my Aunt Maime had the main house kitchen. Her family would come, they would cook in that, that one. Lou would be there and my mother would be--and Aunt Rachel if she was coming would be in the other one. And, and there was a real rivalry about you know who, who, whose cooking you would be eating when you came to, to--so, you got the benefit of really good cooking, but you had to make a choice.
Speaker 1: Well, did they ever come together for, for a common meal (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I, I don't remember that happening. So, this is you know later in their lives so they probably did. But this is you know how they had made their way. This is how they had made their way as older, older adults.
Speaker 1: And, and independent people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and independent women.
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: So, I guess I would say that my family had a way of, of my--the women in my family had a way of demonstrating their independence even as they sort of conformed to a more chauvinistic approach to families with the head of house (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The tradi- the  traditional gender roles.
Speaker 2: Yes, the traditional gender roles, yes.
Story_ID: 622337
Speaker 1: When you moved to Passaic [New Jersey] and now you're an older child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --do you recall having to do chores?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: What kind of chores?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: House, house cleaning chores, washing the dishes.
Speaker 1: That was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that was your job?
Speaker 2: Those, that--those are--those were my jobs. And we had somebody to come, probably not in the early years but certainly in the later years. It was this--my mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] was a high school guidance counselor. We had somebody there and when I was growing up because my mother wasn't--you know had to go to, to work as early as we did, we had someone who came in and, and cooked breakfast and babysat for us. So, we had--we never called it a housekeeper.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you ever try to get out of your chores? Did you ever try to bribe your little brother [James Haddon] into doing them for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I did but that wasn't the main thing. He had chores too.
Story_ID: 622338
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned vacations that the vacations were sort of built around the National Dental Association, which was the--
Speaker 2: Very often, yes.
Speaker 1: --the black dental association.
Speaker 2: It was the black dental association, yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did--was your father [Wallace J. Haddon] also simultaneously a member of the American Dental Association?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, he was a member of both?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But your vacations would, would be--?
Speaker 2: Were connected to the other one, yeah. He, he attended the others, yes.
Speaker 1: So, so what--where are some--
Speaker 2: So, I would, I would probably say that his affiliation, he certainly had local affiliation with the white dental society. I remember that. And he certainly was a member of the dental association, the American Dental Association. But his connections, his social connections were with the National Dental Association.
Speaker 1: Where are some of the cities that you recall going to?
Speaker 2: All over the country.
Speaker 1: Names.
Speaker 2: We went to Jackson, we went to--
Speaker 1: Jackson, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah. We went to Richmond [Virginia], we went to Chicago [Illinois], we went to Detroit [Michigan], we went to California several times.
Speaker 1: Do you recall for your trips down south, something called 'The Green Book' ['The Negro Motorist Green Book']?
Speaker 2: 'The Green'--?
Speaker 1: 'Green Book'?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was a book that listed the places where one could--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --stay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stay.
Speaker 1: --and buy food.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In the segregated--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --environment.
Speaker 2: So we, we traveled to the South. The other vacations that we went on were not that, were not connected to the dental association, was to go back to Hampton [Virginia] and go back to South Carolina to visit my [paternal] grandmother [Ursula Gray Haddon].
Speaker 1: So, when you were going to Jackson (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, we were always there every, every, every year or ever--and my mother--my grandmother would travel to our house and we would go see her. In fact, her birthday is about--so this is TMI [too much information], but her birthday is about three days before mine on the 26th of August.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And so, I spent many of my birthdays in Abbeville, South Carolina going to school with my grandmother. That was my birthday treat.
Speaker 1: Your strict grandmother?
Speaker 2: My strict grandmother.
Speaker 1: Was that a treat?
Speaker 2: I don't think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 622339
Speaker 1: So, when you were going to a place like--so you're driving from Pas--
Speaker 2: Passaic [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: --Passaic to Jackson, Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Or--
Speaker 1: --you cross the Mason Dixon Line--
Speaker 2: Or Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Or Hampton.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where do you stay and what do you--do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Yes. We did not stay. We would actually go late at night and my father [Wallace J. Haddon] would drive all, all night and we'd be asleep.
Speaker 1: You did, you didn't--
Speaker 2: So, we could get to Hampton in--
Speaker 1: You didn't stop?
Speaker 2: --six or seven hours. Unh-uh, no. I'm sure he'd stop for gas.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I can remember actually learning how to drive when I was sixteen, I guess going on seventeen, and we were in Abbeville [South Carolina] and I forgot to look at the gas tank and we ran out of gas. And we were in or close to running out of gas and we were near Augusta, Georgia because Abbeville is very close to Georgia. And, and we were in a black Bonneville Pontiac [Pontiac Bonneville] and my father--I've never seen my father that nervous because he was really afraid, number one to, to go to somebody's house to get some help. But number two he was afraid of the, the police stopping and saying, "What are you doing in that kind of car?" Yeah, I can remember that.
Speaker 1: And he was afraid to, to knock on someone's house because--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to knock on the door because he didn't know what kind of reception we'd get. This is when--this is '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: At the height of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. So, that--you know I do have that, that full appreciation of what it meant to, to go south. And as long as we were going you know about our business it was fine. But if you're in that kind of situation you're--and, and you don't know who your--what the community is that you're entering, you know as, as a fifteen, sixteen, seventeen year old, I know that feeling of, of--so the, the other, other recollection I have though, of segregation in that respect, I've never in my entire life gone to Cape May--
Speaker 1: New Jersey.
Speaker 2: --New Jersey to enjoy the vacation that people talk about and I have many friends who now have homes there. But when I was one time going not with my parents, but with someone else, my aunts, going south to Virginia, we took the Cape May Ferry [Cape May Lewes Ferry]. This again is, I know the date, 1966 or '67 [1967] because I was sixteen or seventeen years old and the Civil Rights Acts [Civil Rights Act of 1964] had already been passed. And on that ferry there were colored women, white ladies, and my aunts said to me, "Girl, you better go in that white ladies," and they imposed on me to go in the white ladies' bathroom.
Speaker 1: Your aunts?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, because they said that law is illegal.
Speaker 1: And this is what year?
Speaker 2: It's nine--it has to be 1966 or '67 [1967] 'cause it was after the, it was after the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is Cape May, New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Cape May, New Jersey. The Cape May Ferry.
Speaker 1: May--
Speaker 2: The Cape May Ferry.
Speaker 1: May ferry.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They had colored and whites (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They still had those signs up. They had those, those kinds of signs when you went to South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know in the South. But--
Speaker 2: But you just didn't go.
Speaker 1: But you didn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: --think that they would be north of the Mason Dixon.
Speaker 2: So, can I just tell you that I--that was one of the more frightening parts of the, the--two times, running out of gas in the South, but making myself go into that bathroom. And they, they actually insisted on making sure that I was actually going to the bathroom and--
Speaker 1: Well, your, your aunts of course had your back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They were waiting for somebody to even look (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah but I didn't feel real comfortable let me just say. And so, I have never 'til this day--
Speaker 1: Gone back to Cape--?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: No, I won't.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure the signs are gone now.
Speaker 2: I--that just, that had a profound impact on me. I, I--that was what--you know when people talk about apartheid and our apartheid, that's how I felt.
Story_ID: 622340
Speaker 1: So, you grew up in Passaic [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I've read that your elementary school was show--was mostly white.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that you were frequently the only African American--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --child in class.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Describe what that was like for you. This is like from what, K through sixth [kindergarten to sixth grade]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh. So, so, I was, I, I started kindergarten initially in a black school, the same segregation that was going on, because we hadn't moved to our, our house. But when we moved to a house we moved in an area that was all white. And I know now and knew probably by the--four or five years later that you know we broke the color line there so to speak. And you know my father [Wallace J. Haddon] was already active in NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and so I know that, that the choices were limited even though the laws you know were supposedly open. So, we--the, the neighborhood that we lived in was a working class white neighborhood. It was not middle class. We ultimately moved farther into a middle class neighborhood, which was right down the street literally but that was the only house that he could buy. And so, we, we became friends with the people there but they had never been around black people before. And--
Speaker 1: Did you have sleepovers?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, you had white friends?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did they come to your house?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you went to their house?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you ever feel--how did you feel?
Speaker 2: I felt like I was accepted except when people started talking about black or Negroes as the time you know then you were sort of the outlier. Some people would say ignorant things sometimes.
Speaker 1: Were there ever any racial slurs while you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yes. So, not at school. The, the--my school was, was, was pretty good about that. There was in my, our neighborhood, I remember very vividly going on my bike with some of my friends from my block down the street to a, an area that was not as familiar to us and somebody calling out of the women--out of the, the window, "Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger." And so, I went home and told my parents and my father went down to the people's house and told them that that, that was unacceptable.
Speaker 1: He--by himself?
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: Didn't call the police?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: What did you think about your dad for doing that?
Speaker 2: I, I was scared to death for him, but they didn't call me nigger anymore.
Speaker 1: That was a pretty brave thing for him to do--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Kind of dicey too.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But I think he was really, really angry you know. And then as I said, I grew up in the same neighborhood from the time you know I was in first grade at least. And so, these were people who I knew really well. There were some other Jewish families nearby too. So, my brother [James Haddon] actually was really good friends with a, a little Jewish girl who lived around the corner. And my friends were mostly right in my immediate block. And they, they were blue collar people and they--it took a while for them to, to warm up but we were you know we were good friends growing up.
Speaker 1: Did you form any lifelong friendships?
Speaker 2: So, these were not--you know as many people growing up in that time, I had two sets of friends, yeah. I had friends that, that were my school friends, including my local neighborhood. But you know a, a more well defined larger set of friends, many of them Jewish because there--it was a, a nearby Jewish neighborhood as well, that I was very comfortable with until thirteen or fourteen. And then always you know Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] and other kinds of things. My, my father and mother's [Ida Bassette Haddon] contemporaries who had friends my age--
Speaker 1: African American friends (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) not there. Yeah, African American. And so, most of our social activity was with those folks.
Story_ID: 622341
Speaker 1: Did you--of your school friends, did you form any relationships, connections that have lasted for a lifetime?
Speaker 2: Yes. Not, not many but some, yeah.
Speaker 1: From those days in elementary school in Passaic [New Jersey] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yes. So, I had a couple of friends through high school [Passaic High School, Passaic, New Jersey] that--the white ones, through high school and then on to college [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts], yes.
Speaker 1: Have you attended--
Speaker 2: And I've actually seen several people now that I'm at Rutgers [Rutgers University - Camden, Camden, New Jersey] who were there, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so you have attended your high school reunions?
Speaker 2: I, I attended one, um-hm, the twenty-fifth I guess. Fifty is coming this summer, I probably will go. So, once I came back to New Jersey, particularly after a lot of publicity about me becoming chancellor, a lot of people got back in touch with me and said you know, "We've been following you," or "We know about what you do." But also, when I was dean at the law school at Maryland [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland], there're people who came, came around.
Speaker 1: Who were some teachers that you remember? Describe your relationship with your high school teachers, say the one that you consider to have had the most profound effect on your studies, on your college choices, however you want to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, one in particular that I really think about fondly, who was very, very quiet and who was a math teacher, I'm sorry, history teacher, I'm trying to remember her last name. But she actually took me to a couple--she was a Quaker, very plainspoken, very plain herself. And she took me to some of the smaller Quaker schools in Pennsylvania, including her alma mater. And as soon as I remember her name I'll remember her alma mater. But it--that trip was designed for me to think about whether or not a small liberal arts school, not you know the Michigans [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] or the other kinds of things that I was looking at.
Speaker 1: So, it was just you and her?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: She asked my mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] if it was all right if she would--could take me and yeah, so we went--wish I could remember the name of the school.
Speaker 1: Was it in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in Pennsylvania, small Quaker school.
Speaker 1: Not Earlham [Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana]? No, that's in Indiana.
Speaker 2: No, that's Indiana, but a similar kind of school. And it was too small for me. But, it was you know--she really thought that this would be a, a good place for me to grow and to, to really get engaged in the liberal arts.
Story_ID: 622342
Speaker 1: Well, I should ask the question. How supportive were your high school teachers in terms of your academic prowess, your potential for attending college?
Speaker 2: I went to a great high school [Passaic High School, Passaic, New Jersey]. It was integrated. The two junior high schools, white and black, came together. There's only one high school in Passaic [New Jersey] at the time. And--
Speaker 1: Still only one.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, there's now only one too, but there are also other private schools in the area that a lot of white people go to. So, it's not an integrated school anymore, like many other places in New Jersey and elsewhere. But that--my school was, was integrated and so, I had two challenges I guess for going into high school. One was that I was in the, the honors classes and there weren't many blacks in the honors if any. And so, for all intents and purposes, I was in a white environment, but it was an integrated school.
Speaker 1: I read--
Speaker 2: And so I'm smiling because I did things like cheerleading, which who could imagine me being a cheer- cheerleader. But anyway, it was things that you know I could do in an integrated environment. I remember though in that kind of context, my parents [Ida Bassette Haddon and Wallace J. Haddon] would not let me go on the bus, no.
Speaker 1: You couldn't--
Speaker 2: And so, that, that was the end of my cheerleading career when we, when we started traveling out of Passaic into other, other areas.
Speaker 1: So, they wouldn't let you go out of town with the football team?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no. Probably 'cause my mother knew all of the football team from her junior high school. (Laughter) But anyway, so, I, I had a, a very positive high school environment.
Speaker 1: You, you have written that, going to that high school gave you a, an awakened sense of appreciation for diversity. Did, did having spent most of your, well all of your school career--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --in a--where you were one of the few (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Predominately white, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then you go into a situation where you're no longer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so alone.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: How--what, what was that like for you?
Speaker 2: So, so my--I'm going, I'm going to say that predominately my social life was not through the high school. It was still through Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] and those kinds of African American social environments. On the other hand, you know you're in high school twenty-four--not 24/7, but much of your time and so, I interacted with people and it was a diverse environment in there. The, the, the--by the time my brother [James Haddon] was going to the high school, it was about, I, I think about 50/50 probably. But it was still predominately white in the honors programs and things like that.
Speaker 1: And your brother was how many years behind you?
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years behind you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and what, when do you mark the beginning of the development of these private schools that the white folks started going to? What, what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around the time that he was probably coming into it.
Speaker 1: So, after about four or five years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because people--
Speaker 1: --of integrated public education they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --kind of checked out?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, I--yeah and I think that, that that's true in much of the North.
Story_ID: 622343
Speaker 1: So, just to go back to where we were--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with respect to the recognition of the importance of diversity, were you--in your early years in school when you're the one of the few, what, what--were you at all feeling ostracized or, or separate or were you just part of the class and nobody really cared about your color?
Speaker 2: So, I would not say that I was ostracized. I sometimes felt different and part of that is just ignorance, you know. People not knowing that you're not different but also not knowing that there are differences. So, it works both ways. So, for many black people again growing up in the South or going back to the South or being part of a large family of people who come together to kind of exhale after being in the North is a way of life. That's not an experience that white people generally understand. They understand it probably in terms of going to the old country, but not in terms of being in your own country. So, I think you know the notion of, of the Great Migration you know that's now been the focus of books and the focus of art work for example, really brings home I think the importance of those travels back and forth and how they shape your, your interests. And so, I don't, I, I think I feel very, very much committed to making sure that people don't feel like outsiders in their experiences because I've had that. It shaped my own experiences growing up. Many, many times not feeling like an outsider, but sometimes feeling like one and really having to either conform or to define that outlying position. Or to remind people that, that there are differences.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your neighborhood in Passaic [New Jersey], the, the house and the--where you all broke the, broke the color barrier.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about your neighbors, about the street? You know, did you, I don't know play--
Speaker 2: We played ball outside. We, you know went over each other's houses. We--
Speaker 1: So, so, so the neighbors welcomed your family?
Speaker 2: Eventually. I, I could not say that that was the case the first year or two that we lived there. I think you know we warmed up because we lived together. The interesting part is that because this was a blue collar neighborhood, my mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] had a profound influence, not my father [Wallace J. Haddon] as much. My mother had a profound influence on the children in the neighborhood's interest in going to college, because they could see that you know we had things and an approach to life that was different. Or, later on when she was in high school, when she was a high school teacher [at Passaic High School, Passaic, New Jersey] you know they actually had her probably as teachers, as a teacher.
Speaker 1: The, the kids in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, may have, you know, not while I was there. But what I'm saying is that basically they knew that we were college ed- that my family was college educated and they had never had that experiences themselves. And so, we were basically the role models in many respects once we overcame the racial barrier.
Speaker 1: Do, do you remember whether there were any people on your block who became I don't know you know, drop over for tea or coffee or, or that your mother had--?
Speaker 2: My mother was not socializing with them. I mean that, that's not how, how it was but we certainly, the kids went to our house and I went to their homes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I did not spend the night though. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you didn't go out on the road trips with the football team?
Speaker 2: No, I did not (laughter).
Speaker 1: As a, as a cheerleader.
Speaker 2: Yeah. No.
Story_ID: 622344
Speaker 1: So, now we--you're going to college. As you approach your high school senior year [at Passaic High School, Passaic, New Jersey], what was your idea about what college you wanted to go to and what were your parents saying?
Speaker 2: My mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] thought Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] now, Hampton Institute at the time was the finest college in the world. She was very, very proud of her experience and so as I was talking about going north and going to women's colleges or thinking about major university, research universities predominantly, she said, "Well you know, I've been with you to visit some of these places and most of them can't hold a candle to Hampton." And so, what we did, both my brother [James Haddon] and me I think, but certainly me, we had to go visit Hampton and did go visit, I did, go visit Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and other colleges--
Speaker 1: HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, because she wanted me to make the choice in an informed way. So, one of the reasons why I actually went to Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts], there were two reasons ultimately connected to this. One was that they had a program abroad that was well established and I planned to go abroad. I did not, but I planned to go abroad at the time I was looking at the school. But the other was that they had a, a connection with HBCUs, so the thinking was that I would go for a semester. And my cousin actually went, Rachel's [HistoryMaker Rachel Noel] daughter, my cousin Angie [Angela Noel], went to Smith with me and that's another story. But she actually went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Oh so--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so, so that was the relationship between--with Smith and Spelman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had--well there, there were several black schools, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Several schools that, that had the cooperative exchange.
Speaker 2: That during the time--yes, uh-huh, um-hm. During the time we were looking at schools they were offering, they were starting to offer that as an option.
Speaker 1: Other than Smith, where else did you apply?
Speaker 2: I applied to all of the Seven Sisters and a couple of the others, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, I was like Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and Smith were the main ones that I was interested in.
Speaker 1: That was kind of expensive.
Speaker 2: To apply?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause you had to pay those application fees. So your mom and dad [Wallace J. Haddon]--
Speaker 2: Oh they didn't care.
Speaker 1: --they, they didn't, didn't raise a ruckus about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, not at all. No.
Speaker 1: And were you accepted at all of them?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. I, let's see, I was not accepted at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, so where were you accepted, Smith?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, did I--I, I'm not positive whether I applied to Mount Holyoke [Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts]. I--Smith and Wellesley were my main choices, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you applied to Radcliffe?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Barnard [Barnard College, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I think I never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so you--
Speaker 2: --finished the Barnard application. I really liked Smith, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't--okay. So, once you got into Smith you didn't really--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was between Smith and Wellesley and I went back and forth. My cousin and I both got accepted to Smith and Wellesley, so we went back and forth. And then I said I was going to Smith. She said she was going to Wellesley. Then she said, "Well I'm going to Smith. I ain't going to Wellesley." And then finally, I said, "Well, I'm going to Smith." And she said, "Well I'm going to Smith." So, we both went to Smith, which was interesting 'cause my mother and my--my mother and Aunt Rachel were overjoyed.
Speaker 1: That you were both going to the same school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 622345
Speaker 1: As you were growing up what did you want to be? Now before you get to college [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts], but what did you think you wanted to be say when you were in I don't know, junior high school, high school [Passaic High School, Passaic, New Jersey]? Did you have a career objective, something that you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: So, I actually thought about being a doctor. Somebody said, "Why--are you interested in being a nurse?" I said, "No, but I might like to be a doctor." I, I think I mentioned earlier my father [Wallace J. Haddon] said the dentist wasn't--being a dentist probably was not such a hot idea for women. I never really had any interest 'cause I worked in his office on the weekends so--for so many years. That was not something I was interested in.
Speaker 1: But your [maternal] uncle [Andrew W.E. Bassette III] was a doctor, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Internist?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, I--but I wasn't really, really strong in, in science or math for that matter, which is ironic since my mother [Ida Bassette Haddon] was strong in both of those things. So, it, it was very early that I thought that law was really the place that--for me.
Speaker 1: Before you got to college?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, very much, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and what made you focus on law?
Speaker 2: Because there are so many lawyers in my family. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And again your parents didn't encourage you one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't push it, unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: --one way or the other?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 622346
Speaker 1: So, at Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --tell me about those years. What--if, if, if you could sum it all up, how would you describe your experience at Smith?
Speaker 2: Intellectually stimulating. A real opportunity to kind of see myself as a strong individual with lots of opportunities. It was a very positive experience for me. One of the reasons was that I got involved in the Counselors of Smith [Board of Counselors of Smith College] and these were older women who came back and connected with different committees and areas of interest at Smith. And there was one that was focused on Afro American studies [African American Studies Committee] and I was active in getting the Afro American studies program going. So--
Speaker 1: There was no Afro American studies program before?
Speaker 2: It was during the years that I was there, yeah that it, it became an actual department. There were some courses available before that. So, I was on that counselors committee as a student transitioning into becoming a graduate.
Speaker 1: Were there any African American instructors at Smith?
Speaker 2: We, we pushed for them to happen and they actually happened in the year or two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before you left?
Speaker 2: --right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do, do you remember--?
Speaker 2: Yes. There were, there were a handful of people before then. Walter Morris Hale was one who actually was really influential in my intellectual focus and determination.
Speaker 1: What was his--
Speaker 2: He was--history. Afro American studies. And--but he was a historian, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Anyone else?
Speaker 2: Philip--not Afro--are you asking me African American?
Speaker 1: Well no, just--
Speaker 2: No. Yes.
Speaker 1: --instructors in general.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my major advisor and honors thesis advisor, Philip Green.
Speaker 1: Why was he--?
Speaker 2: He really encour- I, I wanted to, to look at politics.
Story_ID: 622347
Speaker 1: Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] has a--one, one of the other reasons why I went to Smith is that they have a connection with Washington, D.C., and so I was part of the, the, the group that, that worked for a congressman. I worked for Congressman Conyers.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you, you did an internship--
Speaker 1: John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.].
Speaker 2: --in, in the summer or for an entire semester?
Speaker 1: Well, it was an internship for summer that became a semester that became a--I worked after I graduated.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What was that like for, for you being in, in the, the hurly burly of--
Speaker 1: Washington (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Washington politics?
Speaker 1: Oh, I absolutely loved it. So, first of all the summer one, the internship part in the summer was a Smith, Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] and Mount Holyoke [Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts], I think venture. I think that's what it was. May have been Smith and Mount Holyoke. But at any rate, a number of my other friends who were also working for congress people who were African American so we all decided to live in one house.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So, there were six of us, six women in a three bedroom house with one bathroom in Washington, D.C. It was the most fun that I have ever had in my life probably.
Speaker 2: And probably a few parties?
Speaker 1: A few (laughter). But it was, it was really a great experience because we all were working for congress people, many African American but not all. And we really had a, a great, great summer. It was the Congressional Black Caucus event and lots of things going on.
Speaker 2: So, you--so, this was '72 [1972]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: So--um-hm.
Speaker 2: Did you ever run into Sylvester Bass [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he worked for the CBC--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And he was--
Speaker 1: So, I'm trying to remember the internship was--I'll have to look back at the dates 'cause I think I was still in school when I was in the internship. And then--
Speaker 2: And then you went to work--
Speaker 1: Went on--
Speaker 2: --aft- after--
Speaker 1: I went to work--I certainly went to work afterwards, um-hm.
Speaker 2: After graduation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, during that year is the year you applied to law school?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't, I didn't apply to law school 'til a little later.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't go immediately to law school.
Speaker 2: So, how long did you work for Congressman Conyers?
Speaker 1: Only, oh, only a half a year after law school.
Speaker 2: Oh after law school?
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: After college?
Speaker 1: No, after college. Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then what was your next job?
Speaker 1: Then I worked for the National Labor Relations Board.
Speaker 2: What did you do for NLRB?
Speaker 1: I was a hearing examiner and so, that was one of the reasons why I went to law school 'cause I thought I wasn't positive that's what I wanted to do, but I thought it was. And working for the National Labor Relations Board, I worked for two years, one in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and one in Cincinnati [Ohio]. My first one was in Cincinnati. I worked with lawyers because we investigated unfair labor practices and ran elections as a hearing examiner.
Speaker 2: And what was it about that job that, that, that pushed you towards law school [Duquesne University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Well, I worked directly with lawyers. I had always said to, to myself that I didn't want to practice but I liked law.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And so that exposed me to law more than had been my experience in undergraduate school. And it confirmed that that would be something I'd be interested in doing.
Story_ID: 622348
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I have to go back again. During your years on campus in college and to some extent your early years of employment coincided with student--
Speaker 2: Unrest? Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know demonstrations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and the rest of it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were you at all engaged and involved in any of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure very much.
Speaker 1: Which, which--?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we sat in with Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] and UMass [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: You, you were involved in all three of those?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You sat in at Amherst also?
Speaker 2: We actually were, oh god, I think we were locked in, in Amherst. I can't remember. My, my parents [Ida Bassette Haddon and Wallace J. Haddon] were not pleased. But it basically you know it's, it was to get more African American teachers, to get more courses.
Speaker 1: Were, did you do the Wesleyan [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut] sit in too?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No? You missed, you missed that one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew about it.
Speaker 1: Well what did your parents--?
Speaker 2: So, I actually--my, my experience at Wesleyan that is like that had to do with the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] 'cause the Black Panthers came on campus once we were in some event and the Black Panthers came in with guns. And I said, oh my god.
Speaker 1: That was your junior year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was probably was.
Speaker 1: That was the year after I had left.
Speaker 2: Ooh.
Speaker 1: I heard about that.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Gene Lang.
Speaker 2: They were--yeah, yeah. They were serious.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That was a bit beyond my--
Speaker 1: --George Walker [ph.] I think.
Speaker 2: --comfort zone, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: George Jett, you remember George--
Speaker 1: George Jett, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of them went west.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know they did, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, you, you were fine with sitting down to protest for African American studies, but the Black Panthers were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a bit beyond mine--
Speaker 1: --was a bridge too far?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right. Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so you removed yourself from Wesleyan protests?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What did your parents say about your activism?
Speaker 2: They said they, they paid my tuition and if they, if I wanted to do that kind of thing I had to do it on my own.
Speaker 1: So, they threatened to--
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: --to cut the--?
Speaker 2: Oh certainly.
Speaker 1: Did they actually do that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 622349
Speaker 1: You know with the fullness of time, how do you, how did that period of your life, that aspect of your college education, I don't know shape who you are, shape your, your world view, your political view?
Speaker 2: I believed that it was shaped profoundly by my experience in a women's college. I think that I always felt that I was as smart or better than most people that I interacted with. But at a women's college you didn't really have to worry about impressing anybody or primping or--I, I think the other part of it, as I reflect, is that I had grown up in high school [Passaic High School, Passaic, New Jersey] being in predominantly white environments in school and having social opportunities outside of high school in the, the larger North Jersey [New Jersey] black community. And so, I, I, I basically replicated that in college, you know. I studied during the week and then I went to different campuses or my own campus and socialized with other African American people on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Did you develop relationships with your white classmates at Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Sure. Sure. I had roommates. The--my first roommate was somebody that I've kept in contact with. Not, you know we don't see each other all the time but she's in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we keep in contact. And there were four or five other people that we have come together even now because they're in the area.
Speaker 1: And obviously--well I don't know if it's obvious but you have retain--remained in contact with your social--
Speaker 2: My African American (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) African American friends.
Speaker 2: --ones yes, for sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From all of those schools up there.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah, so, it was a nice wet- network. It's a network that continues to, to thrive. It's a network that I enjoy when I come to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] as well.
Story_ID: 622350
Speaker 1: Did you keep a, a diary or a journal during your college years [at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When I went to Europe I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you go to Europe? This is before or after law school?
Speaker 2: I'd been several times--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --so I think I went maybe one summer, the--before--
Speaker 1: Before law school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went before college.
Speaker 1: Oh, before college?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But I've been several times and I actually lived in Japan you know. Did I say that in there (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No. When did you live in Japan?
Speaker 2: So, Temple [Temple University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] has a program so as a, a member of the faculty--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --my husband [Frank M. McClellan] and I went there.
Speaker 1: Well once--okay, this--so we--yeah, you haven't mentioned that because we haven't gotten to Temple yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We, we're going to get there though.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, law school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where did you apply? Where did you go?
Speaker 2: So, again I was working at the NLRB, National Labor Relations Board in Phil- in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]. Did I say Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], 'cause it's Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Okay, yes, in Pittsburgh. And--
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh and Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, in Pittsburgh I was working for the National Labor Relations Board but I had a, again a social life that was informed by the social organizations that I belonged to. And, [HistoryMaker] Ronald Davenport was dean of the law school. He was the first African American dean of a major law school in the country and so--and I was married at the time. And my husband at the time, Thurman Northcross, was going to Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. And so, I was working and the dean, Ron Davenport, said that he would give me a full scholarship if I would come to Duquesne [Duquesne University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. I applied to Pitt [University of Pittsburgh School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] as well and Pitt had a minority serving program, and the reason why I did not go to Pitt is because a part of the condition of going to the minority serving program was to take one less course and I'm sure that was meant to support students who they felt were not capable of doing the work. But that was insulting to me. There was nothing in my background that would say that I wouldn't succeed. I--not a single thing. And so, I did not go to Pitt. I went to Duquesne, and I've never looked back on that. I was editor in chief of the law review. I was very, very active. I had wonderful clerkship opportunities afterwards. I clerked for a judge who was a Republican and conservative, but a very fair minded person. My summers were with major law firms. So, you know I know as a law professor that law schools are very hierarchical and so, some would have said that that was not a good decision, because Duquesne compared to other law schools that I might have applied to at a different time you know is not prestigious in name but I've had great experiences.
Speaker 1: So, your clerkship with Judge Weis [Joseph F. Weis, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was that while you were in school or afterwards?
Speaker 2: No, that's afterwards. I had a--
Speaker 1: Full time clerkship?
Speaker 2: --two--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How, what--
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Well, how--oh two years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any cases that you worked on?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there were a couple of cases that were just wonderful and, and also really, really convinced me that I wanted to teach law. One involved a 1981 case, which is a case related to the use of race. It was a, a 1866 Civil Rights Act case [Civil Rights Act of 1866].
Speaker 1: Section 1981--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of the U.S. Code?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And it, it involved conspiracy and we created a theory that really supported that case and, and it was in part because I literally spent lots and lots of time when I was at a summer clerkship reading about the 1981. So, I was able to convince the judge or help him to shape the argument related to using 1981 in the case.
Speaker 1: And I assume it, it--
Speaker 2: I taught, I taught that course when I went to law school, 1981.
Speaker 1: Was, was--
Speaker 2: When I went to teach in the law school.
Speaker 1: And, and so this circuit court of appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] ruling stands. It wasn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It wasn't challenged. What was the case? You can't tell me?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll have to find out. I'll, I'll have to go back and look (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh you can't remember. Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the name of the case.
Speaker 1: What did you--so, so you say you decided as a result of clerking for Judge Weis--
Speaker 2: Weis, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that you wanted to teach law.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why did you decide you wanted to teach law as opposed to--?
Speaker 2: Practice law?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I had practiced during the summers as a summer associate. And as I said earlier I think I never wanted to practice. That was never an interest of mine though I liked the law. And so, higher education was the, you know, a logical way to go.
Story_ID: 622351
Speaker 1: What did you do after your clerkship with Judge Weis [Joseph F. Weis, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: I had a, a couple of offers for law firms, one was in Washington [D.C.], Wilmer Cutler and Pickering [Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP] and the other was Reed Smith [Reed Smith LLP] where I had clerked during my summers, one of my summers.
Speaker 1: Where was--that was also in Washington?
Speaker 2: No, that was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you elected to go to Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was--
Speaker 2: So, that was a no brainer because I had had wonderful times as an intern in Washington.
Speaker 1: And there were a lot of your friends living and working (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lot of my friends were living right there.
Speaker 1: In Washington.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I, I think that all of, all of us from that era probably at one point wanted to go to D.C.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was my goal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, what was the nature of the work that you were doing for Wilmer--well, first of all what kind of firm was it, a corporate law firm or--
Speaker 2: So, Wilmer--
Speaker 1: --political lobbying or--?
Speaker 2: Wilmer prided itself as being somewhat different than the run of the mill, big, huge corporate firms. They had a lot of civil rights connections. Many of the people came from very, very profoundly impressive clerkships and made their way there. And the, the, the firm was actually founded by a group that split from a New York [New York] firm. And they really wanted to have a better experience for their clerks, but also for themselves as partners. So, they did have opportunities for people to take time off. Actually, you could take a sabbatical after a number of years and many of the people did things like take bike tours through Europe or you know go study wine making or do very interesting things because they thought that you know the well rounded lawyer was better than a lawyer who only walk--worked nine to five [o'clock]. So, it was hard working there but it was also a place where people really appreciated being part of the city, being civically engaged to being real parts of their families, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Did they do much pro bono work?
Speaker 2: They did a lot of pro bono work and they encouraged their associates to do that as well.
Speaker 1: So, what kind of work did you do in your early months there?
Speaker 2: I did the, the gamut. So, you know whatever was assigned to me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Memos and research?
Speaker 2: Yeah. A lot of memos and research. I, I actually went to court once. Yes, I went to court and I said--I had prepared the papers and I said, "May it please the court," and the, the judge asked one question and adjourned.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That was it. So, I'm--I can't say that I am a, a very experienced trial lawyer, but I wrote lots of memos.
Speaker 1: So, that meant that you were obviously a member of the federal bar?
Speaker 2: I was part--I, I took the D.C. bar yes. I took both the Pennsylvania and the D.C. bar.
Speaker 1: The D.C.
Speaker 2: And I took the D.C. bar having gotten the job offer at Wilmer after saying I don't need to, to waive in. There was an opportunity to waive in earlier and I did not so I had to take the D.C. bar.
Speaker 1: Oh wait, back up. Say that again.
Speaker 2: After I graduated from, from law school [Duquesne University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], I took the Pennsylvania bar. And at that point, they go back and forth, but at that point Washington, D.C. allowed you to waive in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, without taking the second one.
Speaker 2: --without taking the bar. And I--
Speaker 1: And, and why, and why you didn't--why didn't you do that?
Speaker 2: It cost three hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: So, as a result of not spending that three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that was one of the brighter things that I've done in my life.
Speaker 1: I, I, I hear that wry--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --that wry wit. Then how much did you have to pay to take it?
Speaker 2: I cannot even, I, I don't even know. It was ridiculous.
Speaker 1: But the law firm paid (unclear)?
Speaker 2: But the number--yeah, and the time that it took.
Speaker 1: And the time that it took.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Could have just waived it.
Speaker 2: And to take another bar.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, my, my--the other part of my Wilmer experience is that John Payton was there. He was my classmate at Wilmer. He's the head of, he used to be head of the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh he was?
Speaker 2: Yeah and he was--
Speaker 1: So, he was--
Speaker 2: --he was also a partner at Wilmer and he--we were really good friends.
Story_ID: 622352
Speaker 1: Well so, so you were there for two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: That, that really wasn't what I wanted to do with my life but, but I was thoroughly happy there. The dean of the law school of, at Temple [Temple University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Peter Liacouras, recruited me. And--
Speaker 1: How did he know about you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) he recruited me because my now husband [Frank M. McClellan], but at the time, friend, suggested that I, I might be interested in teaching.
Speaker 1: And, and how did--was he teaching there at the time himself?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see. And, and where did you meet?
Speaker 2: At Duquesne [Duquesne University School of Law] in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, was he in law school there?
Speaker 2: No, he the, the--he was a faculty member there, yeah. So, I got to be good friends with him then. I had actually written a, a law review article with him at that time.
Speaker 1: And you were, and you, after Duquesne you were clerking with the appeals court [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] and decided you would prefer to teach?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, but you still took the law firm job for the resume (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because most people--yeah, yeah. Most people do that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, now when you go to Temple--
Speaker 2: So, most people, those days in particular, had clerkship and also some, some experience if they were going into law teaching.
Speaker 1: And if you're at that huge firm, Wilmer Cutler and Pickering [Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP], you were probably making some nice coin?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But to go teaching you probably took a pay cut?
Speaker 2: Probably not. I mean I think I was around the same amount.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you, you got a full time faculty position right off the bat?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tenure track?
Speaker 2: Tenure track.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, the--
Speaker 1: And you had no prior teaching experience?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well how did you manage that? I mean I know you're smart, but--
Speaker 2: I interviewed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, I had the clerkship--many people go straight--so, many people go from a court of appeals clerkship to a firm.
Speaker 1: Oh, to a firm or, or--
Speaker 2: Or to teaching.
Speaker 1: --to teaching.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These days it's much more competitive and so [U.S.] Supreme Court clerkship is often you know one of the indications or a practice. But many, many people go to law firms.
Story_ID: 622353
Speaker 1: My notes indicate that you were also deputy director of the Philadelphia Re- Redevelopment Authority.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that co- contiguous or at the same time as you're teaching at Temple [Temple University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I took a, a leave of absence.
Speaker 1: Oh, you took a leave of absence from Temple (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: After six years?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: To do--then why did you do that?
Speaker 2: I wanted some other experience.
Speaker 1: Okay. But--
Speaker 2: So, let me think if that's right.
Speaker 1: It says '87 [1987] to '90 [1990].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But you were at Temple from '81 [1981] to 2009.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took the, I took--
Speaker 1: Except for those, except for those three years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was offered a position there. I had done some, some outside work with a, a person at the, at, at the redevelopment authority.
Speaker 1: Joyce?
Speaker 2: Yeah. No, no, I hired her.
Speaker 1: Oh you hired Joyce?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Small--
Speaker 2: I did the, the executive director, I had done some work with him and so he asked me would I be interested in doing that. I was pregnant during one of those two years. So, it was going to be a one year thing and it was two years.
Speaker 1: What was it about the redevelopment authority that attracted you to it?
Speaker 2: You know I just wanted some other experience, the kind of real world type of experience. And he offered me the deputy executive position and it was as a result of my having been a hearing officer at a couple of different things and so, it was a great opportunity. He also was looking for some other people so I hired, I encouraged Charisse to come, Charisse Lillie [HistoryMaker Charisse R. Lillie]. I encouraged Joyce Wilkerson and Pat, you remember Pat Smith [Patricia L. Smith]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, the three of us, the three of them and I were at the redevelopment authority.
Speaker 1: The New England gang--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was great.
Speaker 1: --reunited.
Speaker 2: It was fabulous.
Speaker 1: So, so give me an example of, of some of the projects or maybe one of the most significant projects that you worked on with the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority? I see you did mixed use communities.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We talked fairly about the weed and seed deal, which didn't exactly go too well in one particular instance. But--
Speaker 2: Right. But it really--we did make many of the decisions about which housing to preserve, where to put some of the federal money that came through Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and also what new community type opportunities--like for Pat Smith for example, she did the fields, the, the--using vacant properties to develop new, new parks and things like that. Charisse was general counsel so--or that's not, that--I don't think that was her term, her--the, the, the position name but she did straight legal work. I, I was doing more of the administrative work.
Speaker 1: And what was Joyce doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Joyce, Joyce was in the, the legal office too, the counsel office.
Speaker 1: Joyce is not a lawyer though?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a lawyer.
Speaker 1: She is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that. Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, she went to one of the California schools [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 622354
Speaker 1: So, this is the year you have, somewhere along the way you got divorced [from Thurman Northcross] and then you got remarried [to Frank M. McClellan]?
Speaker 2: Yes. So (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I, I forgot that so, yeah. And, and so this is your, your daughter [Cara McClellan]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got remarried like ten years later, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --quite a while.
Speaker 1: So, this is your daughter who's born.
Speaker 2: Yes, my daughter was born in 1988, is that right?
Speaker 1: Oh. Oh, then this was not during your Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority days?
Speaker 2: Oh yes. Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, that's ninety--
Speaker 2: What is it? I don't even know what day--
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987] to '90 [1990].
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 1: So, your daughter was born in '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Didn't I say that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, at some point you decide to go back to Temple [Temple University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was just there for, I was just taking a leave.
Speaker 1: Oh, just, just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Now--
Speaker 2: I always intended to go back.
Speaker 1: So, when you went back were you going back as a full professor or was that when you became--weren't you like an assistant dean or something at Temple for a minute?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, you never--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that's the, that's the interesting part of my career, I never wanted to be the--
Speaker 1: An administrator?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't. I wanted to be a president though.
Speaker 1: The pres- you wanted to be--
Speaker 2: I never wanted to be a law administrator. I wanted to be a president. I really wanted to be a president. I went to the Bryn Mawr school [HERS Institute at Bryn Mawr], a leadership school. It's women only.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was about ten years ago, and that's when I really uttered the words that I wanted to be a president. And I went there because it, it's sort of like the experience with the redevelopment authority. I needed a change. But I never wanted to be dean of the, of a law school. So, I actually applied and got to the finalist position of about five or six and--five or six presidencies after going to Bryn Mawr. And then you know just made the decision that this was clearly not going to happen unless I had some more administrative experience. I was trying to use the redevelopment administrative experience as my experience.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And that wasn't going to work.
Speaker 1: Academia.
Speaker 2: I got to the end each time though so it was very, very frustrating and I actually was the one of two for Bryn Mawr presidency.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Which is--would have been at that time, that would have been my dream job.
Story_ID: 622355
Speaker 1: Before we get to your not so dream job, but a necessary step, Maryland [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland], tell me about the, the writings, the, the re- academic, what is this, a rite of parish [sic. passage] kind of thing that professors have to do.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You did a, a lot of articles.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I saw one called 'Rethinking Juries' [sic. 'Rethinking the Jury,' Phoebe A. Haddon].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that about, the role of African Americans, what, what was on your mind? What prompted you to write that article?
Speaker 2: So, I looked at the history of juries and really focused on the need for diversity in juries and really thinking about how they can be socially, socially useful, how they can, how they are part of how we think about democracy and so how important it is for them to be diverse.
Speaker 1: So, how lacking in diversity--
Speaker 2: They have been in the past and they need to con- they need to be diverse in order for us to really have people feel confident about our system because that's the one place that people interact as a group and make decisions and they are actually participating in democracy.
Speaker 1: But when you have--I forgot the term--mandatory, not mandatory strikes but where each lawyer can wipe out X number of people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --just, just for any reason or no reason--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that usually in a jury pool, it takes care of at least 60 percent of the African Americans who show up.
Speaker 2: Right. So, this was designed to have us think about what are the kinds of ways that are also important to, to preserve in preemptory strikes. And what are important ways for us to rethink how preemptory strikes should be used or other kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So, so, so tell me what is, what is, what is this new paradigm that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I, I was, I was saying that that needed to--
Speaker 1: Needed to be.
Speaker 2: --need to happen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Need happen but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you didn't have a solution for?
Speaker 2: Well, I looked at different models and talked about different, different models--
Speaker 1: So tell--
Speaker 2: --whether it be limited numbers or whether it be cause or, or how we would define what cause is.
Speaker 1: So you would, so you would limit the number of preemptive strikes? You would reduce--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the number from where they are currently?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Depending on the kind of case it is?
Speaker 2: Yes. But you know they've mostly been used to, against us but they also have been used by us as, as people interested in making sure that there is a diverse jury.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: I think the biggest problem actually and what I was talking about in the context of the study of juries is that people have to believe that they have a role to play in democracy through juries. So, you know most of us try to avoid jury duty as opposed to going.
Speaker 1: And is, is it, is it avoidance or is it also the necessity that folks have to work two jobs and they can't take the time off?
Speaker 2: Right, so that's some of the things that I talked about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the payment that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the payment that you get for jury service is like (makes sound).
Speaker 2: Right. Right. So, those are the kinds of things that I talked about in the article, but also I had been on several commissions related to this.
Speaker 1: Do you--so this article was written in '94 [1994], twenty- (makes sound).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, long time ago.
Speaker 1: A while ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Have you seen anything that gives you an, an indication that things are changing or--?
Speaker 2: I think that, that juries are--I think because cities have become increasingly more segregated, I think that they're worse now. You know it's--the issues are worse. I also know that the federal courts are very different and so they're--while I was clerking [for Joseph F. Weis, Jr.], I had a conversation with a couple of judges who said that they had never seen black people in a federal courtroom. And they basically never seen black juries in a federal courtroom because the jury pool for the state court system and the jury pool for the federal court system are two different things.
Speaker 1: I know that state courts pull off voter rolls. What do federal courts pull from?
Speaker 2: They do that too, but they are also using court rolls from different places and they may be all white in some situations. And so, if you find yourself in that courtroom you know, there may not be any black people there.
Speaker 1: And the obvious question, why is it important for there to be diversity in jury pools? Why?
Speaker 2: Because I think those perspectives, just as I was talking earlier about people not having the same experiences in life and it, it--they aren't necessarily racial, they just are a consequence of culture or a consequence of geography. But they don't have the same understanding of what works in life. I think we've seen that certainly in a number of the cases, Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896] and other cases.
Speaker 1: Er- Garner [Eric Garner]--
Speaker 2: More recently like Charlottesville [Virginia], we, we see that people don't have the same situational opportunities to think about race and culture.
Speaker 1: Did your article also focus on the grand jury pools?
Speaker 2: No, I did not talk about that. I did--I have done a couple of research projects related to the grand jury.
Speaker 1: Because when you look at the Errol Garner [sic.] case--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's one example.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Story_ID: 622356
Speaker 1: You go to the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law [Baltimore, Maryland] in 2009.
Speaker 2: So, I went to the University of Maryland [University of Maryland School of Law] and I'm making that distinction because the name Francis King Carey was brought in as a result of a gift that I got as dean, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh. Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: So, the Carey Foundation, W.P. Carey Foundation in New York City [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Is that an investment firm?
Speaker 2: They do all kinds of different things, huge though. Huge corporation. That's a corporation that stems from the Carey family that actually came from Maryland. And the W.P. part of Carey wanted to leave something to Maryland and I didn't know him, but he knew one of my faculty members, Joe Tydings [Joseph Tydings]. You know that name, Senator Tydings?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Millard Tydings was a senator, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep. And--
Speaker 1: That would have been his father or grandfather (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, yeah. And so--
Speaker 1: There's a bridge [Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge]--
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, Tydings called me and said that he wanted me to meet W.P. Carey [William P. Carey] and that this would be a really great opportunity. And so, we made the arrangements for that meeting and then he was not able to go. So, this is Joe Tydings and he says, he, he was not able to go but I should go anyway because we're going to have lunch, Bill Carey and I, and it's going to be a wonderful opportunity. I said, "You mean he's going to give me a gift?" And he said, "Yeah." He said--I said, "Ten thousand dollars?" And he said, "Think big." And I said, "Twenty thousand dollars?" And he said, "Think big." I said, "A hundred thousand dollars?" And he said, "Think big," click. So, I went to this lunch and we started talking at thirty million, yeah. Yeah. It was just an unbelievable, unbelievable (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you'd never met him before?
Speaker 2: No. I had lunch with him. I visited him after that clearly and you know, continued to visit him until he died. I was--
Speaker 1: If you had another child you'd have named--
Speaker 2: He was very, he was very, very ill the last time I saw him. I went to his funeral, spoke at his funeral. That was just an amazing, amazing thing. I spoke at his funeral and his brother, Frank [Francis J. Carey], and I became really good friends. His, his brother Frank just died.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So, yeah. Yeah, last year.
Speaker 1: Were they related to the, the Governor Carey [Hugh Carey] of New York?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Different Careys?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, so Francis King Carey is their great-grandfather [sic. grandfather], yeah.
Speaker 1: So, of all of the places--
Speaker 2: He had gone to--so, the connection is he had gone to, to Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so all the--so the, they wanted it to go to the university or it could have gone anywhere?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it could have gone any--no, they wanted it to go to, to the university because their, their great-grandfather had gone there, Francis King Carey.
Speaker 1: And they elected to put it in the law school. Was, was their great-grandfather an attorney?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah he had gone to the school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, he went to the law school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so how long had you been--
Speaker 2: Gone to the, let's see, yeah I--well, he had gone to the school, the University of Maryland.
Speaker 1: And so how long had you been dean when, when this fortuitous event occurred?
Speaker 2: Not long.
Speaker 1: So you, so, so--
Speaker 2: So, maybe third year maybe, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and--but--so let's back up.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I, I was dean five years there.
Speaker 1: How did you go about applying for the deanship at that school or why did you apply to Maryland as opposed to I don't know some other law school?
Speaker 2: At that point people were calling me about would I be interested in deans.
Speaker 1: So, more than one school was calling you about deanships?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I really didn't want to be a dean, but I also had begun to understand that I wasn't going to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You would never get to president.
Speaker 2: Right, unless I was a dean. So, I, I went ahead and put my name in for that. I went for Rutgers [Rutgers University - Camden, Camden, New Jersey] actually and I went to the finalist for both of them and decided to go to, to Maryland.
Speaker 1: And, and your former colleague, that was someone from Temple [Temple University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: My former colleague?
Speaker 1: The, the colleague who put you in touch with Tydings?
Speaker 2: No, no, this was, this was somebody in the law school.
Speaker 1: At University of Maryland?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 622357
Speaker 1: You also wrote about the law school bubble, how long would it last if students can't pay their bills.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm very, very concerned about student debt and the restructuring of law schools and law firms. Not law schools but the restructuring of law firms and businesses related to law. And during the last ten years, the costs of education period, but the costs of legal education has really gone up. And particularly at the time of the bubble, there were fewer and fewer law opportunities and the bubble broke basically. And so, my job was really to think, rethink what opportunities there were. So, I got involved in several commissions. One was the ABA Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice. It was something actually that I had looked at about ten years earlier in a different context but had worked on thinking through what a--at the time I was involved through the ABA [American Bar Association], but in a different context of thinking about what kinds of ways lawyers should be using their skills with other folks. The commission looked at it and made a recommendation that we should be able to work with other professions. As you probably know there are lots of limitations on what lawyers can do that, that would involve the work of other people.
Speaker 1: Explain. Example. Example, one example.
Speaker 2: So, for example there are lots of things that people from Deloitte [Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited] or certain other kinds of business firms can do with lawyers, but they can't do by themselves. And so, what had happened was many of the law firms were starting to bring in people as consultants. They wanted to bring the people into the firm itself and there were prohibitions against bringing them into the practice of law even though you could work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cer- like certain investment banker types?
Speaker 2: Yeah, investment banker, consulting firms and the like.
Story_ID: 622358
Speaker 1: So we started out talking about student debt.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you were telling me about something else you were looking at with respect to a multidisciplinary--
Speaker 2: Disciplinary opportunities to practice and to engage with other professionals.
Speaker 1: And to what--
Speaker 2: Which is something that I had studied earlier in my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what, what, what would be the benefit for, for attorneys, for the other professions, for society if that were to happen?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it--problem solving is multipronged and having the expertise of other people working with you in problem solving, we know that that's a good thing. And coming from different backgrounds, different ways of thinking about a quantitative and qualitative. So, it made perfect sense to me but there are barriers for lawyers to what they can do with other participants in the business world that were preventing those kinds of close relationships to happen.
Speaker 1: But the other thing--
Speaker 2: With the downturn in the business area, what was that now ten years ago, many of the law firms were struggling to survive because they weren't getting the large fees that they needed to support the number of lawyers that they had to hire as opposed to other people to do the, quote non-lawyering work. And so, what happened was law schools started to lose enrollment. At the same time, they had in plusher times increased tuition. So, we had high tuition, low enrollment and--
Speaker 1: In terms of paying lower salaries?
Speaker 2: Right, right for some of the lawyers going into the firms, and hiring fewer of them. So that you had the higher tuition which in flush, more flush times people were able to go into debt for because they could go into a law, a large law firm or into a lucrative business and actually pay that debt. The debt continued to escalate, the jobs continued to constrict and so, we had a really--and continue to have a real student debt problem.
Speaker 1: And has there been a leveling of tuition costs for law schools?
Speaker 2: There has been a real effort to level tuition costs but they're high, in part because many of the faculty are tenured faculty. So, there will be some constriction, but also we have ABA [American Bar Association] and other requirements that leave us having to have courses available to students that multiply the number of staffing needs.
Story_ID: 622359
Speaker 1: Well, the other aspect of, of that conundrum that you've discussed is the judicial gap, which has to do with the fact that so many Americans have no access to legal assistance.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At a time when lawyers--what, there are few lawyer, there are fewer lawyers?
Speaker 2: Yes. So, that led to another commission. The ABA [American Bar Association] commissioned another group and I was part of that group as well to look at that gap. And it really was concerned with should there be allowed and what would these look like, alternatives to legal services. So, for example should law firms be able to use some other people who are trained as lawyers for two--trained in the law for a couple of years or for a year or are paralegals as we call them or operate without a law degree but have some particular legal expertise, should they be able to provide some of the services that we have said should only be provided for by lawyers who have passed the bar.
Speaker 1: And then I think you, you, you, you gave an example in that address you made to the AL--American Law Institute (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) ALI, yes.
Speaker 1: American Law Institute of some of the innovative measures that have been attempted in some locations, something called a limited license legal technician?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well what was that?
Speaker 2: So, that would be somebody who was trained for a, a, a shorter period of time and could do specifically defined tasks that don't need to be done by a lawyer but have been in the past--
Speaker 1: Such as--
Speaker 2: --lawyer work.
Speaker 1: --intake?
Speaker 2: Yeah, intake, some research, some contract writing, things like that.
Speaker 1: And why is, why were you focused on that gap, that deficit in legal assistance for--?
Speaker 2: Because poor people and people of color are often the ones that can't get the, the adequate legal assistance. And people who live in rural areas can't get to a lawyer. So, some of what we talked about in the commission [ABA Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice] was actually having in the library resources that could be used, including screens that could connect them to lawyers elsewhere to provide the services. Or in these days of technology, could give them the opportunity to use some limited research to find out whether they have a legal problem. So, the first step is deciding that you have a legal problem and many people don't realize that they have a legal problem until it's too late.
Speaker 1: So, this is preliminary pro se assistance?
Speaker 2: At some--it's pro se, it's as we said limited assistance by a professional who is not a lawyer. It's the, the group based work that I was talking about so it would be a businessperson and a lawyer maybe working together.
Speaker 1: You're thinking about new paradigms for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, new paradigms to address the legal needs that are going, wanting now because of price or because of access.
Speaker 1: I recently saw a story of a, a group of people, mostly young people, mostly minorities but not all, showing up in a courtroom, the judge comes in, there's one court appointed attorney and everybody pleads guilty to--it was like a, it was like a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: Have, have you heard of that?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 2: Terrible.
Speaker 1: I've never seen anything like that before and why did they do it? Because the court appointed attorney tells them well if you want a trial you're going to wait--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --X amount of time. They can't post bail.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they're going to--
Speaker 1: So, they, so, they're going to be sitting in jail (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --waiting for their--
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --for their trial.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Meanwhile this court appointed attorney has twenty people or more--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on his--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on his dock- on his caseload.
Speaker 2: Right, right. So, that can't be effective assistance.
Speaker 1: Of course not.
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: But that's what's happening.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is. And so, this, this report that we did looked at the question of access and assistance that is effective or not.
Speaker 1: Who is raising the issue of the unconstitutionality you know, everybody's supposed to have a lawyer allegedly, right? Your legal, your--you have a right to legal counsel.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: If you got--
Speaker 2: But people can waive that and in the waiver you can also you know, create other alternatives. And again you know, if the choice is going to jail or you know sitting--having to pay bail, you know there are lots and lots of stories of people who have you know just traffic tickets and wind up you know in the same kind of situation. Yeah, the legal system is, is still in need of some repair. The two commissions that I was talking about are really the places where people are having those conversations at least. And you know I, I, I came resisting the, the idea of you know rethinking this notion of multidisciplinary practice, but I think that it's certainly time and there are a number of states that now have embraced this ABA commission report.
Story_ID: 622360
Speaker 1: So, you retired from the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law [Baltimore, Maryland] in 2014?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't retire, I left.
Speaker 1: You left?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, I, I--my term was up, so I didn't go for a second term.
Speaker 1: Oh. And, and had you applied for the job of chancellor at Rutgers University?
Speaker 2: Actually it happened within the same month or so. It's kind of interesting. I was planning to come back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. My husband [Frank M. McClellan] did the commuting. You know we had a house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) While you were in Maryland?
Speaker 2: --in Philadelphia but I lived in Maryland and, and he commuted. And so, you know five years was enough of that. So, I was returning to Phila- Philadelphia and thinking about what I was going to do next and the--there, there were a couple of other things but this offer came through and I really thought this was the best place for me.
Speaker 1: It was what you wanted.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah. Now I'm the, the chancellor or president and I get to do the kinds of things that I was in training for all these many years.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five hundred students you have?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How many faculty (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-seven hundred now. We're actually in growth mode, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. How many faculty?
Speaker 2: Sixty, yeah. Sixty-five.
Speaker 1: And what are your goals and objectives as the chancellor of Rutgers University - Camden [Camden, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Well, to grow and we are part of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, but there are actually three campuses, Newark [Rutgers University - Newark, Newark, New Jersey], Camden and New Brunswick [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey]. And it's evolved into a system since I've been there so it really it is a situation where I am the president in, in terms of being the CEO, the chief CEO, but we interact with the other universities. And so, we now have a--one law school that is in Newark as well as Camden and so it's a new innovation of bringing them together (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When did the law school open in Camden?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: When did the law school open in--so there wasn't always a law school in Camden?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh. But now it's the same law school?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were two separate law schools, one in Newark and one in, in Camden. So, now it's the Rutgers Law School. So, I helped finish that reorganization 'cause I think it makes sense to have one Rutgers Law School. And we also have opened a nursing program and have a brand new nursing and science building that is up and running and--
Speaker 1: So, so, so there are two nursing schools then, one in Newark--?
Speaker 2: There is, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: At the University of Maryland--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --University of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of Rutgers.
Speaker 2: New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Rutgers University.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, Rutgers University has several different campuses, some of which have multiple schools. And so, the--some of which have the same school. So, in some case we're talking about merging like the law school, which I am a big proponent of. I think that that makes sense. In other situations the need to preserve the locality is important. So, for example in nursing, the profession is very local focused as to some, some people would say in business. So, understanding the culture, the local culture, understanding the, the clients and constituencies are much more localized than in law perhaps. And so, we have a separate business school, we have a separate nursing school and, and we have a separate arts and science school in Camden. So, my aim is to grow those schools.
Speaker 2: Do you--if--so, you have been a law school dean. You're now university president. You have been a professor. You have been an attorney.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You've been--
Speaker 1: Public official.
Speaker 2: Public official.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What do you call yourself?
Speaker 1: I believe essentially I am higher education focused. I believe in the importance of education. I am civically engaged in all of those entities that I have been involved in. I believe that our cities can't thrive without having good leadership and so for me, both Maryland and Rutgers have--has been a place where I can participate in increasing the civic engagement of our students and our faculty and staff in much same way as I did at the redevelopment authority [Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority] or quite frankly in the law firms that I participated in.
Story_ID: 622361
Speaker 1: I read another speech where you were talking about that there's not a dichotomy between civic engagement and private enterprise, that if you're were doing one it doesn't mean that you should frown upon (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To--that's right.
Speaker 1: --or knocking the other but that they should--
Speaker 2: They have to be. They have to marry because you need both the entrepreneurial focus as well as the commitment and investment in the city. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and if, I don't know--is, is this the, the patent philosophy of civic engagement?
Speaker 2: So, I think that liberal arts used to be inward and similarly research universities have been inward looking. Civic engagement makes us be more committed to look outward and so there are other universities that are doing the same thing. I think, I happen to think that Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] is very committed to being outward looking. And we believe that the liberal arts are enriched, not diminished by that outward looking focus. So, being connected to the city is critical. You get to be engaged in real life problem solving and they benefit the--your problem solvings benefit the people that are surrounding you and promoting your, your ability to thrive as an institution.
Speaker 1: And promoting the ability of society to thrive because if an institution is just on a hill--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --separate from--
Speaker 2: That's right, in a lab (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) everyone else.
Speaker 2: Right, right. And so Rutgers - Camden [Rutgers University - Camden, Camden, New Jersey] was a very small school. As I said, we're growing. But story after story came to me when I first came to be chancellor about particularly first generation, at that time white people coming into Rutgers and into Camden [New Jersey] from South Jersey [New Jersey] and thriving because they had the interest and the, the connection with one lab member of the faculty, laboratory scientist or one social scientist or someone who took the time to teach that person problem solving skills. And so, I think that we have a commitment in many ways that is stronger than other liberal arts institutions to do that kind of work, to reach out to first generation students. Now many of them African American and black, but not all. Many people, working class people whose parents have had maybe a little bit of, of academic and college experience but not necessarily having graduated and to thrive in this small, small environment.
Story_ID: 622362
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that you had visited Japan.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this was when you were at Temple [Temple University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and what was that for? What was that about?
Speaker 2: So, my husband [Frank M. McClellan] and I split a faculty position and took our daughter [Cara McClellan] who was at the time in fifth grade and we went for a semester that Temple offers. So, it's TUJ it's called (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what were you--?
Speaker 2: Temple University, Japan [Temple University, Japan Campus].
Speaker 1: When you say you split a faculty position what does that mean?
Speaker 2: We taught. We taught at, a TUJ. We're talking--
Speaker 1: Oh in, in, in Japan?
Speaker 2: Yes. And we--
Speaker 1: Oh, Temple has a campus in Japan?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes. Very small but yes. Right in the city, right in Tokyo [Japan].
Speaker 1: So, that must have been quite--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was amazing. It was amazing.
Speaker 1: Did your daughter learn to speak any Japanese?
Speaker 2: A little bit, (speaking Japanese) "(Unclear)," as she says, but not much. But she also went to a, a, a school that was not the American school, it was a school that was international. Sixty--sixty-six, sixty-six countries were represented at this school that she went to. And so she actually went to Yale undergraduate school [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and when she got to Yale she saw some of her friends from this school, Seisen School [Seisen International School, Tokyo, Japan]. It was so wonderful. But also because we split it, we had lots of free time so I went to the school and you know worked with them and we took lots and lots of trips all over Asia.
Story_ID: 622363
Speaker 1: Forgot to mention that you also have a master of laws degree--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --from Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When, why did you pursue that?
Speaker 2: That was part of what I was responding to with respect to the, the name of a school you know. I think that it was clear to me even after I was thriving that, that the pedigree was very important, and so I got an LL.M. at Yale. And it was great 'cause I loved being a student. I think one of the reasons why I like being in higher education is 'cause I'm always a student. And so being at Yale was a great opportunity for me. I worked with you know some of the wonderful professors, Owen Fiss [Owen M. Fiss] and Guido Calabresi and you know they were--as a student again, but not as a faculty member. And it was a really, really good time for me to reflect on some of the work I had been doing at Duquesne [Duquesne University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And when you went to Yale were you part time or you went full time?
Speaker 2: I went full time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh you took--
Speaker 2: This is, it reflect, this--I, I just said Duquesne, I meant Temple [Temple University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yes, I went full time.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a student.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I was literally a full time student.
Story_ID: 622364
Speaker 1: Any regrets?
Speaker 2: I have absolutely no regrets. I've had a really full and wonderful life. And I have a wonderful husband [Frank M. McClellan] that has obviously been a, a real important part of my journey. He's enabled me to do the traveling and the, the multitasking and the commission work and all of the things that I do because he is also a professor. And so you know, he can take the time and we have shared lots and lots of both research and writing as well as traveling and other things that we're interested in such as being a part of communities like Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts]. He's an avid tennis player. I'm not, so you know we have separate opportunities as well. But also, he has two sons who now, one of them has just recently had a, a baby so we're grandparents and he, he has a older grandchild that lived with us for a year. So, we have a very rich life. My daughter [Cara McClellan] is a graduate of--undergraduate at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and graduate law school at Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut]. She's about to work for the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] starting in September, in a few minutes. And she is, she's been an educator and she's been a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Like mommy.
Speaker 2: So, here we go. It keeps going.
Speaker 1: What does she teach?
Speaker 2: Legal educator, that's what I'm waiting--huh, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: You said she's been an edu--
Speaker 2: She, she did Teach for America.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: For two years, yeah.
Story_ID: 622365
Speaker 1: What are your hopes for African Americans?
Speaker 2: So, I am still committed to diversity. I think we have to--and I have to say the recent events, as in Charlottesville [Virginia], have convinced us that we don't know each other and we live highly, highly segregated lives. And it's not that integration is important. It's that we need to tear down the walls that divide us. And so whether it's diversity or some other way of describing it, we have to learn about each other and learn to live with each other and, and experience, have opportunities to experience what other people go through in order to have the kind of sympathy, empathy, ability to do problem solving that is necessary in today's world. It's clear we don't know each other now.
Story_ID: 622366
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I truly am committed to people using education to engage in problem solving and to find the good life and to thrive and I would like to think that I've made available through both legal education as well as through my leadership as a chancellor to be a role model for people to value education and value leadership as a way of defining a better future.
Story_ID: 622367
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything that I did not ask you that you want to be part of your oral history with The HistoryMakers? Anything you wanted to say or share that I didn't ask, I didn't know to ask?
Speaker 2: No, I think that what I'd like people to understand is that for me, family means a great deal. Family means support, but also family means being able to let you grow and thrive and fly. And so, you know I wish that for my own daughter, Cara [Cara McClellan] and my new grandson, Marsalis [ph.], for their lives. I think education is the key. Diversity is critically important and finding ways to interact with different people who don't necessarily share your views or values but know how to be civil and know how to engage I think is very important. I'm, I'm concerned about the future.
Speaker 1: As are we all. Well, a footnote, we're hoping that Cara Ida will choose to include Phoebe in the name of her child.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm going to tell her. I'm gonna tell her that's what you said.
