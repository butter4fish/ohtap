Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?

Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Let's see, do I have a favorite phrase?  Well, I guess one of them is: you can make it.
Story_ID: 486481
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Eldridge Edwards] side, and we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Josephine, it's J-O-S-E-P-H-I-N-E, Radford, R-A-D-F-O-R-D, Edwards, E-D-W-A-R-D-S [Josephine Radford Edwards].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is June 19, 1911.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And that was in Harris County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Harris County, Texas, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so is that near Houston [Texas]?  That's, that's near Houston.
Speaker 2: It is Houston.
Speaker 1: It is Houston?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's in the county, but it was a rural part of the--
Speaker 2: Well, no, Houston sits inside of Harris County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, sometimes it's hard to tell where you are.  Houston is a city in Harris County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, really, you can say Houston, Texas, would still fit her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because it is Houston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was born in Houston?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you--what can you tell us about her side of the family?  First of all, how far back can you trace that side of the family in history?
Speaker 2: I can only go to my grandfather.  That's as far as I can go.  And my mother told us that her grandfather--her daddy's daddy was a white man and, of course, they had--they were all pretty light skinned and with the so-called straight hair, that kind of thing.  But that's--and her mother had, I think, eighteen children.
Speaker 1: So this is your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: My great-grandparents, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Eighteen children, that's a big family.  So did they live in Harris County too?
Speaker 2: They lived in Houston--
Speaker 1: In Houston.
Speaker 2: --and in Polk County [Texas].
Speaker 1: Polk County?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Frank.  Frank Radford.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did they do for a living, do you know?
Speaker 2: He was a carpenter and a farmer that they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, are there any stories from that side of the family?  I know you have a keen interest in Juneteenth.  I was wondering, is there a story from that side of the family about, you know, the emancipation of slavery or--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's birthday is on June 19th, that's the day of the holiday, June 19th.  And, of course, we always celebrated growing up because that was her birthday and, and, of course, our parents taught us what the significance of that day really meant.  One of the thing that I often hear them talk about is how they would go from Houston to Polk County, really, it's Camden, Texas.  And it would take days for them to go 'cause they went by horse and buggy.  And my grandfather's daddy supposedly owned a toilet tissue company, I'm not sure of the name, and he tried to give it--give him some of it or give it to him, but he wouldn't accept it.  If I had my way, I sure would have made an exception, but I often hear them talk about that.
Speaker 1: And do you know his name, the name of the--this is the great-grandfather, the white great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's dad.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, I don't know his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that wasn't passed down in the family?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But I don't know how they came up with it, but when my grandfather died, the--and the property still exists up in Camden, sixty-eight acres of land which is more than most folks own today.  I mean, we still have it in the family, but--along with a lot of other blacks that we have heard about across the South who ended up with hundreds and thousands of acres of land that for some way, somehow, they were able to maybe not convince the slave master, but they just felt close enough to them because, of course, our foreparents cooked for them, they raised their children, they nursed them, they did everything and so it's amazing on how--is how much property blacks without leads ended up with thousands of acres, but it's also kind of heartbreaking to see how fast it started reversing when whites started buying it out from them for little or nothing, and especially from their grandchildren and their offspring.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  That's one of the big issues of the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], black people moving to the cities and letting that land go, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 486482
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Josephine Radford Edwards] have any stories about growing up in Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the typical things, like with children with a lot of sisters and brothers, but she did say how close they were and that her dad [Frank Radford] never, never had to whip any of them, which was totally different from my situation.  But they often talk about how they never were hungry, you know, there was always, I guess, food from the garden or whatever, but they were able to manage.  Of course, when my mother was raising us, she did the same thing.  Neither dad [Eldridge Edwards] or mother graduated from a college and--but at the same time, we were never hungry.  So then there was an ironic story between my mother's side and my dad's side.  There was a church [South Main Baptist Church, Houston, Texas] that was organized in my mother's home when they were growing up and that was headed up by her mother, Eugenia Radford [Eugenia Marshall Radford].  And across--and they lived out on South Main [Houston, Texas], which is--now you can't afford to buy out there, but they, they, they did and they were farming out there.  Across the highway was another family that was the Edwardses.  Well, even though the church was formed in my grandmother's house on my mother's side, when the church was put together, they--it ended up the church was being pastored by my grandfather [Redick Edwards] on my daddy's side.  Ironic story, she ended--and, of course, at that time, my mother and dad wasn't married, they weren't even dating.  So it's, it's--you know, it had to be a godsend kind of thing for that to happen for those two families.
Speaker 1: So I take it they met at church, I guess?
Speaker 2: You know, the church out on the country dusty road.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is your--did your mother have--did she go to high school in Houston?
Speaker 2: She graduated from Jack Yates High School [Yates Colored High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Jack Yates?  Okay.  And what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was always a housewife.
Story_ID: 486483
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Eldridge, E-L-D-R-I-D-G-E, Edwards [Eldridge Edwards].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Three--1912, August the 2nd.  No, it's August the 2nd, 1912.  He was one year younger than my mother [Josephine Radford Edwards].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was born in--
Speaker 2: Same place, Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Houston.  Okay.  And what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: To my grandfather.
Speaker 1: And are there any stories on that side about the end of slavery or--
Speaker 2: Well, I know they often talk about the sharecropping and all that 'cause my mo- my grandmother [Katy Edwards] on my daddy's side had fourteen children.  People back then had a lot of children.  And anyway, they sharecropped and like, like most poor blacks were doing at that time.  Later on he became a real estate broker and a pastor of a church, and when he passed, he was pastor of a church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is the grandfather that became the pastor of the church across the road?
Speaker 2: That's my daddy.  I was speaking of--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's your--
Speaker 2: --my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather ended up pastor for South Main Baptist Church [Houston, Texas], but my dad also became a pastor later on in life and a real estate broker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So the church that your grandmother on your mother's side, that's Eugenia Radford [Eugenia Marshall Radford], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the church that she started was called what?
Speaker 2: For South Main.
Speaker 1: For South Main?  Okay.  So I am right, that the answer is yes, he was the one that was a pastor--
Speaker 2: My grandfather--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on my dad's side.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's his full name?
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: Your grandfather on your daddy's side.
Speaker 2: Oh, Redick, R-E-D-D-I-C-K [sic.].
Speaker 1: Redick Radford?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Redick Edwards.
Speaker 1: Edwards.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Redick Edwards.  Okay.  So do they have any--what was life like in those days?  Did they ever talk about that to young people?  What was it like growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, what I gather is the same as it was with us.  My mother had a lot of children and we didn't have a whole lot.  When we look back at it today, we didn't, but we didn't know it.  And so I think they--it was the same thing.  I mean, they didn't know how poor they were.  They were happy, they were--went to--had to go to church, whenever they went to church and we did too.  You know, it was a thing that we couldn't play the blues in our house, we couldn't curse period.  Anything was cursing.  Hell was cursing, lying was cursing, all that was cursing, that would get you get that leather put on you if you did that.  We couldn't fight each other.  So it was pretty much not exactly the same, but similar 'cause my dad was pretty strong and the struggle for civil rights and better in the community.  He was very active in the civic club and wouldn't let whites talk to him any kind of way.  It's surprising he didn't get killed.  But I think that their story was like most stories, they shared, they shared the hall, they would share with the neighbors, you know, if they needed sugar until they got some money from wherever they borrowed from each other, my mother did the same thing.  So I think we were pretty much the same, and I think those families where there were the two parents that had their families, made sure they went to school, got their education.  Down the line, it really paid off because on both sides of my dad's mother, my mother's side and dad's side, the offsprings are doing well; not all of them, but a good number of them.
Story_ID: 486484
Speaker 1: When you look at your parents' [Josephine Radford Edwards and Eldridge Edwards] personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I've got a lot of both in me because like I said, I saw my dad get streets paved, ditches cleaned up, communities where there were no drainage.  He would work with the county commissioners and people like that.  He was also a precinct judge over the voting, and I remember one, they used to have to counts the votes by hand and even though he was pastor in the church, he was still a precinct judge and they didn't get through in time, so we couldn't go to church that day, so mother sent his lunch to him 'cause they had counted votes all night and going back and forth and all that.  Because I remember so well, she--I was the one who carried him his lunch and some of other sisters and brothers, so I know I picked that up from him.  I--he was a real estate broker, I'm a real estate broker.  He was a minister, a Baptist minister, I'm a Baptist minister.  He was involved in his community, I'm involved in the community.  So I just got a whole lot from him.  I think my mother was more on the supporter side, and I know I picked up a lot of that from her because I can support anybody else's program.  Have no problem in doing it; have no problem helping folks out.  I've seen people come by the house and eat that we didn't even know because mother did--there was no strangers to mother at all.  I mean, if we ate, they ate, you know.  Used to make us a little upset because she'd give them sometime the best part of the meat, but I know I got a lot of that from her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father go to Jack Yates High School [Yates Colored High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas] too?
Speaker 2: He did, but he didn't graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did he go to any kind of a bible college or anything?
Speaker 2: He, he went to, I think, the--he did go to bible school for ministry, but he didn't--it wasn't a real formal structure school, I think it was more at one of the Baptist Ministers Association's [Baptist Ministers Association of Houston and Vicinity] kinds of things, so probably a lot learned on his own or he picked it up from his dad [Redick Edwards] 'cause my daddy's daddy was a Baptist pastor.
Speaker 1: Right.  In those days, a pastor was like an important--very important figure in our community.
Speaker 2: That's right and it's nothing like today.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, they handled the business for the community, basically.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they were it.  I mean, I wish we'd see that day again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was he a member of any of the national organizations like NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was a member of the NAACP--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very active.  He was the treasurer of the Baptist Ministers Association.  And, of course, even outside of our community, out in Acres Homes [Houston, Texas] where he pastored, even though that's not where we lived.  We lived on the north side in the Trinity Gardens [Houston, Texas] area, but he was pastor in Acres Homes, but he had all those streets out there paved and ditches gutted, worked with the light company to get lights out in their community, the whole bit.
Story_ID: 486485
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Of--early childhood memory of?
Speaker 1: An--I mean, the first--do you have a memory that's your first memory, period?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember when I was in, it had to be kindergarten in school.  I don't know why, mother [Josephine Radford Edwards] would tell people she spoiled me and I don't know why that--I don't know why me, but that was her doing.  And my dad [Eldridge Edwards], at that time, was in the trucking business and he helped to get the more affluent part of Houston [Texas] down in Braeswood [Braeswood Place] and South Main [Houston, Texas] where the medical center is and all, and so obviously working with some of those people.  Somebody out there had a great big tricycle and dad brought the tricycle home, I guess on the back of his truck or something.  Now, having all those children, why it was designated as my tricycle, I don't know, but it was.  And so we lived a good ways.  We lived by a good mile away from the elementary school, dirt roads, and I rode my tricycle to school the first day of school.  Why mother would let me do that, I don't know, but with all those children at home, nobody could ride that tricycle if I didn't let them and that wasn't right, but that was my tricycle.  And when I went to school and I put it right by the door, you know, they had the frame building then.  Naturally, the other children were gonna be excited about, you know, that tricycle out there and somebody told me that somebody was on my tricycle and, man, I ran out the classroom and pushed the person off and parked my tricycle by the door.  It was kind of crazy and at that, that--I wasn't even in the first grade.  But I know it--the carryover, I was always one of those that thought I was supposed to help and get what we needed, that's what made the civil rights struggle so tough for me because there were so many things I saw we didn't have we should've had.  But I remember those days, back in my kindergarten days.
Speaker 1: What's amazing is that you rode a tricycle a mile down a dirt road.
Speaker 2: Down a dirt road.  I can't--I just don't even understand how I can't remember what even mother was thinking.  Of course, there wasn't that many cars, you know, but--and if there would've been, if they had seen me, you know, they'd stop and the people were much friendlier then than now.  But yeah, that was a crazy--
Speaker 1: So that didn't become an everyday thing though, right?  You didn't--
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No.  No, once I got my tricycle back, I wouldn't take it back to school 'cause I didn't want nobody to touch it.  But it was an odd kind of tricycle.  It was real big.  It wasn't a little tricycle, it was a big tricycle, yeah.
Story_ID: 486486
Speaker 1: Was there a particular name for the neighborhood you lived in or was it more or less a--like a--
Speaker 2: Trinity Gardens [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Trinity Gardens.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, describe it for us, I mean, who--was it predominantly African American?
Speaker 2: Yes, at that time it was predominantly African American.  You know, the houses out there set on great big lots like most, like most houses were back, you know, in that time, but the streets were dirt roads; well, later on they became paved but, you know, no red lights and all that stuff; wasn't that many cars.  The houses were not sitting right next door to each other.  You know, our house sit on a--an acre of land and we had to sell the lots on both sides and--'cause we had gardeners that we had to work during the summer also, so the neighbors would share in, in, in what we were doing.  But it was, it was, you know, then up on the corner you'd have a little store and you'd go get stuff and they'd write down what you got.  You know, if your mother didn't have the money for sugar, she'd send us to the store and the guy would write it down and when dad got some, got some money, he'd go up there and pay it, but she'd get groceries, not the big bunch of groceries, but things that she needed, she'd get them on credit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were growing up the tail end of the Depression [Great Depression] and the beginning of World War II [WWII], right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in the, in the early '40s [1940s], late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember once when we were downtown at--there was a store called--we used to call it Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company], and mother [Josephine Radford Edwards] would take me down--take me with her when she would go shopping and they had--and I wanted--I saw the water fountains.  I saw the water fountains and I just got--I just started drinking water and it happened to be the one that had white on it, and somebody obviously was saying that I wasn't supposed to drink water from it, but mother wasn't paying too much mind to me.  She did turn around and realized I was drinking out the white water fountain.  You know, she really snatched me away from there and told me you can't do that, it's this, you know, you can't drink from--you can't drink out of that water fountain.  I didn't understand what she meant, I just went on about my business with her, but then later on I realized what she meant and why she wanted to make sure I didn't do it.  I, I--you know, I was up there on white water fountains drinking right from the white water fountain.  But, yeah, those were some days, man.
Speaker 1: So, were you--I take it you weren't down there that much to experience the segregated fountains and facilities and things, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, they were still there when I grew up.  I was a little boy when that happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, yeah, I was in--I was a part of the Civil Rights Movement.  I was in the sit-down strikes.  The--I remember the first time we left from right here off this campus under the leadership of [HistoryMaker] Reverend Bill Lawson, who pastored Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church [Houston, Texas].  When we went down to--there was a Walgreens [Walgreens Company] up on Almeda [Road] and a Weingarten's [J. Weingarten, Inc.] and we went down there to integrate the lunch counter and at the Walgreens downtown when they turned us back, we organized and we went back down there.  Well, when we got down there then, there was no lunch counter, they had just completely moved it.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: At Weingarten's, we went to that one, we had a problem with that too, because the lady just--she didn't refuse to serve, they just didn't serve any food.
Story_ID: 486487
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as some of the sights were concerned, we--when we were little and we couldn't go to a place that was called the Playland Park [Houston, Texas], they had rides and it was like a big circus, you know, that kind of thing.  And the--of course, they have the roller coaster.  Blacks could only go once a year to Playland Park out on South Main [Street] right here in Houston [Texas].  And did we ever look forward to going to Playland Park.  It was said, I don't know whether it was factual or not, that on that day they made enough money to pay their own--all their annual expenses because the rides stayed full because that was the only time we could go out there.
Speaker 1: Just one day a year?
Speaker 2: One day a year, and that was on Juneteenth, on the 19th of June.  And man, I'll tell you, I remember that.  That was--then later on when we realized what it was, you know, then it became kind of offensive, but that was--that was a memorable moment when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: What other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Well, the one thing that I used to always enjoy doing was at--when I was, when I was growing up at home was I used to like to roll tires and I always thought that was the greatest thing in the world.  I always had something to play with 'cause you could always find an old tire and I'd make my own streets, you know, my own bridges.  In our house, selling blocks when we were growing up and, of course, we were little and so we were able enough to go play under the house, so I'd make me a eighteen-wheeler out of two cans and a board, I put two nails in the back, one in the front and I'd just travel all over the country under that house with my truck; you know, I mean, things like that, that you did that, that you just, you know, always remember.  Of course, I remember how one Saturday mother [Josephine Radford Edwards] said, "Look, you all are going to do your work and I don't want any problems out of none of you."  She was probably pregnant at the time.  So she said, "Somebody get me a switch and I'm gonna use it."  I went and got the switch, a mulberry switch at that.  And I started doing my work and I (unclear) and so I wanted to play and so some of my smaller brothers or sisters would always want to fool with my toys, my trucks, my whatever and I'd stop them and they'd start crying and they would tell mother I hit them.  That Saturday, mother had used five switches, all of them on me and I went to get the switches for her.  So in addition to, to being a little humorous, I was always some kind of selfish too, you know.  I used to make my own bicycles.  Dad [Eldridge Edwards] didn't buy us bicycles and all that kind of stuff, but if I found me a frame, I'd go to the store for some of the neighbors, you know, they'd give you a dime or a nickel or something like that.  Or when dad gave us money to put in church and he gave me more than two or three pieces of money, one of them I was gonna keep for myself.  Or, on Saturdays when he would get up and he would be at the breakfast table after we had 'cause, you know, the children would either be out in the yard playing or in the garden working, when he'd go to the table to eat, I knew where he left his money on the dresser in their bedroom, so I'd go through the hallway when he couldn't see me and I'd take a quarter off the dresser until I had enough money to buy me a chain or a tire and I'd make my own bicycle.  I'd fix it up.  I'd borrow or something from somebody else, but I always made things happen pretty like that.  And so when I think back on that sometimes, it kind of reflects us to why I've done what I've done, you know, whether it was in a political arena or in the community.
Story_ID: 486488
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any regular jobs when you were growing up like delivering papers or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well, my first job when I was in the fifth grade, there was a man that lived across the street from us who was crippled, he was on a cane.  His name was John [ph.], they called him Mr. John.  And several days a week, I would go over to feed his hogs.  He had little ones and middle size ones and big ones and sometimes they were really hard to handle, but he had hogs and chickens and ducks and I would get twenty-five cents for feeding his hogs, fixing his fence, taking some from--he'd want a certain one from one place to the other one.  You know, it was sloppy and muddy and I'd be falling down trying to pull old, old mean hogs or stubborn hogs or whatever.  But--so I had a job when I was five and then I got a little bigger during the summer, I would take my cycle and I would go in the white part of the community and ask folks if they wanted me to cut their yards or if they had a ditch, I'd cut it or if they had a lawnmower, I'd use theirs and cut theirs, but I made money like that.  But another memory that I left out which was not so exciting is we were--when I was growing up there was a place called the clay hole, way out in the woods and my brothers would leave going to cut yards, but they really was going to that place and swim.  And I would follow them 'cause I wasn't supposed to be with them from the first day and they didn't want me to go with them.  So I would let them get down the road and I'd start behind them and I would stay close to the ditch.  If they looked back or I thought they were gonna look back, I'd jump over in the ditch where they couldn't see me until they got a long ways from home, then I would start catching up with them and boy would they fuss and thump me on the head.  But they'd go down to that clay hole so they'd be swimming, I got in there swimming too, but I didn't know how to swim, and so on two occasions I was drowning.  The first time I was drowning, my second to my oldest brother saved me 'cause I was supposed to just been right there close.  They told me just stay close to the bank and I was just kicking around like--but me and my adventurous self, I ventured out into the water and then I was, I was drowning, they saved me.  And the second time the same thing happened, my older--it wasn't my older brother that saved me, it was a white guy that was down there swimming and he hollered to my brother and both of them came over.  And--but now this was not clear water now, this was, this was in a pu- this was out in a creek and they called it the clay hole.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's kind of like a pool of water in the creek?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  It was deep, man.  So I always remember that.  But anyway, as far as my jobs were concerned, when I got a little older I started working at supermarkets carrying out groceries, you know, for tips and that was, at that time, some Weingarten's [J. Weingarten, Inc.] and Henke's [Henke and Pillot] and Piggly Wigglys [Piggly Wiggly Corporation], they don't exist anymore, but--or they sold out.  And so I always had me a little job during my middle, middle school.  When I got out of high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston], then I was, I was waiting tables at The Houston Club [Houston, Texas] and the Petroleum Club [Petroleum Club of Houston, Houston, Texas] and then I went to work for Maxwell House Coffee [Maxwell House Coffee Company].  You're supposed to be twenty-one, I lied, told them I was twenty-one, I wasn't twenty-one.  I hadn't even made twenty-one, but I lied, I got the job and I stayed there 'til I got ready to leave 'cause I left from the plant and I went in sales and marketing.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, I don't want to get you too far gone, but I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --want to go back to the beginning of school.  Now, when did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: In the fifth grade--in kindergarten (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean--yeah.  Where, where did you--what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Trinity Gardens elementary school [Trinity Gardens School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Oh, Trinity Gardens?  Okay.  Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I enjoyed school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there any special teachers there that you remember?
Speaker 2: In the elementary school?  Well, my first grade teacher was named Ms. Bond [ph.], and she was really sweet.  They all, you know, they treated us like we were their children.  And then I had another teacher by the name of Ms. Turner [Falbia Turner], she's still living, my sixth grade teacher.  She would--she taught us mathematics, mostly, but we thought she was pretty mean because if you didn't do her work or you were talking, she would take one of the little, you know, little rulers and turn it upside down on the corner, make you ball your fists up, and she'd whale those knuckles out and made you go sit down.  I mean, you--there was no problem, you was gonna sit down and learn some math in her class.  So she was one of my favorites, in fact, I presented her with an award two years ago at Jones Hall [Jesse H. Jones Hall for the Performing Arts, Houston, Texas] downtown, the Juneteenth award and she's ninety-some years old now.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to high--did you go to middle school or was it--
Speaker 2: E.O. Smith Middle School [Houston, Texas].  E.O. Smith.
Speaker 1: E.O. Smith?  Okay.  Okay.  Now did you--were you involved in any kind of extracurricular activities in school?  Did you play any instruments or play sports?
Speaker 2: At E.O. Smith?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I played on the--a little intramural basketball team.  I didn't play on the, the regular team 'cause I had my little job in the evenings, a couple, three days a week.  And then the one time I went out for football, I got kicked in the jaw and I was gonna keep playing, but daddy [Eldridge Edwards] said no.  That was the end of that, you know, but I didn't, not in middle school.  High school, I did more of track and basketball.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Phillis Wheatley [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Phillis Wheatley?  Okay.  Now, when you were you in school, was there any emphasis on black history in school, in any of the schools that you--
Speaker 2: Not--
Speaker 1: --attended?
Speaker 2: Not--no, not--um-hm.  I doubt--I--it was very little history that--the only thing I remember was about George Washington Carver, you know, they used to talk about that, but not about the stuff you said in black--in the black history programs now when they teach children about, you know, who invented the broom, the mop, the blood plasma and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have a lot of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did they have Black History Month or Negro History Week in those days?
Speaker 2: It was--I don't think we had a Black History Month when I was in school.
Speaker 1: It would've been Negro History Week in those days, but no, huh?  No?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a lot of emphasis on black history then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Well, whichever one I could get out of, man 'cause I liked to play.  But I really didn't have a favorite.  I used to like math, but down the road I kind of stopped liking it, but I did, I did--the math was one that I liked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any favorite teachers in middle school or high school?
Speaker 2: In high school, my homeroom teacher, Mrs. Plummer [Christine Jones Plummer].  She was really, really sweet and I just thought she was the prettiest woman in the world.  And she had two sons, both of them attorneys and right now, she lives four doors down from me.  I never would've known that, and so on occasion I'll pass and talk to her and, and we'll talk about what, what--some of those days when I was in the tenth grade and she was my homeroom teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you start playing tennis in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Didn't?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I had--I ended up majoring in physical education in college [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], so we took tennis as a part of that, but I didn't play on the tennis team.  I really took up tennis long after I was out of college.
Story_ID: 486490
Speaker 1: So when did you graduate from high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas], like, what was the year?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-five [1955]?  Okay.  So what did you do right after high school?  Did you go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to college [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: --college or anything?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--but I also worked in the evenings.
Speaker 1: So you were working at Maxwell House [Maxwell House Coffee Company] then?
Speaker 2: Part of my college days was at Maxwell House, the other part was waiting tables at The Houston Club [Houston, Texas] and Petroleum Club [Petroleum Club of Houston, Houston, Texas] downtown, yeah.  So I've always worked, always.
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking to Henry Brown [HistoryMaker Henry H. Brown] earlier this week, he said he waited tables too at some of these clubs.  Is that a pretty lucrative--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: He said he made good money doing it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, it was not just making some money, but the opportunities to get the kind of job was much easier then than to walk into a big department store and become a salesman because all the salespersons, not all, there, there was a few salespersons who were not white.  So it was working at the--at a club was, you know, that was our kind of thing, you know, it--most of your maitre ds and the heads of the waiters, head of busboys, all those were black folk had worked in these clubs for a long time. That was not for white folk.  That was black folks too.  Same thing for working at the post office or the railroad.  So it turned out that there was jobs turned out to be good positions, but during that time they were not looked at as being so good, but they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they became traditional black jobs where you could--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a black man could get a job at?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 486491
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas], did--were you considered a good student in high school, or?
Speaker 2: Well, I was number one, very amenable, and I couldn't skip classes too much, of course, one time I did and dad [Eldridge Edwards] found out about it and I really got a real, real--he really put that leather on me for doing that, so I kind of cut back on that.  But, I don't know, high school was--it was fun because I, you know, I was an average student, I wasn't an A student, but I wasn't an F student.  And I couldn't be an F student, daddy--I mean, you just didn't come home with failing grades.  That was murder.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were--did you run for any of the class offices or anything like that or in--or were you in any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was--
Speaker 1: --of the clubs?
Speaker 2: --a member of the BroBombers, they call it the BroBombers Club [ph.], that was an all-boys club where you, you know, dressed, wore certain kind of things.  There was also the Gents, you know, I was a member of that.  During the assemblies on one or two occasions, I was a part of--I remember once I introduced the principal and I--after I introduced him, as he was walking up to speak, Dr. John E. Codwell [John Elihue Codwell, Sr.], he patted me on my behind and, you know, he said good--you know, you did a good job of introducing me, you know.  Now this--you know, I thought that was just, I was in heaven.  But the guys, you know, a lot of the guys teased me, "We saw you get that good whip across your behind."  You know, but it wasn't considered as doing anything homosexual or nothing like that, but that's what they were laughing about, you know--
Story_ID: 486492
Speaker 1: I also remember when I got a whipping at school [E.O. Smith Middle School, Houston, Texas] when I was in the fourth grade too, I didn't tell you about that.
Speaker 2: What happened?  What happened?
Speaker 1: I never liked to be late, and this particular morning I was late and I didn't want to walk into class, so I didn't go into class, I went to the boys' restroom and I just stayed in there.  Pretty soon my buddy by the name of Rudolph [ph.] came in, and I told him why I wasn't in class and convinced him not to go back to class.  And so I had my--he had a slingshot with him and so we said, "Why don't we go down on the--by the big ditch and shoot some birds?"  But in the meanwhile, students kept coming in and out, we were in the restroom.  So eventually, we're in the fourth grade, so eventually, somebody told the teacher, she told Ms. Harris [ph.], and Ms. Harris called the house 'cause they knew, you know, my dad [Eldridge Edwards], knew he was a minister and preacher and all that stuff and mother [Josephine Radford Edwards] called dad some kind of way, or he called her.  She told him that I was not in class, not at school, so he came home.  And I had a dog by the name of Buck.  He got Buck and he's on his way to look for me.  Meanwhile, while we're out there on that ditch, the slingshot broke so we didn't have nothing to shoot birds with, probably wouldn't have gotten it anyway.  So we just started kind of playing and sitting around and just waited 'til school was out.  And we were a good ways away from the street 'cause the lots--all the lots are real big out there in Trinity Gardens [Houston, Texas], and this lot had to be at least over a block long from the, the depth from the ditch to the street.  But for whatever reason when dad was passing along where down the street and we were way over there at the ditch, my dog saw me and he started running and barking, coming at--to me.  And I looked up and saw, "Oh, man, that's, that's Buck."  Then I looked right up and I saw daddy not too far behind him, so we started to run.  He said, "Oh, don't you all run."  And so he took us to school.  He walked us back to school.  It was at--there was a recess at two o'clock where the children used to come out, you know, I don't think they have recesses anymore.  But all these children were out, it was a sunshiny day and he walked me and Rudolph right into class.  And all the children were looking and saw, were teasing us, laughing at us and all that 'cause you know your daddy got you and bringing you into school like, like we were--you know, he was a bounty hunter or somebody.  So school--after recess was over and all the students sat down and my dad made me beg the teachers' pardons and the students for skipping class.  He--and he took his belt off right in this classroom and put it on me right there and made me put my hands on the front--right on the front row desk and put a whipping on me right there.  And so after so long, the teacher told us that, "Okay.  Reverend, that's enough."  And he, and he said something like, "It hurts me to do this."  And they made the lie up, my buddies, you know, they made the lie up and said when he said, "It hurts me to do this," they said that I said--that Al [HistoryMaker Albert Edwards] said, "Yeah, but it hurts me too."  You know, and that was a lie, I didn't say that, you know.  But you could imagine when we were going to high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] we were on the school bus, I mean, you know, on occasion when we started laughing and hooraying and playing, that was always brought up.  But anyway, back to high school, I mean, I was, I was a typical student, but I always worked.  Like I said, I was amenable, and that's what helped me get through, really (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 486493
Speaker 1: Now, when you think back on it, because when you think about all the whipping that took place in those days and it took place quite a bit in former days.  Not as much of it going on now, but do you think--do you have any reflections about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the worst thing that could have happened is, is when we took that out of school where the teachers could not chastise children, even worse is parents can't chastise their own children because Child Protective Services will come out and arrest the parent, I think that's the worst--how that thing got turned upside down and backwards, I don't know.  But I just, I just don't, I just don't get it.  I mean, that's, that doesn't even--that just doesn't make sense to say that a child can raise himself, he can discipline himself.  The Bible doesn't speak to that at all.  It says train up a child the way that it should go.  It says bend the sapling while it's young.  It doesn't have nothing--all this stuff about--you know, what happened in my opinion is some slick consultants, probably mostly white or whomever came up with this idea about it was detrimental to put a paddle or whip a child and strangely enough, all the folks who used to get it, nothing was detrimental about that.  Now, I admit that there may have been some abuse from some teachers, particularly when schools integrated, where you had, all of a sudden, white teachers could work with black children and black teachers could work with white students.  Maybe they did abuse it some, but maybe they should have corrected that, but not to take it out because along with that then Madalyn O'Hair [Madalyn Murray O'Hair] and them was able to get prayer out of school and we--'cause every morning when I was in school, we used to say the Lord's Prayer, you know.  Since then, when we see all the pregnancies that take place in these schools, sex actually taking place in schoolrooms, and under the stairway, you know, all--out in the parking lot, guns on campuses, teachers being jumped on.  We wouldn't have thought about jumping on a teacher.  We didn't even know how to talk back to a teacher because if so, she could either whip you, take you to the gym and have one of the gym teachers put their board on your behind or call your parents, so that just didn't happen, you know.  I carried legislation to get prayer back in school and we got petitions and all that signed and we were able to get prayer back in school for what little bit of prayer you could do.  You could pray, but you couldn't do it in a classroom and you couldn't do it openly.  That's the way the rule is now.  But I think taking the paddle and taking chastising out of our schools and family was just, just did us a disservice.
Story_ID: 486494
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas], did you--had you already planned to go to college?  Did you know you were going to?
Speaker 2: Well, that was one thing that we didn't have much options on going to school.  The--you went to school, church and came home at a reasonable time.  You was gonna help do the chores, whether it's working the garden or whatever.  I--we didn't have options to do stuff that we wanted to do.  We did what our parents [Josephine Radford Edwards and Eldridge Edwards] said.
Speaker 1: But in terms of college--
Speaker 2: And my parents would--
Speaker 1: --they told you--
Speaker 2: --say absolutely the same thing, you are gonna go to college.  If you stayed at daddy's house, you were going to college.  So out of all of my mother's children, every one of them has a college degree, at least one degree.  Now, there are some with, you know, additional training and schooling and dah, dah, dah.  And others with master's degrees, but everybody graduated from college, so, you know, you had to graduate from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's the same principle that's for church.  If you're at daddy's house, you have to go to church on Sunday morning.  So I knew I was gonna go to college.  You know, I didn't know how or what, but I know I would.
Speaker 1: Did all your brothers and sisters go to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Earl [Eldridge Edwards, Jr.], Alfred [Alfred Edwards] and Phillip [Phillip Edwards], they got their degrees at--they went to school in California.  The rest of them went to Texas Southern.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So tell us about Texas Southern.  When you entered school it was what, 1955?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I had been waiting tables, and I got my income tax check back, I think it was about $150, $200, which I thought was a lot of money.  And, of course, I was staying with dad and it went to the house.  In fact, I couldn't remember if it was my first income tax check, but dad had me go to wherever to cash it and he brought me over here to register me and it took fifty dollars to get registered and get in school.  That's what it was.  And he left--
Speaker 1: That's all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just fifty dollars?
Speaker 2: He left me with the registrar and, and she said, "Well, okay, Reverend, thanks for bringing him.  You can go ahead on, and we'll take him from here," just like at home, yeah.  So--but I knew I had to go and I, I remember that first day very well, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he left you with the registrar?  You paid your money and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --started up later that week?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, you were staying at home when you were going to Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: I was staying at home, but I didn't stay at home the whole time I was in school, no.  But at that time, I was and that's just the way he made sure all those--all of his children got registered in school--in college and then after that, you had to make it on your own.
Speaker 1: You majored in physical education?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did you manage to choose physical education?
Speaker 2: Well, my minor was psychology, and when I was growing up, one of my brothers, Donald [Donald Edwards], he was--he had arthritis real, real, real bad.  In fact, he died from that and I kind of--I went to the hospital with him.  I used to take him for his appointments and things like that.  And so one of the things that I said I was gonna do was go to school, be a doctor to help take care of Don.  And I was gonna do physical education and then move on.  Well, I did physical education, but instead of going to school for medicine I went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and was certified in corrective therapy, and that's what I was gonna work with Don on.  That was my plan, but Donald died before I even got there, so I just ventured off into something else.
Story_ID: 486495
Speaker 1: You had mentioned before that the Civil Rights Movement was pretty hot on campus when you got here.  I mean, it got that way anyway.  So were things going on when you first got here in '55 [1955] or did they start--
Speaker 2: Well, it was right at the time.  It was during that period because, you know, the big fight and the push for the education bills in '54 [1954], and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was still living and that, that was taken up.  He had just really kind of started.  You could see, you know, in some instances through SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and Carl Stokes and people like that speaking out, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], at that time.  I mean, not that it was just beginning, but it heightened itself when the NAACP got behind Dr. King following the fact that Rosa Parks did not get up and go to the back of the bus and from that started the big bus boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in '56 [1956], yeah.
Speaker 2: And it just moved right on.  So that, that started it all around the country in your predominantly black colleges and universities [HBCUs] to some degree are surely in a number of the black communities.  Not everybody participated, but that's kind of when it started.  That's--
Speaker 1: Was civil rights like a major topic in your household when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, facing the facts about racism was always a topic when we grew up.  You know, when--at the time when people used to come by folks' houses and try to sell them blankets or pillows or stuff like that, usually, they were white folks.  And when they'd come to our house, you know, it could be a boy and a gal, I mean, dad [Eldridge Edwards] was--dad would straighten out a white man real quick.  Put him off his property, you know, and we saw that.  When we'd be going place that--not that often, but dad was stopped by a policeman and we thought dad was gonna get arrested because he let the policeman know you don't talk to me like that.  And the policeman could arrest him, and there wasn't much he could've done about it.  But, you know, we saw--you--we did see that same thing happen, you know, with my children [Albert Edwards, Jr, Jason Edwards, and Alana Edwards-Holloway].  They registered and they vote because they saw their parents doing it.  So, yeah, we were taught about that when we were growing up.  We knew what racism--we knew the difference between white and black, you know, so the answer to that is, yes.
Speaker 1: And you said that the first demonstration at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], and you were involved and were led by Bill Lawson [HistoryMaker Reverend Bill Lawson]?
Speaker 2: Reverend Bill Lawson.
Speaker 1: Reverend Bill Lawson?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Attorney Francis Williams, Attorney Plummer [Matthew W. Plummer], people like that who helped integrate the county courthouse.  That was--those were the lawyers.  Reverend Lawson was not a lawyer, but he was a minister and he helped lead some marches and demonstrations here in Houston [Texas].  And--
Speaker 1: So what was the county courthouse like?  I mean, how was it segregated?  Did blacks have to go to a separate court or--
Speaker 2: Well, down at the Harris County [Texas] courthouse, those lawyers who were practicing law down there, there was a lunch, lunch concession, but the blacks couldn't go in to buy stuff from it, the black lawyers could not.  So Attorney Francis Williams, and Plummer, and people like that and some other community folks, yes, they helped to integrate it, even at the county courthouse.  Mickey Leland, the congressman who got killed, he was there much involved with the Civil Rights Movement from right here off of this campus and in the community, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was he a contemporary of yours?
Speaker 2: Oh, we were good friends, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: He about the same age as you?
Speaker 2: No, I was--I think I'm about eight or ten years older than Mickey, probably, but we went to the same high school and--here, and he was very active in, in the community.  I was very active, so, you know, I knew his brother and mother, you know, so we both graduated from Phillis Wheatley [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] over here.  I went to the same middle school and high school that Barbara Jordon, the very room we're sitting in here now, and I'm--she was ahead of me, but she used to do speeches at our school.  During the assembly, she would speak and all that very eloquent.  So that Civil Rights Movement really pushed me into a rich background, as far as really understanding who we are and where we are and what we're all about.
Story_ID: 486496
Speaker 1: --Were you a member of any of the civil rights organizations?  Did you join SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] or--
Speaker 2: Well, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was the one that we were very active with.  SCLC, that, I think, was headed up by Pluria Marshall [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.].  Never--no, it wasn't Pluria Marshall.  It never did really get off too strong down here; it never did.  In some places it did.  It should have, but it didn't.  But I think a stronger base has always been in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking that maybe because of the strong Baptist community here it would've grown.  But was your father [Eldridge Edwards] part of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: My dad was.  Oh, yeah, he was, he was involved with all that.  Yeah, he was to the local association, the local Baptist ministers' conferences and all that stuff, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember in '61 [1961] when the Baptist convention split over Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], basically, and civil rights?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it has split several times since then too.  In fact, some of the splintered folks are here in Texas.  In Dallas [Texas], there's a Reverend Johnson [Peter Johnson] who started a national group and then in Houston, Reverend F.N. Williams, Sr. started a national fellowship of churches [National Baptist Convention of America, Incorporated].  The one that Reverend Thurston from Chicago [Illinois] is now the national president.
Speaker 1: That's Stephen J. Thurston.
Speaker 2: Reverend Stephen Thurston.  And so they've had several--they've had so many Baptist groups now, man.  Of course, there's a lot of people, and it would be hard for one group to do it.  I think it's good that they've got different groups.  I think they ought to be a little better organized and not do them when the other one was doing the--they would allow you to go to one, then go to the other one and stuff like that.  But, yeah, they've had, they've had some splits, but I still think they're a very useful tool for whatever they do.  I think there's a lot more they could do and should do, as far as addressing the problem in our community, but I think for what they are doing, it's--thank God we have that and that they're not doing nothing, but, but--and so I'm, I'm proud of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you participated in demonstrations in lunch counters, you said a Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] and some of the other places, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah, Woolworth and Weingarten's [J. Weingarten, Inc.], which was a big supermarket.  We marched to get education into our school books and the--you know, for what little we have gotten right here.  We marched (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I mean--
Speaker 2: I was--I marched --
Speaker 1: --are you talking about changing the curriculum, you mean, or for more books or--
Speaker 2: To put some of the education into the school books.
Speaker 1: You mean of black history or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, black history.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  You know, I was part of the civil march from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama], and I go back every anniversary.  I haven't been to every anniversary, but when we had our thirty year anniversary down in Tennessee led by Reverend Billy Kyles [HistoryMaker Reverend Samuel Billy Kyles] at Monumental Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee, very memorable occasion.  You know, saw a lot of the folks that we were part of the marches and the demonstrations and stuff like that.

Speaker 1: --Now was there ever a time that you really--well, I guess it could've happened almost anytime, but was there any particular demonstration where you thought you were in a lot of jeopardy or could have--
Speaker 2: Well, there was an old dumpsite here in Houston [Texas] called the Holmes Road dump, and it was out in the Sunnyside [Houston, Texas] area and it was not well kept.  And on nights that the--we had a lot of high wind and all you--that, that odor would go over the community, you could--it was just horrible for the community, so a number of the activists got together with the city and started protesting that dump.
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Let's see, there had to be in the '60s [1960s].  I don't remember.  I know it was in the '60s [1960s], about mid-'60s [1960s] or a little before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where we had people like Ovide Duncantell and Eldridge Stearns and Mickey Leland and people like that protesting, Dr. Edith Clark [ph.] and folks.  And we were able to shut the--get the city to shut the dump down.  That dump sat there for thirty years until 2002, I think it was 2002, I was able to get the city to find enough funds to go out there and, you know, just tear up the incinerator because it just sat there with this open dump.  Weeds had grown up around it, nothing had been done with it, but that was thirty years later.  And, and so right during that same time there was a big riot at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], right across the--here and the policemen from downtown came out and during that riot just kind of shot up the dormitory.  And thank God no one was killed, but there was some folks who ended up going to prison from it.  So, it very well could've been that we could've gotten hurt then.  Then there was a--
Speaker 1: So this is--
Speaker 2: During the '60s [1960s], yeah.
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s], okay.  I've heard about the police department actually came on campus and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right out there on the street.
Speaker 1: Was there already a disturbance on campus or did the police create the disturbance?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I--it's--you never get--we never get the right story because it happened in the dormitories and we didn't know, but, but definitely started a riot and police were all over the place, school shut down and police all over everything, you know.  And part of it had to be a protest.  You know, you've heard that they were protesting because of, of racism here.  I mean, you know, people would, people would and could start a protest during that time anywhere 'cause racism was so prevalent.  But I really think that ended up getting out of hand, what happened at Texas Southern, getting shot up and people having to get put out of school and all that kind of stuff, going to jail.  And so that could've been pretty dangerous.
Speaker 1: Were there particular student leaders that were involved or faculty members?
Speaker 2: One of the guys who--over on the campus, he was a white guy, but anyway, he was over to try to help solve some of the problems.  He ended up being our county treasurer, was by the name of Hartsell Gray.  Eldridge Stearns, he was another one that was right in the middle of helping us solve that problem.  Ovide Duncantell, who still lives and does the Martin Luther King Parade [Dr. Martin Luther King Birthday Parade], was a very--you know, very much involved with that.  [HistoryMaker] Reverend Bill Lawson, whose church is right down the street, he was involved with that.  Reverend--at that time, I think Reverend C. Anderson Davis was also involved.  So there was a number of persons involved with it and it--that just happened to be here, you know, in the Houston area, but those were the days.
Story_ID: 486498
Speaker 1: Were there riots in Houston [Texas] after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?
Speaker 2: Very little because when Dr. King was killed, what the leadership of the city decided was if they want to ride on the bus, front or the back, so what, let them do it.  If they want to go eat downtown, let them do it.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute now.  So you're saying in 1968, here in Houston, the buses were still segregated?
Speaker 2: It was not--I don't remember exactly how that was, but it was--not in '68 [1968], because--not the buses, but there were some other things that was seg--was--wasn't integrated.  Because when Dr. King died--no, there were no riots then and a lot of things had already been opened up because this--that--the leadership decided even before then rather than go through the riots and the shootings and all that, let's just let them do what they want.  If they want--if they can afford to buy in a certain neighborhood, let them do it.
Speaker 1: So Houston was something like Memphis [Tennessee], maybe, or some of the other cities where the business community, rather than lose a lot of money on a riot would rather just go and give you--
Speaker 2: That's what happened.  That's what they did.
Speaker 1: If that's the way to phrase it, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  If you don't want them to eat, just take the restaurant out.
Speaker 1: Now, I was told by someone who used to live in Houston that when the buses were segregated, someone started burning the buses up, you know, and that ended the bus segregation, but I don't know if that's true or not.  I mean, if you recall that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't think there was a lot of bus burnings here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Story_ID: 486499
Speaker 1: When you were in college, you majored in physical education, you first got exposed to tennis, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In my class, but I didn't play on the team.  I didn't even go out for the team.  It was some years later I just picked up the racket and started playing and practicing and, and now I like doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: So we'll talk about a tournament later, but I just wanted to see when you got started.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--yeah, I was part of mine was to take it up, like a lot of folks.  You know, you have to go out and when you're in school, if you're, if you're playing basketball that day, everybody played basketball.  Time to play tennis, you played tennis, you know.  I used to bowl.  Bowled a 300 one night.  I had an average of about 190, and then that was a--on this campus they had a two-lane bowling alley at one time, right here on Texas Southern's [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] campus here.  That--but, but yeah, I took up tennis, not took it up, I just started playing more of it later.
Story_ID: 486500
Speaker 1: Now, are there any particular teachers or students that kind of define your experience at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] when you were a student here?  You were here, I guess, off and on from '55 [1955] to '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I go the first year in '55 [1955] when I started.  After the first semester break, I decided not to come back.  I said, "I'm gonna get me a job working and buy me a car," and that's what I did.  And so on occasion when I decided, well, I'm going to start to work, make me some money and come back.  But the good part about it, I kept coming back.  But the teachers that really impressed upon me most was Dr. Rains [David Rains], who was the head of the department.
Speaker 1: R-A-I-N-E-S [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dr. Norris [Edward Pershing Norris, Sr.] who was my advisor.  Well, when I was at Texas Southern, and I was grown and not at home, in and out of mother's [Josephine Radford Edwards] new house, but had my own little places here and there, and so I wouldn't have to go to college if I didn't want to go.  So I liked to hotrod, like the race, in fact, they used to call me drag 'cause I used to love to drag race.  Just loved hearing those tires spinning.
Speaker 1: So would you fix your own cars up?
Speaker 2: I worked--yeah, I took--I, I remember one Saturday I took a transmission out and put it in one of my cars three times in one day because it didn't move fast enough for me.  Nothing wrong with it, I was just a fanatic about drag racing.  But, hm, speaking of Texas Southern, in and out, stopping and going back, and my grades were not that good.  You know, Bs, Cs, F, Is, so I came over here to register right in this very building 'cause that's where registration would be, right here in the library.  And I couldn't get into classes 'cause Dr. Norris, Dr. Rains had put me on probation.  It wasn't the first time I had been on probation about grades.  And so they were sitting behind the desk, they didn't say a word, he and Dr. Norris, but the lady--the people told them, "Well, you can't pick up a class card."  Then I went to another table, couldn't pick up a class card.  So after it was over I went over to the library, and I was gonna go talk--not the library, over to the PE [physical education] office to talk to Dr. Rains about getting in the class 'cause they told me, the only people that can approve this is Dr. Rains.  And he was really stern, he didn't smile much.  I mean, he was--I mean, you just thought he was the meanest man in the world.  But after I waited, they didn't come back 'cause I guess they were--lunchtime came or some break came, he and Dr. Norris were walking from this library over to the physical education building.  And there was a building over there called Fairchild Building [Thornton M. Fairchild Building], I remember real well, and that's about where we--I walked right to them, right in the middle of the day, and I asked them about getting into school.  And Dr. Rains said, "Well," and Dr. Rains, mind you, is a person that I used to bowl with.  I taught him how to bowl.  He just thought I was the greatest bowler in town, but yet, he put me on pro- not just probation, but he wouldn't let me get back in school.  And so I started talking to both of them.  One is the head of the department, one is my advisor.  And my sister, who was younger than I, was about to graduate and that's all I could think about, my youngest sister passing by, passing me up.  And then I started begging them to let me back in school.  I asked them, I said, "Well, what if I transferred and went to Prairie View [Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas]?"  'Cause I had a car.  I said, "I'll just drive to Prairie View."  They said, you can't transfer Ds and Fs to another college, and that's all you've been making.  And I said, "Now, are you telling me that I will never graduate from college?"
Story_ID: 486501
Speaker 1: What happens when you couldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh.  Well, when Dr. Gaines [sic. David Rains] told me that I would never graduate from college, it was based on the fact that I had asked him about transferring to Prairie View [Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] or going to some other school.
Speaker 1: There are no Bishops around here, isn't there a Bishop College (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bishop is up in Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was saying none of these things could be done.  I couldn't transfer, you know, my grades because they were so bad.  And the more we talked, the more it was hitting me that I would never be a college graduate.  I just couldn't imagine that, you know, and so I asked, I said, "But, you mean, you're telling me that I will never be a college graduate?  I will never go to college?"  And Dr. Carson--Dr. Gaines said, "Yeah.  Well, that's exactly what we're saying.  You can't, you can't graduate from a college with these kind of grades, that's just--."  I said, "Well, but I got to go to college.  I got to graduate from college.  I got to do that."  So we stood there and, man, tears was running down my eyes, my big pretty Thunderbird [Ford Thunderbird] was sitting over on the side of the street that I was paying no attention to.  I wasn't bothered about the students that was passing, the girls and nobody else.  I'm--I mean, I was in a heck of a bad fix.
Speaker 1: So those are the things you were usually paying attention to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I usually pay attention to my car, and the girls and all that; none of that was going on then, man.  It was about one o'clock, right in the middle of the day and I usually go to work at three, but he said--Dr. Norris [Edward Pershing Norris, Sr.] was a little--he was a little kinder and gentler.  He said, "Well--."  He said, "I don't know," he said, "but if you made A's and Bs, you could graduate from college."  And I said, "Well, if I start now making A's and Bs, I can graduate?"  He said, "Yeah, you could."  And so Dr. Gaines said, "I'll tell you what I'll do then," 'cause they really saw that I was serious, man.  This is hey, look, I know I messed up but, you know, I got to be able to do something.  He said, "Well, I'm gonna give you another chance.  I'm gonna give you one more chance.  I don't want to see you in my face ever again on this subject matter."  He said, "I'm not gonna let you take but two, two courses, nothing but six hours 'cause you're working."  He said, "I'm gonna let you start off with six hours.  And then if that goes well, then maybe you can add down the road, but nothing but six hours a semester."  He said, "And if you come in with Ds and Fs, there's no sense in even coming and talk to us."  I said, "So let me be clear."  I said, "So if I make A's and Bs, I can stay in school?"  They said, "Yeah."  He took out a piece of paper and wrote on that thing, gave it to me and I went came back over here, and I picked up two classes that was available.  English, I had always flunked English ever since I had been in Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  I remember taking it from Dr. McCleary [W.C. McCleary] and people like that, but those two from that day on, from that semester on, I made nothing but A's and Bs for the rest of my duration at college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I graduated.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But it took that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you came out in '66 [1966], so how--about when did you have the discussion with Dr.--was it Dr. Rains?
Speaker 2: Well, this had to be, I guess, around '60 [1960] or so, 'cause I had been out of school and come back to school.  I was out for off and on for a year to two or something like that.  But only taking six hours a semester. It took me some years to, to graduate, but once my grades were up there I was able to pick up a third course or whatever.  But from then on, all of my grades--I even made A's in English that I at one time made Fs and Ds.
Story_ID: 486502
Speaker 1: Did it spill over into other things you were doing in life?  I mean, your--this attitude (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it just--I was working full-time at Maxwell House Coffee [Maxwell House Coffee Company] during that time, and I just devoted my time to school and very little entertainment, very little.  It didn't matter what I was doing.  I made sure that all of my homework was done, done right.  I went to--came over to the library, did what I had to do.  I actually started living a whole different college life because I realized I had played too long, you know, you know, playing with college and you just can't play with college.  So those two men I'll always remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, when you graduated, what were your prospects?  What did you--
Speaker 2: Well, when I graduated--
Speaker 1: This is 1966, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a program that had been offered at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] for persons graduating in physical education and whatever we had, and at that time, Dr. Mo Dees [Morris Dees] was over at that program, along with, you know, some other professors, Dr. Perry [ph.].  And once you graduated with good grades then you could go up to Tuskegee and do your intern in therapy.  So I went up to Tuskegee, and I got certified in corrective therapy.  And I was told that--by the profession at that time, that I made the highest grade of record at Tuskegee.  And so--
Speaker 1: So you went all the way from the bottom to the top?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after that, did you become like a physical therapist afterwards or--
Speaker 2: Well, I was offered some positions.  I think I was in Castle Point, New York, I was offered a position in therapy, but I didn't, I didn't accept it, at that time.  I went back to work for Maxwell House after I came back from Tuskegee, and I got in sales and marketing and went to real estate school, got my real estate license.  Later, went and got my broker's license in mar- in the market business and I ran for the legislature [Texas Legislature] in 1978--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did--
Speaker 2: --during that time.
Speaker 1: It sounds like to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, you were leaning towards being an entrepreneur and having your own business--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --rather than working for somebody else?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I was--I used to stand out on the back, on the back of the building, one of the buildings over at Maxwell House Coffee and I could look out over the city, in some parts of it, and I would--I said to myself, I'd remind myself that one day I'll be out there making a living, not inside this plant, and so that's what happened.  One day something hit me, and I decided to gather up information after I had talked to a number of blacks who worked at Maxwell House Coffee who had degrees and--but they were porters, they were working on the assembly line and all of that.  When I realized that, I just starting going--talking to them and, you know, I knew that some had gone over to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], some had graduated, some had even second degrees.  I got all of their names and what they went to school for, and I documented that myself.  Nobody told me to do it, wasn't being paid to do it.  I was a lift truck operator and once I got my assembly line full, I would just go through the plant.  It took me some weeks and months to do this, hearing whether these guys went to school, what their degrees were in and when they graduated and the position that they were holding because they were discriminating at Maxwell House Coffee.
Story_ID: 486503
Speaker 1: I gathered up all that information, and then I got in touch with the enforcement officer at the EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].  Now, I didn't know anything about it, but in the front part of the plant they had up on the board that you--that everybody has to post up, employers do, have some equal opportunities, all of what that is about.  I read all that and I looked up on some of the names myself, nobody told me, I did it all on my own, and I got in touch with the enforcement office in Washington [D.C.].  Told them what was happening at Maxwell House [Maxwell House Coffee Company], they came down and met with me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is the EEOC?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so they obviously flew some folk down, we met.  I, I had copies of the information that I had sent them and there was no question that they were discriminating 'cause all these blacks out there with degrees, but they were porters, utility men, tow motor drivers, working on, you know, the wrong shift.  We got all that changed from what I had put together.  And, also, included there were no blacks in sales.  Well, I wrote that whole big thing that I was doing.  Four black men came out of that plant in sales and marketing, one went to St. Louis [Missouri], and went to St. Louis and another one was in Dallas [Texas], Eddie Farrell [ph.] was in Dallas and Joe Lee [ph.] and myself were all here.  All of us degreed individuals, but we were doing--I was driving the lift truck at the plant, but out of that fight, all--if you look back prior to that time it started off on this campus, and, of course, it also started out of my house looking at what my dad [Eldridge Edwards] did.  And so when we put all of those things together well, like I said, when I would stand up on at the plant and look out over downtown Houston [Texas] from Maxwell House Coffee, and I said, one of these days I'll be out there and not in this plant.  And sure enough, I was do--I was one of the ones who went with Post Cereals [Postum Cereals; Post Consumer Brands].  I had my own company car, my own account and I got promoted from being a salesman to account manager, and I called on major accounts like Fleming [Fleming Companies, Inc.], and Minimax, and Randall's [Randall's Food Markets, Inc.].  Major accounts.  But somewhere inside I kind of knew that I would not be in that plant much longer than that.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.  So at Post, you were in sales and marketing too?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, I went--I decided to--I was in the plant, but then I went into being a salesman.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And part of that came from fighting for other people.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I wasn't looking for it.  You know, I wasn't part of it, I was certified in therapy, I had my degree.  You know, I didn't know how long I would be there, but I knew at some point I could--and I had passed the National Teacher Exam [National Teacher Examination; Praxis Series], so I knew I could go other places.  That was my position.  I was clear I could--I didn't have a--I didn't have that problem that I could see others in the plant having.  And so my position is, what can I do to help these guys who are in here?
Speaker 2: Were these mostly older guys who had just been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Some were old and--
Speaker 2: --kind of got stuck?
Speaker 1: --some were--yeah, they--but some were older, some were, you know, in their thirties or forties and--but they were, you know, they didn't know they could do other things and a number of them became foremans and supervisors out at the plant.
Story_ID: 486504
Speaker 1: Your experiences, I guess, watching your father [Eldridge Edwards] or being involved in the Civil Rights Movement informed the kind of activity that you--I mean, that you took, the kind of actions that you took to get--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it had to be because if not, then developed.  It would be like Tiger Woods, we see him now the number one golf player in the world, but had not that talent been developed, he wouldn't be playing golf, he would just have talent, but who would know it?  So mine was developed inadvertently, so to speak.  I mean, it was developed.  They didn't tell me to do those things, nobody told me to do them, but because I got the exposure, I started doing them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let me just get some dates here.  Now, when did you start with Post or what dates did you work for Post [Postum Cereals; Post Consumer Brands]?
Speaker 2: I left in '80 [1980], so I must've spent--it was in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: So you were at Maxwell House [Maxwell House Coffee Company] until about what date?
Speaker 2: I left Maxwell House in the '70s [1970s] and went into sales, and I stayed in sales with them 'til 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was--it was '80 [1980]--no, it may have been '81 [1981] or '82 [1982] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'cause--
Speaker 2: --something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were working at Post when you were in the state legislature [Texas Legislature]?
Speaker 2: I did for one session.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I sure did.
Story_ID: 486505
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were elected in 1978.  Now, how did that take place?  How did you become an elected politician?
Speaker 2: Well, again, that too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had you run for office before?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that came from that background, being involved in the community as a--seeing my dad [Eldridge Edwards] doing it when I was growing up, being active.  He owned a camper, being in marches around the country with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and people.  I was his state chairman in '84 [1984] and '88 [1988].  You know, Congresswoman Maxine Waters [HistoryMaker Maxine Waters] who would be here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, were you--
Speaker 2: --and we--
Speaker 1: Were you--now, I don't want to get us out of order chronologically, but--so I'm gonna go back.  Now, were you a member of PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition] when it first started?
Speaker 2: Not when it first started, but I did serve on the PUSH--the PUSH International Trade Bureau board, which I didn't put down, but I served on that board.  When Reverend Jesse Jackson sp- and this was in '79 [1979], the first time he has ever spoken before house and a senate joint session; I passed legislation in Austin [Texas] to have him to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then got him into Austin and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  What I was--
Speaker 2: --Austin just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what I was trying to get at was, were you involved in Operation PUSH before you ran for office?
Speaker 2: No, I was--it was afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was involved with PUSH.  I wasn't on the board.  I was involved, yeah, 'cause I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --involved with Jesse Jackson and some of the rest of them who was out marching and demonstrating.  We'd meet up for this or that, or go places, you know, that was just the part of it.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all of that came from there, so--
Speaker 1: So where did the idea come to run for political office?  Did people think this because you were--were you leading civil rights--
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was also the PR [public relations] director for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] with Reverend C. Anderson Davis, who was the president of NAACP here at that time.  So I was always on television and making announcements and going to communicative meetings and functions, talking about the issues and the problems and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so Barbara Jordan stepped down from [U.S.] Congress, started with this lady right here that I used to sit with when we were in middle school and high school.  When she stepped down because of her illness, her position opened up.  At that time, con- Mickey Leland and Anthony Hall [HistoryMaker Anthony W. Hall, Jr.] had been in this Texas Legislature, so three persons ran for her seat, City Councilman Judson Robinson [Judson W. Robinson, Jr.], who's no longer living.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, one of the--
Speaker 1: --black city councilman, right?
Speaker 2: --first ones, yeah.  Mickey Leland and Anthony Hall, who I--and so I was gonna run for that--her seat and Mickey Leland came to me one day right next door to here at the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)], at a professional--Houston [Texas] profe- men's professional organization.  And, and he said, "Look, Al [HistoryMaker Albert Edwards]," 'cause we had been friends, I mean, we had been in other campaigns and stuff like that and I had helped him in his campaign where he ran for the legislature.  He said, "Al, what are you doing?"  He said, "This seat doesn't make sense.  You can't run against me or me run against you."  He said, "And I can--I've been in the legislature, you've never been in office."  He said, "I would sure beat you."  He said, "But it doesn't make sense."  He said, "Why don't you and I hook up together and run for Anthony Hall's seat?  'Cause Anthony's going to run."  I said, "Oh."  Because I wasn't bothered by running for office, not really.  I never really cared about it, but he said, "We'll just hook up together, and I'm gonna run for Barbara's seat and you help me.  You run for Anthony's seat and I'll help you."  So that opened those seats up, and that's when I ran for his seat and there were seven or eight persons already running for that seat and I got in there at the very last day.
Story_ID: 486506
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you ran for the seat that Anthony Hall [HistoryMaker Anthony W. Hall, Jr.] had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was vacating?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I won that seat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So what do you think was the decisive factor in you winning?
Speaker 2: Being involved in the community, you know, and, of course, my dad [Eldridge Edwards], who was active with the ministers, my [paternal] grandfather [Redick Edwards] who, in that same district, who passed it and built that church out there.  Had a, you know, big families on both sides of the family.  You know, our family just knew a lot of people and, and, you know, of course, people had seen me doing things.  And that's what I tell people who talk about running for office, get out there in the community and do things so you'll have a story to tell, not what I'm going to do, but what I've done and that makes the difference.  And so--
Speaker 1: So did you have the backing of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Well, NAACP cannot even today get involved--
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: --with campaigns, but a lot of their members were supportive of me in the campaign.  You know, I had the community, I didn't have the leadership of the community, I had more of the regular everyday ordinary people.  And I had some others, but the most of the elected officials they were not with me when I ran the first time.
Speaker 1: Now, were you fairly confident when you started running that you were gonna win or did you think, "Well--,"--
Speaker 2: Well, well, I just--oh, I didn't believe there was no way to lose.  Of course, the same thing carried over when I went to the legislature [Texas Legislature], I didn't feel like there was nothing that I couldn't do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you were elected in 1978 to the district you represent, you represented then was the--in the Third Ward [Houston, Texas] here?
Speaker 2: It was more southeast.  That included the Sunnyside [Houston, Texas], South Park [Houston, Texas] area, Astrodome [Houston Astrodome; NRG Astrodome, Houston, Texas] area, and then further to the southwest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is the area around--is that area predominantly black?
Speaker 2: No, it's only about 55 percent black.  With about 10 percent Hispanic and the rest white.  So it was never a black--well, it was considered black because it was majority black, but not an overwhelming amount.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't like a black neighborhood necessarily.  But it was like a district that was mixed.
Speaker 2: It was mixed.  A very diverse district even today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a real challenge, but we made it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486507
Speaker 1: So was there any particular campaign issue that stuck out more than anything else?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the biggest thing was that I had a record of accomplishments and involvement.  I could talk about the Civil Rights Movement, talk about TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], helping to shut down the dock, helping to integrate the schools as far as our black history was concerned.  So I had a list of things that people knew that I was doing and knew I was involved with it.  And the movement was very close to us, much closer then than now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In terms of the curriculum and the--now, how did that become an issue?  For some people, even today in 2007, the curriculum for them is no issue.  They don't even see it, even black people don't even see it as something important to deal with.  How did you get involved in trying to change the curriculum, is there any particular incident in the city that kind of woke people up to that?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that we didn't have it in our schoolbooks meant that we should have.
Speaker 1: No black history, huh?
Speaker 2: You know, we just--just like when there were no blacks working in key positions with our major corporations.  We would go to them and raise hell because they had no blacks, we didn't tell them who to hire.  But hire blacks to help run this corporation.  Especially our, you know, consumer, automobiles, beer and groceries and you know, I mean, help run these big chains.  You know, our oil companies.  And a lot of them hired blacks simply because we reminded them that they didn't have blacks, and that they should.  It was just the right thing to do.  We weren't looking for the job but we knew that they should do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in terms of curriculum though, I can hear the school board asking you what like kind of black history you want (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the fact that you don't have it in there.  And you've got a school district that was 25, 30, 35 percent and you have no history about them in the schoolbooks.  I mean, why not teach them who they are and from whence they've come and what some of their accomplishments were.  But they are still not really there in the schoolbooks like they should be.  But at least the schoolbooks allowed for Black History Month.  Used to be black history day or week, and it has made it a big, big difference, because even other groups now have started having their history program.  Like the Hispanics and the Asians and stuff.  Which allows everybody to learn about everybody.  So I think it's been real good, but they didn't have it is important as education is.  Then that was just another thing that we thought that we ought to fight.  Now, I mean fight for.
Story_ID: 486508
Speaker 1: Was black history education a major feature of Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] when you were a student?
Speaker 2: I think they had some degree of a black history structured thing, but not much.  I think--and I know the University of Houston [Houston, Texas], they had what they called the African American something.  They have it on both campuses now, and they're carefully going to cut them out because we don't participate as much like we should.  But because the nature of the school didn't, there was just a lot of stuff that was talked about.  You know, the news itself, because of course the issue was born out of oppression and segregation, so it had to be talked about to some degree.  But not the big forefront burning issue, because TSU didn't organize the marches and the demonstrations.  It just so happened we met at Texas Southern because that's where people were, but it didn't come out of the administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it wasn't led by the academics over there--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --so much as it was--
Speaker 2: Absolutely not.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, so--were you successful in getting some black curriculum in the schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, they did get some black history in our books, and a year after that of course they had to go to the legislature [Texas Legislature] to get it done.  But it had to be requested by the district.  But yeah, they did get some black history, much better than it was originally, you know.  Most of the things like that have to be led and driven by others.  Because in 2004, 2004, I led about five, seven thousand people up from Prairie View [Texas] to Hempstead [Texas] because the county judge down there said that the students at Prairie View [Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] didn't have a right to vote.  And which is totally and absolutely wrong because the law says you can vote wherever you live, and at the time they lived there, but they would not let those students vote.  So we got together and organized, and met with the mayor, commissioners, and the presidents of student body and fraternities and sororities.  And we marched seven miles from Prairie View to Hempstead.  This has only been two or three years ago.  We marched to the county steps and had a big rally right on the county commissioner's steps. Today, that county clerk and that white county commissioner is out of office, and those students are voting within a couple of blocks from the recreation building.

Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the legislation to recognize Juneteenth.  Now, you started that in '79 [1979], right?  A year after you were in office [in the Texas Legislature] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.  Well, first of all, you know, we knew about Juneteenth.  The fact that, even though the message got to Galveston, Texas late, June 19, 1865.  And of course the Emancipation Proclamation was signed January 1863, by [President] Abraham Lincoln.
Speaker 1: In '65 [1865] actually was when slaves were actually free.
Speaker 2: We got the message June 19, 1865.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But the proclamation to set slaves free was signed January 1, 1863.
Speaker 1: Well, you know there's some controversy about whether anybody was set free with that, because if your master was fighting for the Confederacy, you were set free.  But nobody could free you 'cause you were still with your master (laughter).  But if you were--if your master was not fighting for the Confederacy, you were still a slave, you know, in 1863 according to the proclamation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But after 1865, the war [Civil War] was over and everybody was basically free.
Speaker 2: Well, the--that was the very last--when it finally did get to Texas--and my mother's [Josephine Radford Edwards] birthdate then, on the 19th of June, and my dad [Eldridge Edwards], as community oriented as he is, made sure we knew about Juneteenth.  In fact, every Juneteenth, they would dig a hole in the ground, and put wood and coal down there, and then put screen wire over the top of it.  And that's how they would barbeque.  And neighbors did that all over the community, and you could walk down the street and you could smell barbeque all over the place.
Speaker 1: Now, you were saying also, that's when they opened the amusement park [Playland Park, Houston, Texas] for black people?
Speaker 2: That was on the 19th--yes.
Speaker 1: That was on the 19th too.
Speaker 2: That too was on the 19th of June.  That was the day that we could go out there, you know.  We'd have all of those nickels, and quarters, and that was the big thing.  They would have to pick us up later on that night.  'Cause we would stay out there all the rest of the day after we had mother's big, you know, dinner.  And we wouldn't go--daddy wouldn't let us go every year, but we would go sometimes.  You know, because that was, you know, I mean a dime and a quarter, you know, that was some good money then.
Story_ID: 486510
Speaker 1: When I went to Austin [Texas], you know, my inclination is that if the Italians and all these other folks could have a holiday depicting their accomplishments, and who they were about, then why not us?  I didn't push it that way because it never would have passed.  Because during that legislative session, out of 150 house members, and 31 senators, that was 181 folk.  There were only 14 that was black out of that 181.  We had a Republican governor, and in a state as conservative as Texas, and holidays cost millions of dollars.  And, you know, that's always the big push and cry about the budget.  And so I wrote Juneteenth into the legislation seven different ways before I finally came out with it being a straight up holiday.  One was an observance, another one was do it the Saturday before, another one do it the Saturday after, you know.  Just different things and different ways of putting it, just in case one way did not work.  Well, I also used my preference number on that particular piece of legislation [House Bill 1016, 66th Legislature Regular Session].  Your preference number is, if your bill passed the committee, and you get to the chief clerk's office, then they could have stopped it.  It had to have passed to the house floor for a vote, and I was able to get it out of the committee.  Congressman Green [Al Green] helped me do that, he's from here, and some others.  Even Republicans and mostly whites.  And so, while I was in the process of getting that bill through these processes and talking to legislators and stuff, I went to the governor.  "Governor Clements [Bill Clements], will you help me?"  He said, "No."  He said, "I'm not gonna help you."  And he said, "But if you get the bill to me, I'm going to sign it.  I'm not going to veto your legislation.  But, no, I'm not gonna help you."  He pointed to an Abraham Lincoln statue, a mannequin he had there in his office.  He said, "You know who that is?"  "Abraham."  He said, "Well, he's the one that signed the Emancipation Proclamation."  He said, "So, you get that bill to me, I'll sign it."  Well, needless to say, when I would go to white legislators with my flow chart to check off who I had and who I didn't have, my first time around, they all said no.  They didn't have no blacks in their district.  They would lose their seat if they voted a black holiday in.  It was gonna cause division.  It was gonna cost the state money.  State employees had too many holidays.  All these kind of things.  Well, the farm and ranch bill came up that session.  And they--and it was a close, close vote.  And they were doing the same flow chart work on their farm and ranch bill, I mean, the bill was good.  You could buy, I mean, you could get deals and you didn't have to pay it back for eight or ten years, and the interest rate was 4 percent.  I mean, it was a great piece of legislation for farmers and ranchers.  Well, I reminded them I didn't have a farm or a ranch in my district, but we could sure talk and I could also talk to some of the other members who would be supporting my legislation, and we were able to work something out and they began to sign up on my Juneteenth legislation.
Story_ID: 486511
Speaker 1: At the end of the house [Texas House of Representatives], Bill Hollowell, who was pushing the Confederate Heroes Day bill to be a holiday, came to me and told me that some of my black brothers had asked him to kill the Juneteenth bill [House Bill 1016, 66th Legislature Regular Session].  And he said that--and he was the dean, very conservative guy, but he was a Democrat.  He said, "But I want Confederate Heroes Day.  And I know you," he says, "I've read about you. You're a pretty good fighter."  He said, "But if you don't fight my Confederate Heroes Day to be a holiday, I won't fight your Juneteenth bill being a holiday."  I said, "Well, man, I can't support the Confederacy.  Golly, I'm totally opposed to all that."  He said, "Well, let me tell you something young man, my people are not crazy about Juneteenth either, and neither am I."  He says, "So, you've got to make a decision.  Either you don't fight mine, or you fight mine, and I fight yours."  He said, "I can kill your bill."  He said, "I know it.  I've been here much longer than you, you just got here.  I can kill your legislation.  So you either want your holiday and let me have mine, or we don't have a holiday."  I said, "Well, you've got a deal.  I won't fight your Confederate holiday, you won't fight my Juneteenth holiday."  And sure enough, when that bill came up, black guy walked up to the podium, put a can of--a bottle of red soda water on the podium making a joke out of it.  Walked on over to the other side of the wall, he thought that the bill was gonna die.  Know that they know before I got the first black vote, I had ninety-two or ninety-four white votes.  And so--and I had the speaker on my side.  And so we gaveled the bill through.  Had to go to the senate [Texas Senate].  You have to know that was really difficult.  No blacks were in the senate, and the gentleman that was over that committee by the name of Senator Bill Moore [William T. Moore], his daddy was a plantation owner.  And I asked him to carry the bill for me in the senate in his committee.  And he sat me down.  He said, "Let me tell you something, boy.  I know more about slavery than you."  And I just wondered what he was talking about.  Then he told me, he said, "My dad was a plantation owner.  And our slaves had to be off.  They would not work on the 19th of June."  And so he said, "Okay.  I'll carry this bill for you--"
Story_ID: 486512
Speaker 1: Now, you just said something that was kind of--it was a mistake, but not in some ways.  You mentioned him [William T. Moore] having slaves.  He actually had sharecroppers, probably, after the Civil War.  But they probably were no better than slaves in some places.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, that's right.  I mean, they had--I guess they were calling them whatever was convenient for their businesses at the time, sharecroppers or what not.
Speaker 1: Did he actually call them slaves himself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he said, "We actually had slaves."  He said--I quote him, "We had slaves."
Speaker 1: So he actually thought they were still slaves, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: That's interesting; isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But he thought--he carried that bill [House Bill 1016, 66th Legislature Regular Session], and convinced the lieutenant governor put it on the right calendar, and we were able to get it passed.  Now, Senator Mengden [Walter Mengden], they called him Mad Dog Mengden, called me over and wanted to--he told me he was gonna kill the bill.  It didn't need but two votes on that calendar to kill it.  One guy had already signed against it, so all now, one person could have signed against it.  Just signed their name and it would have been dead.  The reason he did not kill it, is because his assistant reminded him that when his abortion bill came up, and I'm opposed to abortion.  I wish ladies didn't have to have it.  Of course, I support a lady having a right to do with her body what she wants to do.  He told me, he said, "Out of all the Democrats, senator, he's the one that voted with you on your abortion bill in the house [Texas House of Representatives]."  He said, "Yeah?"  He said, "Well, if that's the case.  Then I won't kill your bill."  I had no idea that we would run into each other like that because there was a month's difference.  But I was just voting my convictions, and so we got it passed and a black guy, Clay Smothers, told me, he said, I'm not gonna fight your bill because some people tried to get him to fight it.  He was the only black Republican in the house from Dallas [Texas], and he didn't fight it in the house.  But the day that the governor [Bill Clements] was gonna sign the bill, on July--on June the 13th, 1979 [sic. June 7th, 1979], I had arranged the program down on the capitol steps [Texas State Capitol, Austin, Texas].  We had choirs and thousands of folks there.  Clay Smothers called a press conference.  The black guy did, and asked the governor not to sign the bill for Juneteenth.  It was in the newspaper, he said, "It was the worst piece of legislation we ever could have passed."  A black man.
Speaker 1: Did he give a reason for why he thought it was the worst?
Speaker 2: Oh, we could take the money and do other things, and, you know, we got the message late.  Just silly stuff.  He just couldn't stand the fact that this bill was gonna pass, and they didn't have anything to do with helping to make it pass.  But, you know, I had two truckloads of watermelon there.  I think H-E-B [HEB Grocery Company, LP] and some other company.  But most of the folks there, overwhelmingly, was white.  And when the program was over, and I wanted me some watermelon, the watermelon and the truck were gone because all the watermelon had been eaten up.  So when people laugh and talk about watermelon, nobody can tell me that white folks don't like watermelon, just like black folks like watermelon.  But we were able to get it done, and since that time, of course, we've organized cities all over the state and around the country, and we're gonna make it a national holiday too.
Story_ID: 486513
Speaker 1: And it's really spread.  I know we were talking before we started the formal interview about the celebrations in Denver [Colorado], and there's some in California.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's spreading (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] got them, Milwaukee's [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] got a big Juneteenth.  Even that far north--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they don't have a historic connection to Juneteenth, other than it's a celebration of when we got the word.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was definitely a Texas holiday, but I'm glad so many other states are joining in, even passing legislation.  And we will make it a national holiday.  If God leaves breath in my body and people keep working like they're working.  But, you know, nearly twenty years later I passed another bill dealing with Juneteenth, and that set up the first Juneteenth historical commission.  The governor [George Walker Bush] appointed the members, the lieutenant governor [Bob Bullock] and a speaker appointed members.
Speaker 1: Now, when was that passed?
Speaker 2: That was in '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And part of this mission is to set up the program and stuff like that for Juneteenth, but also, we're building a Juneteenth monument on the capitol grounds of Texas [Texas State Capitol, Austin, Texas].  On the capitol, and there's nothing else that's black out on the yard of the capitol.  So it's the first and only--I mean, it's not just a little, you know, three or four feet high thing.  It's just gonna stand, I mean, one of the statues on it is nineteen feet high.  So we're talking about, it's cost us a little over a million and a half dollars for that monument.  We also have one in Galveston [Texas] at Ashton Villa.  A Juneteenth monument, first ever in the history of this world.  And Ashton Villa is the place where Granger [Gordon Granger] made the announcement that the slaves were free.  So we're real insistent on making sure that when we leave here, our history won't be the same as when we came here.  And our children will be able to--when they see those monuments and ask what that monument means, mama or daddy.  It's Juneteenth, that's--it represents the day that our ancestors were set free in the State of Texas.  Imagine that, on the capitol, how many people are gonna go through that capitol ground and see that monument.  That's how you build and develop.  All of this, and I was the chairman of the committee, chairman--I raised the money, the whole bit.  And all of that started from out there in Trinity Gardens [Houston, Texas] when I was a little boy watching my daddy [Eldridge Edwards], and just following his suit, you know, right onto that.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about this.  Now, at the--around the same time that you were fighting for Juneteenth, on a national front, people were fighting for the Martin Luther King holiday [Martin Luther King, Jr. Day].  That really was kicking in around '79 [1979] or '80 [1980] as well.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It was.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I helped, I helped sponsor the bill to make Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] birthday a holiday.
Speaker 1: Here in the State of Texas, yeah.
Speaker 2: And the good part about that, I don't know how many people could say--well, I don't know no one ever would be able to say that much to many people.  Imagine, I helped sponsor the bill to make Dr. King's birthday, a holiday, and we got it.  I helped sponsor, I sponsored a bill to make Juneteenth a holiday, and we got it.  Not too many people can say they voted, and had a part in making those two things actually happen because it had to happen through the legislature, not any other way.
Speaker 1: Was there any opposition here in Texas over the Dr. King holiday?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah man, I tell you, that bill was sponsored several times before it was finally passed.
Speaker 1: Because I know it never passed in Arizona.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arizona was a real, real problem.  But, yes, indeed, it didn't pass when they first brought it up.  Sure didn't, but we finally got it passed.
Story_ID: 486514
Speaker 1: What are some of the other issues and--well, what other legislation has been important, I guess in your almost twenty-eight years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, getting prayer back in school.  I sponsored that legislation, and we were able to get prayer back in school in the State of Texas.  Here again, not the open prayer, but it had to conform to the--whatever the federal government said that you could do it.  We couldn't go beyond that, which would be open prayer.  But they can definitely have silent prayer in school.  I pushed that legislation, and we were able to get that legislation passed.  I sponsored legislation on lowering property taxes.  I sponsored legislation that benefits our senior citizens.  I sponsored legislation for the CHIP program [Children's Health Insurance Program], children's health insurance right now.  Children up to seventeen would have insurance.  But imagine having over a million children in Texas with no insurance.  Tons of problems, appendix problems, whatever.  They didn't have any insurance.  Now, we have a program that will help solve that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, health insurance as we speak today, it seems to be a national issue once again.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: I know it was in '92 [1992] when Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] was trying to sponsor legislation that didn't go anywhere.
Speaker 2: She was ahead of her time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she was right because today we have, what, nearly 146 million people without health insurance in America.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  As we sit here, though, Michael Moore's movie 'Sicko' is going around the country and people are talking about once again, about national health insurance as a problem.
Speaker 2: We've got to have it because individually, it is too expensive.  I mean, you can't--if you're working for some companies who do not provide health insurance, you're just out there hoping and praying you don't get sick and nothing happens to you.  Or you have to go to the county, and, of course, when you go to the county in Texas, these county hospitals, you can't hardly get in there because you got so many illegal aliens, and Mexican Americans, and Asian folks who are without jobs and you can't hardly get in there.  Otherwise, you gotta have your own insurance, and most folks, if the company doesn't pay for it, it's too expensive.  So, yes, we've had to fight that issue.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think the black community is aware of the fact that if they live in Canada, or France, or someplace they wouldn't have to pay for health insurance?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  No.
Speaker 1: Are they aware of that?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Not that many people are aware of that.  Because to be honest, I didn't know, I didn't know that was the case myself.  Not that I would have moved over there, but I would at least think about it (laughter).  Yeah, but we've got to do something about healthcare.  I mean, you know, we claim we didn't have any money, but when the Iraq War started, we found trillions of dollars.  And right today, we're spending $168 million a day on that war.  And we've got people in America that's homeless, that's sick and can't get healthcare, uneducated and you don't want to pay for education.  Our education and our colleges and universities have skyrocketed.  You can't hardly afford it.  I mean, we've got senior citizens over here with illnesses that they can't get treated.  They got drug prescriptions that they can't get filled, and, yet, we're spending $165-170 million a day on a war where our boys are being killed, and we're over there for something.  Stability, or to have a handle on the oil, or whatever the underlining factors are.  Who knows?  But I know they're making a lot of millionaires out of a lot of people under this administration through that war (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 486515
Speaker 1: George Bush [President George Walker Bush] being in office at this very time, he was a former governor of Texas, and with a lot of Texas people in his cabinet and in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  Do you have any reflections on those people, and about George W. Bush (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think, I think, you know, President Bush and I were in the same, one of the same summer programs before we ever thought about running for office.  I've been knowing him a long time, I've been to his mother [Barbara Bush] and daddy's [President George Herbert Walker Bush] house.  We laugh and talk about his dad had a big Chrysler and his wife [Laura Bush] reminds us that he should have been paying attention when he ran a stop sign and had a wreck in the car, and he always remind me not to remind him about his wreck.  I mean, we're old friends, George Bush and I served together in the Texas Legislature.  And we would talk about Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] and John White [John C. White] who headed up pool where we would be during the summer.  You know, playing and tussling as young guys.  But, I don't think he's really calling all the shots.  I think Cheney [Dick Cheney] is a big, big part of what's going on behind the scenes.  You know, Cheney's company was making all that money off of, you know, whatever the contract was to Iraq and, you know, nothing happened.  He didn't even get slapped on the hand.
Speaker 1: Halliburton [Halliburton Company]?
Speaker 2: Halliburton, yeah.  I mean, if you and I was doing that, taking federal money, and we're in office like this, oh, they would want to hang us.  But Cheney's doing it, getting away with it, and his friends are just making millions of dollars off of that war [Iraq War].
Speaker 1: Billions.
Speaker 2: And our boys are being killed over there.  I admit we need to have stability in that part of the country for our own protection, so I understand that.  But if we could come up with that kind of money for that overnight, then surely we should provide healthcare for senior citizens who can't get their prescriptions.  They got to choose between eating or their prescription being filled?  I mean, come on man, how hypocritical.  And then you get up on television and talk about how loving, and how you believe in God, and all this kind of good stuff?  To me, it's hypocritical that we don't take care of our sick and mentally ill people in this country.  I mean, it's really like, kicked to the curb.  Even in the legislature in Texas, it's hard to get really good funding for our mentally ill.  I just don't see how God would ever bless us for that.

Speaker 1: As I'm asking you to reflect on George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush], can you give us some reflections on Barbara Jordan?
Speaker 2: Barbara Jordan and I went to the same elem- middle school [E.O. Smith Middle School, Houston, Texas] and high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].  Even then she was a great orator.  I mean, she was on all our assembly programs most of the time, or she was the emcee.  She was ahead of me, but we never knew that she would become the great person that she became.  'Cause we didn't know.  To us, she was just another well speaking person at school.
Speaker 1: She wasn't the only one.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But she made us proud, though.  And then behind her at that same school came Congressman Mickey Leland, who we all, you know, we just was crazy about him.  We had our differences, but he too was a great guy.  So Barbara made us proud, and Mickey did the same thing.  And, of course, now we have Congressperson Sheila Jackson Lee that's doing a good job along with Congressman Green [Al Green].  But I think that too many young folk know nothing of Barbara Jordan, because their parents are obviously not telling them about her.  They don't talk about her--their own blacks who have made it.  I don't know why that seems to be such an industry of jealousy, of realizing how important it is.  But you have to teach your children who all the blacks are in their accomplishments, so they'll be motivated.  Not teach them about whites or browns, yeah teach, but teach all of it.  My children today can talk to you about politics because they have heard me talking about it.  And I talk to them about it.  They know segregation is real.  They know racism still exists.  But a lot of children think that everything's okay, and when they run into difficulties and problems, they end up on drugs or losing their jobs and not knowing how to handle it.  Long as you know what you're facing, then you can deal with it.  If I go out in the jungle and know that there are bears out there, then I can stay prepared for it.  But if I go in the jungle and I don't know, then I may get killed.  And that's what's happening to a lot of our children.  That's why so many of our boys are in prisons, and our girls are coming up with AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] by the un- you know, breakable numbers.  Because we're not teaching them the dangers that exist out there.  And it's not anything difficult, just, just, it's just, do it like every day talk.  Around my boys, I sit every day talk about what's going on.  If they, anywhere they go they're gonna know people.  You know, who are involved from the president down.  I've taken them to the White House [Washington, D.C.], I've taken them to inauguration services, even Republicans.  You know, so they'll learn and know.  And so, that's, that's--we--our children don't know about Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland.  They don't know about Eldridge Stearns, Ovide Duncantell, people who helped blaze the trail here, because we don't talk about them.  And a lot of times there's a jealous streak, but we've got to make that, we've got to make that correction.  I think we will.

Speaker 1: What issues or legislation are you working on at the present time that are the most important?
Speaker 2: I think one of the main things that we're working on now is this university where we are, Texas Southern University, here in Houston [Texas].  Ever since I've been in the legislature [Texas Legislature] and before, and it's always at the time of appropriations, that there's always something's wrong with Texas Southern.  The finances are not right, they're not reporting what they're doing properly, the students are not satisfied.  There's some kind of upheaval.  There's always underlying, and I think this is a move to get Texas Southern under a system.  If not the system of the University of Texas [University of Texas System] or A&M system [Texas A&M University System], under another system that they've created.  But surely under a system, not where it's independent the way it is today.  Texas Southern has an open door policy.  Where you can--you don't have to pass an entrance exam like you do at some of these other schools in order to get in school.  You have to pass some kind of exam.  But, in other words, it provides an opportunity for everybody that's not geniuses or semi-geniuses, or whatever (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So if you have a high school diploma, you can enter Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: Yes, pretty much.  Yes.  And this has been the difference between people who are successful or not.  I would doubt to think that I would, may not have even passed that exam if I had had to go through what you go through to get in University of Texas, for example.  And so--and we'll appropriate, you know, $50, $60 million every biennium over here.  That's a lot of money.  And you've got a lot of folks who want to take control of that money.  Not that they're so crazy about Texas Southern, the students, the incoming students, past students, but the money.  And we know what that means.  But, but every session, we're having to fight to keep Texas Southern from being merged with some other school.  It's providing a great service and so one of the things that we're continuously doing is monitoring and staying on top of what's going on at Texas Southern.  In fact, I talked to former representative Glenn Lewis [Glenn O. Lewis], who is the chairman of the board of regents, just recently.  And his position is that we've got to do what we've got to do to put Texas Southern in a position where we even have a good president.  Can't walk into things that's in shambles.  You know, our present president is going through some changes and trials and in court.  I hope things work out well for her because I think she's one of the greatest presidents this university has ever had.  And, uh--
Speaker 1: That's who?  What's her name?
Speaker 2: Dr. Slade [Priscilla Slade].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486518
Speaker 1: The other one is, our young men and black women go into prison at record numbers.  The judges, we're not asking them to be patient for personal reasons with these folks, but be patient enough to listen to what the issues are and stop just railroading them, in my opinion, to prison.  Our prison population with blacks are 50 to 60 percent.  Yet our population in this state is about 10 to 11 percent.  Now, you know, why so many in prison?  In our community, right where we sit in the Sunnyside [Houston, Texas], South Park [Houston, Texas], the southern part of Houston [Texas], it's the number one fastest growing area for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] among black folk.  Now, why is that?  I mean, you know, why does it have to be that way?  And so, we've got to find funds and convince people that we've got to teach AIDS education.  We ought to teach them more morals and character rather than, you know, this stuff that these consultants are out here talking about.  Let's teach them all about sex and how it works and all that kind of good stuff.  But, I'll teach them that sex should be for love and marriage, not just out there playing with it like they're doing.  Genital herpes is a growing, growing thing in our community among our girls between 14 and 17 and 21.  And so with our boys going to prison for reasons--one of them, they don't have funds to have proper representation.  Because some of our court-appointed attorneys, all they want to do is get the case, and get them to plead guilty on something, and turn their paper work in, get their check and keep going.  And that's what's happening to a lot of them.  And so we--and I served on appropriations on the criminal justice subcommittee with Representative Turner [HistoryMaker Sylvester Turner].  I would think that if judges just give them more community service, don't put boys--give them three to five years because he was smoking one joint of marijuana.  I mean, come on, some of our pilots are smoking more than that.  They shouldn't be doing it, but they are, you know, a whole lot of people who are in office are doing it.  I mean, I don't condone it, it's not right, but why ruin a man's life because he's smoking a marijuana joint?  Same thing for how you throw the book at us for DUIs [driving under the influence].  You shouldn't drink and drive.  I don't care what your color is because you kill innocent people, you got to pay the cost.  But if you stop me because I was weaving and bobbing, you know, and I'm an upstanding citizen, just happen to have maybe one drink too much, you know, you can ruin my life by snatching my license, you know, sending me to prison for a couple of years, or jail.  Or, you can have someone to come get me, take me home, and give me community service.  Just good common sense stuff is what the legislature [Texas Legislature] is working on.  Because these young men, when they come out of prison, they can't rent apartments, can't get a job, so they end up going back to the recidivism rate, and so high until it's pathetic.  Because they come out with nowhere to go.  Can't get a job, the apartments won't give them an apartment, and so they just kind of drift right back into what they were doing.  And that carries over into our communities.  So those are just some of the things that we're working on, and it's a constant everyday fight.
Story_ID: 486519
Speaker 1: What are some of your other hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I wish God would instill with us an attitude of what we sing about on Sundays and preach about on Sundays.  And that's not being so jealous and envious of each other.  But to reach out and want to touch and to help.  It's a real good feeling when you help people.  I mean, I've experienced it over the years and I wouldn't stop it for nothing.  But for whatever the reason, it seems that black folks don't like each other.
Speaker 1: Do you think--what role do you think the church should play in that?  I know you're a Baptist minister yourself, you come from a family of ministers.  You've also been involved in a movement in trying to change social conditions.  Do you have a sense of what the church should be doing?  I mean, from the--I mean, in terms of on Sunday, people coming here to have a sermon, what are they getting the message that they should--
Speaker 2: Well, I think our ministers should include more personal love and care, and a lot of them do.  I think, though, the minds of our folk are molded, so often it's at home.  You've got to see--well, and of course we had a problem there because so many of our homes are headed up by single parents.  And oh, 50, 60 percent of those happen to be female.  Seventy-five, 80 percent of our children are born out of wedlock, so you don't have that family thing there.  But it has to start when you, and somebody we have confidence and believe in as a young person, I think.  The fact that my dad [Eldridge Edwards] taught us not to fight each other, don't dislike each other to the extent that you want to hurt each other.  And so that carries over, that I don't want to hurt you, because I was taught not to want to hurt somebody.  We couldn't call each other names because it belittles folk.  So I think about that before I do that to people.  We've got to start with the parents, because that's the person who has such a direct influence on that child's life.  And this thing about (unclear) is no good, you know, Uncle Sam is no good, Johnnie Ray is no good.  Those children hear that, and so we're no good.  And so I just think that that's something that would be the greatest thing in the world could happen, that we start taking a different view of each other to the extent that I want to see you grow and go.  Not because you're doing alright for some reason, I kind of want to see you fall.  So that would be my greatest desire.  My favorite song is, 'If I Can Help Somebody As I Pass This Way' [sic. 'If I Can Help Somebody'].  Then my living won't be in vain.  Well, yeah, you'll run into some people who can be pretty nasty.  And you'll run into things that you'd rather not have to deal with, but by and large, when you get through with, it's a plus.
Story_ID: 486520
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I would probably, I probably would do a little different family wise.  I'd probably be married rather than divorced.  I've learned and observed that it could have more devastating effect on the children, I think, than the adults.  If it's possible, I think family should do everything under the sun to stay together.  I used to hear--my mother [Josephine Radford Edwards] said, "If it wasn't for you children, I'd leave this man [Edwards' father, Eldridge Edwards]."  She didn't leave him because when the children were gone, she was still there.  But, but I--but she said, but parents should stay together for the sake of the children.  I know what she means now.  I didn't then, you know.  I'm not so sure that I would spend as much time dealing with community issues, rather than my business.  I think I would work to do things in the community, but I'd also emphasize my business because it takes money to do things.  And a lot of times, if you're making enough money, you can do it yourself.  A lot of things I do, I just do them myself.
Speaker 1: They don't necessarily require legislation or--
Speaker 2: No, no correlation.  It requires just wanting to do it.  The City of Houston [Texas] cut back on the funding for the Juneteenth activities this year, and most of--the rest of that funding, I did it myself.  You know, but it wasn't a whole, whole lot of money, fifteen, twenty thousand dollars.  But let's assume that I made $2 or 3 million a year.  I wouldn't have to ask the city for funds, we could do it ourselves.  So that's something that we have to stress to our folk.  That we've got to become more economically sound, and not continuously to run to the government for help and other people for support.  Not a lot of time should do.  Especially, when you're putting on public functions.  They should participate.  They should help.  But at the same time, we should emphasize making, making money, developing our businesses and helping to keep our businesses flourishing and growing.
Story_ID: 486521
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, and you've addressed it somewhat when we talked about Juneteenth and the Dr. King holiday [Martin Luther King, Jr. Day], but what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my legacy would be from being involved, and the one that's been willing to reach out and help folk.  Not being afraid to face the establishment for poor people, old folks, the underprivileged.  I think, more than anything, outside of teaching us to observe who we are.  Using Juneteenth as a vehicle, because that's what it really was.  Getting into doors to teach young blacks to have more pride of themselves.  And Juneteenth has been a vehicle to just open those doors countless times.  It's doing it all the time now.  And people talk about it and ask about it.  We're able to teach children about their ancestors, and what they're about, and from whence they've come.  Not to give up because they still can accomplish and do things.  So it goes much further than just a holiday to just be off from work.  The very fact of it was, we can use this as a vehicle to help us get from where we are to where we want to go.  So my legacy is sort of like a combined thing.  Not only did I pass legislation, and then put programs there toward building a monument so folk going behind us can see.  But at the same time, over here fighting for old folks, and young folks, and in prison people.  So it's really kind of multifaceted, I guess.  If I can help you, that's what I'll do.  And being in the legislature [Texas Legislature], being involved in the community, educated in the Civil Rights Movement, there's not too many things you could come to me and ask me about that I can't tell you where to go find what you're looking for.  And so that's--either that would be my legacy or I'll end up with no legacy.  It's hard to tell, you know, just where they'll put it, because I've pretty much given most of my adult life to the community and dealing with the issues and the problems--

Speaker 1: You're going in your twenty-eighth year [in the Texas Legislature], you said as--
Speaker 2: This is the twenty-eighth year.
Speaker 1: Twenty-eighth year?  All right.  What are your future plans?  Do you plan to write about this experience, or do you want to seek a higher office, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm looking forward to putting this in a book.  I've been talked to about, you know, I'm gonna work more with the alumni over here at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] 'cause we graduates should support the university like others do.  And I'm gonna spend more time in my ministry, even though I've been to seminary school and, you know, got some degrees and certificates in that.  I still want to spend more time in that.  But I also want to spend more time organizing Juneteenth functions around the country and pushing real hard to get other states to pass legislation dealing with it.  And making Juneteenth a national holiday.  I just think it deserves it, it warrants it, and we're headed in that direction.
Story_ID: 486523
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  You mentioned your sons and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, the--all of my children are degreed--
Speaker 1: How many do you have?
Speaker 2: My last three is in real estate.  Not the last three, the--Al [Albert Edwards, Jr.], Jason [Jason Edwards] and Alana [Alana Edwards-Holloway].  Alana's going into real estate.  That's my daughter, spoiled as she is.  Jason is into real estate buying and selling, Al is doing the same thing, and I'm doing the same thing.  My daddy [Eldridge Edwards] was in real estate.  It just seems right, that it just, you know, it just fell down, just like that.  My--I have a brother [David Edwards] here that's an insurance agent.  Owns his own business and in fact, I sold him a building right near the downtown.  I have another brother [Redick Edwards] who is a senior vice president of Bank of America, vice president.  And I have another brother [Paul Edwards] who has a healthcare business, and he's doing real great and well.   And so all of my brothers and sisters, my other two sisters [Elrine Edwards-Henson and Mary Edwards] who got out of--they were educators and volunteering their time.  And so, all of the work and the energy that dad put into making sure we went to school, making sure we went to church, making sure we respected ourselves, our children--see, dad made us respect each other.  We could not curse in front of people, we couldn't fight each other.  He wouldn't let us play the blues at that house.  If we did, we were in trouble.  You know, we couldn't go to any neighbor's house.  He said, "That's why I've got this place for you, stay in your yard."  So he taught us that early, and that's where it has to come from.  And I, and I know now that my sisters, some of them retired, they're living well, they're not having to work for each other, brothers doing fine.  All of that started right there in that little frame house in Trinity Gardens [Houston, Texas].
Story_ID: 486524
Speaker 1: My last question is this.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: When--how would I like to be remembered?  I would like to be remembered as one who reached out to help those who couldn't help themselves first.  That would be my--that's how I would like to be remembered.  And that's how I actually want to be.  As one who had no problem helping others who couldn't help themselves.  And helping those who could help themselves.  More than anything, I want to make sure that whatever I do is in the honor and glory of God, and not for myself or mankind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you, sir.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.  Thank you.
