Speaker 1: State and spell your name please.
Speaker 2: My name is Arthur Turner, A-R-T-H-U-R, T-U-R-N-E-R is the last name and I represent the Ninth District.  I'm currently the Deputy Majority Leader in the Illinois House and I've served 20 years now.  I was born in December of 1950.  When I was elected, I was the first--no actually, I was the youngest black male ever to be elected at the time and that was back in 1980.  That record has since then been broken and we're very proud that there is some young people to come along and break that record.  But at the time that I came in, the Young Turk.
Speaker 1: Who broke it?
Speaker 2: I think it was Todd Stroger.  Between Todd  and Calvin [L. Giles], yeah.
Story_ID: 14503
Speaker 1: I'll start out by just asking some questions that have no relevance, but we're asking them or everyone and they're short.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, fish, catfish in particular, yeah.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is actually winter time.
Speaker 1: That's (laughter) a black person liking winter.
Speaker 2: But I live in Chicago, it looks much nicer in the winter (chuckle).
Speaker 1: What is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination.  Actually I enjoy pretty much everywhere I go.  There's so much I learn, I don't have any one spot that I've gone to on a regular basis, other than Mississippi and that's because that's where most of my family is from.  I can certainly say I enjoy that trip.  But in terms of whether it's abroad or other states, I sort of enjoy and appreciate each state and each country for what it has to offer.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color, probably black.
Speaker 1: Favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "It's a hard life, but you can make it."
Story_ID: 14504
Speaker 1: If you would tell us a little bit about your mother [Catherine Turner] and father [Joe Turner] and what you were--you say your family is from Mississippi, were you born in Mississippi or were you born--
Speaker 2: No, I was born in Chicago on the west side.  In fact, I was born in the area that I represent.  My parents are from Mississippi.  My dad is from the town of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, which is one of the first all-black cities here in the United States.  My mom is from Merigold, which is about ten miles away from there.  My dad had a third grade education and eventually he served in the armed forces and he came out and was a tailor and worked for the packing company.  Eventually I wound up as a laborer with the Chicago Board of Education.  My mom received an 11th grade education and while I was in high school, my mom went to school at night and became a physical therapist.  Her first job, when she came to Chicago, she and my step-grandmother came to Chicago together.  She was working as a nurse's aide and she did that until I think I was a freshman in high school and then I noticed that my mom and I both was going to school.  She was going at night and I was going during the day and she was studying to become a physical therapist.  So she's a retired physical therapist and for the last few years have pretty much been doing home health.  As I said, they both were from Mississippi and one of the things that they always did or we always did as a kid, in fact, from the time I was six weeks old, I had visited Mississippi at least twice a year.  I used to spend the summers there.  During the summer we would leave and we would go south.  In fact, I went to summer school at a little town called Drew, Mississippi, which is where my uncles were going to school at that time.  So I've always gone to the South and I remember, this was in a time when my grandparents [Esalena Williams and Alex Sanford] were sharecroppers.  So I got a chance to chop cotton and slop hogs and work for three dollars a day.  I know that, as I talk to seniors and some of my older constituents, they remind me that I was paid high at three dollars a day.  But I think it really taught me a lot about who I am and what the struggle that my parents and forefathers went through.  I can remember as we used to travel South, we would stop and I'd see the colored water fountains and the bathroom that I had to go to was in the back.  As a little kid, you jump out of the car, you want to go to the first one you see and they go, oh no, no, you have to go to the back.  Now as I'm older, I understand why my mother would fry up all this chicken before we'd get ready to hit the highway because you just couldn't stop at every restaurant and they just felt comfortable bringing our own food.  I can remember a number of trips where we fought for that last piece of chicken when you were less than 30 miles from my grandma's home.  I also remember the experience of getting out of the car and taking my shoes off and never putting them back on until the end of the summer.  But I think that it really helped me understand who I am and who we are and one phase of our history, I realize that everybody didn't have to go through that struggle, but it was a piece that truly I think, helped me know who I am and I'm very proud of it.
Speaker 1: Tell me, how did your parents end up coming to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well my dad was drafted.  He would serve in World War II and when you think about Merigold and Mound Bayou, there wasn't a lot of opportunities there for them.  So he decided that Chicago was the place for him.  I think his grandmother was here and so that was an extended family, which is kind of, actually my family has sort of served as the underground railroad for most of my mother's sisters and brothers.  My father was an only child.  His father, in fact, had to leave the town of Mississippi by night.  He was accused of killing or involved in a murder and so he had to leave town.  His mother died when we was born, so he was raised by his aunts.  I won't call him a foster child, but coming to Chicago was his way of just sort of setting out on his own.  My mother, as I mentioned earlier, came up with my step-grandmother and the two of them decided that they were going to relocate to Chicago because at that time, Chicago and coming to the North is where the jobs were.  So that's what brought them here, both knowing that their educational limitations, they always stressed to me and my younger brothers and sisters that education's important and the one thing that I always heard was that we will work, so that you can get the education which is going to make life better for you and they understood the importance of it.  So that was something that, although after third grade, my dad said he wouldn't be able to help me with my math homework.  He knew that it was important that we learn it and we try to study hard.
Story_ID: 14505
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Joe and Catherine Turner] share any other memories of growing up or did your grandparents [Esalena Williams and Alex Sanford] share any other memories of growing up that they shared with you?
Speaker 2: Oh certainly.  We talked a lot about their youth and they sort of compared it at that time, to the things that we wanted back in the late '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s].  Certainly when I look today when I have discussions with my kids [Arthur and Aaron Turner] and they talk about their needs and wants, you sort of understand how life has gotten better for us.  But yeah, they certainly spoke of it.  Dad didn't talk--I tell you they, some of the things that we considered negative today, some of the racial incidents that they may have experienced, they really downplayed that.  In fact, I didn't know that my grandfather was accused of a murder until I was grown.  My father did not think that that was something that was important and he didn't want me to grow up hating people as a result of why his father had to leave, because he was accused of actually defending himself.  So I was a grown man when I knew that my grandfather--and why he had to leave.  So I didn't, some of the negative things we didn't talk about.  They were always uplifting in terms of what you can do and what, if you have an education, you will be able to do.  So they would, if nothing else, talk about their shortcomings because they didn't have the education and what a difference it may make and why they were struggling and doing what they were doing for us, so that life would be better.
Speaker 1: Do remember any stories they told?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  A lot of it was, I would say family, in terms of aunts, sister, brother stories.  In fact, not long ago, probably 12 years ago, I purchased a car from my uncle.  I have a 1946 Dodge that my uncle bought new in '45 [1945].  This uncle on my grandfather's side of the family, my grandfather's side of the family owned their own land; they weren't sharecroppers.  So that uncle, I won't say prosperous, but he was able to do a few things.  He was able to do a few things.  He bought a car new in '45 and so the '46 Dodge that I purchased from him, he had it in a shed at the time I bought it.  It was a car that my mom tells me about the rides to church on First Sunday.  In fact, that was the only time he brought the car out was on First Sunday.  Sure, and that they rode on the back of the wagon that was pulled by a mule, but on First Sunday he would bring this Dodge out and everybody went to church in that car.  So I have the car now and when I bring it out my mom and my dad remember the car, but my mom in particular because she remembered as a little girl getting in this car going to church on Sunday. But there are a lot of family stories that we talk about in terms of, as a little girl, how hard it was for her because my grandmother was married, I think, three times.  So there are half-brothers and sisters and so there was some discussion about being a step-child and what that relationship was with each of the grandfathers.  For the most part it was all positive, but it just let us know that she had to do the normal things that she, cooking and cleaning was things that everybody had to do and they were something that she sort of reinforced, so that as a child when I was growing up, this is what I knew every Saturday morning was that the floors had to be mopped, the dishes had to be mopped and it wasn't a thing that your sister did or the girls did, but this was something that all children do.  As a family member, we all have a role to play in terms of living peacefully.
Story_ID: 14506
Speaker 1: Your mother's name and father's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Catherine [Turner]; my father's name is Joe [Turner] and I have a younger brother that's named after him.  He's actually the third child that was named after my father.  In retrospect you say, well why wasn't I named Joe and the irony of that is, his name is Joe and yet when we wanted to name the younger brother Joe, the hospital said it has to be Joseph because my father grew up in the area where people, the names were either short or they had initials.  I have uncles, like Uncle L.C. who when Uncle L.C. got ready to graduate from high school, the principal said, well your name is Leslie Carl because you can't be L.C.  This was at a time when we were changing and sort of insistent that people had full names and not initials, but it was not unusual in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] for kids to be named A.C. or L.C. or E.T.--not E.T., but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: But no, I didn't even know that people--I thought people had nicknames, but you're saying that the names were actual initials.
Speaker 2: The names were actual initials, right.  I was unaware, I thought that, but when you ask the name that was all they called.  This is something that I learned later that in many cases, they would actually tell the guy he has to have a full name versus an initial to move on.  But early in life, our grandparents, that was it.  They were A.C. or L.T.
Story_ID: 14507
Speaker 1: Are there any other memories on your summers when you spent them?  You were in Mount Vernon in the summer.
Speaker 2: Right actually Mound Bayou or Merigold [Mississippi], that doesn't say we had--I would spend probably a week or two in Memphis because I had a couple uncles that had served in the military.  They worked for Firestone [Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire, LLC] I remember in Memphis.  So Memphis was our big city preview into going into the country, because when we went to Mississippi it was rural and very rural.  Memphis was a stop where I got a chance to see the uncles who were lucky enough to have industrial jobs.  But it was--it covered pretty much those three states; Mississippi, Arkansas, a little of Arkansas.  I had an uncle who lived in Arkansas, that general area, what's referred to as the delta.  So the towns of Clarksdale, Rosedale, B.B. King's home, those were the places that I have a relative or a cousin and we pretty much made a point of seeing all those relatives.  When we went to visit, it was I don't want to say mandatory, but that was part of our family custom that.  Even to this day, that the ones that live in Chicago on Sundays we would get together and go by and visit the great aunts and uncles and that was just something that my parents [Joe and Catherine Turner] strongly emphasized.  I'm amazed today when I meet people who don't know their second and third cousins.  Said back, there are people who don't know their first cousins which is very strange.  But I came from a tradition where I could name fourth cousins.  In fact, in my district there are people who now--I'll run into somebody and they say, well he says he's your cousin; or she said she's your cousin.  I said, well they probably right.  I'm not here to deny it, but it was something we were proud of.  I think that that's helped me a lot politically because I want to believe everybody's related to the--
Speaker 1: Now you're, I think you're a born politician, that's what I think.  So family's been very important to you in your life?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  That's I think, something that we kind of gotten away from and even as I look at my political career, I tell people, there's only so much government can do, but the real solution is in addressing most of the problems that we're confronted with today, starting with the family.  The problem is, how do you legislate family and who defines family and the role of family has changed.  If you just look today where we are, compared to 50 years ago, it's changed dramatically.
Story_ID: 14508
Speaker 1: I was impressed--not impressed, but sort of, the wife and I agreed when my children [Arthur and Aaron Turner] were born 18 years ago, that she would be at home until those kids where school age.  Today, you find very few, for whatever reason, people staying at home raising their children.  In fact, in government, what we're saying is, let's provide more money for daycare.  Well, I don't care how nice the daycare center is and how qualified the staff is at that daycare center.  I don't care that there's a teacher in a daycare center that can do what a mother does or a father does during the first five years of that child's life.  So, that's something that I think, we did years ago and it was something that my parents [Joe and Catherine Turner] did because that's what they knew and that's what they felt was the way to do it.  Then we sort of gotten away from it.  When I look at where we are today, where you go into a home and when I was growing up there was one television; certainly in my parents' home there was no television and one radio, maybe if they were lucky, to where we are today where there's four televisions in a house, average family size.  I have two children.  My parents, well my dad as I mentioned, was a single child, only child, but my mother, I think there was nine in her family.  Fifty years ago it wasn't unusual to have eight or nine and certainly, because we were more of a rural economy and farm background, people had large families, but today we have two.  You can see a big difference in terms of where we're at and how we're progressing, I think.  So I do appreciate the family values and the things that have been emphasized.  I understand today, trying to adjust to the flexibility of it, but today the new family is the Internet and dot-com used to be dot-family or family-dot.
Story_ID: 14509
Speaker 1: I was born and raised in 1950 and at that time we lived on 19th and Troy, which was right across the street from Douglas Park.  As I mentioned, my mom [Catherine Turner] was working nights and my dad [Joe Turner] was working at the stock market at that time.  So my step-grandmother [Esalena Williams] who came to Chicago with my mother was sort of like, I think lived a block away, so I spent a lot of time with her, between her and my mom in terms of, as a little kid.  So I can remember walking down Roosevelt road, back then when they had a number of shops and they were theaters on Roosevelt Road.  This was all in the community known as Lawndale, which is the area that I still represent.  So I can remember those days.  In 1955, my parents purchased their first home and it was on a block in the 2100 block of Harding Avenue, which is where my mom still lives today.  At that time, we were probably the fourth or fifth black family to move into North Lawndale.  I should say on that particular block.  So I can remember having white neighbors that had their J.C.--was it Schwinns bicycles, and I think which bike Sears sold.  I was a young poor kid who, it was all my parents could do to buy the home, I was still waiting for that first bike.  The J.C. Higgins, that was the brand of bike.  But I can remember those bikes with the little horn on the side and I do remember what those days were like.  I can also remember running to the grocery store every chance I got with a return bottle.  I think then it was two cents on a bottle and boy, for two cents you could get a pack of Kits and a Double Bubble or a Bazooka [bubble gum]; you thought you had died and went to heaven.  In fact as I, my younger years I can remember because my grandma drank diet cola and she would always buy, I think, now as a parent, I understand why you buy one at a time (chuckle), especially if there are a lot of kids around.  But she would send you to the store everyday pretty much to buy this Diet-Rite Cola.  If you got lucky and you took her bottle, that was two cents that she had counted towards (chuckle) buying the next purchase.  But I remember those days.  In fact, I used to work at the neighborhood grocery store and I was the bag kid and would take people--help carry their bags home.  This is when you had a grocery store on every corner.  I can remember when we used to have a little charge account at the neighborhood store.  The guy kept a little green box and you go in the store and he'd write down how much you spent and at the end of the week or end of two weeks, my parents would settle up with him.  But I remember those days very well.  This was when Emil Denemark Cadillac is an automobile dealership was right on the corner, half a block from where I live.  I can remember during the months of August and September, when we would try to go into the garage to get a sneak look at the new cars that were coming out because they usually came out in October.  So in September we would sit there and look and go, yeah, this is the Cadillac I want and get the early preview book.  We'd ride our bikes to the garage and these guys would chase us out.  But those are fun years.  I remember when Ogden Avenue was very prosperous.  Oldsmobile dealership, Pontiac had a dealership, Ben Giller Chevrolet, so Ogden Avenue was noted for its automobile dealerships.  So those are the kinds of things, or growing up, that I could remember the lights that all the major strips as we go back and forth to home.  I have a good memory.  It was fun times and then I can recall my first job or second real job was a job as a cashier at a local grocery--no, a drug store.  I had this job while working in high school.  In fact, I went to parochial schools.  I went to a parochial grade school and when I decided to go to high school, my dad suggested that I go to the public school system because he was sort of, I think, tired of paying tuition, but he also had an affinity for public schools.  He felt that they were just as good and he didn't quite understand why I was going to a parochial school and yet my mom and my grandmom liked that fact that at parochial schools, when you got out at three o'clock, you walked along the line at the end of the day and they enjoyed the discipline.  They thought that was something that they felt comfortable with me and my brothers going to those schools because they were working and they felt that at three o'clock when you got out that you'd be safe.  So that's how I wound up in parochial schools.  But when I got ready to go to high school I chose to go to a parochial high school and I took a job just to show my parents that I can, willing to help to pay my tuition.  That's, I really felt that was an affinity for me to go to a parochial school.  I went to [Providence] St. Mel High School, which is an all-male high school at the time.  I watched that school change over the years.  I think when I started there, it was probably 30% black; four years later, it was probably 80% black.  So my teen years were transition years on the west side of Chicago were communities were going from old Jewish, old Polish to black and now, black and Hispanic.  So I came, as I tell people, I saw the good times; I saw the bad times and today, I'm proud to say, I see the good times coming back.  It's a good history and one that I try to share with my kids and let them know what it used to be like and what it was like growing up.
Story_ID: 14510
Speaker 1: Certainly I remember the riots and when they took place.  I guess I'll chronologically try to move along with this.  During my high school years when I worked at the drug store, I also got a job working at what is now know as the Better Boys Foundation.  At that time, it was called, Archie Moore's Boys Club.  Warner Saunders, who's the news anchor for one of the local TV stations here, was the Executive Director at Better Boys Foundation.  When I went to what was called Archie Moore's Boys Club at that time, I went there because I wanted to learn how to fight.  I was a kid growing up who didn't like fighting.  Although my dad [Joe Turner] would turn me around when I come in the house running from somebody and say, okay you're going back out and you're going to do what you're supposed to do.  So I decided I'd go to Archie Moore's to learn how to fight.  It was a boxing club at that time.  They put gloves on me and said step in the ring.  This guy hit me and he hit me in the jaw and I walked out of the ring.  I then walked upstairs to the third floor and said, I like this Boys Club, but I think I want to be on the third floor where we tutor and we play ping-pong, and do things that I think I'll enjoy because boxing is not for me.  That's what I did.  Actually, I think it was a week later they hired me at Better Boys Foundation and I became a tutor counselor there.  So we were working with kids and eventually Warner asked me to sign up for a math contest.  So that was, I don't remember who was running the program.  It was a citywide program and I wound up doing very well and represented the agency.  We won some awards for my math skills.  In fact, math was probably my strongest skill and I can remember as a kid, my dad, we used to have these little wooden blocks.  So as we were going to through the ABC's and learning how to count one and one is two, I can remember, he would come home from work and he'd sit down with the blocks.  I had a younger brother that I'm a year and nine months older and he would be laughing as I made a mistake and dad sometimes would, he had his own way of punishing you if you got it wrong or--usually it was because you weren't paying attention.  The younger brother would laugh and he'd bring him over.  So what I found is that the younger brother actually was much smarter because he learned at an earlier age, the same things that I had to learn.  But it was a great experience.  I remember those moments well, but it was the strong math background I think.  I think there's something to be said about people who major in math too, because you're able to analyze a lot of situations in addition to the numbers.  But my dad really pushed math and felt that it was something that was going to be very important.  In fact, through the efforts of Better Boys Foundation I enrolled in a modern math course.  That was when they were teaching and I think even today, that one and one is 11.  Traditionally they go, one plus one is two, but one and one is 11.  We signed up for this math contest as I say, and did very well.  I then took that achievement on with me to [Providence] St. Mel High School.  In fact, we just recently finished a graduation of my son [Arthur Turner] who just finished high school, and there were neighbors, who were at the graduation because they had grandchildren there and they reminded me and my son about my eighth grade graduation and my high school graduation because in eighth grade, I think I received three years of perfect attendance and all kinds of other awards.  Then the same thing when I went on to high school, it was another four years of perfect attendance.  So I enjoyed going to school, even when we had the great snow storm back in the '60s [1960s], I was one of those kids who took off that morning going to school and literally walked to get to school.  By the time I got there, they had declared the city was major disaster and I walked back home.  But I was, I think everybody got credit for being in school that day, but that's how much I enjoyed going to school.  It was, school is a way, for me, it was a way of getting out of the house.  My parents were strong disciplinarians.  I was the guy that had to be in at eight, when most kids were still out to 9:30 or ten o'clock.  Homework had to be done; I had a chore or my brother had a chore where he did the dishes or mopping the floor.  So they watched us very closely and I think that that has a lot to do with the success in terms of, at least surviving, especially when you hear the statistics today about the number of young black males and what happens to growing up in the inner city.  I lucked out and I think that there were a couple reasons.  One, in addition to having both parents home and both parents who really were concerned about my future and growing, we also came from a strong religious background.  So that, in addition to, I went to parochial schools as I said earlier, I had to go to--I won't say had to, but that's kind of the way it was back then.  I also went to a Baptist Church.  Both my parents were Baptists and there was some discussion at the time.  I can remember crying to my parents to tell them that I wanted to be baptized Catholic.  Traditionally in the Baptist Church, you're baptized at the age of ten.  I think that's what the consider an age of reasoning.  So by ten or 11 in most Baptist churches, that's when kids get baptized.  In the Catholic Church, they baptize you at five, if not, you get the early baptism when you're first born, but by first grade usually kids are brought into the Catholic Church and so I was in fifth grade when I became-- I was baptized--Catholic. And even then my parents weren't sure if they wanted me to become Catholic-and it was one of those--where I said I know this is what I want to do--But even upon being baptized I still had to go to Baptist church every Sunday--
Story_ID: 14511
Speaker 1: I was saying about the church and the fact that I was baptized Catholic and I would come home--in fact, I was an altar boy.  I was a choir boy.  I actually found that I was involved in a lot of activities and when I looked back on it, I think some of it was because it was my way out of the house.  So because my parents [Joe and Catherine Turner] were so strict and they had the help of my grandmother [Esalena Williams] there, when I had activities to go to, that meant I could leave.  Prior to that, I spent a lot of time sitting on the front porch.  I was one of those kids who couldn't play across the street.  So although we knew the neighbors, my parents felt, if you're going outside, you should be close.  You should be, if they open their window and yell out your name, you should be able to respond right away.  So I was fairly close.  So when I involved myself with church activities or after school activities that gave me a few hours to bust loose, be a little further away from home.  So I was an altar boy in grade school.  I sang in the choir and was pretty active in the Catholic Church.  As I say then, I would come home on Sundays after Mass and mom would say, well now we're going to church.  So then I would go to Sunday School and regular church service and then BTU [Baptist Training Union] on Sunday afternoon.  So my whole Sunday was pretty much consumed in hearing the Word and I have no regrets about that today.  In fact, being brought up in two churches I think, really helped me appreciate our community and understand who we are.  Even as we speak today, I still go to visit a number of different churches, different denominations I certainly understand, but I think the Christian upbringing and the reinforcement of it, really made a difference in terms of some of the things that I wanted to do.  Not that I was a perfect kid, but it certainly, I think, helped me in terms of developing morals and given me the kind of background that has helped me on the job I have today.
Speaker 2: What did your parents think of--I know they allowed it, for you to go to the Catholic Church, but they were like, because there's this whole thing between Baptists and Catholics.
Speaker 1: There was no real debate on it.  They weren't forced to go and traditionally, if you come from a non-Catholic family, they would want your parents to go to church once a month or so.  They did that when they had to, but short of that, there was no, they had no--they always told me, there was only one God.  So although the Catholic Church and probably the biggest difference my parents saw was that one parade to the Virgin Mary and the Baptist Church did not necessarily recognize the Virgin Mary.  So that was one of a couple things that we debated.  I think in the Catholic Church we also and our creeds say, that there's the one true church.  They would tell me, there's only one God and as long as we're praying to God that--so then they really never forced any particular denomination--I won't say forced because I did go to the Baptist Church every Sunday, but as long as you went to church.  What it did is it probably cut my basketball career short and my baseball career short because they also were thinking that you didn't play ball on Sunday.  You didn't iron on Sunday and Sunday's the day that you praise the Lord and you relax.  So when I, as a young kid, wanted to say, well the school's having a basketball game on Sunday; well they go, you won't be able to make that basketball game because we've got services to go to today.  But it was encouraging.  In fact, my mom today reminds me and that's something that I share with families, that a child in church is very seldom in jail.  When you look at some of the issues of juvenile delinquency and some of the things that we're going through, you'll find that kids are going to church.  There's generations, the baby boomers are not practicing religion, regardless of what faith that we did as children.  I can remember and I talk to older people who said, regardless of what church, when we were growing up, we even invited neighbor's kids to go to church with us.  So there would be, in addition to my family, we might have two or three of the other boys on the block who also went to the Baptist Church because my mother would go, hey look, you're invited and their mother, if they didn't go, would say, well you're going.  So even though Sundays, because a lot of time my mother worked on Sundays or my dad would work on Sundays, we still went to church on Sundays.  So it was the kind of thing that I already went to Mass and now you're telling me I'm going to church and some Sundays, they couldn't go with me, but you still knew that that was part of the program, that you were going back to church and you were going to be there.

Speaker 1: So tell me, as you were the oldest of two boys--
Speaker 2: No four boys.
Speaker 1: --oh okay.
Speaker 2: The way it works, I have an older sister by my father's [Joe Turner] first marriage and she was born in '44 [1944].  She came to live with us when she was ten.  Her mother died, so she came to live with us when she was ten.  I was born in '50 [1950] and then I had a brother that was born in 1952.  He passed, as I mentioned, two months before my father did.  Then ten years later, I had a baby brother and 20 years later, I had a baby brother.  So there's the--in fact, I think that also, some of my childhood, in terms of age ten to have a little baby brother, sort of curtailed some of my running here and there because I also helped babysit that little guy.  So if I decided I wanted to play ball in the alley or go to the local telephone pole, I had to take my two year old or my three year old brother with me.  That was part of the deal, so you didn't go very far.  So in my teenage years, I had a younger brother.  In fact, I can remember going out on dates and my younger brother was my excuse to get the family car, because I'd say, well we're going to the movies and I'm taking Joe [Turner] with me.  So okay, you can have the car tonight.  So it was a great experience.  Then 20 years later, you come home from college and there's another little baby boy.  Actually mom [Catherine Turner] and I think dad, I think were looking for the little girl.  I think after the last time they gave up on the girl and just said, well mom, you're only going to have boys.  So she was blessed with four boys and I'd say that age difference says that the family continued on and on.  So it's a very close family.  We currently live probably within a block of each other.  I live actually a block from where I grew up.  My district office is a half a block from where I grew up.  The brother that I'm ten years older lives a quarter of a block from where we grew up.  He actually can look at his front door and see my back door and his garage opens up at my mom's garage.  The baby brother that I'm 20 years older lives in a building that the younger brother owns, which is about a block and a half away.  So we have our own little kibbutz in my area.  I have an aunt now that lives in the two flat building that I grew up in.  She lives on the first floor, my mother's sister and I have another aunt, another one of my mother's sisters lives directly across the street from me.  So we're a very close family.  But it was encouraging, also interesting in my teen years because I mentioned, our home was the underground railroad.  So all of my uncles and I have an uncle that I'm actually a year older.  I have an aunt that I'm--I have an uncle one year older than me and I have an aunt that I'm three years older.  So there's a generation of aunts and uncles and cousins that moved to Chicago and their first stop was our home.  It was not unusual for them to live with us for one two, as long as three years.  I can remember my cousins, when they first came to Chicago, one of them, I'm a day older than she is and her sister, my younger brother was two days older.  So we all lived in this three bedroom house and they stayed with us for about two and a half years.  So I can always remember never having my own bedroom, sleeping three deep in a bed, and probably on the back porch or having--or on the hideaway couch, but that was a way of bringing other members to the city.  After they got their jobs, in many cases it was at Spiegel's or Sears, because those were the employers that time, Western Electric, they eventually settled and they have their own places and started their own families.  But our family, our home was the underground railroad for what I would refer to as the Briggs family.  So we grew real close in terms of knowing each other.  It's almost like brothers and sisters.  So you always had somebody watching over you or somebody that knew where you were or what you were doing.
Story_ID: 14513
Speaker 1: Now what was the young Art Turner--what were your sort of dreams and aspirations?  Everyone has--
Speaker 2: When I look back on it now, I sort of laugh because I probably wanted to do everything I saw.  When I saw the firemen, I wanted to be a fireman.  When I met the policeman, I wanted to be a policeman.  When you visited the doctor, you wanted to be a doctor.  So for a long time, doctors were always viewed as the money.  They were the people who have made it.  So for, at one point in my life I wanted to be a medical doctor.  I was, as I say, very well in math and science areas, so for a long period of time that became the focus.  But prior to that, you name the profession, the guy had a uniform, I think uniforms sort of impressed me as a kid.  I remember growing up and I used to love to hear or see a guy in a Marines uniform and the song 'From the Halls of Montezuma' was one of our favorite songs.  So at some point, not permanent military was a piece, but I thought that that would be something I wanted to do, but ultimately I thought I wanted to go into the medical arena.  When I left high school, I received a scholarship from [United States Military Academy at] West Point.  Well, West Point Leadership Award.  Actually I applied to go to the [United States] Naval Academy and I had a cousin that moved to Chicago from East St. Louis who applied for the [United States] Air Force Academy.  We were from the same Congressional District.  This Congressional District at that time was probably 80% white.  Our congressman was a guy named Roman [Conrad Pucinski], if I'm not mistaken.  We got to be First Alternates.  We weren't the principal candidates, but we both were set on going to the military academy and thought--we were both first generation college grads in our family, so that's another thing that in terms of where we were on the economic strata, I'm actually and my cousin were first ones to graduate from college.  So we did not get the opportunity to go to the academy.  So he eventually went to U of I [University of Illinois] and graduated from there, from the Law School and now is a very prominent attorney in Los Angeles.  I went on to a little school in Indiana my first year and that's a whole 'nother experience too.  But after my first year in college, I tried to then apply to go to West Point Academy, but this is the same time the Vietnam War was going on.  Although I knew of the war, I really wasn't following it very closely, but I thought that I still wanted to do West Point.  As I was taking the exam at Fort Sheridan, they had me go to a week long physical.  I had a friend that was killed in Vietnam, one of my best friends.  When he came home in a body bag, I pretty much gave up West Point and the military and sort of refocused as to where I was headed.  In fact, I even changed a profession.  I went from wanting to be an MD to probably just running my own business.  Not that there was an correlation between his death and my profession, but it made some changes in terms of where I was headed.
Speaker 1: Tell me why it made changes.
Speaker 2: I think there were a couple factors.  One, the university that I went to was a small, it was, actually I was at St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana and that's where the Bears, at that time, trained.  I had got accepted at Southern Illinois University and back then, that was the place to go.  My parish priest said, why are you going to Southern?  You should consider another school.  Well I had visited Rensselaer during the summer.  I was with a group called Young Christian Students.  Actually we changed our name back then to the Black Christian Students.  So we had went to this retreat to this college campus.  I never visited a college before, but I was sort of impressed.  I lived in the dorm for two weeks and with nobody else on the campus, it had seemed like it was heaven.  So they offered me a scholarship and I said, hey I'll go there.  But it was a one red light town.  There were ten black students on the campus, seven men, three women.  It wasn't what I expected a college to be.  In fact, I had seen spring breaks with Elvis Presley and I always thought college--and I heard of Kappa Carnival and I thought it was supposed to be a lot of fun.  When I got off in Indiana, it was a rude awakening.  As I say, the war was going on, Kent State was going on, so there were a lot of things happening at that time.  At that point, I was majoring in math.  I changed my major.  I decided after that first year there, I got involved with some demonstrations.  We wanted to change the name of the auditorium to Malcolm X, not realizing that the guy who it was named after, I think founded the little town and probably was a major contributor to the university.  The older you get, the more you understand people's motivation, but to me, at that time, naming this building after Malcolm was very important.  But I also realized, I started seeing people die from the demonstrations.  The march on Selma was going on and I really started to take a look at what the commitment level in terms of change and what sort of changes were real.  It didn't take long to realize that naming the building was not that important and that my real goal here was to get a degree and move on and see what we could do from there.  Having spent a year of boycotting and demonstrating, I thought that to be right on track, I changed the major, I could still get out in four years.  So I won't do doctor, I'll do whatever.  Business administration was ultimately the degree that I picked up.
Story_ID: 14514
Speaker 1: But I also transferred from that university [St. Joseph's College] after the first year.  We had a demonstration earlier in the spring.  I should say, late in the spring where the, it was ten students there, I think it was five of us got together and decided to take over the President's office.  The university at that time, had a gun club and we had a young man who was a blue eyed soul brother that grew up in Lawndale who helped us develop a little device that looked like dynamite.  So we decided at that time that we were going to blow up the university, although our dynamite was not real.  I want to make certain that's clear for the record that I was not involved with any explosives.  But it became a very heated exchange because people thought we had explosives and our concern was that there was a gun club on campus and there were people who had rifles and I decided to leave.  In fact, I left the university before the semester was over.  I asked that the President of the university have all my finals sent to my high school and let the high school principal monitor those exams.  They agreed to do so, only because I was there on a scholarship and the people that provided the scholarship for me were fairly influential.  When we spoke of what was happening on the campus, this one gentleman told that President that he should let me come home and because I told him that I didn't feel safe there.  That's when I really realized that taking on causes should have a commitment that you're willing to die for.  If it's not something that you're willing to die for, then you ought to leave it alone.  At that point, I said, leaving this university or naming the building was not something that I was ready to die from and that it was time to leave.  It was all but one professor who mailed the exams to Chicago.  One said, I had to come back to the campus to do it and I at that time, swore I'd never step foot in the state of Indiana again in life.  I came home that summer trying to enroll in another college and I went from an all-white institution to try to get into a traditional black college.  Because this one professor would not give me the exam, I had an incomplete.  So it was hard transferring with an incomplete.  I met a friend of mine at a picnic who was at a state university and this is when affirmative action and recruiting was going very big and they said, well why don't you come down to this school.  This was Illinois State [University].  At that time, they had about 350 black students.  But coming from a school of ten, 350 sounded like a like.  All the black colleges were writing me back saying, we can't accept you because you have an incomplete on your grade.  So time was running out and a friend of mine at Illinois State said, well we've got a program that we can help get you in.  I received a letter two days later saying that I had been accepted and I hadn't even filled out the application.  I went on and my first year there, I became a tutor counselor.  I was very involved in helping other students.  Eventually I became a Resident Assistant, an RA in the dorm and I was also a Food Service Manager.  So I had actually three jobs in college. What I realized was that the ripple effect was going on.  The demonstrations at the second college was just starting up.  By that time, I knew better and so I didn't participate in the demonstrations.  The local law enforcement in these years went from the small billy clubs to the billy club that was like waist length.  They went to going with face shields.  We were lowering the flags, but again, I realized that that was not what I was committed to.  I said I'm here to get a degree and I just stayed focused and managed to live through it.  But it was a pretty strange time, but I pick and choose my fights and I said, I know which ones I want to fight for.
Speaker 2: Then when you finished school, did you take some time off?  You graduated--
Speaker 1: No, when I left for--actually I stayed at Illinois State until January of '73 [1973] and I had considered--actually I'd taken some grad courses that fall and I decided after that it was time to come home and get busy.
Story_ID: 14515
Speaker 1: My first job out of college is with the US Treasury Department.  I was to be a bank examiner.  When I came home, I met, well my campaign manager who was my little league baseball coach suggested that, why don't you apply for a job with the States Attorney's Office?  We had, at that time, elected a new States Attorney.  Bernard Carey was elected a States Attorney and he had just defeated [Edward V.] Hanrahan who was the guy that was the States Attorney that was involved when Mark Clark and Fred Hampton was killed with the Black Panthers.  In fact, just a little history prior to that at my college, St. Joe's [St. Joseph's College], we invited Fred and Mark to speak at the campus.  So they did speak at St. Joe's, along with Friar George Clements.  So this was just as the Panther movement was starting up.  We had them come down and speak at the university at that time.  So Hanrahan was defeated, Carey won and because I had a degree in Business Administration, Carey was looking for investigators to serve in the Consumer Fraud Unit and deal with business crimes.  So my background fit right in with what he was looking for.  I applied for the position and I got hired.  The job, also at that time, paid $4,000 more than the bank examiner and the young man that helped me with the job, achieve the job as a bank examiner, my first assignment with the States Attorney was at a bank where he was working.  So the day that I showed up at this bank, he thought I was there as a federal government employee and he just discovered that morning that I didn't take the job and here I am with the same assignment working for the States Attorney's office.  I worked there for eight years, starting out in consumer fraud, dealing with white collar crime.  I then dealt with official misconduct and then over the years it got into gambling, prostitution, narcotics.  It was, as we moved more and more into what I call police work, that I decided it was time to look for a new profession.  But when I left college, I came right in and I got the job. I can remember coming home and bringing my stuff home from school and I was ready to move into the basement and my dad [Joe Turner] told me that maybe you ought to get your own place.  I go, well look, I got this job.  The job pays well.  I'll help remodel the basement and fix it up.  He said, just pay rent, you don't have to remodel the basement and I laugh now because the basement has since been remodeled.  My mom [Catherine Turner] holds block club meetings.  I understand, again, that that was dad's way of saying, you need to get out on your own and hold your own.  I appreciated in retrospect, but early on, I was thinking, well I could save some money by living in this basement, but the irony of that story was, I moved about two blocks from home.  I moved in an apartment that a cousin of mine, his mother-in-law owned the building and she rented me this apartment.  Two bedroom apartment for $75 a month.  So I had this $75 a month apartment.  I lived two blocks from my parents, I could eat with mom every evening.  I had my own place and this was at a time when most of my friends who graduated from college were living on Lake Shore Drive and paying probably four or $500 a month and another $50 a month to park their car.  I had 24-hour security and $75 a month.  I lived there for I think five years.  And then after that period if time, I purchased two pieces of property.  I was able to save up a lot of money and I did a lot of traveling while I was there because I had this built-in security and it worked out real well.  When I moved out of the apartment that I was in, my brother, younger brother, moved into that very apartment, he and his wife.  I purchased a building in South Shore, a three flat building and I purchased a six flat building in North Lawndale from a local minister.  That's when I decided that I thought real estate was going to be the way for me.  In fact, I still own those buildings, 25 years--well not both, but I still am involved in real estate.  But real estate became my way of relaxing.  As a bachelor back in those days, that was how I spent my weekends.  I actually became a pretty good carpenter and electrician as a result of rehabbing those old buildings.
Story_ID: 14516
Speaker 1: Now you said, now how did you get involved in politics?
Speaker 2: Very--my--
Speaker 1: Because you said that after you had done the States Attorney's Office that you had had it after a while and decided--
Speaker 2: Right, actually I got involved in politics because I was tired of the States Attorney's Office and I wanted a different job.
Speaker 1: Why did you think it would be politics?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  My campaign manager was my little league baseball coach.  At that time, Jesse Madison, who was the State Representative from the 21st Legislative District was retiring.  He had served three terms.  Now my campaign manager was Jesse's campaign manager.  He used to ask me, I worked my little precinct for Jesse, so that basically was about two blocks or three blocks in my community.  So for the couple elections that Jesse ran, I would go around and ask the neighbors to support Jesse and tell him he was a good guy.  But in college, I only majored in one political science course.  I didn't major in political science, I only had one political science course.  It was Polysci 101, I think there were about 450 people in that class and I remember passing it.  So that was the extent of politics.  This was never an ambition.  In fact, my parents [Joe and Catherine Turner], when I decided that I wanted to run for office, were very much afraid and did not want me to run, told me that politics was a very bad business and that in fact, they kill people.  This was based upon the history and I know that somewhere somebody has spoke of it.  We had an alderman that was killed in our community, Alderman Ben Lewis.  Ben Lewis was found dead.  He was an alderman from the City of Chicago.  He was found dead in his office and to this day, they still have not found out who murdered him.  One of the things that Ben fought very hard for in our community was, he was against public housing, so that's why you'll notice in North Lawndale there's not an influx of a lot of public housing units.  He also was fighting against the red lining in the insurance industry.  Back then, homes were being sold on contract and through the Contract Buyers League, they were also selling the insurances with these mortgages.  So Ben was fighting the insurance companies, as well as public housing and I don't know what else.  To make a long story short, he wasn't a guy that was necessarily going along and then was murdered.  I think there was a whiskey bottle on the desk and the guy didn't drink and the stories go on and on.  But that was the first thing my parents reminded me of when I decided I wanted to get into politics.  They went, why are you getting into that?  They kill people.  In fact, I was taking a $10,000 pay cut, so for the life of them, they didn't understand why or what did you see in politics.  And yet, my days in law enforcement taught me that the only people that we were arresting were people that looked like me or people of color.  The irony of that was, as we were arresting people, they were out on bond and back on the street before I could even do my reports.  So I looked at this cycle and what was going on and said, something's wrong here.  As I mentioned earlier, I started out in white collar crime and now I'm doing gambling and prostitution and narcotics and I decided that that's not for me.  So my campaign manager said, well Jesse's retiring.  There's a Citizen's Search Committee that's getting together to find someone to take Jesse's place.  Would you be interested in running'  I said, what does the state rep do?  He said, well you know, he works in Springfield and on and on.  I go, well, but what do I have to do?  He said, well you'll need about $2,000 to help get the campaign off, just to get it off the ground.  Well I had $2,000, but I wasn't certain if I wanted to but it into politics.  He said, that'll be it and then we'll help you.  The people will help you.  Well this Citizen's Search Committee was, at that time, the district took in North Lawndale, Austin, East Garfield, and Oak Park.  So this is when we had multi-member districts.  That's when you had three state reps from each district.  Jesse again was elected as an Independent state rep, an Independent Democrat.  So there was a Citizen's Search Committee of the community.  It was about 60 people that made up this Citizen's Search Committee.  I had been coached a little and I can admit it now by my campaign manager.  I knew what the issues were at that time and so we had our little discussions, but during this Citizen Search Committee when they, in their interview process, there was seven people that submitted their names.  They selected me over the other seven to run.  So I had the support of these 60 people, in terms of trying to take Jesse's place.  The first time I ran, I lost by 800 votes.  It was less than one vote per precinct.  Prior to that, in addition to working in the States Attorney's Office, I used to work in my youth parish--or I should say, work in my parish with youth.  So we had a little youth group where we were doing the summer programs, NYC jobs and I realized that politics was a way of me making the greatest change.  With our kids, 100 kids, we may say 25 or 30; but I looked at politics and through my work in the States Attorney's Office as having the greatest impact and this is where you could help hundreds of thousands of kids.  So it was with the States Attorney's Office, realizing what politics could do and the impact that it had on our community that I decided to run.  As I said, the first time we were defeated.  I ran two years later and we were successful in winning.  The 800 votes was one vote per precinct was encouraging enough to keep going at it.  So we just knocked on a few more doors, sold a few more chicken dinners and we were able to win the second time around.
Speaker 1: So it was historic, you said, because you were the youngest.
Story_ID: 14517
Speaker 1: At that time, the independent movement was just starting to grow.  He was very popular in Springfield.  I think the state rep was not a popular position in terms of the community's knowledge, but in Springfield Jesse [Madison] held his own.  When I took Jesse's place there, that was the one thing that I could feel proud about was people say, if you're half the guy that Jesse is, if you can live up to his history, you'll be just fine.
Speaker 2: Can I ask, did you win over him or--
Speaker 1: No, he resigned.
Speaker 2: He's resigned.  Why did he resign?
Speaker 1: After three terms.
Speaker 2: You have, okay.
Speaker 1: No, no, he just decided after three terms he had enough.  I think he also was getting ready to redraw the lines.  Jesse had teenage daughters and at the time, it was a decision as to do you stay here in your district, or do you move to a different neighborhood.  So I think there was some family considerations.
Story_ID: 14518
Speaker 1: So here you are, you've gotten elected.  You're probably feeling full of your oats in many ways.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You arrived down there, you're king of the mountain.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And tell me, what that was like.  What did you find there?
Speaker 2: Well I was king until you walked up to the door and the doorman say, who are you?  Here's this kid comes up and they go, well you can't go in there.  I go, but I'm Representative Turner and so it was different.  Then you walked into an assembly, they had 177 members.  That was in the days when there was a lot of activity going on.  There was a lot of activity going on, but it was a very interesting time.  (Interruption) What was it like those first days.
Speaker 1: Right and you said you came up--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, well you said, what it was dealing with all those 177.
Speaker 2: Right, there were 177 people in the House at that time and so you--that was when we had, what we called multi-member districts and you had like two people from the major party from each district and then there would be one person from the minority party.  If it was Democratic district, it would have two Democrats, one Republican.  In the city, you had two Democrats and that third person who could be a Republican, maybe a third Democrat.  So they were like the independent Democrats at that time.  But it's a very busy place at that time.  Compared to where we are today, I think it was much more citizens involved and the relationship among the legislators was one when you really work to understand the process and to get a bill passed that was not as controlled as it is today, but it was a very unique time.  It was also a year when reapportionment was taking place.  That was something that was not clear in my mind, but it was the issue, probably the most important issue during my first term.  It was a very unique term because at that time, we also elected our first Hispanic representative, Juan Soliz was elected then and Representative Monica Faith Stewart, who held the distinction--has the distinction I think, of being the youngest black female ever elected.  We all came in together during those years.  So reapportionment was the issue of the year at that time and during that first term was a term that I voted with the Republicans on a reapportionment matter, which was very unique and one where I caught a lot of flack from the party in terms of not kowtowing to the party line.  But I came from an independent Democratic background and never been supported by the regular Democratic organization and when I asked the Democratic leadership during my first term, what about this map and how will it be drawn, they told me don't worry, we'll take care of you.  These are the same people I've been fighting for the last three years.  I go, okay, you'll take care of me.  George Ryan, now Governor Ryan who was the Speaker of the House at that time, said well, if you want to help us draw a map, I'll let you draw the city of Chicago.  He said me, it was a group, little coalition that we had put together.  We could draw the city of Chicago, he'd draw the rest of the state.  Well my first term, one of the things that I learned right away was that it was no longer an issue of Democrats versus Republicans.  Even today, I still believe that it's the have versus the have-nots.  So having served that first term and watched Democrats vote against issues that I thought were important to our community, I realized that the representative need to be more reflective of the district that he represented.  So I pushed for drawing a map, that I thought at that time, would increase the number of minorities that currently served in the state government.  I think we had 14 members at that time.  The new map would have increased minority numbers by another four people.  So we would have had two Hispanics and an additional three blacks.  It did not allow for the Democrats to control the state, but it increased minority representation.  My concern was minority representation.  The map eventually went to a draw of the hat.  We did, we were successful in passing this Republican map, House map out of the House and to tell you about my naivete to the political process, I didn't realize that a bill had to pass our both chambers and then go to the Governor.  So I thought if you get it out of the House it's going to become law.  The bill went to a Democratic controlled Senate and there it died.  So when you cannot reach agreement between the two chambers on reapportionment map, ultimately it went to a draw of the hat.  The Democrats won.  I then had it--there was no district drawn for me.  I chose to run in a north and west part of the district, which included the suburbs of Oak Park and Austin and not run in the community that I was born and raised in.
Story_ID: 14519
Speaker 1: I was defeated that time by a precinct captain that the organization put together, three to one, after the first term and I really felt that I was doing, providing the kind of representation that our community should have, but politically the community had no idea what was going on.  I was defeated and then I came home after the first term.  During that interim I worked in the [Harold] Washington Campaign.  In fact, on paper I was listed as the West Side Coordinator.  Everybody takes credit for Mayor Washington's campaign, so I just consider myself one of a few, but on paper I had a pretty influential title and I was responsible for moving stuff around and making certain that that structure was there.  My alderman and state rep at that time, was a guy, actually he was a state rep, he resigned from the legislature to become an alderman because the alderman didn't come, an alderman at that time, died.  This was former Alderman Walter Shumpert.  Shumpert had previously served in the Illinois legislature and Bill Henry who ultimately became the alderman took Shumpert's place in Springfield.  So Henry supported Jane Byrne in the Washington election.  I was supporting Harold.  Henry knew it.  Harold was on a landslide and there was, a train was running and nobody could stop it.  Harold won and so Henry decided at that point to tell Harold he was going to fill the vacancy with Art Turner.  So three months after I was out of the Assembly, I got appointed to come back to the Assembly and I've been successful ever since.  So I'm three months shy of a full 20 years, but I got appointed as a result of the Washington campaign.  In fact, keep in mind, Harold left the Senate when I came to the legislature.  He had, when I came to the House, he went to the Senate and then as a result of the congressional race, he moved on to Washington.  So he was probably the mentor, I were to use someone between Harold and Jesse [Madison], former representative [Eugene] Gene Barnes, these were the guys that I knew and tried to use as a mentor or predecessor that I wanted to be like.

Speaker 1: Let me just, I need quick answers, but what did you admire about Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: Well I, in terms of his political history prior to me getting to the legislature, I'd be the first to admit, I was not aware of those, what was going on.  What I admired about him, I think was his oratorical skills, his deep voice, he was a big guy.  He had put on a few pounds in the legislature, but he knew my campaign manager and they had a real good relationship.  Our relationship built over the years, just in terms of, I could communicate with them.  Here's a guy who's a state rep talking to a US rep now and ultimately a candidate for mayor.  But I think that our openness, I can--I'm certain everybody has their own stories, but I can remember the informal sessions where we were sitting in a room and there were libations as we talked about politics and most of which was politics I had no knowledge of.  I didn't know the players.  You talk about the Charlie Gaines, the Bill Shaws, the Shaw brothers [William and Robert Shaw], so these were all names to me and I enjoyed it.  I guess, when I look at this family relationship and visiting aunts and hearing the history, I think that's the attitude I took when I went to the legislature.  So I didn't go in, although as a campaigner, I told people we were going to knock the walls down and we're going to turn around.  As a politician when I went there, I sat and I listened and just tried to get to them to learn who the individuals were and develop my own interpretations as to their viability and how credible they were.

Speaker 1: We're doing this whole thing and we're looking for things in terms of African Americans in the state legislature.  Really in terms of what their legacy is or what importance they had.  I was wondering if you have any comments about that.
Speaker 2: Well I remember hearing about the infamous role call, I think, where Cecil Partee was elected to the Senate, as a result of 26 ballots that was taken in the general assembly at that time, to try to elect a President of the Senate.  I can remember stories about Harold [Washington] and [Eugene] Barnes and these guys when they stood up and former Representative Cornell Davis and the speeches and the fights that they had in the legislature.  So there were a lot of things that were going on that really was not publicized in the Chicago news versus the [Chicago] Tribune or [Chicago] Sun-Times that as I said, in terms of [Black] Caucus meetings and in talking with others that you got a chance to learn and appreciate who the individuals were.  In fact, my first term there, when I went to the legislature, you choose seats based on seniority.  The irony of going to the legislature my first term was, I wound up sitting on the last row in the House of Representatives.  That row had, I think there may have been one white person on that row.  It was all black.  Here it is 1980 and I'm going, I'm in the House of Representatives and all the blacks are sitting on the last row, or in the back row.  In fact, that row picked up a name.  It's called Catfish Row.  It was--people were talking about Catfish Row and it was just, that was it, but by the same token I described myself and Monica [Faith Stewart] and some of the younger people that came on board was a new breed of catfish and that we were raised on catfish farms and we were well fed and understood the process.  But it really, it sort of hurt me, and yet it became, as I look back on my political history now, probably one of the most rewarding experiences because I sat with what, at that time guys that we called the Machine politicians.  I sat next to former Representative Taylor Pouncey.  I sat next to former Representative [Douglas] Doug Huff, Langdon [W.] Patrick.  These were all guys who were part of the Machine and I got a chance to understand how they were--I tell people they were those who were anointed, there were those who were appointed, and then there were those who got it the old fashioned way and they got out and knocked on doors.  But I got a chance to appreciate what they were doing and how they viewed their job and how they felt they were still helping our community.  Although we differ sometimes in our approach, the long and the short was, they still tried to help their constituents, it's just that in some cases, in providing that help, they put cuffs on their hands.  So it is trying to figure out that balance.  Even today, it's still a challenge of how do you help and still hold your independence and be free in a system where although you feel your majority say in your city or in your community, it still took 60 votes.  At that time, it took more than 60 votes to make it happen.  So at one time it was, at that time it was 118 members necessary in order to pass a bill.  So it was, there was a real challenge and an experience and I can remembers guys saying, well Art, I can't do or I can't have the independence that you do and I appreciate you, but I have to dance with the person that's brought me to the dance.  So this is my role and we're going to differ and hopefully there's no long term hard feelings about it.  But this guy brought me to the dance and this is the tune that we're singing today.

Speaker 1: Now what, what of your 20 or--you've been there almost 20 years, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What are you most proud of or what do you want to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I don't, in a 20 year period, I don't believe I've lost my credibility.  One of the first things they tell you is, that your word is all you have.  So I tend to really research the issues and know that what side, take a position, that you can go to the bank with it.  I think that that's something that is the feeling of the, first of all, the constituency that I represent and that there is no deal to be made, that this is the position.  I think, one of the things that people will always remember me for is that I was credible and I didn't really look at issues from a partisan standpoint.  Although even today, as I served as Deputy Democratic Leader in the house, I still look at the issues and see what impact they have on us as a, first of all as my community, secondly as people in the entire state and what is the economic impact that it's going to have and how will it benefit our community.  Besides the credibility piece, I think the thing that I'm noted for is the affordable housing trust fund.  So there are those who call me the godfather of the housing bill.  Even there, I share that title with some of my predecessors and people who served before me.  I know that Senator [Earlene] Collins was involved in trying to deal with affordable housing.  So affordable housing wasn't something that just came along, but it looked out then at that time that I was were, we were able to create a pool of money, about 17 million dollars a year now to help create housing for both low and moderately low income houses.

Speaker 1: I don't think the west side has been given its proper due in terms of independent politics.  For so long we wore the banner of being the plantation and yet, plantation politics did in fact, and it existed throughout the entire city, but there was, the first people to break from the plantation came from the west side.  So that break started with the Jesse Madisons, and the Earlene Collins and actually it started before then.  It started with the Otis Collins.  Otis served in the Illinois General House of Representatives.  Otis was the guy who took on the real estate industry in terms of redlining with the insurance.  So those were the people who really sort of set the tone and then it sort of spread throughout the rest of the city.  But it has not been given its just due in that regard, but it's, for those of us involved politically who understand, but again, I tried not to get into south side, west side, because I think that's one of the things that has hurt us and has kept us divided here in this city, in terms of there's some difference between the politics and those of us who believe that if you live on the south side you have old garbage cans; if you're on the west side, you don't have garbage cans.  The long and short is, is that we were all minorities and many of the people who live on the south side were people who started out on the west side.  It was after they got that city job or the county job and if they moved on to other parts of the city.  But I think, as a people that politicians, be they south or west side, that they were able to do a number of things and accomplish a number of changes that again, happen at the state level that we really don't see at the citywide level.  I think the first human rights bill came through as a result of the black legislators pushing this.  This is Cornell Davis and Harold [Washington] and those guys back in their early tenure in the general assembly.  It's the kind of thing that you don't really hear at the city level.  In fact, state governments often refer to as the invisible government.  I think that's one of the travesties of what had happened in the past and can appreciate what we're doing here today, in terms of sharing that history of state government because I think it played a very important role in terms of where we are today and with many of the accomplishments.  Although there were a lot of things going on at the national level, state governments had to operate on their own and they came along as a result of some of the push that was happening on the national level.  But even as you look today, you still have states that want to fly confederate flags over their capitols and do some of the things at the federal level we have said, should be changed, i.e. Martin Luther King's birthday.  Well we still have states and cities that are still debating if they want to recognize those holidays.  But here in Illinois, I think that we can be proud of what my predecessors and those who served before me in the general assembly has done.  And in fact, as I say, a lot of things are not even spoken of.  Cornell reminded me of the days when they first came to Springfield, they didn't live in the hotels.  They lived, it was actually the local minority minister; in this case, the black minister in town who knew someone that could provide housing for these guys and they were elected officials and could not live in a local hotel.  It's just hard to envision that, that this was government and that these were people who were serving in government and yet there were restaurants and hotels that they could not eat in or go in.  But understanding that history and having talked with those individuals, having had a chance to either serve with them or meet with them over the years has really made me appreciate what I do and understand the importance of it.  And yet, I notice so many things that today's budget being 45 billion dollars and when you look at maybe a million dollars being spent in your district, you say, hey, I still have a lot to do.  We've got a long way to go.  But when you think about where we've come from, the very fact that we can at least sit in the room.  The fact that I'm sitting there with the budgeteers; that when we start talking about social service issues, that we can at least have some change.  That makes a big difference and I think people also respect the educational level of the members in the assembly today.  I think that that's--again, the job we have although we serve it as individuals, I think the community has become much more informed.  So it's really a team effort, I think, that people understand that, both from the public and private sector.
Story_ID: 14524
Speaker 1: Now what do you, just some sort questions, what do you want to be your legacy?  You haven't stopped serving yet, so who knows, you may have another 20 years?
Speaker 2: My mother [Catherine Turner] says I should stop (laughter), but no, I really don't know.  In all honesty, as I said, when I took this job, it was just to, it was a change in professions for me and I still view this as a job.  I try not to let the title really go to my head and yet there are others that tell me about the great things that I do and can do.  I see, it is important that we have people operating at the legislative level because so many things that need to be done at the community level and I think that that's where the emphasis has to, where our focus as to go is actually delivering those services.  So there's a piece of me that says, because I'm a guy that likes doing the hands on, you need to now go back to the neighborhood, take the money from a trust fund and rebuild your community.  It's one thing to have the money out there, but we need somebody.  I think you probably heard it over the years is that, you've to have somebody to shake the tree, shake the apples and then we need people to make the applesauce.  Well I think, I'm slowly moving to a point where I believe I need to really get more involved in the applesauce making process, because we just don't do things like we used to do.  When I think back on the old family and how you made applesauce years ago, now the stuff is pasteurized.  It don't even taste the same.  It's just a different flavor.  So I feel like it's time, I won't say time now, but there's time when I think, maybe you've done your part at the electing level, you need to now take that experience and come home.  Yet I realize that in politics, seniority's important, so to leave now is probably the right time and that that history that you know and that the relationship that you develop can be pretty important, but yet, politics does take its toll on your family.  Although I'm the politician, my wife, my kids [Arthur and Aaron Turner], and relatives, they all have to wear this title and our community has yet to really, I think, appreciate the role of the politician and what he does.  So it's tough because when I tell people I'm a politician, first thing I notice is they reach for their pockets.  It's like, oh I hate all of you.  Then after 20 minutes with them, they kind of go, you're different.  I don't quite, where'd you come from?  It's like, this job is not for you and yet I realize, it takes 20 minutes to get someone to realize that I'm actually working hard and working for their behalf and saying, I can also put a tool pouch on and build a one room apartment in that 20 minutes time and that's something that they can see.  But I'm not certain where.  It's the kind of business you would say well yeah, one day I'd like to be governor or one day I'd like to be president.  I found that politics is just about timing.  And if the timing is right and you're at the right place, having watched what Harold [Washington] went through, he never thought he wanted to be mayor.  In fact, when we first started talking, he said, if you registered 100,000 people, I'll try it.  But it wasn't like that was--and yet, I just kind of tell myself, whatever the Lord has for me to do or whatever the next position is and if the timing is right, we'll go for it.  But right now, I enjoy the state rep position.  I enjoy state government and yet, I know the challenge of talking about running statewide.  The more, the larger your constituency, the harder it is to focus in on any one particular community.  I represent a district now that's 95% black.  It's easy to know what I'm going to do and where I stand.  I don't have to stand up on the house floor and say, I'm an African American.  I think all the members know what my position is and what my first interest is.  If we talk about representing us statewide, then your interest becomes more diluted, so it's hard then speaking for one particular community, but speaking, you have to speak a more diverse tongue.  That's why I say that politics really, as I've learned, is not about what race of people as it is the have versus the have-nots.  Fortunately, I have a lot more friends that have, have-not and that's the group that I've really tried to work to see how I can bring more dollars and more resources available to them.  Even further than that, just trying to bring back a trust in each other, develop a relationship where people appreciate and respect each other a lot more, because I think that's the thing now everybody wants to know is, what can you give me or what do you have for me or what are you going to give me or what do I owe you.  I think that if we can get away from that mindset and look about what we can do to help the children and help our future, that's the role that I've seen politics and my role as a politician.  If I leave here tomorrow and folks say, well he helped that little league; or he helped the little football team; or the kids in high school, made more monies available for them to go on to college.  I think I've done my part.
Story_ID: 14525
Speaker 1: Just one question, I need a short answer.  What message do you think is important for us to communicate out there about the blacks, the Illinois state blacks?
Speaker 2: Well, I think this would be true in pretty much any subject area or any field.  That is, that education is probably the most important thing that we have going for us.  Education includes history, both past history and the history that is to be made.  If there's anything that in government, that I think we really need to focus on and we've sort of lost a little bit, lost some headway is, in terms of dealing with our schools.  Because as people are more informed, and better educated, then the rest is just going to happen naturally.  But it's taking charge of our schools and making certain that our kids have the basics, the reading, writing, and arithmetic.  In fact, I laugh when I look at some of the famous black historians many of them went to the one room school house.  It's hard to believe that we taught people in one room, when today we've got to have a magnet school over here and a charter school over there and this specialized school and we're missing the boat with all of these separate places, when years ago, when Grandma Briggs and others were coming along.  They went to school in one room.  So I think that education is probably the most important thing.  As we educate ourselves to just general knowledge, the political piece will come in.  From a political standpoint, it's educating the public where they know that the politician works for them.  So although it's Art Turner who's the rep from the ninth district, actually I'm just holding the seat and doing what the people tell me to do.
