Story_ID: 261734
Speaker 1: We have a few what we call warm-up questions, People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Which will also give people who look at this [The] HistoryMakers interview a certain dimension of your personality.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so I'd like to ask you, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Olives.
Speaker 1: Olives?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Me too.
Speaker 2: I eat hundreds of them a day, it seems.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you a little story about my olive eating later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: The fall.  It's a bit sad.  I'm always sad in the fall for some reason, but I do love the fall.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: It used to be orange, which was my mom's [Merle Laviscount Jones] favorite color, but I'm leaning toward green, greens, all the greens.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not yet.  I haven't found one yet, but I did spend quite a bit of time in Greece.  I do love Greece, very much, but I haven't seen enough yet to be able to completely answer that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sounds like you want to go, sounds like you want to go back.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, very soon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Lastly, do you have a favorite phrase or saying that you use from time to time, a spot of your philosophy of life, that you like to share with others?
Speaker 2: I hope I can say it on video, but live your life like your ass is on fire (laughter).  Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: That's a good one.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 261735
Speaker 1: How would you describe or title or characterize your profession, your work, your career.  What are you?  What do you do?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's a really good question, 'cause I only thought, when I first started in this business, that I was a dancer, and as it turns out, I've, I've danced and choreographed and staged, done make-up, costumes, produced, directed, decorated hotels--just, you know, it's just gone on and on and on, and I hope that I still have a few more things left that I haven't done yet.  But, it's really hard to say because people are always saying to me, "You're so good at this, you should--" but I keep saying that it's basically show business, it's just--like when I decorated that sixteen room hotel up here on the Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts], just for a friend.  It was nothing but a theater set, a movie set for me.  And it was quite easy.  Directing is easy for a lot of choreographers, because it's basically moving people around at the right time.  It's timing.  So there are a lot of choreographers who become directors, and very good ones.  So, I just kind of slid into it, and the more work I did, the more plays I did, I just got better at it, and I have still have lots to learn, but I--the directing, I just fell into it.  The producing, my mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] told me, and my grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount] and everyone when I was a kid, I had all the--the kids used to run from me in the neighborhood because, "Here she comes, she's gonna want us to do a show."  So it was always producing stuff with the kids and shows for my family and shows for the church [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts], so that's just where all that comes from.
Story_ID: 261736
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to ask you to start now by telling us about your mother.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Would you give us her name, when she was born and where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Merle Laviscount [Jones].  She was born, I believe, in 1925, in Detroit, Michigan, I believe.  Yeah, it's been a long time, and my mom got to Boston [Massachusetts] via my grandfather who, you know, he brought the whole family to Boston, but basically that's who she is--was.
Speaker 1: How long did she live in Detroit before she came to Boston?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  No, my grandfather was there and started a church [Plymouth United Church of Christ, Detroit, Michigan] in Detroit as you probably know, and that was a bit of time there, and then came to Boston, from, but he originally came from Antigua, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't know.  I'm not sure how many years, 'cause my mom was off running in college and everything and, you know, at the college age, so I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: What did she share with you about her childhood and growing up years in Boston?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother has a lot of stories.  You know my mom was Reverend [Samuel] Laviscount's daughter, you know which makes her--she was pretty famous basically.  All the kids were famous, you know, my grandfather's church was famous, as you know, and she was, you know--it's funny, because I left home when I was sixteen, and I didn't come back basically, except to come in and out, but I was gone for a lot of years, so I missed a lot of information, which is troubling, now that my mother has passed on, that, you know, I have to get information from a lot of other people about those earlier days, but basically she was Reverend Laviscount's daughter in Boston, so there was a lot--
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your maternal grandfather--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the Reverend Laviscount.  Would you give us his full name, and tell us a little bit about the reverend?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's Reverend Samuel L. Laviscount.  He was born in Antigua, and--
Speaker 1: You know the year he was born?
Speaker 2: Oh, I do know, nineteen--
Speaker 1: Approximately.
Speaker 2: --eighteen, oh dear, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], I have it written down too as well.  I should have remembered that, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's all right.  We can come back to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do, I do have it written down.  You know, I'm getting old.  My memory is just sliding away every day.  Anyway, he was Antiguan, went to the universities there, spent years in Antigua, and then his family moved to Detroit and he decided to, I think he got his degrees basically at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], which my mom went to, and that's how we got to Washington [D.C.].  That's how I was born in Washington.  But, and then, started from scratch, as he did with St. Mark's [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts] in Boston, a church that just grew into a huge membership and was there for quite a few years; met his wife [Leafy Giles Laviscount] there, and then moved to Boston.
Speaker 1: This was in Washington?
Speaker 2: That was in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Oh, in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went from Howard University to Detroit, and then went into the ministry there, and from that point came to Boston.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about that church or that congregation, or the name of it or anything?
Speaker 2: I do, and that's written down on that--I don't know it offhand, but I do know that I have the information for you, for sure.
Speaker 1: How long were they in Detroit, then, roughly?
Speaker 2: I would say, guessing--I would have to guess, because I don't know, you know.  Unfortunately, my dear cousin Lynn [ph.] was a wiz at all of this.  She had every little bit of information. There's families that have all the information, every little detail and then, but I was out in the world, doing my thing, basically.  I don't know how many years he was there, yeah.
Speaker 1: We'll come back to your mother, then I want to come back to your grandfather, Reverend Laviscount.
Story_ID: 261737
Speaker 1: Your mother grew up in what neighborhood in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: In Roxbury?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, how do you remember your mother?  What do you remember about her, as a person?
Speaker 2: Absolutely amazing, and people to this day will--and she was my, clearly my grandfather's [Reverend Samuel Laviscount] child.  Just everybody knew her, just fiery and hair blowing in the wind, and just brilliant, very, very smart, you know, my mom went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  She was an accountant, a notary public, everything.  Just, just, you know, he had three daughters.  Three really fiery, beautiful daughters that were--some of them were wild and crazy, but smart, very, very smart.
Speaker 1: And their names?
Speaker 2: Vera [Laviscount Renteria] and Wendolyn [Laviscount Love], and my mom was Merle [Laviscount Jones], and he also had--my grandfather had a son, [Samuel] Leroy [Laviscount, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Leroy?  Good, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but she was just great, up until the moment my mom passed away, I mean, everybody here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts], you know, was--she was one of those that would meet everybody at the boat and take people to the boat and go off-island with this van and bring materials back and food back, wine back for everyone, because we were doing that even then.  We had a sense of the cost of things up here were pretty high and, you know, needless to say, they were ahead of their time, but she was just an amazingly giving person.  Six children, there were six of us, and we all, in my opinion, we all were treated extremely fairly.  She helped me with my career, my brother [Max Jones] to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island], my sister with a home, my other brother with his business, just anything, you know, she was really something.  Anyone who knows my mom, she was really, really something.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: In Detroit?  And the year, do you recall?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five [1925], 1925, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about her mother, about your maternal grandmother [Leafy Giles Laviscount].
Speaker 2: My grandmother was--her family was from Detroit, but she was originally born in Bermuda.  And my grandfather met her in Detroit, and they fell in love and eventually moved back to Boston.  And, it's interesting enough, you know, there are some people in your family that you remember when you were younger, but you don't remember all the information about 'em--
Story_ID: 261738
Speaker 1: When I got to Boston [Massachusetts] from Washington [D.C.], we were living on Rutland Street in Boston, and my [maternal] grandmother [Leafy Giles Laviscount]--she was a grandmother.  She was, you know, the cook; she was just always there in the house.  She just never seemed to leave the house, from what I could remember.  She was just there in the kitchen: baking, cooking, baking, cooking, baking, cooking; it was--I don't have a lot of recollection of my grandmother other than in that kitchen.  Isn't that interesting?  Cooking, yeah, I know, it's--we used to make ice cream, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What do you remember about growing up in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts]?  What are your earliest memories growing up in Roxbury?
Speaker 1: Huge community; so much fun; so many people supporting.  I was just about born at the time, but you know Malcom X would come to our house, [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan was at our house, because of my grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount].  There were just so many people, and because of the church, we just had so much support, and there was so much.  My grandfather had built this wonderful recreational center behind the church, so I was putting on shows there, and we had parties and, you know, events, and--wow, it was just really, really something.  I go back to Roxbury now, and it's just, well, it's heartbreaking, because the memories of that, of that, just a huge--but I think this is with all of us in our younger life, I would hope, that people would have that wonderful opportunity of that sense of community, just so many people helping you, and, you know, it was just a real community.  That whole area, as you probably know, of Roxbury, was unbelievably beautiful, you know.  We just moved from one street to another, and we stayed in the community.  [Roxbury] Memorial High School [Boston, Massachusetts] was there, you now, it was just--the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], my grandfather's church, there was just, but I think this is what life is for a lot of people when you're young.  I hope so.
Speaker 2: The name of the church in Boston that your grandfather pastored for many, many years?
Speaker 1: St. Mark's Congregational Church [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts], Townsend [Street]-Humboldt [Avenue], yeah.
Speaker 2: I recall when I first came to Boston, to go to college that we used to go to St. Mark's to play basketball--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: --because attached to the church was St. Mark's Social Center [St. Mark Social Center, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Yes, this is what my grandfather built, yeah.
Speaker 2: Tell us about your grandfather building this social center.  What do you remember about that history?
Speaker 1: Well he just knew that we, we needed a place, you know, and this, this to me it's not unusual, it happens in a lot of communities.  He just was a go-getter and he said, "We're gonna do this." The space was there, behind the church, and it turned into a place for everyone, for yourself for basketball, for me to put on shows, for parties, for classes, for--
Speaker 2: So you had a stage?  I remember that.  In fact, I remember the stage.  I remember jumping off of it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember the stage too.  Yes, I remember, oh my God.
Speaker 2: Because it was so high, I remember.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Wow, you just--deja--you just took me back, that stage was really high.  I can remember now, and visually seeing, being on that stage and looking out into the gym and the backstage area and then the area where you went off to the right where we could get into the church, and it's just--we just had a ball in that place, an absolute ball, and it was his vision: "We're gonna do this for the kids," you know.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 261739
Speaker 1: Your mother [Merle Laviscount Jones] was a multi-talented person, college-educated.  What thing, what were the things she was doing in Boston [Massachusetts], besides mothering?  What was she-- was she working as an accountant?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh absolutely.  My mom, she literally was the backbone of a company called the Maine Post & Beam.  She worked for a gentlemen, Bill Eustis [ph.], for many, many, many years and just did all kinds of things in the business, but she was a businesswoman, interesting enough, you know.  The show business part for me came from my dad [Ruble Blakey], but my mom was a businesswoman and that spilled off into my brothers, who are business, you know, very business-orientated, and yeah, she was business; really smart.  All of my grandfather's [Reverend Samuel Laviscount] daughters were really smart, and they were all in business.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the others, just briefly.
Speaker 2: My Aunt Vera [Laviscount Renteria], was one or two or three in every family, but she was like, you know, your favorite aunt, wild and crazy, but a B.A., a master's degree in this--she was just really, really smart, but she was the wild and feisty one, you know, she was like my biggest supporter, would come to all my shows and, when we'd have parties, I would look out and there was my Aunt Vera doing cartwheels, you know, on the dance floor, with her, you know, skirt all up in the air, and she was one of those.  And then my other, my Aunt Wendolyn [Laviscount Love] was a business-orientated.  She was, she was also, boy, you know, an accountant, my mother and her sisters were really good with numbers, really good with numbers, so Wendolyn was an accountant as well.  So all the girls, basically, other than taking care of their families, because Vera was the only one that had one child, but everybody else had several.  So they were really mostly moms, but, and good ones, good moms.  A lot of kids, lot of kids, yeah.
Story_ID: 261740
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.  Give me your father's name, when he was born and where he was born.
Speaker 2: Okay, my father's name is Ruble, R-U-B-L-E, Blakey, B-L-A-K-E-Y, middle name Maxwell.  My father was born in 1904, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and his father was black, his mother was full-blooded Cherokee [Native American], smoked a pipe--that's how we know (laughter), and my dad, basically, I think that he grew up mostly until he was in his early teens in Bowling Green, and then went off to New York [New York], to the big city, to be in show business.  And he did various and sundry jobs in New York.  In fact, he told me he lasted all of one day being a bus boy.  He put in his time card and wrote on it, "Thanks, but no thanks," and from that point on, he just slid into show business.  He was a stand-up comedian at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] for many years and then emceed, did a whole lot of clubs doing emceeing, and then started singing and eventually got a job with Lionel Hampton.
Speaker 1: How old was he when he went to New York, do you know?  He was born in 1904, so he would have been how old do you think roughly?
Speaker 2: I think he was about seventeen or so when he went to New York.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's about 1921 then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, at the beginning of the Harlem Renaissance and the arts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The whole thing.  The whole thing.  He was just smack in the middle of it and knew every single person and just--then just started doing his movies.  He started doing a lot of black films.
Speaker 1: Do you know what drew him to the arts and to performance and comedy?  What were the influences?
Speaker 2: I think it was just who he was, as with me.  There was nothing in particular.  My mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] said just when I was four or five years old, I was always getting everybody to, "Let's do a dance.  Let's create a show."  It was the same with my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back to, let's stay with your dad now.  Tell me more about his career and his life and how you remember him.
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough, I did not meet my father until I was twelve years old.  My father was very suave and very beautiful with two hundred suits in the closet and was a singer in the band, and all the girls, and one of the girls was my mom, and he was beautiful and that.  I somehow came.  Here I was, which happened a lot in those days.  My dad was, you know, he was--people like Dinah Washington and all of those folks were in my father's life.  He was just a very handsome band singer, and basically, he sang with Lionel for many years with the band, and then just one day decided that he was going to go to Paris [France], where everybody was going at that time.  Either going or there.  Dexter Gordon, [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones, they were all there already.  So my dad decided he was going to go over for six months to see what was going on in Paris, and he went and stayed for eighteen years.  He never came back.  What he did in Paris was, because he knew everybody, Dexter and Quincy and everyone, he spent years and years and years over there booking musicians 'cause he knew them all from New York.  He'd left the band, Joe Williams replaced my dad, and then my dad just went off to Europe, and when I went to Europe at twelve years old to meet my father, went to Paris, and wow, what a time.  I just remember hanging out in these smoky clubs with Dexter Gordon and Quincy and I could go on and on, Sidney Bechet, I mean, the list is a mile long, and these were all his friends, and they were all--it was that really wonderful time in Paris, as well.
Story_ID: 261741
Speaker 1: So, he [Blakey's father, Ruble Blakey] stayed there for many years.
Speaker 2: So you went there at twelve years of age?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  The first time I met my dad.
Speaker 2: So that was about 1961, '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Who'd you go with?
Speaker 1: I went with my Uncle [Samuel] Leroy [Laviscount, Jr.], who was going off to Germany to meet his soon to be wife.
Speaker 2: This was your mother's [Merle Laviscount Jones] brother?
Speaker 1: My mother's brother, yes.  He took me, my first plane ride, and he stayed in Paris [France] with us for a day, and then he went on to Germany and left me there with my dad.  So I spent the summer in [Quartier] Pigalle [Paris, France], which is where my father lived in a hotel.
Speaker 2: Could you spell that for me?
Speaker 1: P-I-G-A-L-L-E.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which is--which was the section of Paris where they made the movie 'Irma La Douce,' and where all the girls were and the nightclubs and the Moulin Rouge [Paris, France].  I could see the Moulin Rouge from my dad's apartment.  He lived in a hotel, which a lot of musicians did in those days, and I remember looking out all the time and seeing the, you know, the windmill, and--what a time it was there.  I spent many, many days--in fact, one day my father thought that I had been lost, because I was away so long talking to all the prostitutes in Pigalle asking 'em, "Where'd you get those shoes?"  And so I was on my way to show business then, and, "Boy, I loved that sequined--" and I just became friends with all the girls when I was able to talk to them, and so we just spent--I spent that whole summer totally entrenched in the jazz life in Paris.  So needless to say I think it had a little effect on me as a person.
Speaker 2: So you were there for the summer?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Were there other--I want to come back to that summer, but were there other occasions when you and your father were together after that time?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.  In first meeting him, for the very first time, at twelve years old in Paris, we both fell in love with each other instantly.  I just never--I don't know whether I had, whether it was I had enough sense to or not to, but I never carried any stuff with me about why my mother and father were not together.  My mom never spoke ill of him.  It was always a curiosity about this man, this singer, and he flipped when he found out years later that I was in show business and that I worked for all the same people that he knew, which will come a little bit later, but he was really shocked.  Happily, but just surprised, but not surprised, but I just went completely open, and I've been that way my whole life with my father, until he passed.  Just never carried any of that, "Why?"  And I got lucky, because he was an amazing human being, so I spent a lot of time with my dad after that.  He lived in California after he came back from France, then went back to France and lived in a little town called Le Cannet [France] down where Josephine Baker lived.  He knew all these people, and then ended up coming back again because it was too expensive to stay there.  You couldn't quite make it there on your social security.  And he really couldn't do it now, but then it was, for a few years, he really managed.  And then I brought my dad here for the last few years of his life.  Here to the Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] to stay with me, yeah.
Story_ID: 261742
Speaker 1: Blakey [Blakey's father, Ruble Blakey], did he share with you any memories and facts about his growing up and his parentage, your paternal grandparents, did he--?
Speaker 2: No, it's interesting; he just had a saying that was so interesting, and I wasn't, I guess I just wasn't--I didn't ask enough questions, you know, and I'm really, I regret that, that I didn't ask enough questions.  I was taking things as they came into my life.  But he'd just always make a comment when people would go, I mean, the whole world was upset that someone would die, and he would say to me, "Well, Charlie Blakey died."  I'm like, "Who's--?"  He says, "My father."  He said, "Yeah, Charlie Blakey died, what's," you know, "what's the big deal?"  But I mean the fact that my grandmother was full-blooded Cherokee [Native American] and my dad--I didn't have a lot of information about my father's parents.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the origin of the Blakey name?  That never came up?  Um-hm.  You said he spent a couple of years here with you.
Speaker 2: Yes, just about a year, little less than a year.
Speaker 1: Before he passed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did he do during that last year on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, he came here not feeling very well.  He was living with my older sister [Myrtis Blakey (ph.)], through a previous marriage, with my dad in Harlem [New York, New York], and he was not able to get out a lot, and he just wasn't doing well there, so I decided that, as we all think, this is utopia here, and my dad's going to be much better in Martha's Vineyard.  So I brought him here.  We listened to music, we, I, you know, he came to see a few of the shows that I did.  I put him out on the deck, and he smoked his pipe, which he smoked his whole life.  I just wanted him to be well, to feel better and, but my dad always wanted to go back to Europe.  My father's dream was to go back to France.  For a while he wanted to open up a couscous restaurant here in the [United] States because it's, you know, so big there, and now it's really big here.  There's still some people that aren't really sure what couscous is, but--
Speaker 1: Well, tell us so we'll--everybody's--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a grain; it's Mediterranean, and it's like rice, I mean, I would have to think that most people in the world know what it is, but it's pretty great.
Speaker 1: I fix it for myself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I fix it a lot.  I fix it, it's easy, but my dad had dreams of having a couscous restaurant because there's a million different kinds of couscous.  That's what he really wanted to do, but his biggest thing was to get back to Europe and spend his last years back in France, because like so many musicians, they just had an amazing life over there, whether it was an escape or not, I don't know, but it's recorded in history about how many musicians and singers, you know, a la [Josephine] Baker, [Ada] "Bricktop" [Smith], I mean, everyone; their lives in Europe were good.  For all intents and purposes, they were good, and I have to say that my years spent in Europe, when I was dancing with a dance company, that we were almost what would be termed here, really high-class go-go girls because we would just go to army bases, and we'd do these dances, and they were all choreographed routines, but when we would get there our names would be up in lights and flowers in our dressing room and people treating us like we were, you know, these big, big stars, and this is how Europe has been, and still is in my opinion, about--they really have a huge appreciation for who we are and what we do.  So I did get him back to Paris [France], but I took him back, I took his ashes back and, when he died, and--
Speaker 1: And that was what year, do you?
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994], '94 [1994], and I took his ashes back and put some of them up in [Quartier] Pigalle [Paris, France] and spread some of them in the Seine River and up in Montmartre [Paris, France] and just took him back.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 261743
Speaker 1: Would you reminisce a little further about your father's [Ruble Blakey] work in the entertainment business, and his contacts, and the people that he worked with and knew and vice versa?
Speaker 2: Well, from the time in New York [New York] singing with the band, after that, doing some films, you know, some of the black films, like I said, he, like so many musicians, "I'm going to Europe."  I say it every day now.  "I'm out of here, I'm going to Europe," so my dad went, you now, and when he saw the scene there, that was it.  Like I said, he went with the intent to stay for six months and came back eighteen years later.  But what he did, because he knew all of the musicians out of New York, is he started booking them in Paris [France], and Belgium and Copenhagen [Denmark] and Amsterdam [the Netherlands].  He lived in Amsterdam for a while, which I spent time with him there, and that's where I started dancing, 'cause he introduced me to the people there that were in show business.  But he would book folks, everybody from Freddie Hubbard to, just everybody, just a list of folks, and that's what he did in Paris for many, many years, as well, and I believe at the time that [HistoryMaker] Quincy [Jones] was spending a lot of time in, in Copenhagen, so there was a lot of booking back and forth, and Sidney Bechet, he really became really good friends with Sidney and, you know.  So they all, it was a huge, it was just an amazing time that I wish I lived in.  I wish I was there, because it will never be like that ever again, and all of that time has been documented a million times over, so I certainly don't need to say it, I am just am happy that my father was a part of it, and I got to see a little bit of it at twelve, and then some of it when I went back years later.  But, I mean just everybody, everyone from Miles [Davis] to everyone was in my father's life because that's, that was the life that, you know, so he was, he was a booking agent, basically, yeah.

Speaker 1: Let's go back to your grandfather, your mother's [Merle Laviscount Jones] father.  What else do you want to say about the Reverend Samuel Laviscount?
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: How do you remember him as a person, his personality?
Speaker 2: Well, interesting enough, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], and this will lead into that, there were some people that were brought to my house a couple of summers ago, friends of friends, and my grandfather's picture was on the wall, and they turned around and asked who it was, 'cause I had this beautiful, big photograph of him on the wall, and they asked who it was.  I said, "That's my grandfather, and he was from, he's Antiguan."  And they looked at me and they said, "Oh, that's why you walk the way you do."  I said, "What do you mean?"  They said, "Have you ever been to Antigua?"  I said, "No, I've been wanting to go my whole life," and I'm planning on it, because I still have family there that we don't know, but she said, "Well, when you get to Antigua, you're gonna know what I'm talking about.  Everybody walks around like a king and a queen."  And I thought I walked that way basically from dancing because when I first got into the business we--the producer of the show would put us on stage for about two hours a day walking in high heels, so we would learn how to be show girls and dancers and walk with dignity.  This is how my grandfather was all the time, and you probably remember that.  He just, every time he walked into a room, there was this magnitude, this power, this king-like persona, and she said that's how the Antiguans are.  They're very proud people.
Speaker 1: I have a distinct visual memory of your grandfather walking up and down Newtonville Avenue in Newton [Massachusetts], all right, when he was living with--
Speaker 2: Wendolyn [Laviscount Love], his daughter.
Speaker 1: --your aunt.
Speaker 2: Yes, my Aunt Wendolyn.
Speaker 1: I remember driving my car and seeing this very tall man, very erect, very erect, right, walking down Newtonville, and as I got closer, I said, "Why, that's Reverend Laviscount.  What's he doing way out here in Newton?"  You know, a suburb of Boston [Massachusetts].  And I remember him walking very erect to his last day--
Speaker 2: To his last day.
Speaker 1: --up and down Newtonville, tall and straight, and I remember that, so I saw it.  I saw everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it kind of threw me for a loop when she said that.  And I said what do you mean, but that's what she was talking about.  And that's the person that he was: powerful and strong and generous and kind, and I loved hearing him speak in church because he was--his voice was so powerful, but he wasn't, you know, a screaming, yelling preacher.  He was just strong, and he also talked about everyday stuff.  You know he was way ahead of his time in regards to that, I believe, you know.  Yes, he quoted the Bible, and he made the correlation and everything, but he also talked about you, as a man, taking care of your children and you, as a woman, doing the meals, a person, and da boom, da boom, da boom.  You just walked out of there feeling so, yeah, I can do it.  This is how I grew up with, with that.  I was very close to my grandfather.  I think the closest out of all of us; I was the closest to my grandfather, and then I ended up, in his later years, when he became pastor of a church in Brockton [Massachusetts], I would go with him every Sunday just to spend time with him.  We were very much alike in a lot ways.  We both hated drafts, and we'd drive in the car with a blanket over us.
Speaker 1: When did he go to Brockton?  After St. Mark [Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after St. Mark's, yeah.
Speaker 1: St. Mark, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: So, he was a powerful, powerful human being, really powerful, influenced many, many people, Malcolm X, [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan.  I went to hear Louis speak several years ago, and I asked to meet him, you know, years later, 'cause I don't remember him as a child, and they escorted me in, with all these beautiful men around me, I got escorted in and sat at the table with him.  We talked about my grandfather, and he just, you know, spoke about him like everyone did: this brilliant, wonderful, supportive human being.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the relationship of Malcolm X to your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Well, it was all church.  It was--basically, the only knowledge that I have is that my grandfather, with his church, was a mentor to so many people, including Malcolm X and Farrakhan, and that's how all of that happened, was that Malcolm just--he just quoted my grandfather, he loved him, he, you know, my grandfather was just, he just was really smart about the world, and about life, and he was a mentor, basically to everyone (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Malcolm was living right around the corner from St. Mark's.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right around the corner, absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 261745
Speaker 1: Your brothers and sisters--would you give us their names and a little bit about them and where they are today?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, there were six, six of us in the family.  I have had two brothers that have passed on.  My two living brothers are Maxwell Jones and Alison Jones.  Their father is--was Maxwell Jones of the Jones Brothers, who were singers, very famous singers in Boston [Massachusetts].  My mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] really had a thing for the singers.  What can I say?  They had a trio, Max, Clyde [Jones] and Herbert [Jones] for many, many years; traveled everywhere.  Did [Las] Vegas [Nevada] and Miami [Florida] and, in fact, my brothers' godparents are Nat King Cole and Louis Armstrong, so they were, it was, you know, show business once again.  They are, they have a construction company.  My brother Max graduated from Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] with a degree in architect, and so they're smart, really, really smart, and they have a great company.  They do a lot of great building.  My sister was a school teacher for many, many years in Boston, which is now, I think she was at, oh jeez, what's the new school there now?  Wow, I'm going to have to get some ginkgo biloba for my memory bank here.  But anyway my sister was a school teacher.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Deidre, I'm sorry, Deidre, it was Deidre Darden, and she's Deidre Ware, but Deidre Darden Ware [ph.].  And I have an older sister who lives in New York [New York].  Myrtis Blakey [ph.].  She's the only other Blakey, and she's just, basically, she was a barmaid at the Shalimar [Diner, Queens, New York, New York] and all those wonderful bars in New York City [New York, New York], and, you know, that's basically what my sister did for many years.  Myrtis, yeah.
Story_ID: 261746
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early schooling, the beginning of your formal education.  What was the first school that you, you attended and when and where, as you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, as I remember it was the William Lloyd Garrison [School, Boston, Massachusetts] which was right there on Hutchings Street, between Hutchings and Brookledge [Street].
Speaker 1: In?
Speaker 2: In Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: In Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I do not, I think, I don't remember what school I was in--I was in Washington [D.C.] until I was about seven, then brought to Boston, so I don't remember much about Washington, I know that we lived in the projects in [Washington] D.C., and I remember, all I remember about D.C. was the weather, the heat, and my mom [Merle Laviscount Jones], in those days my mom used to grab us, and we'd sleep on the Potomac [River] overnight, with blankets.  I'll never forget that as long as I live, just sleeping out on this river in the middle of Washington, D.C., because it was so hot in our apartment.  So my first recollection is the William Lloyd Garrison in Roxbury, yeah.  Then I went to the Jeremiah [E.] Burke [High School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: What was elementary school like?  How do you remember those years?  Do you remember any of your teachers or close friends in school?  Anything especially influential during those elementary years?
Speaker 2: I'm sure that there were a few teachers in elementary school.  It was right in the neighborhood where we lived.  I just remember having a really good time when I was a kid.  I have, you know, a little, little more recollection of my teachers when I got in high school, but, no it was just a good time.  I walked to school.  You know, it was right in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: What was that neighborhood like around your home and around the school?  What was the neigh, how do you remember the neighborhood?  Who lived there?
Speaker 2: Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], like--unbelievable.  We, unbelievable, Hutchings Street, Homestead [Street], Elm Hill Avenue where [HistoryMaker] Elma Lewis was.  Elma Lewis was there.  Her school [Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts] was there.  The houses, big beautiful homes, with mahogany and wood everywhere and backyards and, I mean, just everybody, all of, many of the islanders lived in that area, you know, Cecile Gordon, Doris Pope [Jackson], the Jacksons, the Tuckers, everybody.  We were all in that neighborhood.  It was absolutely magnificent.
Speaker 1: Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke].
Speaker 2: Ed Brook.  Well, Ed Brook, you know, that was another real close friend of my dad's, you know.  My grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount], sorry.  Unbelievable community, really unbelievable.  I mean, many names I can't even, I can't even, you know, recall at this moment, but just amazing.
Speaker 1: Were any of those neighbors, either that you just mentioned or didn't mention, who were friends of your parents--that were especially influential in your growing up?  Any neighborhood people?  Any families that were particularly influential during your early childhood years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, only on my mother's side because my father [Ruble Blakey] was not in Boston, of course, but, yeah, the Tuckers, the O'Banions, the--oh God, there were so many.  Oh, there were so many.
Speaker 1: What ways did these families support you in your--
Speaker 2: Well, it all went back to the church [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts], basically.  You know, it all went back to the church, and the community center [St. Mark Social Center, Boston, Massachusetts] and just, I've had support in this show business thing for as far back as I can remember.  I am so blessed like that.  It's amazing, and my mom in particular, no matter what I wanted to do, she said, "Yeah, okay."  I was just that one of her kids that wanted to do this, you know.  My brother wanted to go to college, and my sister wanted to be a school teacher and there was never any, "Ahh, you can't, show business stuff," no.
Story_ID: 261747
Speaker 1: The late [HistoryMaker] Miss Elma Lewis of Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] of your growing up years and your neighborhood in Boston [Massachusetts], is a HistoryMaker.  She was interviewed before she passed.  Tell us about your memories of Miss Elma Lewis as a child.  Do you remember what she was doing when you were (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  You want my biggest memory?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You're going to love this.  I am, like all of us, my parents, my mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] sent me to Elma Lewis for dance classes, and I think I was there all of two classes and when she hit me with a switch, I went home, and I said, "I don't think so, mom."  I loved Elma Lewis 'til the day she passed.  I, we supported her, her school [Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts].  I did shows with her.  I sent people to her.  There was just something at a really young age about that switch that didn't quite get--hit it for me, and this is not nothing new.  We all know about the switch.  "Get that leg up!"  I said, "This is not how I want to do it," so I ended up going over to Stanley Brown who was another really famous dance teacher in Boston.  But, wow, she was magnificent, magnificent and clearly, you know, was a real history maker in terms of that whole scene in Boston, but we--interesting enough, in later years, we were, for lack of a better term, we were sort of rivals, because I opened up my own dance school, had my own dance company [Marla Blakey Dancers], did many of the same things that her company would do, but yet I was still [HistoryMaker] Marla [Blakey], Reverend [Samuel] Laviscount's granddaughter, and she was still Elma Lewis, and we were who we were, yeah.
Story_ID: 261748
Speaker 1: You had said a few minutes ago that you went from the William Lloyd Garrison Elementary School [William Lloyd Garrison School, Boston, Massachusetts] to?
Speaker 2: Jeremiah [E.] Burke High School [Boston, Massachusetts] in Grove Hall [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Tell us about those high school years.
Speaker 2: Well, I got to tell you Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], the most I remember about high school was putting on shows in the gym to avoid classes, me and Donna Summer. We laugh about this to this day.  I have worked for Donna.  I've done, choreographed a lot of her shows over the years.  I traveled with her a little bit.  And I mean we were in that gym singing and dancing trying to get out of class, but as I look back now in retrospect, we weren't trying to get out of class, we were just doing what we do, so there was always a show.  We were always in the gym putting on a show.  Even at that early age, I was doing exercise classes for so-called physical ed [physical education] that really wasn't physical ed in those days, so I just have to believe that this is just something, as heard as it's been, off and on through life, this has just what I was meant to do, because we literally danced and sang our way through high school.  I remember some great teachers, but it was always, "There's [HistoryMaker] Marla [Blakey] and Donna," you know, "they're in the gym putting on shows."
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers at the school that you remember that gave you special support for your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a Mr. Daly who Donna always speaks about as well.  I think--
Speaker 1: Mr. Daly?
Speaker 2: Mr. Daly.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: D-A-L-Y.  I think Donna herself went back to get an honorary diploma or something from school.  I'm not sure that Donna even finished, she just took off, and boy did she really take off, to say the least.  But, he was really, he was, he liked us a lot.  He said, "Those girls are going someplace."  So he was really supportive.  As we were, we were in the gym, you know.
Speaker 1: Now Jeremiah Burke High, you were there during what years?  This would have been early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was all girls.
Speaker 1: That's what I was trying to get to.  It was an all-girls school.
Speaker 2: An all-girl high school, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was what year were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there, let's see I graduated in '67 [1967] so I would imagine it was '64 [1964] or something, '64 [1964], '5 [1965], '6 [1966], '7 [1967].  I did the ninth through the twelfth. I did graduate.
Speaker 1: What was the racial ethnic make-up of the Burke School when you were there?
Speaker 2: Unbelievable, Bob.  I--my best friends were Chinese, Jewish, black.  We didn't, at the time there weren't many Hispanics, but huge, huge diversity in that school, growing up in high school.  It was amazing.  And we were all just sitting there hanging out doing our thing.  In fact, one, one of my friends who was Chinese, we ended her taking her with us to the next phase of my, when I left high school to go to Atlantic City [New Jersey] to work at the Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey], took her and put her in this all-black show, 'cause he said, "We need another dancer, we don't care what she is."  But that's how high school was for us in those days, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did your grandfather, the Reverend [Samuel Laviscount], think about your talent and spending all of your energies in the entertainment?  What did he say about all of that?
Speaker 2: They just thought I was a queen, that I was just, "That Marla, she's really got talent."  Every single person in my family.  My Aunt Vera [Laviscount Renteria] in particular--came to every show, I did, just huge support.  My mom [Merle Laviscount Jones], huge support.  We were putting up dancer's feet and dancers--my grandfather would let me put shows on in the church [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts] whenever I wanted to.  There was, all I can remember is nothing but support.  I don't think I ever heard, "You better go to college."  I probably should have, but I didn't hear it.   All I heard was, "If this is what you want to do, go for it."  My mom threw me in the station wagon when I got my first real job in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and drove me down there in the station wagon with my suitcases in the back, and threw me, literally, into show business--
Story_ID: 261749
Speaker 1: You graduated from [Jeremiah E.] Burke High School [Boston, Massachusetts] in what year?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], and how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was sixteen and a half.
Speaker 1: And so you graduated in June?
Speaker 2: June.  July, I was dancing on the stage at the Club Harlem in Atlantic City [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: How did you get from Boston [Massachusetts] to Atlantic City so quickly?
Speaker 2: Larry Steele, which many people will know.
Speaker 1: Larry Steele.  Would you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: S-T-E-E-L-E was a big black producer in those days.  He had a big show called 'Smart Affairs.'  A Sepia Revue, and he had shows in Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], Miami [Florida], everywhere.  He was really big, and it was a variety show of, you open the show with big--a line of girls, then you have an act, and the line of girls come back and do a middle number.  Then you have a comedian, then you have the headliner, and the headliner were everyone from Sammy Davis, Jr. to, wow, you name it, just everybody.  Big, big, big, stars.  And this was the show.  He came to Boston, because he knew Stanley Brown who I had started taking dance classes from--for a very short time, I might add.  Came looking for girls, and we auditioned.  I got the job, but I didn't get the job as a dancer.  I got the job as a showgirl, because I was too tall to be a dancer, and they needed tall girls for showgirls, which was very upsetting to me at the time, because showgirls just walked around in g-strings and pasties and feathers, and I wanted to dance, so I was just smart enough to just wait, and I got the dancing gig.
Speaker 1: So he found you as a student of Stanley Brown?
Speaker 2: As a student on Mass Avenue [Massachusetts Avenue] in Boston.
Speaker 1: Let's say a little bit about Stanley Brown because we're right at that time.  I remember when I first came to Boston, and for some reason I heard about Stanley Brown, and I remember he had a studio.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I wasn't into the dance or theater, but everybody seemed to know Stanley Brown.  Tell us who Stanley Brown was and when you first him and your working with him when he was your teacher.
Speaker 2: Well, he was my teacher.  My mom [Merle Laviscount Jones], I didn't know his background.  We just knew that this was the person to go to. If you weren't at Elma Lewis [School of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts], you were at Stanley Brown [Dance Studio, Boston, Massachusetts], basically, if you wanted a black teacher. And he was, he was--he taught jazz, but his biggest thing was tap.  So he, basically, and I just never, I could tap, but I really wanted to dance.  So he had other teachers there, and that's where I went to school.  I don't remember being there very, very long.  Maybe a year or two at best.  And that's when the producer came in looking for showgirls, but--
Speaker 1: Where did he have these classes?  Where were--
Speaker 2: It was a studio.  It was up over a restaurant or something on Mass Avenue, where he had all these windows where you could see out on to the street. I remember that so clearly.  And everybody went through there.  I mean--
Speaker 1: His name was emblazoned, wasn't it, on the window, as I remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and everyone went through there.  The Jimmy Slydes of the world.  Just everybody.  We were, you know he was, he was the man.  Yeah, he was definitely the man.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Slyde still living?
Speaker 2: Yes, he is.
Speaker 1: Is he?  He was a friend of mine some years back.  I interviewed his mother for an article I wrote for the Bay State Banner about her work.  And when I went to the house, it was down in the South Shore [Massachusetts], he was there.  She said this is my son.  I had never heard of him before, but I got to know him.  Great guy, great man.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Slyde, talk about a dancer.  I really got lucky later on in my life, which hopefully we'll get to.  We actually choreographed a couple of really big shows, and he was on the show.
Speaker 1: Was he?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That, that, there was a lot of history in Boston.  The Wallace Brothers.  Do you remember Scott [Wallace] and Norman [Wallace]?
Speaker 1: Know the names, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, amazing song and dance team.  We were all, we were all there with Stanley at one point.  Mae Arnette, the singer.  Everybody went through Stanley Brown in one form or another.  I just got lucky, I was right there in the middle of it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well he was a real legend.  He is a legend.
Speaker 2: Totally.
Speaker 1: Certainly remembered by a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 261750
Speaker 1: Atlantic City [New Jersey], let's--you're there.  Tell us about those opening weeks and months there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow, you know, I just, maybe from my grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount] I learned early on, just, "What you don't know, just keep your mouth shut and don't say anything," and I just was thrown into this situation.  I grew up so fast, where I was with major stars, big revues, Johnny Lynch, an eighteen piece band.  We were in a night club [Club Harlem, Atlantic City, New Jersey], literally, three shows a night.  We finished at four in the morning.  Sunday mornings, we had to do what we called a breakfast show, which anyone who knows that life, knows about it.  That's the big show at six a.m., where all the other entertainers in Atlantic City would be able to come and see your show.  They didn't used to clap in those days.  They had knockers.  They would hit the tables with these knockers.  I was literally--one of our first shows was with Sammy Davis, [Jr.].  He was the headliner.  We--he used to put us in these high heels, the producer Larry Steele.  He was very, very hard on us.  Because we were an all-black show we had to do everything better than anybody else--everything.  He would take money out of our paychecks if our--the seam in our fishnet stockings wasn't straight, if we didn't have red lipstick on, if our nails weren't painted, if our costumes weren't hung up.  Everything had to be precise and better than anyone else, and this is what we went through during that period.  This is what I walked right into at sixteen and a half years old.  Walking around the stage for two or three hours a day learning how to walk in high heels.  My first show as a showgirl, I had what we call pasties.  These little rhinestone things for your boobs and a little g-string and the feathers.  I said, "Oh my God, what am I doing?"  But I'm in show business.  This is what I wanted to do.  My mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] was, "No problem," and I stayed in that show ['Smart Affairs'] for many, many years.  We worked the Eden Roc [Miami Beach] Hotel in Miami [Florida].  We did Chicago [Illinois].  We went through New York [New York].  We traveled with the show.
Story_ID: 261751
Speaker 1: My most vivid experience with that show ['Smart Affairs'] was in 1969 in Las Vegas [Nevada].  I believe I was told that, just prior to that, maybe a year at best, Sammy Davis, [Jr.] wasn't even allowed to walk in the lobby.  We went into Vegas with an all-black show.  We were at the Flamingo Hotel [Las Vegas, Nevada].  Fats Domino was the headliner.  And Larry Steele had made a point of having all of us--which were mostly, they were all women of color--in white.  We were just in white rhinestones and white feathers and all the costumes were, we just had to be beyond perfect for the show in Vegas, our first.  And we were not told and whether Larry knew this to this day I'm not sure, but we were supposed to register at the city hall.  When you work in Vegas, you're supposed to get a work card that I believe at the time was $3.50.  We did not get them, and we went through the first week of our show; rave reviews.  Everyone was talking about the show and the women, and he did, we were, he did a replica of the Olympics, all of the pavilions, and I had the Russian pavilion on my head.  This was some of our costumes.  It was really, really, he was really quite an amazing producer and visionary.  After I believe the first week and a half of the show getting rave reviews, and everyone talking about this black show across town, and Vegas, at the time, every time we left the hotel, and we'd be walking down the [Las Vegas] Strip, we were stopped by police, or someone would stop us, wanting to know what we were doing there.  We'd say, "We're in the show at the Flamingo."  "Okay, go ahead."  At night, we would go across the tracks to all the little joints, the little clubs, you know, and hear the music and the barbecue, and it was really--Vegas was very, very different.  But I just remember being stopped a lot by police in the street.  So we're going into our second week of the show, and we finish the first show, and Larry came into the dressing room and said, "We're not going to do the second show, we have a problem."  So the police were back stage, and they came back and wanted to know where our work cards were, that $3.50 work card, which none of us knew anything about it.  Whether Larry did or not, I don't really know and if he did, he forgot.  It was a thing, even in those days, they used it when they had to, you know, "Where is your work card?"  So we didn't have our work cards, and we were--there must have been seventeen of us handcuffed to each other, put in a patty wagon and spent the night in jail.
Speaker 2: How did you feel at that moment?  Do you recall?
Speaker 1: We didn't think it was very serious.  We were, you know, I was nineteen.  I said, "This is really a hoot."  We weren't quite sure what to feel.  We weren't afraid.
Speaker 2: You weren't?
Speaker 1: We weren't afraid.  No, because we just didn't know that this was, how real this really was.  It didn't make any sense to us.  We were not afraid.  After a while, I'll tell you when we became humiliated, which this is a great story, I think.  When we got to jail, Larry was busy trying to get us bail and get the whole thing together, we're all thrown in the paddy wagons together.  It was in Jet magazine a month later which was a hoot, but, when it came time to book us, my first time being in jail, we all had wigs on, fabulous wigs and eyelashes, and we were, things were just attached to us, 'cause we were show girls.  And there were all these black women in this room being booked, and the officer, the female officer says to one of the women, she said, "Is that your hair?"  And the show girl said, "Does this look like my hair?"  All this wavy long curly hair.  Of course not.  She said, "I got to take it."  And that's when we all started to, like, whoa.  We had to take off all our wigs and pony tails in those days, and up under all these wigs and pony tails were corn rows and little teeny braids and twists and all these things now that are now totally in fashion.  We were completely embarrassed.  It's a very interesting story.  The eyelashes had to come off.  We all wore these long fake eyelashes.  We just, everything, us, we had no knowledge of this.  We would probably have taken off the wigs before we got there, but then we were so embarrassed, because in those days those little teeny braids and corn rows were, just wasn't the thing.  And then, we spent the night in this big huge room with the toilet in the middle of the floor with other, other females.  They were junkies, they were women who had robbed a bank.  There was someone else, and it was still really weird.  We were on these bunk beds.  Then it got to be, "Okay, this isn't fun."  We thought we were going to have to spend another night there.  Larry got us all out basically sometime that afternoon, so we spent a little bit of time in jail.  The show was cancelled which was very heartbreaking for all of us, and I don't know why, but we were all sent back to the East Coast on a train, where we were flown out there, 'cause there was a problem with money, which probably had to be spent on bail.  And it was a big, big, big thing.
Story_ID: 261752
Speaker 1: What an interesting time.  The show ['Smart Affairs'] was cancelled, because of the bad press, and we were very, we were just heartbroken.  We were having kind of a good time in [Las] Vegas [Nevada].  I actually was making a lot of money at nineteen years old in Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: You know, I was going to ask you, off-camera, myself, to know.  How much were you, did you earn doing this work?
Speaker 1: I thought four hundred dollars was a lot of money in 1969, I was nineteen years old.
Speaker 2: Four hundred dollars per what?
Speaker 1: Per week but we, it was, that was a lot of money then, to us.
Speaker 2: Did you have expenses related to your job?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had per diem, and our hotels were paid for, our meals and everything.  So, it was a real four hundred or five hundred dollars a week.  In 1969, at nineteen years old, it was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: It's--we probably should have been paid more, but Mr. [Larry] Steele was quite an entrepreneur, as everyone knows, so yeah, I'm sure we were probably offered a lot more, but now, I mean, people do Vegas, well, because it's just fun, and it's a serious gig, but you can just make some great money even today, but I just that was pretty great at that time in my life.
Speaker 2: Before you had gotten to Vegas, you were in Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 1: We were at the Eden Roc [Miami Beach] Hotel [Miami, Florida] in Miami for six months.
Speaker 2: Tell me a little bit about how you remember that?
Speaker 1: Just, you know, at the time, it was Collins Avenue, and I just remember just doing these shows every night and in these big gigantic rooms, and Miami Beach [Florida], there were houseboats along the way.  We just, we just had a really kind of a fairy tale life, you know.  It was a lot of work, because we were doing shows, very--a lot of shows, long shows, good two and a half hour shows, sometimes three times a night.  So, I do remember saying, "God this is a lot of work," but it was still glamorous, and we were eighteen, nineteen years old.
Speaker 2: Who made up the audiences in these Miami venues?
Speaker 1: They were, I guess, tourists mostly, come to these hotels, as they still do now, and as they did in Vegas.  They were mostly tourists, yeah, and different, there would be a different group of people every single night it appeared.  And it was a repetition that you just sort of did, because you were young and, you know, but Larry would, of course, keep us on our toes.  We would have to rehearse a lot in the day, which we really hated that.
Speaker 2: I was just going to ask you, what did you do in the daytime?  Get a chance to go to the beach or anything?
Speaker 1: No, because it was such--we had to be so perfect all the time, that if there was one thing wrong the night before, we were rehearsing the next day.  He was a real taskmaster, but I learned.  I learned from that, and I, and to this day, I'm nothing like that, but I do want things to be as right as they can be.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the other showgirls that you were with in Miami and Atlantic City [New Jersey]?  Where were they from?
Speaker 1: They were from everywhere, and eventually, because I came from Boston [Massachusetts], I dragged, we dragged some Boston folks with us, Sandra Grace [ph.], Rita Lopes [ph.], Paula Hayes [ph.], my friend Brenda Dong [ph.] from [Jeremiah E. Burke] High School [Boston, Massachusetts].  He grabbed girls from everywhere, all over the country.  And we changed, they changed a lot.  You know, we changed girls a lot, and there were always new girls coming in, 'cause girls would drop out.  They either, you know, went on or met somebody or got pregnant or whatever.  You know it was an in and out thing, all the time, so we were always relearning the show.  You know, it was a glamorous, hard, fun, well-protected life.
Story_ID: 261753
Speaker 1: Let me go back a moment.  One of the things that was in our contract [for 'Smart Affairs'] at the Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey] was that we had to do--we were being paid to work for eight hours.  So, six hours was basically the show, two shows and then that would make up the time frame of six hours.  The last two hours between four a.m. and six in the morning, we had to sit at the bar outside of the main showroom.  There was a fabulous bar at the Club Harlem which was famous.  Everyone knows it.  And we were young, and the reason for that was to bring the men in.  The showgirls are coming to the bar.  Those women that you saw on stage are gonna be at the bar, and even then, people knew my dad [Ruble Blakey] and knew me, and the bartender was good friends with my dad, and I would sit and a guy would want to offer me a drink, and I'd order rum and coke, and he'd give me the coke, you know.  This is how it was.  And this is what we had to deal with.  It was in the contract, and [Leroy] Pops Williams who owned the place, would sit out front in a chair and make sure that we weren't going anywhere, weren't doing anything we were--it was a real interesting life--that we were not leaving that club until six o'clock in the morning.  Couldn't go to any other clubs.  Was very, very interesting.  However, we were still protected.  Never had any fear when I was young.  A fear of the singers, fear of--we were just protected by everyone, especially by Larry [Steele].  I mean we were even, we were overly protected by Larry.  He know, he wanted to get into who was going to be our boyfriend and who wasn't.  That's how protective they were of young black women in that day and age.  It was an interesting, interesting life, without going into detail about everything.
Speaker 2: Six months in Miami [Florida] and where did you go next?  What was next?
Speaker 1: I believe it was--I think we might have went back to the Club Harlem.  I'm not sure because the Club Harlem was a three-month gig every summer, and then we went on to [Las] Vegas [Nevada] and '69 [1969] was when the whole thing happened in Vegas.
Story_ID: 261754
Speaker 1: You mentioned Chicago [Illinois] earlier, though.  Was that a stopover too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we, we did.  It was a stopover in Chicago at some theater in Chicago and I, it does not come to mind at all, because it was very quick.  We were in and out on a show to fill in for something.  This was a very big show ['Smart Affairs'], it wasn't a show that you could just, well, we had props and eighteen piece band, and it was a really big show that just couldn't--
Speaker 1: During, during this tour time from Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey] to Miami [Florida], maybe Chicago, back to Club Harlem and eventually Las Vegas [Nevada], were you, and in what way, in contact with your grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount], your mother [Merle Laviscount Jones], your father [Ruble Blakey]?  Did you have a chance to get back to Boston [Massachusetts] at all to see them, or were you in touch with them?
Speaker 2: I might have for a very short period of time, but I was on a roll.  I was in show business.  I'm sure I came in and out, because I was, you know, my mom was so close with me, you know, she was the Brooke Shields' mom of show business for me.  But she was just--I'm sure I was in and out, and everyone was abreast of my career, and every time I came home I was, you know, "[HistoryMaker] Marla [Blakey], the dancer from show business," you know.  It was a hoot.  It was an absolute hoot.  People took me much more seriously than I did.  I was just out having a good time at that age.
Speaker 1: Where was your friend Donna Summers at this point?  What was she doing?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, you know, she just left that school and bam, went to Hollywood and took off, and I didn't see her for years, you know, she just became Donna Summer, you know, and I met her, ran into her, I mean, I'm sure we periodically here and there, but it was years later that I decided to move to California, and I had no idea what I was gonna do.  I went out with enough money to live for a month, and I had one interview with Sidney Poitier, 'cause he was good friends with my dad, and Sidney was gonna maybe get me a job acting or something.  And I went to an art opening and ran into Donna.  She said, "Girl, what are you doing here?"
Speaker 1: Now, this was after Las Vegas?  This is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was way after all of the Larry Steele stuff, yeah.  I was on my own now.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, when did you leave Larry Steele's--?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I have you there in 1969, roughly.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I stayed there until the early '70s [1970s], and then I left the show, actually came back a few years later to the Club Harlem with my own dancers.
Speaker 1: With your own dancers?
Speaker 2: With my own dancers.
Speaker 1: How did you do that?
Speaker 2: Just came back to Boston and put together my own dance company [Marla Blakey Dancers].  I think I showed you some of those photographs, and I said, called down to the Club Harlem to [Leroy] Pops [Williams], said, "Look, I got an act here.  I got some dancers," because they stopped doing the big, big, big shows, and I remember Larry coming in and making a few comments about my girls, and you know, stuff like that, but he was trying to be supportive, and he was in his own way, but I went back and had my name on the marquee, the Marla Blakey Dancers.  And I did that for a couple of summers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Well, let's--
Story_ID: 261755
Speaker 1: Let's come back to Boston [Massachusetts], because you came back.  And what did--tell us, a little bit more expansively, what did you do, how long did you stay in Boston?
Speaker 2: Ah, I did come back for a period, you're right, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden].  You know better than me.  I came for a period, opened up my own dance school and got my own dance company [Marla Blakey Dancers], and we did tons of things in Boston.  I started with Webster Lewis who gave me my first job basically with my dad's [Ruble Blakey] company at the New England Conservatory [Boston, Massachusetts].  The Boston Conservatory, yes, no, New England.  He was music, the head of music there and his assistant Carolyn Ingalls [ph.] who, at the time was Carolyn Souser [ph.], who was a huge supporter.  So we just did shows all over Boston.  All the festivals, all the Summer [Sundays] in the Park, all the stuff up at Franklin Park [Boston, Massachusetts].  We did the colleges, we did the prisons, everything, with my own dance company, and that's when I through that time took us back to Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey].  I called, I said, "I got my own troupe now, I want to come down and do a summer."
Speaker 1: How did you find Boston when you came back at this point in time?  Had the community changed at all?  You know you were away during the civil rights years of the '60s [1960s], had come back to Boston.  We had court ordered school desegregation in the early '70s [1970s].  I think you had come back around that time.  How did you find your home neighborhood at that point?  Had things change at all?
Speaker 2: They had changed.  Of course, I, a lot of folks were gone from the neighborhood and myself as well.  I had moved down on Tremont Street in the [Chickering] Piano Factory [Piano Craft Guild, Boston, Massachusetts] so we went we moved down, down, but there was, and yes, there weren't as many people, you know, in that community-type situation, but there was still folks that were willing to help me do things, to put on shows and hostels, you know, to put on shows upstairs, you know.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: Ah, jeez, Tinker [ph.] who owned hostels, Joe Bass [ph.].
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember both very well.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  You know, [HistoryMaker] Elma [Lewis] helped us do shows, Bill Owens [ph.], I mean, just everybody in the community.  Mae Arnette, the Wallace Brothers [Scott Wallace and Norman Wallace], everybody, "Come on [HistoryMaker] Marla [Blakey]," Jimmy Slyde, everybody, "Come on, let's do some shows," you know, Webster Lewis, Carolyn, you know Carolyn, everybody, "Let's go do shows."  Everybody was still trying to do things, you know, and then there were folks in the universities who knew me, who brought me in to do, you know, master classes and performances.  People that worked, you know, Dana Chandler, of course, who was at Northeastern [University, Boston, Massachusetts], and I can't remember all the folks, but I actually did stuff at Wellesley College [Wellesley, Massachusetts], just a ton of schools in Boston.
Speaker 1: This was your educator years.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And went in as teacher, master class instructor, and we would be performances.  So, the community was still--Boston, I have to say, you know, there were many, many years; there were a lot of amazing people that came out of Boston or still in Boston, and I mean the music, the jazz. I mean, you remember the jazz workshop and we had, it was a hell of a town in those days, it really was.
Story_ID: 261756
Speaker 1: The Marla Blakey dance studio, at this time, was located where?  Where were you?
Speaker 2: At the [Chickering] Piano Factory [Piano Craft Guild, Boston, Massachusetts], at 791 Tremont Street.
Speaker 1: What was the Piano Factory?
Speaker 2: This was an old piano factory that some developers came in and turned it into apartments for artists, and I said, "That would be me."  And I got in on the ground level.  I was actually on one side of the building before the other side was even finished.  And everyone, [HistoryMaker] Paul [D.] Goodnight and Milton Derr, oh, just everybody--they're still in the building, but all of us flocked to this amazing loft-type place to live right in the middle of Boston [Massachusetts].  Boy, it was paradise.  Downstairs were studios.  I had my own dance studio in the basement.  I lived on the fifth floor, had a beautiful, you know, hard wood floors, brick walls; it was beginning of the whole loft thing.
Speaker 1: I remember when it opened.  I didn't know you then, but I remember being there.
Speaker 2: We had an art gallery; we had, oh my God what a time, what a time, the whole building.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Guilford [HistoryMaker James Guilford] was there.
Speaker 2: Everybody, Hakim Raquib, and the whole building was full of artists.  Boy, it was something.  It was really something.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure it was anything like that in other big cities at that time.
Speaker 2: I don't believe so.
Speaker 1: We have such institutions today in many of our big cities today--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  I've lived in a few over the years.
Speaker 1: --I think that the Piano Factory was one of the early ones to provide that kind of an opportunity.
Speaker 2: We had amazing rent, you know.  I had a studio and an apartment for less than five hundred dollars a month.  Beautiful studio.
Speaker 1: I remember Dana [Chandler], Dana used to have a place in there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody, it was just such a time, wow, what a time.
Story_ID: 261757
Speaker 1: So you took your own dance group [Marla Blakey Dancers] back to Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey], and how long did you have that group there?
Speaker 2: We just did, you know, some summer. We did probably a few weeks in the summers for a couple of years.  You know, they would book acts for two weeks at a time.  You know, we didn't do the whole summer, like Larry Steele had a contract to be there all summer.  And I spent many in a summer in Atlantic City [New Jersey].  It was a gig.  You know, I worked a lot more, I worked more than now than I do now.  It was amazing.  It was so much work for all of us.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you left Boston [Massachusetts] after opening the dance studio and having your own dance group and teaching at the various college universities, where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Hollywood, okay.
Speaker 2: Isn't that what we all do?  I went to Hollywood, yeah.  I went out with about five hundred dollars in my pocket, and I knew I was gonna have a meeting with Sidney Poitier.
Speaker 1: You knew that before you went?
Speaker 2: I did.  He was going to see me when I was settled in, per my dad [Ruble Blakey], as a favor to my father, and I found a place to live with a Murphy bed that fell out of the wall at night, and that was it.  I had--it wasn't well-planned, as I have to say, as most things in my life.
Speaker 1: But you had a dream, you had a vision.  You went there for a reason.  Your father facilitated in a way, but what were you going there for?  What had you seen--?
Speaker 2: To--I really wanted to be behind the scenes, more than anything else.  I really wasn't interested in being an actress or a dancer anymore.  I wanted to move on after having my own dance company, even though I let, I disbanded it much earlier than I did, because it was a huge responsibility at twenty-two years old, taking care of eight or nine people and having to book work and being responsible for everybody.  I felt really overwhelmed and much too grown up.  I grew up, it was much too grown up at that age, to have that kind of responsibility.  I didn't want it, so I just--although we did very well.  We did really well, probably I had a tendency to leave things once emotionally, it was--okay, I'm gonna move on.  Unlike my aunts [Vera Laviscount Renteria and Wendolyn Laviscount Love], who with the business sense, I was, you know, a show business person, you know, who just dreamed and went for it.  That's what I did.  I went to California basically to get back into show business, but to be a choreographer this time, not a dancer.  I would dance, and I did, to begin with, but in one month's time, I was hired by Donna Summer who ran into me at an art opening and gave me a job choreographing her shows, and it just took off from there.  So I didn't have a real serious plan, I just have to believe that there's just been some little angel hanging out with me my whole life that just said, "Okay, even though you didn't plan this too well, we'll let you try this," and I've been really lucky like that.
Story_ID: 261758
Speaker 1: So, you choreographed for Donna Summers [sic. Donna Summer]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and wow, for thirteen years, I--one thing lead to another.  I didn't have enough sense to get an agent; you know, I didn't have enough business sense to get an agent.  I did some dancing around a little bit here and there and a few TV shows, 'What's Happening!!'  I had a little guest spot on 'What's Happening!!' and a big TV show with Cleavon Little, a movie, 'Comedy Tonight' [ph.].  I did a few things like that, but I still preferred to be behind the scenes.  I had--I was really good with people, very diplomatic and I just had, as an early age, you know, just able to organize groups and just God, I have to believe this came from my grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount], just a huge sense of treating people in the right way and being respectful and diplomatic and treating people the way you want to be treated, and I've done that my entire life.  I tried to do it and be totally aware of it my entire life.  So, but L.A. [Los Angeles, California] was a really interesting scene.  I just, from Donna Summer, someone else saw me, saw her show, I met someone else.  I was on the cutting edge of the video scene.  Somebody got my name, Randy Newman's brother [sic. cousin], Tim Newman, got my name from somebody.  "She's a good choreographer, she can do it," and I did a slew of music videos, starting with ZZ Top, which are very, very famous music videos now.  Did three of those videos and moved from that to Linda Ronstadt to Fleetwood Mac, just tons of video; music videos for Motown.  I was there at the music video scene where all the record companies said, "This is what we have to do, 'cause this is gonna make our act, and we're gonna make a lot of money."  So, I was right there, right smack in the middle of the beginning of the music videos.  And I did that for many, for quite a while and then Suzanne de Passe--who, you know, her family obviously is Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts], they knew people--knew of me, I knew her family, I knew her mom and everything and she, you know, she got me some work at Motown doing some acts, and then I got to meet [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, and I really understood what he was doing, 'cause he was like Larry Steele, you know, "We're gonna make these acts the best that they can be," you know, and I have to say a lot of it was because we were black, we had to do everything better.  So, I was hired by Berry Gordy to clean up those acts, to polish them, to choreograph, and to teach the girls how to walk, to teach them how to sit down, to just, you know, and this is what I did for a really, really long time, you know, at Motown.  A lot, a lot of choreographing of the acts, and then Suzanne gave me a big, big shot.  I was the choreographer for 'Motown Returns to the Apollo,' which was a huge shot for me.  And then I moved into a whole, whole, whole 'nother bracket at that point.
Story_ID: 261759
Speaker 1: So you're in New York City [New York, New York] for that ['Motown Returns to the Apollo'], then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Traveling back and forth?
Speaker 2: No, we stayed in New York [New York] for the whole time to film that show.
Speaker 1: Oh you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, up at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York], and it was such a--you know, when you're in this kind of magnitude of stuff, you don't really understand what it is until you get to talk about it, perhaps something like now, years later.  But I was at the Apollo where my father [Ruble Blakey] used be emcee and where all the major, major, most amazing acts in the world went through, and there I was the choreographer of an NBC television special with Bill Cosby, and here comes Jimmy Slyde, and here comes Sandman Sims [Howard Sims] and here comes Sammy Davis, [Jr.], and all these people that I worked with over the years at the Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey], through all of my career.  Here I was the choreographer of the show, and I collaborated on a number with Debbie Allen for the show, a big showgirl number that we did, and it was--I didn't even know the magnitude of what I was in, and I find that to be true of a lot of things until I'm able to step away.  Sometimes it's years later that you understand what you were doing, what you actually were doing.  It was exciting, really exciting, but I also had a job to do, so there was always that level of anxiety that I'm here to do a job and I better well damn do a good one, you know.  And I did my best.  You know, I did my best with that show, but, so those were my years in Hollywood and then, it's interesting how we--
Speaker 1: Before we leave that though, I want to, Lou Rawls has always been one of my favorite vocalists--
Speaker 2: Thank you for reminding me.
Speaker 1: --and you did a Lou Rawls television special.
Speaker 2: A few.  The telethons, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us about that, people, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lou Rawls like so many people had a thing for dancers, and I met Lou at the Club Harlem.  He was one of the headliners, one of the many, many headliners over all my years of being at the Club Harlem, because the headliners would change every week, so we were there for twelve weeks, so I mean, to list would be virtually impossible.  But Lou was one of them, and he knew my dad.  And we got to talking, and he said, "Well, I'm getting ready to do this telethon," and, "can you get some dancers together for me?"  I said, "Yeah, I sure can," and he gave me a shot, gave me a couple of shots, you know, of bringing my own dancers on and doing these telethons with him, and then, we also did a show with Lou in, wow, was it [Las] Vegas [Nevada] or somewhere, I remember going on stage with a big band and Lou, and we all danced behind him, all the dancers, yeah.  So that was--that happened a lot, once I branched out from Larry, you know, from Larry Steele, from that show ['Smart Affairs'].  I really, and a lot of it was my dad.  They knew my dad, "Oh, you're Ruble's daughter, yeah, come on, we'll give you a shot."  That's the way it was, you know, and still is in many ways, and that's what I try to do.  "Oh, you're so and so?  Come on, we'll find a spot for ya."
Speaker 1: Cab Calloway.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about--
Speaker 2: My dad.
Speaker 1: --that experience.  Cab Calloway, Cotton Club revue tours.  Tell us about, what was your role there?
Speaker 2: Cab said, "You're Ruble's daughter?"  I said, "Yeah."  I said, "I got a dance group [Marla Blakey Dancers], I got some fabulous dancers."  He said, "Well, I'm doing this Cotton Club revue, want to come on?"  I said, "Um-hm."  I put together the whole show, and we did two or three things with Cab.  You know the Roseland Ballroom [New York, New York], Waldorf Astoria [New York, New York].  We were with the Nicholas Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas].  "You're Ruble's daughter.  Come on."  It was absolutely amazing the influence that my father had on my career without even knowing it, you know.  And fortunately, I was able to produce, you know, to come through, but that's how it was in those days.  "You're Ruble's daughter, come on," and they looked after me in each and every situation, in every way.  In every way (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 261760
Speaker 1: --Was there ever vacation time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Christmas and things like that, but I was away for a long time, as my brother just reminded me the other day, "Well, you were away so much."  I guess I was.  I was working; I was working.
Speaker 1: But you got back for Christmas?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah, I came back for the holidays as much as I could, yeah.
Speaker 1: How do you remember those Christmas times?
Speaker 2: It was always exciting to come home.
Speaker 1: Who were you with and where?
Speaker 2: The family, you know, the family.  That's one of the sad things about life now, you know, with all--there's no adults left, no grandparents, no aunts, no uncles left in our family.  And the whole holiday thing, you know, I still struggle with that, but it's an era that's gone, at least in our family, where, you know, we have to force all of us to get together, and this isn't, not unusual, I'm sure it's the case with a lot of families.  People are living all over the country, you know, and it's not always easy to get back, and it's always a major ordeal.
Speaker 1: When you were growing up in Roxbury, a neighborhood of Boston [Massachusetts], and your grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount] was very prominent with his church work and community work [at St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts], what were some of the special family things that you remember, special times with the family as you were growing up?  Were there any special holidays that--
Speaker 2: Well, the holidays were always a good time, but one thing in particular, it was a big tribute to my grandfather at the church, and our whole family came from everywhere, the whole community, you know, Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke], I mean everybody, all the who's who.  It was a big, huge affair.  That's something I will always remember.  A tribute to my grandfather: who he was, what he had done in his life.  It's a big, big, big thing; big auditorium, big dinner.
Speaker 1: You know, I think I went to that.
Speaker 2: You probably did.
Speaker 1: I think I did.
Speaker 2: It was a big thing.
Speaker 1: I don't remember everything, I don't remember a lot of things any more, easily but, you know, when you mention these things,--
Speaker 2: Thank you, it's not only me.
Speaker 1: --yeah, I think I was there, I think I was there.
Speaker 2: It was something really, really great, yeah.
Story_ID: 261761
Speaker 1: Did your grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount] have anything to say to you in his later years about your career, what you have been doing?  Did he reflect on it with you in any way, do you recall?
Speaker 2: I just remember us, I was just really grown up for my age.  I just remember us having a lot of adult conversations about life, and I always had a fascination with other countries.  He would talk to me about other places.  No, we never, no, it was just always--we had a very adult, and we were both very quiet people, interesting enough.  I use the word still.  My grandfather was still a lot.  I remember us driving in the car a lot when we would go to Brockton [Massachusetts], and I went to New York with him a few times.  We just didn't say much.  We didn't talk a lot, but there was just this thing between us, this quietness, but when he would talk, well, I think it was because he was a talker, he had to talk so much, and in my business, you have to talk a lot, you know, about what it is you're doing, the process, how to do it, I mean, it's interesting, because I'm really not a serious talker, only when I have to, yeah.
Speaker 1: We should talk about Mrs. [Leafy Giles] Laviscount, his wife, yeah, we hadn't really talked about her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, you know, as I said earlier, I was away so many years of my younger years, and then my grandmother passed very young. I just remember her in the kitchen and cooking.  It's an interesting image, but that, that's what comes to my mind, a lot.  And then, she used to tell us not to use a whole lot of toilet paper, 'cause it was expensive.
Speaker 1: I've heard that before too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, every time I use toilet paper, I think of my grandmother.  Yeah, but, I missed a--I didn't miss it, but I just was off and running for a huge chunk of my life with my family, from sixteen years, you know, on.

Speaker 1: You have been involved with feature films.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You've been involved in television commercials.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the feature films that you've been involved with and how you've been involved.  What was your role?
Speaker 2: Well, I was basically choreographer and did a lot of staging, which sometimes is not about the dancing.  It's about moving people around and, you know, getting them off and on stage, and I got several jobs in Hollywood doing just that in the beginning.  Sting, for instance, just hired me, originally, to choreograph the bows.  He said, "Every night, the guys are coming out, nobody knows where to stand, they don't know what to do," and I got called in to, "Could you just teach everybody how to bow?"  And I ended up doing a little choreography, and then giving 'em some stretch classes, and I ended up staging a little bit of a show, but, so the staging aspect I do a lot of, and did a lot of that, but the film and video and television things that I did were all, again, through word of mouth.  I still do not have enough businesses.  I did actually have an agent for a while, but this is an interesting thing that I would like to say.  I did not, for whatever reason, I did no drugs when I was in show business, ever.  I barely drank the rum and coke.  I definitely drank the coke, and then later on in life I drank the rum with the coke, but not much of it.  And I also, because of my New England upbringing, and some of the things that we just take with us everywhere we go, a certain amount of respect, a certain amount of cautiousness, a certain amount of manners and tradition, I really struggled in Hollywood with a lot of what Hollywood was, and is, and show business is.  And I say all that to say that I had opportunities to do many, many things that probably would have taken my career in a different direction, maybe better or worse, I don't know.  It always remains to be seen how that, how that goes.  But I chose not to.  I wanted to do everything on my own merit, and I wanted to do everything right, and I wanted to have respect, and I didn't--I wanted people to treat me with respect, coming from my grandfather [Reverend Samuel Laviscount], and I missed a lot.  I struggled for every job I got in Hollywood.  Even though I did a good job, and I was referred and referred and referred, I didn't have that little, that thing that you need, that kill, that drive, that, that thirst, that hunger, to get another job and another job, no matter what it took.  And to this day, I know this to be true that, that the Debbie Allens, the Paula Abdul, who I happened to have hired for a music video before she was who she was.  She had a drive, a different kind of drive.  Debbie had a different kind of drive.  I worked with both of them.  They had a hunger and a thirst that I did not have.  I had it but I didn't have it in a certain way, so I wasn't gonna go knock on your door, "Hi I'm--."  My grandfather was extremely humble.  That was the one thing we had in common.  When it came time for me to do the job I could come in, be the person, be the director, run the show, but in terms of, "I'm a choreographer, can you give me a job?"  It never really works like that.  No matter who you have dinner with, no matter who you sleep with, no matter who you do drugs with, it doesn't, in my opinion, it didn't quite work like that.  I'm not sure now.  If I knew then what I know now I might have done things differently, but I didn't.  So, as a result, I did a lot of great things, I have a long resume, but you, I am only as good as my last job.  And so, all of the things that I did, I could have done a lot more, perhaps, perhaps not, I don't know, but they were all based on my last job.  So, in a way, that's a good thing, you know--it was all based on reference.  "Call her, she can do the job."  "Call her, she, you know, she did a good job here, she can do that."  But, therein lies the business sense, you know, "Save some of that money, [HistoryMaker] Marla [Blakey] and hire an agent and pay him for six months and have him get you jobs," but choreography was a tricky thing, you know, there's, there was only a handful of us, and only a handful of black choreographers, you know, literally there was Michael Peters, [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle, you know, the Alvin Aileys, the Debbie Allens.  I'm sure I'm forgetting, but there was still a handful (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 261763
Speaker 1: So, I remember being at Sidney Poitier's birthday party.  I love to tell this story, 'cause I got to slow dance with 007.  Sean Connery asked me to slow dance, and we were talking and I was like, "Oh my God."  And then I danced with Sidney, and he was just getting ready to do a big movie.  He was gonna hire Michael Peters, and I said, "Well, did you ever think of maybe a female choreographer?  Me, Debbie Allen even?"  You know, and there were other female, not many.  "Did you ever think of that?"  And he said, "Well yeah," he said, but, you know, Michael just come off of 'Thriller,' and he's famous and, you know, we want to use him.  And I said okay.  It ended up being--he ended up having some difficulty with the whole scenario.  I'm not sure what it was.  Michael was a great choreographer, but it was that, well those are the kinds of things that I was up against.  Now had I, I don't know what I would have done, maybe to talk him into hiring me, but it wasn't, I didn't have that kind of chutzpah.  The most I got out was, "Did you ever think of hiring a female?"  He did give me a part in the film as a dancer on one of the, in one of the scenes, but those were the things I was up against, and you know, in, in the business, how I chose to conduct myself.  What I could have done as opposed to what I did.  I was still lucky.  I worked for thirteen years in Hollywood, you know, with music videos, TV commercials, all, you know, a lot of acts, Aretha [Franklin], everybody.
Story_ID: 261764
Speaker 1: Tell us about Aretha and your work with Aretha Franklin.
Speaker 2: Oh man, I loved Aretha.  I still love her.  I was assistant choreographer to Lon Fontaine who was another great choreographer, who still is doing choreography, who worked in Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey].  It all stemmed out of the Club Harlem.
Speaker 1: What was that name again?
Speaker 2: Lon Fontaine.
Speaker 1: Could you spell it?
Speaker 2: And his brother. L-O-N F-O-N-T-A-I-N-E, and his brother was a very famous choreographer, Donald Fontaine [ph.], and we all came from Larry Steele, you know, for the most part, out of Atlantic City [New Jersey], out of the Club Harlem, was just like a spring off for millions of us, in my opinion.  One of them anyway.
Speaker 1: But you were going to talk about Aretha.
Speaker 2: Aretha, yeah.  I remember, I loved her so, she was, she's a dear, and she just wanted to have dancers around her, and she wanted to dance, and she, so we choreographed dancers around her, and we did big shows with her, and you know, she'd just come up, we'd hear her coming up the stairs in her flip flops to rehearsal every day, and, you know, she just, she was just a dear who really, you know, and to this day, you know, the outfits.  She was show business personified, but when she got on stage and opened her mouth, you know, all the ostrich feathers and everything just went out the window, and this is how it was with Aretha.  It was great.  She was a doll, absolute.  I mean I worked with a lot of big, big females, you know the Bette Midlers, the Linda Ronstadts, the, oh God, you got my resume there, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden].
Speaker 1: Sister Sledge is another one that we used to hear.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about--
Speaker 2: I'm actually off very soon to do something with Joni Sledge who is going solo.  They were at the Club Harlem.  They were the act, the main headline act.  And I have to remind Joni to this day that we were all up in there together, and they were a little bit younger than I was, but we were all on these shows at the Club Harlem.  And so, the relationship developed from there, and I remained friends with all these people, all these years, and years later I got hired to do their show, and then another show, and I've recently done several things, you know, with the group.  The group is, you know, they've separated and become a couple of different groups, and so I've done a lot of stuff with them over the years and getting ready to do something with Joni as a single act soon.  Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: You worked with Billy Eckstine too, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Billy Eckstine, Arthur Prysock.  They were all the headliners on the show at the Club Harlem.  And then Billy did something else with us, I think with Cab [Calloway], and we also did an amazing show in the south of France for six weeks with Cab Calloway and Herb Jeffries, oh my God, who was just an amazing singer.  The Brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas], and a gentlemen who brought me in who I met through doing choreography was a gentlemen named Rene DeKnight, who was just recently passed, who was one of the Delta Rhythm Boys,  originally, and then he became music conductor and arranger for The 5th Dimension, The Friends of Distinction; many, many groups.  We all collaborated and did shows, took big shows, big variety shows.  You know that's something I think I would really love to do again.  Maybe that's what I could do for the next twenty or thirty years, is one more big variety show, where you know, you come on with the big, you know, the Jackie Gleason, the girls, you have a comedian and then another big production number and then the headliner and then a finale.  It was a lot of work, but it was fun.  It was a show.
Speaker 1: I recently played golf three weeks, three weeks ago I played in a golf tournament in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and I played with two of the Tavares Brothers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know the Tavares Brothers?
Speaker 2: Oh my God, yes.  We were all up in this together.  In fact Tiny Tavares [Perry Lee Tavares] who is out on his own now, sung at my jazz show, the one I did two years ago at the Performing Arts [ph.].
Speaker 1: Here.
Speaker 2: Here.
Speaker 1: He also sang here.
Speaker 2: Yes, I brought him in, and he did a couple of songs on the show.
Speaker 1: I was there.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then I did a PBS special with Sister Sledge, one of those specials with all the oldies, all the old groups in Atlantic City, and Tavares was on the show, so yeah, we just keep crossing paths.  Thank God, you know, we're all still out here, hanging in there.
Speaker 1: Well, I really enjoyed their music.  I'm from New Bedford, but they came on the scene after I had left New Bedford, but I still have their original record, and so I listen to them, now to play golf with them is fantastic.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and then, you know, my shows, Shawnn Monteiro who was originally from New Bedford, who was doing the shows and doing the show this year as well.  Yeah, there's a lot of talent in New England (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 261765
Speaker 1: Another favorite group which is on your list of work experience, The Temptations.  Tell us about your work for them.
Speaker 2: They were on the show ['Smart Affairs'] with us.  Another great venue that we played, I'm sorry I don't know how I could forget this.  The Latin Casino in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, where Larry [Steele], our show went quite a bit, and The Temps were on the show with us a lot, and I ended up doing, choreographing girls around The Temps, girls around The Spinners, girls around, you know, these groups, The Delfonics, just, you know, the girls, so that was my experience with The Temps as well, as they were one of the headliners at the Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey] as well.  And that's just, that's a bulk of where I branched out from, was from that club with everybody, and if you kept those relationships, you inevitably ran into these people again.  And it was a time when everybody was able to give you work, you know, Lou Rawls, The Temps, The Spinners; they were able to, "Come on, let's do something--"
Story_ID: 261766
Speaker 1: Thirteen years in Hollywood, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What came next?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), after, I just had a sense after doing all that I had done, and I wanted to end the Hollywood by saying that you really need to be careful what you ask for, because at one point I was getting a little disenchanted, and I didn't know what else to do, and I said to myself, "You know, I need to do, maybe I need to do some of these rock stars.  Maybe I need to move out of R&B and move out of the music video thing or something and just--" 'cause it's big money and big shows, and I can stage and choreograph those shows, and I kept saying it and kept saying it, and I pick up my phone one morning and here's a call from Bette Midler, and then there's another call from David Bowie, and there's a call from Sting and then Fleetwood Mac and then Linda Ronstadt and then it went on and on and on for a period of two or three years of doing rock stars, staging and, you know, all that kind of stuff.  And then, [The] Manhattan Transfer.  I worked with them for seven years.  You know, they weren't rock stars, but it was a whole different venue for me, a different style.  So, I managed to work with them for a long time.  Anne Murray, you know, a whole different, I just moved into a different phase of choreography and staging and then I just woke up one day, and I can't believe I said this, but I said, "You know what?  The sun is shining again; I don't know if I can stay in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] another day," and that meant smog and the filth and the tightness in the air.  L.A. is a tough town.  It's a big, spread out town.  I lived in beautiful places in L.A.  I lived in this beautiful loft in downtown L.A. when that was becoming the place to live.  I still couldn't get people to visit me.  There was nothing like on Hutchings Street in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], you know, folks stopping over to eat, and that's how that town is.  I mean, you--there's exceptions, and there's parties and there's dinners and there's affairs, but there was something missing, and I just--it wasn't my home, basically, although I have the most dear friends ever in life in Los Angeles [California], and still do.  I just left.  And I said, "Well, another, another emotional move with no preplanned thought or anything.  I'm going to move to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts]."  And within one month's time, I had packed up everything in the place I lived, told my landlord I was--I probably broke the lease, I don't even remember at this point.  I put everything in a moving van and came back to Martha's Vineyard.
Speaker 1: That was 1988.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Why Martha's Vineyard?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  My mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] had a house here.  I grew up here in the summertime.  I knew half the folks that lived here.  It just made sense to me.  I did not want to go back to Boston [Massachusetts].  It just seemed, I felt I had done what I could do in Boston.
Speaker 1: So you had spent your summers here as a child?
Speaker 2: Late, early--later childhood, teens, yeah.  My mom would come, we'd rent and come in the summer.  To what magnitude, I don't remember, but I do remember coming here younger, and my mom was renting, and she like many Bostonians, said, "I'm gonna get me a piece of land and build a house," and that's what she did.  My mom was here.  Very, very, very close, close friends were here.
Speaker 1: In the house that you're in now?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: On Wing Road, Wing Road.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, that's my mother's house.
Speaker 1: In Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  I didn't know where else to go.  I'd like to move someplace now, but I don't know where to go, but that was it.
Speaker 1: We hope you don't go too far away if you do go.
Speaker 2: Well, it's basically my home now, but this is where--and I had no idea what I was--once again, you know, not, didn't know what I was gonna do--
Story_ID: 261767
Speaker 1: --Well, you have had a very prolific and sparkling and influential role in the arts here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] since you came, in a number of venues.  You felt comfortable coming here, because family was here and you knew the place, but tell us how in this--back here, how you began to develop your, your skills as an artist.  What did you first do professionally when you got here?
Speaker 2: Well, I did one very, very big thing, but I had no plans on it.  The first thing I had to do was find a place to live year around, and because I had the most, the most amazing human being, of course, Liz White and Doris [Pope] Jackson said, "We have a little house up here," and it had been given to their niece, but she said, "I'll let you rent the house year-round." 'Cause I said, "What do you get for the summer rental?  Whatever that is, I'll pay it for the year, let's stretch it out."  And I went in, and fixed it up and I lived up at Shearer Cottage [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] which was like, oh my God, I just fell right into the history of this island, and all the beauty that comes with it, with, of course, Liz White and Doris Jackson who, well, Liz White was, you know, a playwright and in show business, so we hit it off immediately.  And we spent many, many a night 'til three or four o'clock in the morning sitting in Twin Cottage talking about projects and plays, and they were hugely supportive in everything I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So Liz White was here.  She had Twin Cottage [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts].  Tell us a little bit more about who Liz White was and Twin Cottage and--
Speaker 2: She was, you know, obviously a Shearer and part of that whole Shearer Cottage amazing history that goes, and you know that, and we won't spend the time on that, but that's, you know, that's, I'm sure that's well documented, but she was also a theater director and producer, but she originally started off as a dresser for like Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable and people like that, which a dresser is someone who, you know, dresses the stars for the films and everything, and I'm sure she had a long list of folks that she worked with and then, of course, she was also doing, even before I got here, she had done the film 'Othello,' you know, with Yaphet Kotto, and half her family and Cutie Bowles and everyone, Audrey [Branker], everybody was in that film.
Speaker 1: It was an all-black cast--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'Othello,' all-black cast on Martha's Vineyard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on Martha's Vineyard.  So we just, of course, man, we hit it off like you wouldn't believe, and I did some fashion shows at Twin Cottage, 'cause she had the stage.  I don't know if you remember this, but the deck was a stage--
Speaker 1: The porch, the whole porch.
Speaker 2: --the porch, was opened down to a stage with the lights and everything, and I said, "Ah, this is my kind of girl."  So we just, and I stayed there, you know, a lot, stayed in the house there.  This might have been before I got the little cottage or after, I can't remember now, but I just, once again, I fell into this amazing group of people that helped me and supported me, and we fed off of each other and were so kind in every way, that when, and Dorothy West and everyone, that when all of a sudden, I said, "You know what, there hasn't been any black theater on this island in some time, I think, I'm gonna do a play.  And I think I'm going to do it at the [Old] Whaling Church [Edgartown, Massachusetts], and I think I'm gonna charge twenty bucks [dollars] a ticket, and I think I'm gonna to bring in actresses from all over the United States, and I think I'm gonna, and I think I'm gonna--" you know, I think that I was [Steven] Spielberg in my other life.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you did it.  Go ahead.  Keep talking.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did it with the help of my mother [Merle Laviscount Jones], money and support, and then I called on all my friends.  I called Paula [ph.]--
Speaker 1: What was this first production then?
Speaker 2: 'For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf.'
Speaker 1: By?
Speaker 2: By Ntozake Shange.  And they're like, "You're gonna do what?  And you're gonna do it where?"  I said, "Yeah, but I'm gonna do it different.  I'm gonna update it," in my mind.  Now I'm a little naive about theater.  This is my first directing job, and I went in on instinct with this whole project, but my gut kept telling me to do things, and I stayed with it, which is an interesting concept, 'cause everyone said, "You've lost your mind."  But everyone rallied, Liz, Doris Jackson; she put the actors up, so and so put the actors up, my dear friend [HistoryMaker] Paul [D.] Goodnight did the set for me.  So and so did this.  Everybody contributed.  I went around and go me a hundred dollars, fifty dollars from this one, from that one, every single person.  This was a huge thing that I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  At the time, [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks' granddaughter [sic. daughter] Leslie [Parks], had just, she had just, was wanting to come to the island, and I said, "Well, I got a little cottage up here.  I got three actresses in one room, you can come and stay in the other," and she said, "Well, what can I do?"  I said, "Well, you can help me with PR [public relations]."  She was good with that, and she came up with some ideas that I would have never thought in a million years.  I was mortified, but she had the girls riding around in old convertible Cadillac cars with red tee shirts on, "For Colored Girls Only" waving at people through the towns.
Speaker 1: Only on Martha's Vineyard.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We sold a million tickets that day.  It was unbelievable, waving (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Only on Martha's Vineyard.
Speaker 2: The girls they were drop dead gorgeous and fine actresses and dancers.
Story_ID: 261768
Speaker 1: So I really had a lot to work with, so I'm gonna to turn the [Old] Whaling Church [Edgartown, Massachusetts] upside down, twenty bucks a ticket, people said, "You're just not gonna get it."  I think at the time the theater, the [Martha's] Vineyard Playhouse [Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts] which is well established here, was maybe doing twelve, ten and twelve dollars a ticket.  I had to.  I had brought all these women from everywhere.  I had a huge set I had to pay for.  I have this terrible habit of making sure that everybody gets some money, no matter who it is.  I don't care what you say, you're being paid for this, and so [HistoryMaker] Paul [D.] Goodnight, clothing designers, nice money, then, chicken feed for Paul now, but everybody.  Doris [Pope] Jackson put up four of the girls in Shearer Cottage [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts].  She said, "Nah."  I said, "No, no, you have to be paid."  So, this is how this thing went, and it turned into a massive, massive production [of 'For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf'] that I also, another thing that I did, I ran the show for sixteen nights, five hundred seats, twenty dollars a ticket, and I have, I have to say I think that we were close to full almost every single show.
Speaker 2: And that was your first.
Speaker 1: My very first show at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  With the help of my mother [Merle Laviscount Jones] and a huge amount of people and support.  It's still astounding to me, to this day, and I don't know whether its 'cause, "Oh, we're going to do this black show in Edgartown [Massachusetts]."  I don't know what it was.  But I got great press.  I think there just hadn't been anything like it in a while, and you know when, you know, timing is everything in this business, and these girls were showing up everywhere, and then Spike Lee was dating one of the girls, and he came up, and you know, they made that, and then Spike saw the Inkwell [Beach, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] and saw what was happening here, and you know, boom, two seconds later, he's got a house here.  That was a really, really interesting time, but everybody rallied in every way.
Speaker 2: So, you brought Spike Lee here.
Speaker 1: Well.
Speaker 2: A little exaggeration.
Speaker 1: A little exaggeration.
Speaker 2: I'm sure it was part of the attraction.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  But that was it; that was, wow.
Speaker 2: Your first success, very first success.
Speaker 1: Yeah, to this day, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], to this day, "Why can't you bring that show back?"
Story_ID: 261769
Speaker 1: But you've brought a lot of other productions here.  Tell us about the next one and the next one and the next one.
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Or those that are your favorite.
Speaker 2: I just felt, I felt that it was important on this island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] where there is such a huge black community to have black theater as much as possible.  And the [Martha's] Vineyard Playhouse [Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts] was a huge supporter of that.  You know, M.J. [Bruder] Munafo, she gave me, you know I did, we did '"Master Harold"...and the Boys' and then we did, then she brought in [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones, the--'Fences,' [August Wilson] and from that point on I got to do, you know, 'Spunk' [George C. Wolfe] and 'Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill' [Lanie Robertson] and the most recent project was 'Oak and Ivy' [Kathleen McGhee-Anderson] with Mario Van Peebles, and I did, you know, a lot of other different things, but there was just, there was a market.  There always has been a market.  In my opinion when Broadway is ready to fall on its butt, you know, a black show comes in with singing and dancing--it's just the way it is, and it's a big hit.  Look at 'Ain't Misbehavin'.'  Look at that show.  It's been running for a million years.
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to 'Oak and Ivy.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with Melvin Van Peebles [sic. Mario Van Peebles].  I went to that.  Tell me how did you, how did you put all of that together?  What was the process of doing that here?
Speaker 2: That was the playwright, M.J., the artistic director of the Playhouse who gave the playwright a shot and brought the show in, and then she, who was a really good friend, who has been dragging me along with every project that she's done, Kathleen McGhee-Anderson.  She was executive producer and a writer for 'Soul Food,' the television show that was on HBO [sic. Showtime] for a few years.  She's a magnificent playwright, and I've been able--been fortunate enough to do, to direct some of her shows, but she just said to M.J., "[HistoryMaker] Marla [Blakey] has to direct this."  And we were looking at who could play Paul Laurence Dunbar and da dat da dat da da, and Mario's name came up, and I said, "You know what?  He can do this, he can do this."  "Well, he's not quite the look, and the boo boo boo."  I said, "No, no, Mario can do this," and it turns out, he was--Mario was a huge fan of Paul's and he did an unbelievable job.  He was such a fine actor in this play and was so wonderful to everyone, and he got to have a good time.  He brought his family up and his kids, and he just--I was able to direct him, and we were able to do different things and I added music and, you know, as what I did with '[For] Colored Girls [Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], you know, I added a lot of choreography, I added sets and costumes and, you know, just revived it, took it to another place.  But, you know, remember that you had to have a good piece of work to begin with, and that certainly what, what I had.  So Mario did a great job.  That was a good, good--you saw it?
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah.
Speaker 2: You're such a fan, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden].
Speaker 1: I like theater, depends on who's doing it, you know.
Speaker 2: No, I'm so surprised that you saw--jaw to the floor (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had such a rep [reputation].
Story_ID: 261770
Speaker 1: Would you tell us about 'The Dancers' here on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] that you produced and directed?
Speaker 2: Well, that was another idea that I had.  Not particularly well thought out, just all emotion.  "I'm going to do a play about dancers, but unlike 'A Chorus Line,' we're gonna talk about the stuff that's going on now."  And I'm going to have a multiracial cast, and we're gonna talk about AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], and we're gonna talk about anorexia and drugs and racism, and I got my writer friends to write this story, this script, this idea that I had.  And then, I got to find a place to do it, and you know, the [Martha's Vineyard] Playhouse [Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts] has its seasons, so sometimes you can't always get something in there, and this is a new play and you know big chance, so I went up island to Piatelli's Studios [Piatelli Studio, West Tisbury, Massachusetts] and created a stage (unclear).  We helped create a theater.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the studio?
Speaker 2: Piatelli's Studios, yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, P-I-A-T-E-L-L-I, Cheryl Piatelli--
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: --had a dance studio there.  And I reminded her of a lot of the places in New York City [New York, New York] where the dance studios at night become theater.  So you have curtains behind the mirrors, and you have bleachers that could pull out, and you have stage lighting.  So in the daytime, you have class and in the evenings or whenever, they become performance spaces, and it's happening all over.  So I suggested that to Cheryl, and that's what we did.  And so I brought in the dancers and I again, once again, Mrs. Ziegfeld here, of [Ziegfeld] Follies, I brought in dancers from all over the country, and everybody rallied.  And my mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] had passed away before this, and I once again tried to do it with the support of, you know, whatever money we could raise from the community and ticket sales, which is always a bad way to do things, you know, paying people with ticket sales.  That was a big mistake.  I've done it a few times since, but I learned my lesson.  But there again is the business sense, you know.  I just didn't know how to do that whole other thing; that happens with a lot of artists.  I mean, you know, we heard stories of Diana Ross, millions of dollars being taken, because we're artists.  And I do have a good business sense, but the money end of it, and the raising of money and writing the grants and, you know, I just never had that, you know, kind of support.  That might have changed things for me, but I was doing it on my own.  And it has nothing to do with my ego, you know, being able to do it on my own.  It was I just didn't have that kind of business sense.  Yet, I was able to get everybody paid, you know, and get the advertising and, you know, I had a great deal of it, but not enough of it, nor did I have that entrepreneur person, that angel as we--we have a few names for those folks.  And why, I don't know.  I guess it's just, you know, exposure, you know, which is a problem living on Martha's Vineyard, as well, is exposure.  I do a lot of great things here, and the thing that I'm most proud of is that I'm able to pull in people--
Story_ID: 261771
Speaker 1: You were saying that perhaps you haven't handled the business side of the work that you do and raising money is difficult and paying the bills is difficult.  You want to just recapitulate that for me.
Speaker 2: Well, it's because I always want to pay everybody.  I understand the importance of that.  I think it's from my early days.  No matter what it is, you have to--first of all, people need money to live, and they need to know you respect what you're doing, and it also gives you a little bit of leverage, to say the least.  "I'm paying you to do this, sing that song, darn it."  No, all kidding aside, I think it's something that just stuck with me.  I am very uncomfortable asking people to do things for free, and I do, I have a lot of things offered to me, and I'm extremely grateful, but when it comes to the talent, and as I have said that one of the things I'm most proud of, all of my adult life, from the dance company [Marla Blakey Dancers] early on, to hiring actresses, to hiring dancers for music videos, I've given people that I knew jobs in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in music videos that didn't have a clue, but I knew they could do it.  If nothing else, they were in the scene, okay?  But I gave them a job.  I put my dad [Ruble Blakey] in a music video.  I'm like, "Okay, you sit there and smoke a pipe, 'cause you're in the nightclub scene."  But I've always done that, because I had that from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], from early on, and it's funny how I--and only in talking to you now do I realize how that has come about.  It just happened naturally for me.  I naturally just say, "Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], do you want to be in a music video?  What are you doing on Friday?  I know you probably need a little job, and I think you can do it, come on.  We can pay you so and so and so and so."  But that was from, as I look back now in retrospect, from an early age of my growing up with my grandparents [Leafy Giles Laviscount and Reverend Samuel Laviscount], my mother [Merle Laviscount Jones], all the people, and boy, I've gotten a tremendous amount of support on this island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] since I've been here.  It's astounding to me, each and every time, I'm like whoa; it's amazing, and I have tried to do really good work, but again, I will say I am most proud of being a positive image for a lot of people.  I make it a point when I go in as director, when I go in as a choreographer, because actors, they're scared to death of you, you know, because some directors and choreographers and producers are not very nice.  We know that for a fact.  So, I want you to do the job, but I want you to be okay with all of it.  So I go in setting 'em up from the beginning.  "This is what we're gonna do.  This is how I'm gonna treat you.  This is what I want to have happen, but the most important thing there is going to be a lot of respect here, or," and I will not hire people if I sense, you know, and I know right off the bat; I have a good sense of character and judgment.  And I have to be honest, I just will not hire you if I have a sense that you're gonna come in with a whole different vibe that's really not about what we want to do, because this business is supposed to be fun.  I mean, it's hell on wheels a whole lot of times, but if you can't find some joy in this somewhere then there's no point in this.  And you see what happens to people that have lost the joy in this.  You know, suicides, drug abuse; I could go on and on, you know.  I'm having a little trouble sleeping at night of late, because I'm at that age, but I can--my conscience, I can close my eyes and eventually go to sleep.  Now, you now, that has made me big, big, big time and a whole bunch of money and everything else, but that's the nature of this business, you know, you either do it for what it really is, or you do it for the money, or you do it for the drugs, or you do it for the recognition, or you do it for your ego, or you do it for art's sake, you know.  There's a lot of reasons to be in this business, and everybody wants to be in show business, but to me when I'm not having, when it becomes not so much fun anymore, I got to get out of it, you know.
Story_ID: 261772
Speaker 1: This is your fifteenth year on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], living full time, and you have produced six theatrical productions here.
Speaker 2: I directed them--directed and produced (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Directed--directed and produced.  All right.  And I think that's quite a record over fifteen years, to do six.  But you also are known for your jazz performances.  Would you tell us about your work in jazz on the island?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, obviously the influence I came by naturally of jazz, but I also just wanted to produce something, you know, and the plays were very, very difficult, you know, we always needed money, the ones that I produced on my own.  The ones at the [Martha's Vineyard] Playhouse [Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts] were really great but you know, you just don't make a killing.  You don't make any real money.  You do it for the love of theater, you know, which I think is the case in most cases.  But I thought that maybe bringing jazz concerts to the island would be a good thing.  And there was a gentlemen who came on the island briefly who had wanted to do it, and I said, "Well, I can help you do that."  So, the first one, we kind of collaborated, and then I said, "Well, I could do this on my own."
Speaker 1: Who was that with and when?
Speaker 2: Calvin--oh dear.
Speaker 1: That's all right, Calvin?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What year was that do you recall?
Speaker 2: Two--1999 maybe, 2000.  So we collaborated with that and then I said, "Hm, this is something here."  You know, "I'm gonna do this on my own," once again, you know.  The dance company [Marla Blakey Dancers], Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey], I could do this on my own, and have it the way I wanted it to be, you know, really good, and top notch and the whole nine yards.  So, I did.  The only, the problem was that I was producing it on my own, you know, with whatever money I could find, with my own paychecks, and/or I was going to pay everybody with ticket sales.  So, that meant I had to get everybody in there.  As many people as possible.  It was very scary.  And since the beginning of time, us show business people have been doing that.  It's a nightmare, but you do it, 'cause you don't know what else to do, and you really want it.  So I did.  I did two like that, three like that and I said, "Oh Lordy, this is not good."  The last thing I want is to have, you know, like the old days when you go backstage to get your paycheck, and the producer doesn't have the money, which has happened to me a few times as well in my life.  So, I didn't want to do that.  I managed, for three years, and it just was very expensive, you know, to do it the way I wanted to do it.  But I have to say, the folks came out.  Oh my God, they came.  But, as with every place, there's so much now on this island, you know, there's a lot of choices for people, and you can spend a fortune going to every event, so I was really fortunate to have, you know, those few hundred people that knew me and supported me all the way from '[For] Colored Girls [Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], all the way through, to come to these jazz shows which kept it alive.  And then I ran into Francine Kelly who is now artistic director of Featherstone [Center for the Arts, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts].  Said, "We want to get Featherstone on the map.  Can you help us?"  I said, "Well, I can do a jazz show there, but I can't pay for it, you know.  I just can't do that anymore.  It's too much stress worrying about money."  So, money to pay musicians who were like, "Yeah, where's our dough?"  So she said, "Well, we'll do it.  We know we can strum up, strum up the money, and we'll do it," and I didn't know how great she really was, 'cause she just gave me every single thing I asked for, and we did three jazz shows last summer, three Saturday nights consecutively, and they were really something.
Speaker 1: At the Featherstone?
Speaker 2: At the Featherstone.
Speaker 1: And what is the Featherstone?  I'm (unclear).
Speaker 2: It's a center for the arts, and they have--it's been around for a long time, but it's been growing and, you know, and raising money and everything, and I think it's taking off, and it's another place, because you can't have too many centers for the arts, and that's what it is now.  They have great classes there, concerts, workshops, and I see it growing and growing and growing, and then, of course, a lot of music series, but then this jazz series just took it to a whole 'nother level, and with Francine doing everything that I asked for, you know, in terms of, "Well, I want to have--I want to have seating with tablecloths and candlelight, and we need a stage, and we need a sound system, and we need the lights."  She said, "Okay," and it was--they were unbelievable.
Story_ID: 261773
Speaker 1: Who were some of the jazz--
Speaker 2: Well, being my old faithful, loyal self, you know, if it's not broke, I mean if it's not broke, don't fix it, whatever.  Shawnn Monteiro, who is very well known all over Europe and Italy especially, from New Bedford [Massachusetts], big jazz, unbelievable, you know, our new Sarah [Vaughan], Ella [Fitzgerald], voice, CDs, everything.  I ran into her, and she said, "Don't you remember giving me dance classes when we were kids?"  I'm like, "No, I don't."  "But now I'm a singer," and I said, "Okay, then come sing for me on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts]."  So between Shawnn and Tim Ingalls [ph.] and Stan Strickland and Saul Davis and Alvin Terry and John Harrison [III], and several other guys have come in between over the past five years.  Of course, we all knew each other from Boston [Massachusetts].  Here, here once again is that thread.  We all did shows together in Boston.  You now, Saul used to play for my dance classes sometime, and Stan Strickland, we all used to do jazz shows together, and Tim Ingalls, you know, was based for our shows for here.  Just the same family.  Just, I just moved the gang to the Vineyard to do these shows in the summer, and they've been coming back the same group every year, giving an unbelievable performance.  I paid--I managed to pay everybody, look after 'em, feed 'em, take care of 'em, give 'em a place to live, and the community rallied with that, and they still are, you know, "We could put a musician up for the night," you know, "We can feed, we can," it's really something.  It does take a village, really does take a village.
Story_ID: 261774
Speaker 1: Two weeks from now, August 21st, 2005, on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], you are ready to present what to us?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm gonna say this publicly so that I can remember that I said it, but I'm going to, I think, for a while, do my last show.  I should have said it last year, then I wouldn't have to save face and not do it this year.  I'm gonna do one more jazz show.  This year, I'm going to do it in collaboration with the gallery at Featherstone [Center for the Arts, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts], and we're gonna grab many of the black painters.  We have to have hone in on a medium, and this year we're going to do, this year they're--we're going to do painters, past and present, black painters on the island.  So we're going to get a piece or two of Lois Mailou Jones, up to Cutie Bowles, to Remain Litman [ph.], to [HistoryMaker] Della Hardman, and Doris [Pope] Jackson and just continue to move, move, move up to some of the younger painters that are living on the island and who are around in the summer, and have an exhibit.  And, of course, I want to do it, you know, Ziegfeld style.  We want everyone to get all dressed up, and we're going to serve wine and hors d'oeuvres, and, you know, flow through and see the artwork, and then they'll float across the lawn and go to the big, to the tent with the big jazz show.  Now, there's nothing new under the sun.  It's been done a million times.  I'm just gonna do it at Featherstone, for Featherstone, because they've been so tremendously generous and wonderful, and I don't have to worry about paying the musicians.  They can get their money.  And then, I'm gonna, I've got--I really have to kind of step back and figure out what to do with [HistoryMaker] Marla [Blakey] for the next phase.  I think that I've done a lot here.  I'm really proud of it, but there comes a time when you know you need to move on, you know, and I don't know where that is or what that is.  I would like to just forget about Marla for a year and step outside of my existence and go somewhere and do something completely--not completely different, because this is what I do.  You know, in one form or another.  But you, in any--it can be isolating here and if, unless I'm ready to retire, and get out of show business, you have to be, you have to be, you got to get back in the mix, whatever that is.  I'm not sure any more, because the mix certainly has changed.  But this is my home for all intents--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure you'll spend a part of every year wherever you go and do you'll be back here at some point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, there's no question.  This is my home.  This is my home.
Story_ID: 261775
Speaker 1: In addition to the fact that you love what you do and you do it well, and you've had tremendous support from family here on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] when you first came back in 1988, from Doris [Pope] Jackson, Liz White and many, many other black people who are doing many things on this island.  What else has sustained you here?  Is there something about the island that has sustained you?  What else (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the lifestyle.  I said that early on, when I first got here.  One of the nicest articles ever written about me, mostly because she said everything that I said, was Dorothy West.  And one of the things that I did say then and I continue to say it, was that I am a show, I'm show business, but there is another side of me, you know, that I love, the clean air, and I love being able to leave my front door open, and I love a sense a community.  I love being able to walk around with my shoes off, and I love all the things that we all love about this island that, you know, some of it does still exist.  It, clearly--it has changed a lot, but, and I, actually, I love older people, and there are still some really amazing old people still in my life here, older people here in my life on the island that I can sit around and chew the fat with, and I think it's, more than anything else, it's just the lifestyle.  This is the way it would be great for the whole world to live, the way one should live, you know, on this island, you know, and give or take things that have changed over the years.  I don't know if you can actually leave your bike on Circuit Avenue [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] unlocked and come back and find it there anymore.  I don't know, but my nature, my personality has always liked that kind of living.  The living is easy, you know.
Speaker 1: The title of one of Dorothy's books--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --'The Living is Easy.'
Speaker 2: 'The Living is Easy,' and that's a important thing for someone in my life and in the kind of life I've had.  You know, I've been in jail with--you know, we could go on and on and on.  You know, I mean, I couldn't even begin to remember, and all my friends, they have a much better recollection of a lot of the crazy stuff that's happened in my life and our lives in this business, but it's a nice, you know, but that's, I think that's, you'll hear that from, from big movie stars, you know, that have these houses and mystique, where nobody can even get to, because you've got to have that, you know, that, that, that separation from this craziness, you know, if you so choose.
Story_ID: 261776
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to add to this [The] HistoryMakers interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: Well, I am, give or take all the other mixtures in my life, I am proud to be a black woman in this country.  As difficult as it has been and is, and, I have sense, is going to be.  I have a sense things are changing again in this country, so I am very proud, and I feel really honored to have done all the things I was able to do.  There comes, you know, at certain times in your life, a sense of disillusionment about a lot of things and where you want to go and what you want to do, and okay, now what do I do now?  The old mid-life crises stuff, you know, but I think it's important that people try what they think they want to do, no matter what it is.  Well, quickly, for instance, Sheila Allen, who, ran into her on the street, "I want to be an actress."  I said, "Well, maybe you can do this part.  I'm gonna give you a shot."  And then her life was completely changed, and I put her in a play.  The play turned out really great.
Speaker 1: Who was she?  Who was Sheila Allen [Styles]?
Speaker 2: Sheila Allen, she has a boutique here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].  She's a black woman who came here, had a shop in Edgartown [Massachusetts] that was off on a side street, and I was working in retail, 'cause you gotta do something up here for it to make a living.
Speaker 1: Well, that gets back to the question about sustaining yourself here.  Go ahead.  We'll think more about that in a minute, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh boy.
Speaker 1: Sheila Allen.
Speaker 2: I haven't been a waitress, but boy I've done a whole bunch of other things.  But Sheila Allen had a beautiful shop.  She was selling high-end cashmere things on a side street, and she was the only black woman with a shop in Edgartown, and the shop that I was working in, the woman was getting ready to sell and move.  And I said, "Well," she wanted to sell the lease.  I said, "Can you sell the lease to Sheila Allen?"  She said, "Who's that?"  I said, "This is my friend.  She's around the corner.  She's a black woman.  We need to put somebody on Main Street.  Can you do that?"  She gave it to her.  Sold it to her.  Sheila's been in this store and still there now.  And she's another entrepreneur young black woman with ideas and, you know.  Some people just got a better business sense than I do, but she has a couple of stores now, but she always wanted to be in show business, and I just ran into her on the street, early winter, and I told her I was getting ready to direct a play in Providence [Rhode Island] and she said, "Well, is there a part for me?"  I said, "You know, there could be.  Have you done any acting?"  She said, "No."  I said, "Will you let me coach you?"  She said, "Oh, heck yeah."  And she, I didn't really audition her.  I let her audition, just to be fair to everyone, but I was gonna give her the part.  There was no question in my mind.
Speaker 1: And what was this play that you produced in Providence?
Speaker 2: It's Cheryl West.  A young black writer, American writer.  The play was called 'Jar the Floor.'  I believe it's been off Broadway and maybe in Los Angeles [California].  I'm not sure all the places that the play has actually performed, been performed, but I was getting ready to do it at the Providence Black Rep [Providence Black Repertory Company] and the best part about being the director is that you have some control, but you don't abuse it, you know.  I was not going to let Sheila do the part if I didn't think she could do it.  And I knew that she was gonna let me coach her.  So, she did.  Unknowing to me, I went into this thing, you know, a hundred percent, you know, as tired as I, as I was, but I said, "Okay, I don't have to worry about paying the actors.  I'm gonna go in and do a good job.  We've got to have things a certain way and, a boom and a boom and a boom," and to my surprise, it turned out to be magnificent.  I mean, the girls got a standing ovation every night, and Sheila was, oh, she was just wonderful.  She has lost her mind.  She is now in show business.  I keep telling her, as I tell every singly young person that I've ever worked for, "Do not quit your day job, whatever you do."  So, she still had the stores, but that is, that's one of the best parts about my life, and what I've been able to do.  And I think if we don't do that, I'm getting ready to do that in the jazz show.  There's a young girl, Felicia Taylor, who I haven't seen since she was a little teeny girl, had no idea she could sing.  She lives down the street from me.  I see her walking all the time on the road.  I heard her the other night for the first time.  She sings like, oh my God, and I said, "Felicia, you're gonna sing, you're gonna do a number on my show."
Speaker 1: I heard her at Lola's [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] a couple of months ago.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, I'm gonna put her in with those first class musicians, let her sing a song, we're gonna get somebody to fly her out of there and get her back to Lola's to her gig, but I got to do this for this kid, you know, and I think that if you don't, if--once you lose that, that passing, passing the baton, but that's the best part of what I've been able to do.
Story_ID: 261777
Speaker 1: Now if I could just make a little more money, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden].  So, I could--my next thing?  I want to open up a jazz club in Italy.  Just like my dad [Ruble Blakey], and bring all the jazz musicians that I've known my whole life, and I could just pick up the phone and say, "Yo, I need you down here next week."  And maybe a little bed and breakfast or something.  I'm ready to move on.
Story_ID: 261778
Speaker 1: Sustaining yourself here [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts].  What are some of the other things that you had to do during the last fifteen years here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] to maintain yourself and sustain yourself here?
Speaker 2: Mostly retail.
Speaker 1: I saw you in a retail business.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm still in a retail shop.  That's how glamorous this business is.  I'm still working retail, I just happen to work for, I've been so lucky to work for amazing people who kind of treat me like an adult, and they know that I really don't want to do this, and it's really not what I do, but I will do it professionally, and I will do the job, but because I'm in theater, costumes and clothes and art work were my thing, so I'm able to do it.  I wish I could do it forty to fifty hours a week, but I just can't.  But mostly retail.  I actually cleaned houses for about two days.  And then, when I realized that I was gonna try to get every little speck off the kitchen counter, and I was being paid by the hour, and you just cannot, you just can't be a perfectionist to that point.  I mean, it would be lovely, but it was killing me, so I managed, like my dad [Ruble Blakey], who bussed, did bussing for one day and then turned in his time card.  I cleaned houses for two days, then I said, "I can't do that."  I actually was sitting in a bar one night with friends and a friend came in who owns Zapotec [Restaurant, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts], a Mexican restaurant here, and he said, "I just bought this hotel, and I've got sixteen rooms with five bathrooms.  I don't know what to do with them."  I said, "I can fix those rooms up."  So I became an interior designer and did the entire hotel, 'cause it was a theater set.  It's a no-brainer.  You know, it's like, oh everyone, "You should be an interior designer."  No, no, no, it's just theater.  So I did that, and I think, I don't know, probably a couple little odds and ends, but you got to do something up here.
Story_ID: 261779
Speaker 1: Would you have chosen a different career path than you have designed and laid out for yourself?  As you think back, would have done anything different?  Had a different career?
Speaker 2: I don't think I had control over that.  I think that just from the moment I popped out, I think, 'cause I don't have any recollection of wanting to do anything else.  I just stayed. I don't think I had any control over that.  Now that I have a little bit, little bit more sense, and a little bit more business sense, I finally figured out maybe I better think about, in fact, if I do live another twenty-five or thirty years.  However, I still want to do a jazz club in Italy, or, you know.  So, it's still show business related.  So I don't think I have any control over the thought of doing anything else.
Speaker 1: You just answered my next question and that was, what do you still want to do that you have not yet done? And I think you, you've answered that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm really good--as you know, we all have people in and out of our homes up here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] on a constant basis, especially in the summer, and I'm really, really good at fixing, at making everything really, really nice, and I'm really good at making special meals.  And I love for people to have food when they get off a plane, and I love the little lace tablecloth, and I love jazz, and I love art, so, boy, I would really--I need an entrepreneur, perhaps.  To do, you know, another level of what I've always done, you know, and this is just what my father [Ruble Blakey] did and all the folks before him and folks after him, I'm sure, you know.  That's what I would like to do, I think.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and/or concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Whoa.  How much more time do we have?  No--
Speaker 1: As much as you need.
Speaker 2: --I just, I, well because of how I grew up, you know, until I left home, that sense of community and, and I have stated this in a few books, it's actually been written that I want the best for all of us.  You know, I want us to drive Mercedes [Benz] and own homes and do things and support and go to college.  I want all the things that everybody else, you know, really wants for us in this country.  I have a sense that we're in a bit of trouble in many fields and levels, but if I could just get my nieces and nephews to sit down at a dinner table with me and have a meal and talk, you know, that would be a start.  But, you know that things are changing, you know, all that, things are changing, and that's kind of, that's a really big question, with a lot, with a lot of answers that are not unique, by any means, what I would say, but I do, I do sense that we really have to, we need some more Black Panthers out there fighting.  We got to get, it's time for us to get back to fighting for stuff again I fear, you know, to keep some of the things--
Speaker 1: Because you did say earlier, maybe fifteen or twenty minutes ago that you thought that things were changing, and I don't think you meant just on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], but, you know, in our culture, and race relations, I think you were saying that things are changing again, I'm not sure?
Speaker 2: Well, I just have a sense, if you look at just the chain of events in, in every aspect, you know, you can look at the news, if you read between the lines you can see that we're, you know, we're going back to a time that we fought to get away from.  I see it happening (unclear).  I see it happening on this island.  You know, I see, you know, there's a whole issue about, you know, the black men on this island, and things that are going on, you know, with police and the controversies about this, and I see the kind of things that start to happen when all those black kids were coming up here for their college reunions.  I thought it was a joyous thing, but I saw, you know, I saw, all of a sudden, the next summer, we had fifty more police than we had the year before.  I mean, you got to stay on top of all of this, you know, and you can make it what you want, but if you really read between the lines, and you really take a look at things, and this could go on forever, they are changing.

Speaker 1: You made reference, I think, just a few minutes ago, about some things you had written.  Did you say you had written--
Speaker 2: I was co-writing with the dancers a play ['The Dancers,' Marla Blakey] about dancers which was, you know, a subject that I knew a lot about.  But I knew that I wasn't a writer, so, I wrote poetry when I was a kid, but I gave it a shot with some of the scenes, and then I, once again, hired friends that were writers to help me, you know, get a script together to do this play, so that's--
Speaker 1: Oh, it's playwriting then?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was playwriting, yes, I'm sorry, yes.
Speaker 1: If any of this published?  Has it been published in any place?
Speaker 2: The play?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: No, it is, it's copy written, and everything and we, you know, I did it here, I took it to Skidmore College [Saratoga Springs, New York], I got it down to Atlanta [Georgia].  I got it to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and then I ran out of money.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was doing it on ticket sales.  So, it has been produced.  It's a great, great piece of work.  Great piece of work, and I'm not through with it, but you never know.  Yeah.  We all have tons of pieces of work.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know if we could get them all produced, life would be grand (laughter).

Speaker 1: For young people today, our teenagers, young adults who have a flair for, an interest in theater and dance and choreography, who think they want to do that, what advice and counsel do you have, for young people today who may want to follow in your footsteps?
Speaker 2: Well, unlike my process which was learning as I went along, everything I know, you know, barring my couple years at Stanley Brown [Dance Studio, Boston, Massachusetts] with dance classes, everything I know I learned, and I kept my mouth shut, and I learned, and I watched, and I just learned every single thing as I went along.  But nowadays, I think the best advice I can give is to learn your craft as much as you can, and if you're lucky enough to have the kind of support system that I had and have had all of my life, then you'll be okay, but you've got to know, I think you need to know-know, you know, the whole process so your chances will be better.  And then you also need to get a business manager.  Duh.  And, you know, all those little things that I didn't do, but you also, when you don't walk into a space, whether it's a recording studio or a theater or the symphony or an art gallery, and you have something missing in here, then you need to stop; you need to stop.  But I think learn your craft; learn as much as you can possibly know about the business, and then just go for it.

Speaker 1: Last question.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Whoa (laughter)!
Speaker 1: How do you want--how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Boy, I give a really good party, and when you come to my house, you got a really good meal, and things are really nice.  When you come to see a show, you, you're gonna see a good show, you know, if I have anything to do with it.  And when you ask me for advice, you know I'm gonna try to give you something really good, and I, you know, I'm not that typical show business person that people think that I am, with all the flair and this, the whole thing, I mean, it's part of the business, but I'm, I just, I think I'd like to be remembered as someone who actually paid you (laughter).  You got paid.  (Laughter) Yeah.

Speaker 1: This is actually my most favorite picture ever.  It was done, I was sitting on the porch of a house that my mom [Merle Laviscount Jones] had rented in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] on Pennacook Avenue.  I was staring off into the sunset wondering, "What the hell am I doing with my life?"  And I was daydreaming, as I do a lot, and it's my most favorite picture, ever (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And the year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen, oh jeez, it had to be early '80s [1980s], I think, and, yes, early '80s [1980s], and it was just basically, I liked this because you, you only know one side of me (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  This picture.
Speaker 1: Yes, my boyfriend took this picture, a very famous Boston [Massachusetts] photographer, my ex-boyfriend, Hakim Raquib and he was a great photographer, and we were collaborating to do a photograph, so that I could use it for theater playbills to have a shot.  And I said, I'm just gonna put a hat on, and again show one side of my face.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: The most amazing man of my life, my grandfather, Reverend Samuel L. Laviscount.  My guy, yeah.
Speaker 2: The most amazing woman of my life, my mom.  That's me and my mom in the backyard of our, my grandmother's apartment, 132nd [Street] and 7th Avenue in Harlem [New York, New York].  I guess I was about two or three years old.  What a babe she was, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the man who started it all, unknowing to me, my father.  Ruble Blakey, singer, entrepreneur, agent extraordinaire.  Without me even knowing it, he just planted the seed for my entire existence; my dad, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Well, I need to hold on to this, because I could probably get a lot of money for this years to come, not knowing what a huge, huge success [HistoryMaker] Paul [D.] Goodnight was going to be.  He did this of me in the early '70s [1970s] when I was living at the [Chickering] Piano Factory [Piano Craft Guild, Boston, Massachusetts], and he was living up on the fifth floor, and I later, obviously, hired him to do a set for me, but little did I know who he was gonna end up being; Paul Goodnight.
Speaker 2: This might be a little--because it's a copy, I couldn't find the original of this.  Is it bad, bad?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No, it's fine.
Speaker 2: Good.  Okay.  My first gig at the Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey], sixteen and a half with my sister Myrtis [ph.].  We were sitting at the bar at, that must have been those two hours of the time I had to hang out at the bar after the show; Club Harlem, Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Well, I certainly don't have to tell you who this person is, but this was backstage at the Club Harlem, 1967.  My first year in Atlantic City and Sammy Davis, [Jr.] was the headliner, and I was one of the show girls.  Wow, look at that bow on that dress, wow.  (Laughter) What a long bow.
Speaker 2: Well, I was still--still kicking up my heels, although I was getting close to becoming a choreographer on this one, but this is the first, one of the first Marla Blakey dance groups.  I started off small with about four or five of us and worked my way up to ten or eleven, and then I realized I had lost my mind, but it's a show, probably in Boston on some stage somewhere, and this is the first of the Marla Blakey Dancers.
Speaker 1: So, I decided more is better, foolish me.  Still not being very business minded, I expanded my group, and this became the second leg of the Marla Blakey Dancers out of Boston, Massachusetts, and it grew and grew and grew and grew, but we did an awful lot of great stuff, a lot of gigs, had a good time; it was just a lot of responsibility.
Speaker 2: That's my dance studio.  We were doing the old Rockettes kick there; the studio at the Piano Factory.
Speaker 1: One of my proudest productions as a director, and I really hope to this again, and again, and again.  'Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill,' [Lanie Robertson] a beautiful piece of work.  I hired this young woman, April Armstrong, from a video that we had of her.  There's John Alaimo in the back, our premier pianist, musician extraordinaire from Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  This was a scene from 'Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill' about Billie Holiday, and I am most proud of this production, most proud.  It was a brilliant piece.  And my dad's in one of the photographs in the back there.
Speaker 2: This is 'Jar the Floor' by Cheryl West, my last production at the Providence Black Rep [Providence Black Repertory Company] in Providence, Rhode Island, and ironically, the young woman with the blue head wrap in the far corner, right top corner, is the woman Sheila Allen, that--I secretly gave her the job, even though she auditioned, and she did a grand, grand job.  It was a wonderful production.  'Jar the Floor' by Cheryl West.
Speaker 1: This sketch is Milton Derr from Boston, who also lived in the Piano Factory, teacher at Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] for many, many years.  An extraordinarily amazing artist.  He did this set for me.  This is, the sketch is from my play, 'The Dancers,' [Martha Blakey] the production that I pulled together that we took around the country a little bit, and our set was seven huge panels as well of Milton sketches, and I'm really, really proud of this.  A wonderful, wonderful piece of work.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's on the list to be interviewed, in Boston (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, great!  You need six hours.  Wow, he's brilliant; please give him my love.
Speaker 2: Okay, my first venture on Martha's Vineyard which, where I just didn't have a clue as to what I was going to do.  'For Colored Girls [Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], I loved the printer who, this is such a phenomenon, this play, the printer didn't even know this play, and he put a period at the end of "is enuf."  We loved that, we kind of kept it in for, you know, for sentimental reasons, but this is the production 'For Colored Girls' that I did on Martha's Vineyard in 1988.
