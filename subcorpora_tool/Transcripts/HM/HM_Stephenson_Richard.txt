Speaker 1: --Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --they're kinda People magazine-ish and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  My favorite food is--I would say steak, a potato, and a light salad and rolls with tea.  I could eat that five nights a week.

Speaker 2: It depends on the occasion.  When I was growing up, if things were tight for me, my favorite phrase was, I can't stop you from comin' over here, but I'm gonna sure delay your departure.  That's when I was challenged.  No, I don't think I have a really favorite phrase other than that.
Story_ID: 185938
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your ancestors and what you know about them.  I'm gonna start with your mother's side of the family, then your father's side.  Can you give me your mother's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Odessa Watkins Thomas.  I should say Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas; she was a Stephenson first.  O-D-E-S-S-A; Watkins was her maiden name, Stephenson for my father [Richard Stephenson, Sr.], who--whom she divorced, and [George] Thomas was my stepfather, T-H-O-M-A-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me what you know about her side of the family--the Watkins side, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What--how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can go back to my, to my grandfather and his brother.  They were twins and they, they married my grandmother [Nannie Watkins] and her sister so, two brothers married two sisters--twin brothers married sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.   Do you remember much about 'em, or what, are there any stories about them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember a lot about--I remember a lot about them, yes.  He was a--stocky, ruddy sort of--his skin was brown but had a sort of a reddish tinge, and brown eyes, stocky sort of guy who, who played with you and--as if he were gonna eat you up all the time, and I think I, I tend to do that with my grandchildren a lot--chewing on their ears and that sort of thing.  I think I got that from him.  I'd never thought about that until now (laughter).  And he worked hard all his life.  As a matter of fact, he was--used to come in from a foundry.  He worked in a foundry as did my stepfather, and he would sometimes take off his dusty old hat and whack me on my backside with it, and laugh when the dust came out of it (laugher).  He was quite a guy.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: This was in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were your mother's people from Nashville, basically, or--
Speaker 2: They were from Murfreesboro.  Both, my mother's people and my father's people, were from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, but when they--they wound up in Nashville after they were married.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, are there any other stories about your ancestors on your mother's side that you remember?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew my grandmother.  Momma was--was the banker in the family.  We used to call her Midas (laughter) 'cause she could hold onto a nickel; she knew how to make the money multiply or whatever.  As a matter of fact, when we were--I know that when my stepfather and my mother married, and my, my uncle and aunt--my mother's sister and her husband--were--they weren't very rich either.  My grandfather and grandmother, although they'd had problems with money because that was the [Great] Depression, they bought a big house (laughter).  They paid down on a big house and into which we all moved.  And I can remember that big ol' white house with a big yard and a dog, and we all moved in there and my--it was because Momma was good with a dollar.  Poppa, my grandfather, always kinda--he made the money and she saved the money and did things with it, I guess.
Story_ID: 185939
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father.  Can you give us--well--about his side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us, and his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father or my stepfather [George Thomas]?
Speaker 1: Well, either one.  It could be--you know, I don't know, we may wanna do both.
Speaker 2: All right.  My, my father was Richard Stephenson--spells his name the same as I, and he was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  I don't know his date of birth.  He--what did you wanna know about him?
Speaker 1: Well, what you know about his side of the family, how far back you can trace them.
Speaker 2: He, he had a number of brothers, one of whom I became very close to while I was in high school, until he died, which was about six or seven years ago.
Speaker 1: What was his brother's name?
Speaker 2: Eugene Stephenson.  Oddly enough, while Eugene was in the [U.S.] Navy, his record somehow got fouled up and they changed the spelling of his name, and after he tried getting it straightened out and the Navy being as obtuse as (laughter), as the [U.S.] military can be sometimes, he finally gave up on it and allowed them to continue spelling his name with a V, and so all of his children, and his wife, spell their names with a V, and that part of the family is Stevenson, and when we get together, we--in some family reunions, we spell it--we say, "The Stephenson/Stevenson Family Reunion," with the two spellings.  The--Eugene was his, was his name, and he was the football coach and eventually dean of men at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], then went to, to Davis, California and became a dean and then a--
Speaker 1: At the University of California at Davis [Davis, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And was eventually the, the officer for--who dealt with bias all this--all over the State of California for--
Speaker 1: Ombudsman they call it.  Is that what--
Speaker 2: It might have been ombudsman, or something of that sort.
Speaker 1: Or equal opportunity employment officer, or OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No--it was something of that order--
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: --for the entire system--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for, for the University of California.  He was--he was a, he was a reserve naval officer also, and had five sons, and as far as I know--as far as I'm concerned, a great guy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we related very, very well.  He was the big brother I never had.
Story_ID: 185940
Speaker 1: Now, you wrote that on that side, you can trace your [paternal] ancestors back to Alex Stephenson, who was born in 1820?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us about him--what you know about him.
Speaker 2: All I can--I just got that from the archives.  I don't know too much about him.  I, I--I can't remember anything specific about him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you spell his name, again?
Speaker 2: S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: His first name?
Speaker 2: Alex, A-L-E-X.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was--was he a slave--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Tennessee, or--
Speaker 2: In Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think there was a--was that in Murfreesboro [Tennessee], too, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so--anyway, in Rutherford County [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--so you were able to do research to find out about him and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  But are there any stories about any ancestors in slavery or about the Civil War, or any of that kind of thing in the family?  Any stories like that?
Speaker 2: No, not on, not on that side of the family, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well--now, how did your parents meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Not about my parents, no.  My mother [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas] and my stepfather [George Thomas] met in college.
Story_ID: 185941
Speaker 1: So, did you know your father [Richard Stephenson, Sr.] at all, or did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He never totally abandoned us.  With me he had a relationship.  I somehow--again, there's this business of--I--for some reason, I never got into the differences between my parents.  They were two people who had problems, and I didn't take sides (laughter).  I don't know why (laughter)--as a child, I just didn't.  Somehow, my sister did, and--but--and for this, he, he seemed to be happy about that because from time-to-time, he'd come and would, would get me and would, would take me out and would buy me some--get me some gifts that, I mean, that nobody in the--in, in, in my--in my neighborhood or in my group could, could, could get.  For example, he got me a desk that, you know, that, that--I mean I would never have had that kind of desk--desk and chair.  My--at that time, even though Momma and Poppa [Stephenson's maternal grandparents] were--had us living with 'em, and that sort of thing, we couldn't have afforded that.  He bought me a, a, a bicycle at one time.  Now, these were--this wasn't frequent.  It happened just from, you know, long, dry spells because he was a guy who--apparent--he liked to gamble, I think, and he was also a guy who, I found out later, was a--the guy who lends money, at your usurious rates, to people.  And that was--he was good at it, I guess.
Speaker 1: What they call loan shark?
Speaker 2: A loan shark.  And he worked for the L&N Railroad [Louisville and Nashville Railroad], and he had a good steady job, good steady job as a baggage handler--a mail handler, you know, carry the big, big heavy mail sacks.  And he got me a bicycle and I'll never forget it.  I'd never seen a bike like that before, twin headlights and all that sort of thing, and no--but no kid in the neighborhood had that sort of bike.
Story_ID: 185942
Speaker 1: Later on, just prior to my going to college, he [Stephenson's father, Richard Stephenson, Sr.] bought me a--an A-Model Ford [Ford Model A].  Now, it was (laughter)--I loved that car (laughter).  It, it, it made me a--I mean it wasn't--it didn't set me apart on campus.  It was, it was--but it was really appropriate for me, I mean it was a good thing for me.  I mean I had a way to get around, and I was working--gave me a chance to get to my job as a manager for Sales Boys [ph.], and I was also a jazz musician at the time, so I could get up and go to do that early in the morning, and then get out to my physics class--my--not physics--my classes at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], my eight o'clock classes, or if I had to do something--I was pledging frat, I had to get out.  You know, sometimes they asked you to do ridiculous things, and I could do that sort of thing.  And it was just great for me; it served me well.  It wasn't a luxury as such, but it really made it very comfortable for me and made me able to do--to get around to do what I needed to do.  I don't know if I could have, could have actually made, made it around as much as I did without that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he--he was around to do significant things for you, you know--
Speaker 1: From time-to-time, and he would show up--I never asked him.  He, he would just show up.  And it seemed he would show up at a right--at the right time, you know.
Speaker 2: So, did you see him on a--was there a regular schedule or anything, or just--he would just show up when--
Speaker 1: He would just show up.  And sometimes I'd run into him on the street, you know, or something like that.  He (laughter)--I was with my girlfriend, who later became my wife [Ruby Stephenson], one day, walking her home, and he happened to be walking down the street.  And he saw me and he spoke to me and, and then, as we passed by, he says--he called me--called me back, and he wanted to know, "Who, who, who is that?"  You know (laughter).  And I just played it off, I just, you know; I went, went back--I didn't, I didn't introduce them.  I went on back to her, you know; went on--took her on home.  But he never met her, that sort of thing.  We just--it was like ships meeting in the night at times--just off and on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, when did your father pass?
Speaker 1: He passed in 1951; I was--as a matter of fact, I was in Officers' [sic. Officer] Candidate School [OCS] when he passed.  I came home when he was ill, went to see him in the hospital, and as soon as I got back to the base, he passed--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I couldn't get back then 'cause I had just taken a leave to come see him.  But--and they were, you know--
Speaker 2: Did he ever remarry or anything, or have another family?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 185943
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your stepfather [George Thomas].
Speaker 2: That's the guy who made a man of me.  He really, really, really--he, he physically, and in other ways, made a man of me.  He taught me how to--how I should, in my opinion, respond to people, react to people, be with people, and in, in so many ways, he--
Speaker 1: Now, give us his full name, and date and place of birth (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) George, George Thesus Thomas.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: T-H-E-S-U-S, George T-H-E-S-U-S, and Thomas, is his last name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thesus is his middle?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah--what--okay--sort of unusual (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and where--he was born in Linden, Tennessee and--
Speaker 1: When was he born?
Speaker 2: I don't know his date of birth, I--
Speaker 1: If you had to guess, maybe?
Speaker 2: I would guess--I would guess he would have been--
Speaker 1: Eighteen eighties [1880s], '90s [1890s]?
Speaker 2: No, he would have been born about 1903 or 1905, maybe.  Somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: He was an easy-going guy who, in many ways, I really thought about--he treated me more like he was my protective big brother in many ways, as he taught me and taught me and, and that sort of thing, and--and how do you treat women?  How do you relate to people of other races?  How do you--you know--all that sort of thing.  He never struck me but once in my life, and I had that coming, because--
Speaker 1: What did you do (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I always felt that, you know, we was--you know, he was, he was my big brother, and we were walking along and, and he was with his--with some of his friends, and I was tagging along and, as men are sometimes inclined to do, he was telling a tall tale to his--some of his friends, and without thinking, I piped up and said, "Aw, Daddy, you know your lyin'" (laughter), and without thinking, he backhanded me (laughter).  He--not backhanded.  His whole hand covered my face, and I must have sailed a couple of feet (laughter), and came down, wouldn't get up.  And when I got up, my eyes were tearing and my nose was, you know, running and everything, but I--he never had to say another word.  I never said another word like that, I mean like that to him, and, and the lesson was learned.  And I would never--it was an unthinking act on both our parts, I'm sure, but--hey (laughter), he was, he was--I, I--in N'Digo, Hermene--
Speaker 1: Hartman.
Speaker 2: [HM Hermene] Hartman--called me once when I was superintendent of, of a district, and asked me to be a part of her heroes series, and asked me who I considered a hero.  And I said I would do it, and she asked me for the name of the person so that she could look 'em up and everything.  I said, "You can't look 'em up."  And--who is George Thomas?  Because he was a man--and I've got a big--on his, on his--on my wall at--well, right up there on my wall, I've got a big picture of that, of that pic--of that thing that she did--of that whole column that she did with his picture in it, framed, because he was the man in my life who, who took care of me and who made me a man.  He taught me how to--he was a, a Golden Glove boxer--Golden Gloves boxer.  He taught me so much about coordination.  At one time, I could throw with either hand, you know?  I was good--he made me a good athlete and--you know, with what I had, you know--made--taught me how to use whatever I had, and so I--nothin' but love and admiration for him.
Story_ID: 185944
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your, your mother [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas].  What was she like, and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I was, I was born on her birthday, so that must have been (laughter)--I don't know; I don't know whether--I guess she was pleased all the way around to get, to get rid of that bundle.
Speaker 1: You're a birthday present.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the birthday present (laughter).  She pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed.  I mean she was just one of those supportive women who felt that her children should--should reach out and do whatever they could, and 'course--because her, her parents always felt education was the answer, she did, too.
Speaker 1: Did she have a chance to go to school when she was growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, as a matter of fact--because she was raising children, her college--she dropped out of college after I was born.  When she married, she dropped out--I mean she was out, came out.  She went back and she married George [Thomas], and they both dropped out because during the [Great] Depression, hey, you know.
Speaker 1: Where were they going?
Speaker 2: Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so he, he went to work in the foundry, in Phillips and Buttorff, Buttorff Foundry [Phillips and Buttorff Manufacturing Company, Nashville, Tennessee], and he didn't get back to college until after World War II [WWII], and he went back to college--he went back to Tennessee State at the time that I was on campus.  We were both on campus at the same time.  My mother went back to campus--went back to college, and finished college at sixty-two, or got her master's [degree] at sixty-two, I've forgotten which--she got her master's at--yeah, about sixty-two.  She had finished, finished college at about fifty-eight or fifty-nine, something like that, and started teaching again.  She was one who was thoroughly vested--invested in supporting the kids.  Along the way, she had me and my sister Vendolyn, who were the children of Richard [Stephenson, Sr.], but then George's children were Barbara and Odessa Ann, and she sup- you know, she worked with those two children also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever find out why your parents broke up in the first place, or did you ever--
Speaker 2: I think his gambling was a big thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you said he was loaning people money and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, that sorta thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did your mother and stepfather meet?
Speaker 2: How'd they what?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How did they--
Speaker 1: How did they meet?  You said there was a story about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They met at Tennessee State.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story attached to how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 185945
Speaker 1: Well, what were some of the sights and sounds of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always been a practical joker (laughter), and I used to play pranks, even on my, on my mother [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas] and stepfather [George Thomas], I used to play pranks on them.  And why they didn't kill me, I don't know (laughter).  If you put itch powder in your parents' bedclothes, that's, that should call for a killing (laughter), you know--that sort of thing.  I don't know how I'm still alive.  That, and of course, I used to--when I did something, I remember once I knew he was gonna come after me, and I did one of those things that you see in the comic books all the time, you know?  Fix a pail of water over your bedroom door?  And I had that for him (laughter) and, and he came in to, to get a--to talk to--get after me or whatever, and the water came down on him, and I went under the bed.  He couldn't come after--he couldn't get after me, that sort of thing.  I mean I just was a prankster.
Story_ID: 185946
Speaker 1: We were talking about the sights and sounds and smells of childhood, and you were talking about your pranks and stuff.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was one of the key features of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, that was one; and the other thing was I, I, I played--at the Catholic school where, where I went to school.  I was probably the--one of the football players there, even though I was small, I was tough, very tough and, and one of the things that I had that was in the, in the thing there is that I had a strabismus from having fallen off a porch on a tricycle when I was about four years old.
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: My eye crossed; my eye crossed.  My right eye had a weak muscle and it would cross, and it stayed crossed most of the time, but my mother [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas] had her choice of either having an operation or taking a chance that as I grew older, it would straighten out, and she decided, "Well, I think it'll straighten out."  And it did, but--but when, when I would get tired at--older, you know.  It started to straighten out, but when I would get tired, it would go back in, you know?  Well--but, at the, at the school, you know, a cross-eyed kid gets kidded a lot and, and sometimes that would cause some, you know, and that's why I would--why that thing I told you about--I would--I can't stop you from comin' over here because somebody would say something, and I'd say something, and they might not like it, and I, I could, I could take--I could defend myself.  And I was small, but I knew what to do; and I was a--a, a good football player.
Speaker 1: Now, did you play back?
Speaker 2: I played back--defensive back and running back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is in high school?
Speaker 2: No, no, this was elementary school.
Speaker 1: In grade school? Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: This--but in Catholic schools, you know.  And we went over and played a ninth grade (laughter).  We went over, seventh graders playing ninth graders--played another Catholic school.  We played the ninth graders.  They beat us, but--that's what happens.
Story_ID: 185947
Speaker 1: We were into music, plays, that kind of stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What kind of music was popular when you were coming along?  What did you all play at home, I mean, you know?
Speaker 1: I would guess just pop, pop and some blues but, but mostly pop, just mostly pop.  We always had some kind of old, you know, Victrola.  Is that what you'd call it?  And we also had an old, old piano, which was--and I would fool around with that, and as I--I--it turns out I had perfect pitch, you know, but--although I don't know how I could have had it with that piano which was out of tune all the time.  But my mother [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas] had a friend who was a music teacher; she had two friends who were music teachers, and this one friend started to give me music lessons, and I was pretty good.  And it was hard for me to do that and play--play, play ball in high school [Pearl High School, Nashville, Tennessee], but we squeezed it in.
Speaker 2: So you played the piano?
Speaker 1: Played piano, yeah.  And I was playing jazz then--pop and jazz and, as a matter of fact, the thing was it was before high school 'cause I remember that I--we left Catholic school and went to a junior high school--ninth grade, and it was ninth grade when I was playing. And when I went to senior high in tenth grade, the principal, I'll never--I can't forget this--principal, I guess he, he did this every year, I guess--did some research on, on, on kids coming in, but he blew me out of the water.  Said, was saying how much he appreciated having the new kids there.  He said, "As a matter of fact, I'm gonna introduce you to some of the new kids"--and he goes--so-and-so.  "And I have this one young man"--so-and-so and so-and-so, "and I'm gonna ask him to come up and play piano for you."  And he calls me up and asks me to play piano.  And, you know, you know what that's like, goin' up before a high school class and it--and--fortunately, it went off well, you know.  But that was--that was--and from that point--that, that was sophomore year.  And it's funny how those things happen; I was a sophomore, so--then they had class elections--well, that got me noticed (laughter), so I was elected president of the sophomore class.  I was south--president of the class all the way through--from there all the way through college (laughter).  That seemed--sort of thing--just because I could, you know, that one freakish thing.  But, the--that was--music was, was just a thing for me.
Speaker 2: Who were your favorite musicians in those days?  Did you have a favorite piano player that you liked?
Speaker 1: Yeah, always Oscar Peterson (laughter).  He--there was a time when I wouldn't listen to any piano player but him, but--Nat [King] Cole--Oscar Peterson, Nat Cole.  Course their styles are so much alike.  Erroll Garner, but he couldn't read, and so I kind of disdained him.  Let's see, who else?  Oh, there were others, but my favorites were Peterson and Cole.
Story_ID: 185948
Speaker 1: Now, you went to grade school where?  What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: St. Vincent de Paul [School, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's a Catholic grade school.
Speaker 2: That's a Catholic grade school.
Speaker 1: All right.  Was it mostly black students at St. Vincent de Paul?
Speaker 2: All black students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, and they devoted their lives to teaching blacks and Indians, and 97 percent of those kids were non-Catholic, so those nuns were--they did a heck of a job.
Speaker 1: So, did your parents [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas and George Thomas] belong to a church, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they belonged to a Methodist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was another thing.  It was a con--there was a conflict there because the, the--they did a lot--in the school, they did a lotta proselytizing, you know, 'cause they wanted converts.  They wanted 'em, and the priests did, too, and all that kinda stuff, but--and I remember my grandmother [Nannie Watkins]--she always would say, "Boy, you wait 'til I die before you become a Catholic" (laughter), you know.  And see, you can see, I, I remember one, one weekend I was just--in, in, in the--I can, I can almost remember that like it was yesterday.  I was in--and was so conflicted--I mean it was just like an axe--an axe was over my head, you know, 'cause the nuns and the, and priest were saying, "You're gonna die and go to hell if you know that Catholicism is the way to go and you don't do it."  And my grandmother was saying, "You wait 'til--boy, you wait 'til I die before you become a Catholic, before you become a Catholic," and that sort of thing.  And finally, I said, "To hell with it" (laughter), in a, in a, in a sense.  I'm not gonna do anything, you know.  I'll just--
Speaker 1: What kind of Methodists were your parents?  Was it United Methodist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) M.E., M.E., Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 1: Episcopal, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 185949
Speaker 1: You alluded to the fact that your grandmother [Nannie Watkins] bought the house that you all lived in [in Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, they--how did it come in?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you said she saved a lot of money and then--
Speaker 2: I don't know because she and, and my grandfather--until her death, I never understood how Momma got--how she acquired money because even at her death, she had money that--I don't know, I didn't inquire, inquire too much into it but there was money that--I was surprised that, that--I don't know how much, but the people who were kinda squabbling over it were (laughter).  There was enough for them to squabble over.
Speaker 1: Now, did she have a job?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: She didn't do day work or anything like that, or any part-time?
Speaker 2: No, she never worked.  And my grandfather was a foundry worker.  Now, they owned some farm property in Murfreesboro [Tennessee], but I don't know what--I, I don't know what--she never worked a day in, in--to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: So, the household consisted of--when you moved into this big white house that you were talking about--you were--how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I would say about seven, maybe eight.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you basically grew up in that house, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the household consisted of your grandmother and your--you and your sisters and your mother [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas] and fa- and stepfather [George Thomas], right?
Speaker 2: No, more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Consisted of six adults, my grandfather and grandmother, my mother and father, my aunt and uncle, their two children, me, my sister, and another sister.  Was that eleven? About eleven of us.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 185950
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about teachers in grade school [at St. Vincent de Paul School, Nashville, Tennessee].  Were there any teachers that inspired you, or took a particular interest in you?
Speaker 2: Sister Christella [ph.], but it was sort of a negative interest 'cause, again, I reacted to something that was funny in class and I didn't know she was there, and I was--I had my back turned and was laughing.  Everything got quiet and I didn't realize it, and it got quiet 'cause Sister Christella was there.  Now, Sister Christella was about 6'1" of nun, and muscular nun and, you know, if you've heard, heard about some of these nuns (laughter)--and I was about, about fifth grade or something like that, and she yanked me up out of that seat like I was a feather and grabbed me--took me to the cloakroom, hung me on a--
Speaker 1: A coat hook?
Speaker 2: --coat hook by my belt like, like--yeah, yeah--by my belt, and started to slap me until I kicked her--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --and she couldn't believe I would kick her.  That scared her, and she left me alone.  And, 'course, my belt gave way and I fell to the floor, but she never--and nothing else was said.
Speaker 1: That seems like cruel and unusual punishment.
Speaker 2: It was, it was, but, I mean--she, she slapped me twice.  The first time I couldn't believe it and she did it again and was goin' back for the third one, and I kicked her.  I mean, I wasn't gonna take it.  That's--that's one that I remember.
Speaker 1: And nothin' else was said?
Speaker 2: Not another word.  Must of hurt her 'cause I kicked her in the breast.
Speaker 1: And she couldn't explain how it happened to anybody, I guess.
Speaker 2: Probably not, but she was a tough old nun.
Speaker 1: I'd say.
Speaker 2: I mean--but they taught.  Those nuns taught, they really taught.  They taught the English language, which is something that doesn't get taught too often anymore.  I could diagram sentences when I went to high school [at Pearl High School, later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee], I could, you know, the only thing I didn't get, that I think I should have gotten, was some geography.
Speaker 1: But the education you received was pretty good.
Speaker 2: It was a good education; it was a good education.
Story_ID: 185951
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about high school.  Now, you went to Pearl High School [later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee], right--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pearl High School.
Speaker 1: --in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: And I got--well, I went to Washington Junior High [Nashville, Tennessee] and Pearl High.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At Pearl High School, my wife [Ruby Stephenson] always gets after me about this, I got the teacher who I will tell the world was the teacher of the century, a woman named Mildred Freeman [ph.], who was the daughter--I mean not the daughter--was the wife of a doctor, and who must have spent her entire salary on us.  She believed in competition.  There was none of this business about oh, competition will hurt 'em, and will make 'em, you know, will, will hurt them for life and everything.  She knew that life was competition.  And if you were the best reader in that, in that room, you were in the front seat in the right row, the next was the second seat in the right row, and so forth and so on, all the way down to the last guy in the last row.  It was fighting like everything to move up one seat, and there was no laughing about it or kidding or teasing.  We were working.  It was competition and, and you--that's the way you felt about it.  And she would do things like a--and I was a good reader; I was a heck of a reader 'cause nobody knows how I learned to read.  I learned to read--I was reading on the front porch when I was three years old, out of the newspaper, and so she would buy things like the kisser scopes [ph.].  You don't get those anymore, to make us increase our speed, and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Now, what is that device?
Speaker 2: That's a device that has a shutter, and you will have a--maybe a whole paragraph or--depending on the size of the paragraph, and you get a certain number of seconds, or something like that, to see it, and then, choop! The shutter closes, and you're supposed to have read, and you'll be checked, you know, examined on it.  And she did that, and man, I could read so fast you wouldn't believe it.  I mean a thousand or so, over a thousand words a minute, one thousand, about 1200 words or something like that.
Speaker 1: And retain what you read?
Speaker 2: And retain what I read.  If you can't retain it, you haven't read it (laughter).  And it--man, did it--and she was good, she was good.  She didn't play.  She taught, you know, there was no doubt about it.  And I had other teachers who were good, too and, and the thing about that school was that most of the teachers, practically all of 'em, imbued you with a sense that you've gotta compete in this world, and that the world is not gonna give you anything--that, while some people may have to climb a hill because you're black and the way the system is, you're gonna climb a mountain, and you better be ready.  And don't, don't look around, don't ask people, don't beg, you know. Get it done, and hey, that's what you have to do.
Story_ID: 185952
Speaker 1: Now, you say you were class president in high school [Pearl High School, later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee], all the way through?
Speaker 2: Yep, from sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Were you the top student in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't the top student but I was up in--well up in the ranks.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you played--did you play football in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't play football, I--I was doin' too many other things.  I was workin'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and playin' music, and, and I--and tried to play basketball, too, basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did play basketball.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you had a shot.  We were talking before we started (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You're a good shooter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're the point guard of the team.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right.  Now, did you--did the team win any championships or anything when you played?
Speaker 2: We didn't--you didn't have a thing like a state championship then, you know, but they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It would have had to have been amongst the colored schools, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we were good, yeah.  We would usually win the--we had a thing called the National Negro High School Championship.  We would win that most of the time, until Bertrand came down from Chicago [Illinois] (laughter).  That was--that one hurt, man (laughter).
Speaker 1: [Joseph] Joe Bertrand?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He was good, he was good.
Speaker 1: There's a story you told, before we started, about a team from Horse Cave, Kentucky--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that came down.  Could you describe that scene again for us?  It's a funny story.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, they [Horse Cave Colored High School] came in and--these guys were from Horse Cave, Kentucky, and my understanding is that they played--practiced on the ground outside, and they came in--they came into the facilities and saw the showers and said, "God, they've got showers!" That sort of thing.  And when they were introduced at the assembly, to the, to the student body, Clarence Wilson, who later played ball for Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] and later played with the [Harlem] Globetrotters, was looking around and was on the stage and was so awed by this structure that he fell off the stage (laughter).  The kids, of course, haw-hawed him to death.  Well, it wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this was like a combination stage and gym, you know, multi-purpose type arena?
Speaker 2: That's--right, right.  And when--it wasn't haw-haw that night.  It was, "Oh, Lord, make him stop," because those guys were rough that night.  They beat--they beat poor Pearl to death.  Those were good guys.
Speaker 1: But you were sayin' too, that the facilities at Pearl High School were probably the premier facilities in the region--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and many schools probably had a situation where they had no gym, or--
Speaker 2: Well, they had--they had gyms.  For example, we'd go over to some places where they had gym, and you had a stove, you know?  You might have a stove there near the--near the basket, or something like that; you know, something ridiculous--you just didn't have facilities, you know, that were--
Speaker 1: In other words, kind of had a makeshift kind of facility?
Speaker 2: Right, right. It was just inadequate.
Speaker 1: Basketball courts, were they all the same size, or some very small (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, some weren't--they weren't regulation, or you're right against the walls, you know, that kind of stuff, you know.  The out of bounds line is right here, and the wall is right here, you know that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: But people had to do what they had to do.  This is now during the '40s [1940s], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 185953
Speaker 1: Any other stories about high school [Pearl High School, later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] you wanna tell us, sir?
Speaker 2: Let's see, well--
Speaker 1: Were you still a joker?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but didn't do too much there (laughter).  I was more of a worker in high school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you had to work, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were in high school really to make ends meet (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dad [George Thomas] was in, my dad was away in--no, he was away before.  He went away in '41 [1941] or '42 [1942] for World War II [WWII], and came back in '46 [1946], I guess.  Yeah, yeah, he was away--yeah, he was away, and I was--I was the man of the house and I got three sisters, you know.  And--yeah, and 'cause '46 [1946] was when I went to college, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you work when you--
Speaker 2: I was a news manager.  I had to go to open up a sub-station for, for news boys at 4:30 in the morning, and in the afternoon--in the afternoon also, and distribute their news--their, their newspapers to 'em.  I had to collect their money, make sure it was, you know--collect the money from them, and turn it in to the Nashville Banner, Nashville Tennessean, you know, after--pay them, you know.  And, of course--and I was gigging.  I was playing, playing music at night.  So, if I had a gig at--like--that would take--say, for example, I opened up Brown's Dinner Club [Nashville, Tennessee].  I, I, I was the piano player who first opened up a dinner club at one--a swanky, black dinner club, you know, very swanky, and I was the--he op- gave me the honor of opening it up--okay.  Well, I played from about 9:30--well, from about 8:30 'til about 12:30.  Then I had to open up that news station at 4:30, okay?  Then I had school, sometimes you have a few nights like that, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a--very little sleep we're talkin' about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I didn't have to do that every night but, you know, that was just a--that was just a night.  Then he opened up on Thursday night.  Usually, I would be working on, on weekends or, you know, a Friday, or a special night, or something like that, or maybe somebody would have a special party or something, you know?  But mornings--that was five mornings a week--I mean seven mornings a week those, those news boys--newspaper is seven days a week, except the afternoon paper.  There's no Sunday afternoon paper, you know that kind of stuff so, it was, it was kind of a rough schedule.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did this mostly all the way through high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 185954
Speaker 1: Well, what about graduation?  When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Pearl High School, later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee], did you--had you chosen a profession to pursue in the future, or what?
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't.
Speaker 1: Did you have any thoughts about what you might like to do?
Speaker 2: No, I knew I liked science, but I liked music, too, and I just, you know, sort of drifted; so I went into the sciences at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: So, did you know, at that point, that you were going to go to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  No thought of, no thought of not goin' to college.  No, I'd have been--I'd have been disowned (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause your mother [Odessa Watkins Stephenson Thomas] was pushin' it, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  There was no thought of it; I wouldn't have even--she, she didn't have to push for that (laughter).  That's never occurred to me.  I wouldn't have even thought of not goin'.  As a matter of fact, the orientation of the teachers at, at Pearl was such that I think most kids would not have thought about not going to college.
Story_ID: 186402
Speaker 1: What was Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] like when you started out now--yeah, and you graduated from high school [Pearl High School, later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] in what year?
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: In '46 [1946], so you start Tennessee State the same year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Started at Tennessee State in '46 [1946], yeah.
Speaker 1: Fall of '46 [1946], and--well, you know, Tennessee State is unusual in that it's a state facility for black students, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--well, give us a little bit about Tennessee State in '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Well, it was much smaller than it is now.  I would guess that it was probably something on, on the order of a third of its present size.  Walter S. Davis, I think, was the president.  I know, was the president.  The faculty, I think, was, was a dedicated faculty.  The times, of course, influenced what was going on there at the university.  You had numerous veterans there.  People who were just coming out of the [U.S.] Army with the GI Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  I remember--I was always interested in languages and 'course, you know, music and languages and math and science mesh very well together, and those are my areas.  And I'll never forget my German teacher, a woman with the most kissable lips you could ever see, a very attractive woman, Mrs. Black--Fraulein Schwarz, and a veteran back from the, from the wars.  And all the guys were just looking at this woman, and this veteran (laughter) who looked like a bum (laughter).  No, he actually was a pretty nice guy, but all the younger guys was just lookin' at this woman panting, you know?  And he married her!  And boy, the class almost (laughter)--class almost dissolved, but she was a good teacher.  Those kinds of things were going, you know, that, that, that would happen because on the campuses, at Tennessee State and at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] because at Fisk campus we were in high school, and many of the Fisk girls would invite the high school--the Pearl High boys, "Come up to the campus, see us," you know, that sort of thing.  So while the cats were away, the mice were (laughter) very willing to play, you know, that sort of thing was going on.  You know, these guys were going up seeing these young Fisk girls who wouldn't have given them a slightest glance had the older fellows been around.  So that sort of thing was going on.  You had trailers that accommodated veterans.  Oh, I guess--I don't know, there were lots of things that were going on; I can't really recall.
Story_ID: 186403
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other teachers that you remember [at Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Oh, the Hills, Carl Hill and Mary Hill.  Those were my two main professors in chemistry department, absolutely fantastic.  I can remember (laughter)--prankster again.  There was a guy named Clyde Dillard who taught physical chemistry.  I was assisting with some of the veterans in the lab, and it was Valentine's Day, and Dr. Dillard--Dr. Dillard was a young guy, fair-skinned, bumpy face, heavy lips, wore glasses, thick-rimmed glasses--thick-lensed glasses; and he came in where I was, threw a, a document of some sort on the desk where I was--on the lab desk where I was, and said, "Mr. Stephenson, I don't like your damn sense of humor."  And I didn't know what it was, and I looked at it and I made the mistake of laughing when I saw what it was.  It was just a fantastic cartoon of Dr. Dillard done up as a fish.  The likeness was remarkable.  Dillard done as a fish with some kind of funny little remarks there, and I cracked up.  Well, then he knew I had done it.  Actually, I hadn't done it.  I was an undergraduate at the time.  It had been done by a graduate student, a young lady who was an--was a great artist.  I'm no artist.  My artistry is in music, not in, in the graphic arts, and she had done one of those for every member of the department.  One guy was the little brown bear.  Ma and Pa Hill were something else.  She had done a fantastic job of all those guys, but he took it to be me because I was known as a little bit of a prankster and I had done some things on campus.  At any rate--so he--you know--well, I took that to heart a little bit, so the next time he came in and he was about to sit down, I didn't warn him that there had been acid spilled on the seat he was about to sit on--the stool he was about to sit on, so his trousers, trousers looked like a nickel can of sauerkraut when he, when he left.
Speaker 1: Now, you had nothing to do with that did you?
Speaker 2: I had nothing to do with that.  I wouldn't do that.  But I (laughter)--I just--the man had no use for me ever.  He held that grudge--when I had to take his class, it was awful, awful.
Speaker 1: So he always thought that you did those things.
Speaker 2: He always thought I did it.
Speaker 1: Wow, I see.  Now--did you pass his class?  Did he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I passed it but, Lord, it was a good thing he had the--that Carl Hill was the head of the department or I might not have (laughter), and Carl was a fair man.
Story_ID: 186404
Speaker 1: So you were a chemistry major in college [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--now, did you join a fraternity?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you had that Model-A Ford [Ford Model A] that your uncle--well, your father [Richard Stephenson, Sr.] bought you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're right.  Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The last of the Model-A's.
Speaker 1: That's the one with the big wheels and everything, right?
Speaker 2: Big balloon tires and a rumble seat.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (laughter).  So, is there anything--were you a class president at college, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All through--all the way through, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was late turnin' in my senior project, so I had to come out in, in summer school, but I was still the senior class president of the summer school (laughter).  I was senior class president, when I didn't come out in, in June.  They made me senior class president in summer school.
Speaker 1: So you were--it would be safe to say you were probably the most popular person on campus, or close to it, right?
Speaker 2: I don't know--I would--I never considered myself a big man on campus 'cause I didn't--I wasn't that kind of a socialite.  I mean I just--I was--I worked with the science, I was a musician, and most of the music I did was out of the city.  I was not--I didn't play with the collegians and that sort of thing, and I wouldn't have joined the fraternity had they not sort of, you know, gone after me because I didn't have much time.  I was working, you know.  I was working one and a-half jobs sort of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you still working for the newspaper distributorship?
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We needed the money.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you live at home, or on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, I lived at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you live far from the campus?
Speaker 2: I lived--well, in Chicago [Illinois] it's kind of hard, you know, having lived in Chicago all these ti- all these years, it's--your sense of distance changes.  Everything's relative.  It wasn't a long ride, no; no, it's not too far.  I lived in north Nashville and of course Tennessee State was--would have been considered west Nashville.  I, I lived at 14th [Avenue] and Heiman [Street].  Tennessee State was at 30--say 3800 West or something that--it would have--it was a maybe ten-minute drive.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that wasn't too bad.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But in those days it seemed longer, I guess.
Speaker 2: In those days it seemed longer.
Story_ID: 186405
Speaker 1: When you graduated from Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], you went into the [U.S.] Army, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went into Officers' [sic. Officer] Candidate School [OCS]?
Speaker 2: Not right away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went in--well, as it turns out, I couldn't have gotten in any faster, but I didn't go in intending to go into Officers' Candidate School.  I went in, and they sort of pushed me into leadership school where I became a sergeant, and then my scores and all that kind of stuff, they recommended that I go into Officers' Candidate School and that was a trip.
Speaker 1: So this is 1951, or '50 [1950], '51 [1951]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay now, where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: OCS was in Oklahoma, Fort Sill.  Leadership school was in Kentucky, Breckenridge [County, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was--at that time, the Army--[President Harry S.] Truman had just issued a presidential order to desegregate the Army, and the post commanders were not happy about it, it seems, and much of what went on on those posts was not according to the presidential order.  There were--when I--
Speaker 1: So, when the order was issued, it got uglier first.
Speaker 2: It did.  I--it, it got really--I--after I got my commission, for example, I was the first black officer to be assigned a--first black combat commi- officer to be assigned in a regimental command at Camp Chaffee [later, Fort Chaffee], Arkansas, and you could--the commanding office there visibly almost fell out of his chair when I walked in 'cause there were no com- no black combat officers on that post at all.
Story_ID: 186406
Speaker 1: The men under my command [at Camp Chaffee, later Fort Chaffee, Arkansas] came to me to complain.  I mean you had--my men were mixed.  I had black, white, Hispanic, but some of the black men came to me early to complain that they were being locked out of the--out of a certain service club, and I listened to it but I, you know, I didn't go right away.  But finally, one Friday night, I got into my civvies [civilian clothes] and I went there, and when I got there, one of my white sergeants was on the door and said to me, "Lieutenant, you ought to know you can't go in there now."  I said, "You, are you tellin' me you're gonna try"--"Oh, no, sir, you"--(laughter).  So I went in, of course, the hostess had been tipped off.  She said, "Oh, hello, you're an officer, aren't you?"  "Yes, I am."  "Oh, come in.  Would you like to have some refreshments, and would you care to dance?"  Well, you know, that's an effort to get you to fraternize.  I don't know if you--have you been in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  If an office fraternizes, that's against the rules.  You can really get burned for that.
Speaker 2: If you fraternize with a--
Speaker 1: Fraternize with enlisted men, or if you get involved during enlisted men's function, you get burned.  Well, she tried to get me to fraternize and I wouldn't.  I stayed there for about an hour and I, I left.  When I got home, I started getting threatening phone calls on my home phone.  The next morning, I went straight to the regimental commander's office.  When I got there, I told the adjutant I wanted to see the regimental commander.  He says, "Oh, well, lieutenant," he said, "the regimental commander was just saying he wanted to see you."  I said, "Fine, I wanna see him."  I went in and I popped in and, "Sir, I'm glad you were sendin' for me 'cause I wanted to see you.  I've found out that somebody is violating the presidential order, and I'm sure that we wanna get this straightened out.  I found out what's goin' on at club so-and-so, and I'm sure we wanna go to the post commander, and if the post commander doesn't straighten it out, we'll go to the IG [inspector general], and if the IG doesn't do it, we'll go to the president, won't we?  I mean, sir, what do you wanna do?"  "I've heard about it.  We'll take care of it."  I said, "Well, when do you wanna do this?"  "Well, I'll call for you, lieutenant."  I said, "All right," I said, "what was it you wanted to see me about?"  "This is what I was gonna talk to you about" (laughter).  I said, "Fine."  For every week, I would go back and--drove him nuts, but he finally did something about it but, hey, that's the kind of stuff that was goin' on.
Story_ID: 186407
Speaker 1: At Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], you were supposed to deliver a graduation address, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It had to be screened or something, by the--
Speaker 2: Yes, they wanted me to submit it to the director of Negro education.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a white official, state official right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Turner [ph.], a guy named Turner if I remember correctly.  It's what fifty years or so, but I think that's the name, and of course I did not do it.
Speaker 1: Were you still allowed to deliver the address?
Speaker 2: Grudgingly 'cause they thought that we'd be some--there would be some repercussions.
Speaker 1: Were there any?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I never heard anything about it then, and the speech was not--according to--altogether, according--according to the way they would have wanted it because I, you know, I was--I've forgotten what I was unhappy about at the time, but I recall that had I--that my feeling was that had I submitted it, some of it would have been cut out, then I would have had to go against what they said, and that would have been grounds for, you know, so, you know, hey, let's do it, do it this way.  Don't submit it, and they can do--come after me afterward, you know?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: By that time it's a done deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 186408
Speaker 1: Okay well, let's fast-forward back to the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you--anymore stories about that desegregation effort in the armed forces?
Speaker 2: Oh, the Army, you know, that whole business in OCS [Officer Candidate School], the numbers of African American candidates who were allowed to go into the service--into OCS was pretty small, and the numbers who came out were pretty small, too, and I--I'm probably biased in this respect, but I think that some of the reasons for some of them get--not making it were prejudicial.  For example, you're graded on leadership.  Leadership is a--is not--except in an actual situation, it's not a substantial issue.  For example, every week, you graded every man in your barracks section.  There are twenty-two men in a barracks section, and every week, you graded every man in your barracks section on leadership, among other things, okay?  How do you do that?
Speaker 1: It's subjective.
Speaker 2: It's subjective as everything.  And there some areas where you might see 'em.  You might see 'em drilling, you might see 'em doing this or that or the other.  You might see 'em--okay?  Now, to begin with, I went--when I went into this thing, I had to room with a guy.  We were put into a cubicle about ten by twelve or less, you know?  Two of us, with cots, all our uniforms, 'bout a hundred or so manuals apiece, our weapons, all that sort of thing.  We had to live together.  Now, he had never seen a black man who did anything but open a door or shine a shoe.  His father was a big shot eastern lawyer.  He didn't wanna speak to me, at first.  He didn't and--but he found out.  We--you had to cooperate and graduate.  I mean it's difficult to do it on your own in a situation like that because there are so many aspects of where you--for example, you need a buddy who will be your demonstrator when you call out orders to do this, that and the other.  "Candidate so-and-so, do--assume such-and-such; do this, that, and the other," you know, all that kind of stuff.  Also, there may be some areas where you are weak and he is strong.  For example, I'd had calculus and all the math, trig [trigonometry], and all that kind of stuff, and we he had gunnery.  He had had none.  He needed me for that.  You know, just generally, you know, that kind of thing.  And when--to make a long story short, when this thing was over--and this is why I think that if this country is ever gonna make it--and I, and I believe it's gonna explode if we don't do this--if they don't break down the doggone residential segregation, that we're gonna explode because the only--or, if they don't figure some way for kids, if they get outta high school or something, to live with each other for a year or two or something, in service to the country or something like that--together, you know?  Because you don't know anybody, you know.  You don't know anybody when you just get these stereotypes that, that you see on television and, and all that sort of thing.  That is the junkiest stuff I've ever seen.  This guy took a chance on losing his commission for me after we got to know each other, and I did the same for him--
Story_ID: 186409
Speaker 1: Toward the end of the thing [Officer Candidate School], I was down takin' a shower and they, they had decided to give a party, and a big guy, a big hillbilly from Arkansas was in the shower, and he said, "Hey, I don't wanna see"--there were, there were only six blacks left--six blacks in the country--company.  "I don't wanna see any y'all niggers dancin' with white girls at this party."  Now, I might have--in spite of his size, I might have tackled him or done something, I don't know, had I not known that if you fight you get thrown out, you know?  So I used a little profanity and left, went up--went on back up.  So--went back up to my cubicle.  Well, Lonogan [ph.]--this is the guy--my, my cubicle mate's buddy's name--one of the guys came up and told Lonogan--told Lonogan about it, you know, was whispering to him.  Lonogan was in his Class A's getting ready to go out, and I saw him changing, you know, getting out of 'em.  I was wondering--I didn't know what the guy had said to him.  I wondered what he was doing.  All of a sudden, I heard all this commotion and Lonogan went down and beat the hell out of this kid--this guy.  He took a chance on losing his commission because the guy insulted me.  I mean that's the kind of stuff--you know, you can't--you can't teach that, that kind of thing.  People have to feel that, they have to--you know, you have to bond with somebody for 'em to, to do that sort of thing for you and, and I--I'll never forget that as long as I live.  And I saw other examples of that, you know, you--now that's small, relatively small, considering what you see.  I mean you can dramatize it and all that kind of stuff you see.  Television dramatizes it and all that kind of stuff but, make it real.  I mean people live together--the small things that--the everyday things count, and you get to know people on a day-to-day basis and you're another human being.  That's what you are, and we aren't gonna get to do that if we don't do something different in this country.  And it's gonna get--Hispanics now are numbering more than blacks and, and I may be stereotyping or saying the wrong thing, and with them tending to be a little bit emotional--more emotional in their approach to things, we could see a lot of problems, a lot of problems, unless we change the way we're doing things.
Story_ID: 186410
Speaker 1: How long were you in the [military] service?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years?  All right so you come out about '53 [1953]?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Came out in January of '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], okay.  And what did you do then?  Did you go back to school or--
Speaker 2: I came here, took a job in--as a research assistant at University of Illinois, in the research department at the University of Illinois Medical School [University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, were you married by then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was married before I went in.  I got married, and then two months later, they drafted me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were married throughout your--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your term of service in the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you met your wife [Ruby Stephenson] at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], or was it--
Speaker 2: I met her in kindergarten (laughter).
Speaker 1: Kindergarten, okay.  So you all were together all the way through school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I met her in kindergarten.  We--she left--at the Catholic school [St. Vincent de Paul School, Nashville, Tennessee], she left--actually, I--was the first--she left, went to public schools.  I used to play with her brothers even though they were in public schools and I was in Catholic school, and then when I went to, to public schools, I would see her, and she tells me now, "Why do you think I was the one who came to your house to sell Girl Scout cookies?"  She tells me I was--she had the loop on me for a long time (laughter).  But we started seeing each other our senior year of high school [Pearl High School, later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] and went to the prom together, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the way through Tennessee State and that was it.
Story_ID: 448849
Speaker 1: Okay, we're at 1954, you're back in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're a lab technician [at University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois] and you're involved with those rat pranks and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Rat pranks and thionyl chloride.  I--the other guy who was in on that prank was another creature of habit, and he would go in for his morning constitutional into the washroom at, at ten o'clock every morning, so I ran some wa- I put a water jug over the stall he always went to, and a tube, and all that do with thionyl chloride there.  I mean the tube had thi- the water jug had thionyl chloride in it, and all I had to do was run some water into it.  Well, water and thionyl chloride releases thick clouds of suffocating sulfur and (laughter) and when he was in there, I gave him time to get comfortable, and released a little, just a trickle of water into that.  Man (laughter), he came out and he didn't have his pants up (laughter).  He came out, "Who, who, who put tear gas in the john?"  (Laughter) He's out in the hall like this (laughter), and so, well, you know.
Speaker 1: So, did you usually--did people know who did these things eventually?  Did they find out who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, they knew. The first guy I didn't tell for a long time because he was really upset 'cause the police took him; kept him overnight in jail.
Speaker 1: With the rats okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the second guy, he--I let him--he knew.  We let him know right away, but they just know, don't mess with me, not if you--I mean if you wanna play pranks, you know--
Speaker 1: So you've got the ultimate pranks (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Story_ID: 448850
Speaker 1: So, how long did you serve as a research assistant [at University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: About four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so that takes us to '58 [1958] and this is when you decide to become a public school teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I was the--they were playing games with money and the people who--I was doing brain perfusion experiments, all kinds of intricate stuff.  I was the only guy who knew biochemistry and biophysics there, and had the knowledge and then the craftsmanship to put stuff together and all that kind of stuff, and they depended on me, you know, and everything, and yet money was always short.  We, we get to it, you know.  And also, I was the only American in the lab who spoke--I spoke four languages. I was the only American in the lab who could speak four languages, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You spoke German.  I know you took German in school, but what else?
Speaker 2: German, French, Spanish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: English.  I knew enough Russian and Japanese to get into trouble.  Not to get out, but to get in (laughter), and I read Portuguese and Italian, so--then I just felt--then, then they would hire--they wanted to hire a young kid from--who had just gotten his degree in chemistry, wanted me to train him, and they were gonna hire him at what I was makin', and I wouldn't even teach him the way--wanted me to teach him.  I wouldn't teach him the way to the john.  So, I said, "Let me outta here."  And so I wound up doing something that I--I really liked science.  That was what I loved, and I could have gone back into it.  There were about four places that I could have gone but I didn't wanna be stuck with that, or with somebody takin' my work and publishing it, which was another thing they did, without my name on it.  And the public school system kept--every time I really thought seriously about doing that, public school system gave me another challenge, a little bit more money, but the other challenge was really what--well, that and the money would always help.
Story_ID: 448851
Speaker 1: Did you have to take education courses to get into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I had to take education courses.  I had to take--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Took education courses and, and then the other thing was that--I don't know if you know it, but an [U.S.] Army officer has to do an awful lot of teaching, and it's--I mean in the Army, you teach.  There's more teaching done than on a lot of these campuses, and it's not just, "You're gonna die if I don't--if you don't learn this."  I mean you gotta really teach, I mean, 'cause you can't tell people, "You're gonna die but so long" (laughter), because they--they're gonna get bored by that.  You gotta teach 'em some other skills, you know, skills that, that will--that have--apparently have nothing to do with dying or living and, you know, that kind of stuff.  And so I started out--after I went to Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] and found out that there were no kids there who--not enough kids there to teach chemistry and, and algebra and that kind of stuff to.  But the guy who really kind of influenced me to come into teaching had me come to his elementary school and teach teachers how to, how to teach science and math, and the other thing was there was a bonus there.  They had a family of geniuses there.  The dummy had an IQ of 147.
Speaker 1: This is the slowest one of this family?
Speaker 2: The slowest one in that family had an IQ of 147.  The other two were off the scale.  This is the black family in the Forrestville area.
Speaker 1: The black (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, the name--the family name is Brown [ph.].
Speaker 1: Brown?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Would, would we know any of their names now, or can we--
Speaker 2: I know--the, the one with the IQ of 147 is supposed to be working in Washington, D.C. now.  I wonder where--what was his first name?  I--I can't think of it.  I'll probably think of it in a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the one kid never really adjusted.  He was, at that time, supposed to be in second or third grade and he just sat in a terrified teacher's room (laughter) and looked out the window and hummed, and she was scared to death of him.  And you know what he was doing?
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: He was plotting out, and renaming, and rerouting the streets in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Now, his sister was a more normal bright one, but she was extremely bright.  She, she went to--University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] wanted her but would not take the other two, so the mother wouldn't let 'em have either of 'em--any of 'em.  She said, "Take 'em all or you don't take any."  So, that was it.
Speaker 1: The Brown family?
Speaker 2: Brown family, yes.
Speaker 1: So--well, Forrestville school [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois] is on--is off of 47th [Street]?
Speaker 2: Forty-fifth [45th Street] and St. Lawrence [Avenue]--
Speaker 1: Forty-fifth [45th] and St. Lawrence, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's gone now.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, but it was a school that served a lot of the students that fed into, I guess, DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Fed into DuSable--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Forrestville High School [later, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois], which is now being sort of supplanted--I mean it's--they stopped the flow of neighborhood kids into that, and they're gonna try and make it a college prep school, bringing kids in from all over the city, but they're gonna have problems with that because of the gangs that are bound in the area.  It's like Lindblom, you know?  Lindblom was a great school, but getting kids into there--
Speaker 1: Into Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, into [Robert] Lindblom [Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, like--I had one son (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean the Englewood area, that neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. I had one son who we went to Lindblom.  Course he was an athlete and--but the athletes had to go in a bunch to get there 'cause the tough kids were from [William Rainey] Harper [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and all that they had to go.  My other son, he's the only kid I had who ever went to anything except public schools, and he wound up goin' to Mendel [Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 448852
Speaker 1: But the Forrestville area was near 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois] where there's a very--it was a big strip in those days--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of activity, businesses, black businesses on 47th Street.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Regal Theater is at 47th.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, and the guy--what's that guy's name [Frank Gillespie] who had that insurance company was it?
Speaker 1: Supreme Life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Supreme Liberty [Liberty Life Insurance Company, later, Supreme Life Insurance Company, Chicago, Illinois], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Liberty, yeah, and Fuller Brush (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Fuller, Fuller Brush, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Fuller Brush Company [sic., Fuller Products Company].  H.B., yeah.
Speaker 2: H.B. Fuller [sic., Samuel B. Fuller], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--now that area--and you drive down there now and you--I don't know what's going on down there now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it used to be a real jumping, you know, vital street in the black community.
Speaker 2: Well, now, you have--you're down in that area, you're getting close to the gap and--down there and, and lots of people--some people are buying some of those buildings and gutting 'em, and who knows what's gonna happen, but--
Story_ID: 448853
Speaker 1: When you were there [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], it was really jumpin' at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, and loaded--really loaded with people.  But there were seven thousand kids going to school in one square block there, with three gangs, and I was the, I was the guy who had to negotiate for them.  Gotta keep 'em from, you know, 'cause you had--that was a time when, you know, you had all this stuff about--well, it was black rage, really, not at that point.  And you had two white principals, one black woman principal, and one--well, you got three white men as principals, and one black woman, okay?  You had five black teachers.  You walked into this up--this junior high--well, this upper-grade center principal's office, white principal, "Tell him to keep his white butt out of black business.  Don't you come out of that office.  Don't you say anything.  Don't you be seen in the halls, don't you--you stay in that office and count paper clips, pick your nose, do whatever the board will pay you to do."  And he ventured out once, came to an assembly, they practically threw him off the stage, snatched the microphone, scared him to death.  So, I was a coordinator at the district office at that--at that time.  They sent me down from the district office ostensibly, as assistant principal.
Speaker 1: Now, this is around 1970 or so?
Speaker 2: This is 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay, '67 [1967], okay.
Speaker 2: They send me--sent me down as, as assistant principal.  The white assistant principal went out on sick leave that day, never came back.  There was supposed to be two of us.  The principal, shortly thereafter, went on illness leave, and he would come back from time-to-time, but I was running the building. I was, I was the principal then, really.  When he was there, if I were late coming in, or if I had to go someplace or something, he would lock himself in the vault 'til I got back.  He was that intimidated.  These teachers were taking the kids out of the building, taking 'em out, classes, whole groups of kids, to go to gang leaders' funerals.  Can you imagine what would happen if somebody shoots, you know?  And they--and that could have happened easily, another gang.  You had, you had four gang--three gangs there.
Speaker 1: What were the gangs?
Speaker 2: They were the [Gangster] Disciples, the Rangers--Blackstone Rangers [later, Almighty Black P. Stone Nation]--and the Warlords.  The Warlords commanded the approaches to the building.  They were in the projects right there next to 'em.  The Disciples had the, from the, from the north, and the Blackstone Rangers were from the south.  You--we (laughter) had a crazy cop there who came to me one day with a--an operations order--an operations order in the service is a--you've written up a--well, you've written up an operation where you're gonna go and kill or raid or do something against somebody--against an enemy.  That operations order said he was gonna get a thousand rounds of ammo and a rifle, and get up on a roof and shoot down some of those kids--shoot down some of those gangbangers.  Now, I called him Batman 'cause he--'cause I thought he was ba- had bats in his belfry (laughter).  He was nuts.  I said, "Are you crazy?"  And I told (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was this a white officer or a black officer?
Speaker 2: No, he was black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Crazy!  And I stopped him; I wanted him out of there.  I tried to get him transferred out but I didn't.  I told him, "You don't go out of this building until--unless I tell you, you know, for any reason."
Story_ID: 448854
Speaker 1: There were a lot of guns out there and there was a lot of shooting.  Now, ironically, those kids because I knew 'em, and see, I had--I had a couple of things going for me at, at that place [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], and at Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], which happened.  First, I was still a pretty good athlete.  I could throw that tight spiral, I knew how to throw a curve, and I could shoot the basketball, and at Dunbar, it was the piano and, and plus those.  I--and so the kids would, would watch my car for me and, you know, and I, I told 'em, "Look, if any--you--no guns.  If a couple guys get into a fight, into a fight, that's one thing, but if you gang up on anybody or if it's a gang thing, somebody is going to--is going to the place or if there's a gun."  And they knew it didn't matter what gang it was.  I didn't treat one gang differently than I did another.  That was the thing.  As long as they knew you were fair, it was all right so they gave me a name (laughter).  It was--they called me Underdog (laughter).  They said--it was like--when something happened, I'd come up out of the ground (laughter), and they really would try to protect me.  They would see a guy from another gang, you know, knew that around, and they would say, "Hey, look, that's Underdog.  You don't bother him, you leave him alone.  He's--he's the man around here, you know?"  Anyway, but what Jones [ph.] did--Jones was Batman's real name--tall cop about 6'2" or 3", he came out of the back door of the school one day, and there was a kid behind one of the mobile units looking across the playground at another kid, and he takes a shot at the kid--at another kid; this kid, one kid shoots at another on.  Jones yells, "Halt!" at this kid, and the kid turns around with his gun in his hand, and the gun goes off (laughter), and hits the wall behind Jones (laughter), scares Jones.  So, Jones goes for his gun.  The kid takes off running.  Jones goes running after him yelling, "Halt!" with his gun in his hand (laughter).  One of the other principals across the yard is coming out of his building (laughter) about that time, and the kid runs around, runs past that principal just as Jones fires a warning shot in the air (laughter).  The principal hits the, hits the ground, skins his knees, tears his pants up 'cause he thinks Jones is, is shooting at him, and Jones keeps running on by him, doesn't say anything to him.  He comes in to me, "Steve, Steve [HM Richard E. Stephenson, Jr.], has Jones lost his mind?  He's shooting at me."  It was just--that's just the kind of stuff you can laugh at now, but when he came in like that, I didn't know what had happened to him.  I saw Jones about six month ago.  He had just retired from the [Chicago] Police Department.
Story_ID: 448855
Speaker 1: From '58 [1958] to '70 [1970], you were a teacher [in the Chicago Public Schools], and you slowly, you know, moved up the ranks, right?  And you went to graduate school and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, all that time, all that time, I had the title teacher, but I was acting as an administrator.  I was either teaching teachers, or I was an acting assistant principal, or an assistant principal, or I was acting principal--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or I was a coordinator.
Speaker 1: So you did very little actually teaching in the classroom.
Speaker 2: I did--I maybe had--maybe I had two and a-half years of actual teaching in the classroom.  They'd snatch me because--I guess it was felt that I was able to, you know, do some things that they needed done.
Speaker 1: What was your interaction like with that Brown [ph.] family?  I just wanna go back to that for a second (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was great, it was great.  I--she was living--they were living over near the--over near 83rd [Street] and Lafayette [Avenue] recently.  Was it Raymond Brown [ph.]?  I'd like to follow up and see what they're doing now 'cause they are really, really something.  Their father had been a postal worker and I think he went to school and became a either an optician or a podiatrist or something like that, you know.  The woman, the woman--the mother, is the bright one though.  I think she's got so much nervous energy she can't, you know, you've seen these people that radiate energy?  She's it.  She just radiates energy.
Speaker 1: It's interesting now--so you were--you tutored them or guided them around for how long?
Speaker 2: I did.  I took the dummy, I took the dummy to a--when he was sixth grade, to a high school science fair.  I taught him to make an electric maze, and we ran rats on it and we also had another puzzle where kids could play Nem [ph.].  Do you know what Nem is?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It's a game.  Originally it was Chinese, a Chinese mathematical game that I used to use in the [U.S.] Army to beat all the other officers to get a steak dinner every night where you take fifteen objects and you make your opponent take the last object, and I don't get beaten at it (laughter).  And I had him wire this thing, you know, and he had that over at Hyde Park [Academy] High School [Chicago, Illinois] when Hyde Park was largely a majority high school, and lots of--the DS [district superintendent] at that time was a Jewish fellow named--I can't think of his name.  He started callin' on Yahweh.  He just said, "Yahweh," you know.  This kid is so bright he's--yeah, 'cause he was really good.  He was great.  He created this--created a sensational wave with those high school kids.
Speaker 1: Now, they went on to college, all of them I guess, or--
Speaker 2: No, the one boy, the old--the middle one, who didn't make an adjustment, was never able--he never was able to leave home, I don't think.
Speaker 1: That's the middle boy you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was off the scale, but I don't think--I don't think he--
Speaker 1: But he didn't have a social--
Speaker 2: The social skills.
Speaker 1: --skills, right.
Speaker 2: He didn't have the social skills.  The girl, I think, did well.  I think she may have even got married.  The older boy, I think, did well.  I know, I know he was in Washington, D.C. had a very good job, I understand.  I don't know exactly what he's doing or what he was doing it, so two out of three, but the boy--I saw the boy with the mother and he was, it was almost as if he were a--he--not a savant, but just out of it, kind of.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was sort of like an autistic person, or something like that or he had--?
Speaker 2: Almost, it seemed.
Speaker 1: He had--he was distracted--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --too, okay.  He--yeah, he was brilliant but not really able to--
Speaker 2: Couldn't relate to his world.

Speaker 1: How did you become principal at Forrestville [Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois]?  Well, I could see--almost see how you got--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--I had to deal with these rebellious teachers, and when they saw--when the community and the kids saw that I could, they wanted me.  And of course, the district superintendent wanted me because he sent me there, so when I became the acting principal there and then, of course, when I took the principal's exam and passed it, I--they assigned me there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and shortly after that, but every--almost everywhere I've gone in the school system [Chicago Public Schools; CPS], and 'course, maybe the school system itself was a series of crises 'cause it's--it seems to be in a crisis all the time.  But my experiences in the school system have been--has been a series of crises.  I left--I went into Forrestville as a--you know, as a result of a crisis.  I left Forrestville and went to Dunbar [High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] as a result of a crisis.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the crisis at Dunbar?
Speaker 2: The principal of Dunbar was promoted, and the assistant principal was made the acting principal for two years.  He assumed that he would pass the principal's exam.  They had to take an exam.  At the end of the two years, he took the exam and did not pass it for the fifth time.  He then got the teacher's--well, he, he upset the teachers, got them to petition, to get a lawyer, and insist that no principal be sent there, that instead, asked--demanded that he be made the director of the school, and had the kids telling Mrs. [Wendell E.] Green who, at that time, was a black board member, they would walk out if he were not made the principal.  And he told the guy who was supposed to be assigned there for the summer school session who was his buddy, who played poker with him every Friday night that the shop teachers would burn down the school (laughter) if he came there.  Dunbar was a tough school, and they knew it was a tough school because, as an example, at the strike just preceding this, there was an assistant principal who went into the school with the principal.  The teachers not only--and I guess these was shop teachers--they're the tough ones--they not only went to his home and painted his garage and slashed his tires and all that kind of stuff, but when he came back to school, they put a bloody hog's head on his desk.
Story_ID: 448857
Speaker 1: We were talking about a hog's head bein' delivered to a school [Dunbar High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A bloody hog's head was put on the man's desk.  Scared him to death.  He walked in and that thing was there, ball of blood and everything.  So, that's the kind of thing--so, knowing the kinds of things that those people would do, this guy was afraid, you know.  They--of how these people would react to his being assigned.  So, when--the first day of summer school of 1971, I wasn't going to be a principal.  It used to--in the past, principals weren't full-time principals, they were--they had to be hired for summer school.  Well, I was in charge of the neighborhood youth program, the whole--I had the whole North Side [Chicago, Illinois], and I would get my full pay.  If you were a summer school principal, you'd only get, I think, two-thirds of your pay.  Okay, so I thought I would work out of my office at Forrestville [Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois] so that I could do my bulletins and all that kind of stuff, you know, as I did my summer work, but that first morning, my private line rang, and a voice said, "Steve [HM Richard E. Stephenson, Jr.], are you busy?"  To which I rather profanely said, "Yes, I was," 'cause I was tryin' to--tryin' to get all these principals who were ducking and dodging all over the North Side.  The funds were being generated by minority kids, and the majority principals didn't want them.  They wanted the money but they didn't want the kids, so they were ducking around, you know, and I was having trouble locating 'em.  And so the voice then said, "Well, are you too busy to talk to Mr. [Julien D.] Drayton?," who was one of the top four guys in the system [Chicago Public Schools, CPS].  I thought maybe I could, you know, make it for him.  So I said, "Yeah, I can come."  He said, "Well, he's waiting for you."  I said, "I'll be right over."  So I got in my car and was driving, and all the way there I was wondering, what have I done now, you know?
Story_ID: 448858
Speaker 1: You see, the situations I've been in, or had been in all the time, was--well, let me tell you, in the [U.S.] Army, as well as in the schools, and almost anywhere, my feeling is that you don't follow the rule book as such.  If you have a situation, and what you wanna do is not illegal or immoral, or unethical, and if you're not expressly told not to do it, you can do it if that'll get the job done.  And sometimes it's unconventional and people are upset by it, but lots of times that's the only answer, and I found in the school system [Chicago Public Schools, CPS] especially, that's what you had to do.  For example, there was a time that--well, I found that teachers could not--teachers' efficiency ratings could not be lowered because they were late coming to work or because they didn't come to work often enough.  And I was told I couldn't lower a teacher's efficiency rating because that was part of the union contract.  It's crazy, on the face of it, but they had that in there, so I figured, I've gotta get around this.  So I said, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So the contract had been structured to--
Speaker 1: That's right, so--
Speaker 2: So you couldn't lower the efficiency rating by a contract.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, how do you evaluate 'em?
Speaker 1: So, what I did was--so, what I did was I lowered their rating, not because they were absent, or not because they were late, but because they interfered with the continuity of the pedagogical program, and I put that in writing.  And I said, if the union wants to fight that with the legal department, I told--and I wrote that to the legal department--"You can fight it."  And, you know--you know what the community would have done with that, don't you?  Everybody would have, you know, they'd have been, you can't fight that.  They changed the contract.  They had to change the contract, and they made that language part of the contract (laughter).  I mean that's the kind of stuff I've done.  They--I'm known as the Creative Rebel, by the way (laughter).  In the system, I'm known as the Creative Rebel.
Story_ID: 448859
Speaker 1: I'm wondering, What have I done now, 'cause I don't know what I'm--why I'm being summoned to [Julien D.] Drayton's.  So I get there and he's standing at the door waiting for me, and that scared me 'cause he was a very busy man, and you always had to wait half an hour, forty-five minutes for him, and he says, "Come on in, Steve [HM Richard E. Stephenson, Jr.]."  I went in and he said, "Steve, you better sit down 'cause I don't know how to tell you want I'm gonna tell you."  "Oh God, I didn't pass the principal's exam after all," and he, he says, "Steve, a man who was supposed to report to Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] is refusing to report, and I wanted to know if you'll take the job."  Out of all the stuff I'd heard about Dunbar about--I mean some really tough things--the thing I told you about, and somebody who carried a gun there, and somebody--you know, some other stuff.  And sometimes your brain is disconnected from your mouth, and I said, "Yeah, I'll take it."  He said, "You will?"  I say, "Yeah."  He said, "You know you won't get your full pay."  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You'll still take it?"  I said, "I said, yeah."  He said, "You're a smart so-and-so, aren't you?"  (Laughter) He said, "Why?"  I said, "Well, Mr. Drayton, you--I've worked for you for a few years, and I know you aren't gonna let me get hurt but so, so bad."  He said, "You're really a smart so-and-so--okay."  So he picked up the phone and called, and had me report--
Story_ID: 448860
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to go to Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Career Vocational Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Because I kind of knew what was goin' on there. I--there was a guy--I was bowling at the time, and there were two people in that bowling league who used to come in every Friday, one was a woman and one was a man, and would come in swearing, I mean just come in, and I could just--you know, and they'd just tell, what is--you know--what this guy was doing.  And he was playing his cards wrong.  He was being absolutely autocratic, and they brought a couple of his bulletins, and he was a guy who was very patrician-looking, and who wanted to use polysyllabic words, but--who was the guy in 'Amos 'n' Andy' who--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're talkin' about the attorney, Algonquin J. Calhoun, I think.
Speaker 2: Calhoun, who--this guy used duplicitous and thought it meant, meant multiple copies (laughter).  You know, he actually did that--that kind of stuff.  So I knew, you know, what was going on.  So that, that's the kind of stuff I was talking about.  I mean they needed somebody there who could, who could deal with that.  The other thing was that I felt I had the, the broad kind of background that would serve me well there, and would serve the school well.  Okay, I've got languages; I've got three languages that I can speak well and English.  They needed somebody who could speak language--English and interpret it, and would put it on line to the staff and students.  I'm a musician, I grew up in the trades.  I mean my dad [George Thomas] was, you know, was, you know, and I--he went to a foundry at Lane Tech [Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].  That's where he retired from, and when he was in Nashville [Tennessee] before he left, he did contracting work and I worked for him there.  So, I--I've been a painter, a cabinetmaker.  I've done a little bit of all that sort of thing--everything except plastering, plumbing, my--I wouldn't do electrical work as a contractor but I've done brick lay, and I took brick masonry in high school [Pearl High School, later, Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee].  That was part of it, you know.  So, I know enough to look at it and, you know, just enough.  I don't pretend to be those things, but I know enough about 'em, and I do know electronics.  I've been--I did electronics in the lab.  I, I've done--you know.
Story_ID: 448861
Speaker 1: So I went in [Dunbar High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and the first--that first day--and this was summer school.  The district superintendent accompanied me there that afternoon before--and--to meet the teachers, and I just said to them, "I'm just your summer school principal, and I won't get to know you very well, unless you're up for retirement, but I hope I'll get to know you a little better than I normally would, as I meet you on your hall guide posts and as I read your lesson plans."  And that's it, you know.  I said, thank you and let 'em go.  Well see, he thought that was great.  He says, "Oh, I can't believe it."  He said, "You told 'em they're gonna have to stay in a hall guide post, and they're gonna have to turn in lesson plans, and you didn't say, 'You better do this, you better'"--I said, "No, that's not necessary. You don't have--there are lots of ways you can tell people to do things."  And see, that's what I mean.  This other guy had been, you know--that's what I mean about--a different kind of approach, that's all.  They'd been used to this steel fist, which you didn't always know where it was gonna hit, all that kind of thing.  And the next--and as soon as he had gone, a couple of my assistants came in and said, "You know, there's a guy here who's--we got a problem."  I said, "What is it?"  "There's a guy here who's not supposed to be here.  He's not--his shop is supposed to be closed and he's got it open."  I said, "Well, where is he?"  "Oh, he's gone.  When the principal didn't come, he left but he'll be back."  I said, "Well, okay, give me a yearbook."  So I got a yearbook and I memorized all those faces.  I--this was a pornographic memory, not photographic (laughter).  And I did, I memorized all the faces, and the next morning, I was trying to greet people, you know, as they came in.  About nine o'clock, they came running to me, "Ahh, he's here!  He's here!  And he's got a bunch of kids and at shop and their hands!"  There's this one assistant who had been--the superintendent had been the principal of the school for two years.  I said, "Mr. Foot [ph.]?"  He said, "I can't help you, I can't help you 'cause he and I don't even speak."  I said, "What?"  This guy's been principal of the school for two years and doesn't speak to a teacher?  I said, "I'm not asking you to handle it.  I don't know the way to the shop, and I want you to go with me 'cause I may need a witness to see, you know, what goes on."  So, we started down there, and on the way--you know, you walk on the right side of the hall.  On the way down, I'm on--we're on the right side--he's on the right side coming to meet us.  There, like a couple of silly women looking away from each other, and my good assistant principal doesn't tell me that this is the guy, and of course, I knew it was, and I said, This guy isn't helping me (laughter), but I didn't wanna see him then.  I wanted to go back to the shop and see what was going on.  I went down there, and a bunch of guys down there with dark glasses on.  At that time, you had veterans in the shops and all that kind of stuff, beards and everything.  I said--I went in there like little goody-two shoes will.  "Fellas, what's goin' on here?  Where's Mr. [Lovell] Roebuck?"  "He ain't here."  And then stony silence.  I said, "Well, if he comes back, you tell him to come up to the office.  I'm Mr. Stephenson [HM Richard E. Stephenson, Jr.]; send him up to me and blah, blah."  Went on back.  I waited ten minutes.  "All right, Mr. Foot, we're goin' back.  Gimme your keys."  I went back, I threw the door open, then I let loose with my command voice and a couple of nice words.  "All right, get outta here!  If you're not outta here in two minutes, you're goin' to jail.  If somethin' happens to you, I'd have a lawsuit and I'm not takin' any lawsuit and"--they get on their feet and they don't know what to do.  "Did you hear me?"  And then--you know, the brain is a funny thing.  Underneath those bushes, I saw a couple of kids I knew from Forrestville [Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois].  I said, "Branson [ph.], what are you doin' here?  You know me, what are you"--"Aww, Mr. Stephenson, I, I--you know I wasn't gon'--Mr. Roebuck payin' our fees, so we"--you know.  See, if he pays their fees, he's gonna make over three thousand dollars in the summer if he has the shop open.  And then I saw another one.  I said, "You guys come on with me to the office."  Well, there are five of 'em there but I know two of 'em.  The others aren't gonna run because I know two of 'em and they'll tell me who the--who they are.  So I--"Come on, we're going."
Story_ID: 448862
Speaker 1: Now, one thing about [Lovell] Roebuck is--and see, I found this out about that place [Dunbar High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] too, those shop teachers were beatin' those kids--some of 'em, and Roebuck was one of 'em.  Roebuck was about 6'4", weighed about 260, and everybody was afraid of him, everybody, teachers, everybody.  So, I started back, and as we're goin' back along the hallway, Roebuck is coming along and he sees these kids.  Well, see when--he had told 'em to stay in there, and they don't dare leave when Roebuck tells 'em not to 'cause he will beat them.  As he--I came alongside them, I ran along--ran up and grabbed his hand like this, "Mr. Roebuck, my name is Stephenson [HM Richard E. Stephenson, Jr.], I'm the new principal here.  Come with me--to the office with me."  "But those kids."  "Come with me, I, I've taken care of them, you come with me--to the office with me" (laughter).  And he, came to, with me to the office, and I said, "Well, now, what seems to be the matter?"  "These, these, these people don't treat me right."  I said, "Look," 'cause I had looked him up.  I said, "Look, you're an intelligent man.  You're makin' thirty-two thousand dollars a year."  I can still remember this.  This is 1971. Thirty-two thousand dollars in '71 [1971] was a nice piece of money--makin' thirty-two thousand dollars a year--that was without summer school pay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was doin' well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, thirty-two thousand dollars a year, and you're gonna give all this up so you can call somebody an MF?  He says, "Well, if you tell me not to, I won't."  It was that simple.  I said, "I'm tellin' you not to.  Now, let me tell you what's"--you know.  I had no more trouble with that man.  I got him to do things that he had never done for anybody.  He was just--nobody had ever--you know.  He was just--I caught him off-balance, admittedly (laughter), but that's part of it, you know?  You play their game--you play--don't play it their way, play it differently.
Story_ID: 448863
Speaker 1: And then there were, you know, others.  All these guys were different.  The music teacher--the band teacher came in during summer school.  He wasn't working summer school, and he came in--and I was in the lobby talking to some teachers.  He says, "Is your name Stephenson [HM Richard E. Stephenson, Jr.]?"  And I said, "Yeah."  He said, "I'm gonna check you out.  I hear you think you can play some music."  And he turns and leaves, you know?  And, you know, I'm doin' a slow burn (laughter).  So I laid for him.  The next time he came into the building, about three or four days later--I, I watched for him for three or four days.  And I waited 'til he got into the lobby and, you know, 'til there were some people around.  I said, "Are you"--I went out and I loud-talked him.  "Are you [Willie] Naylor?"  "Yeah."  I say, "You got your axe with you?"--you know, your horn?  "Yeah."  I said, "Go get it."  He said, "What, what?"  I said, "You go get it.  I'm gonna find out what you can do."  I tell everybody, "Come on, we're gonna go find out what this guy can do.  We're gonna check--take him out on his changes."  And we went down to the music room.  Well, now, I, I ran him through some changes, you know, both classical and jazz.  I was just runnin' changes, but--and he, he was blowing flat before I left (laughter).  We've been friends ever since.  But it was just, it's dirty pool, but you gotta win sometimes (laughter). Yeah, enough bragging.
Speaker 2: Well--so, you had to, you know, kind of get creative in the school somehow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--you know, you have to do, I think, differently.  If you do all--well, in schools, I, I say if you do, if you do the same old things that you've always done, you're gonna get the same old things you've always gotten.  You have to do some different kinds of things, and in terms of dealing with people, you need to get their attention, and sometimes that means let him think that they've gotten you or, I mean, I don't mind letting 'em think they've gotten me.  For example, any--almost any of my teachers will tell you that I don't mind what they say because all of 'em know when the deal goes down, it's all about the kids, you know?  And if they come in--come on into the office, they can really say what they wanna say in that office if, you know, as long as it's, you know, right for the kids.  But it's gotta be right for the kids.
Story_ID: 448864
Speaker 1: Now, how long were you principal at Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Seventeen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you must know Mr. James I. Cage.  I know you know him.
Speaker 2: Cage?  Yeah, he came after I left.  But Cage I knew from the right--from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], and he came in--he and I--Old Blue-Eyed Cage (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, he's not a teacher just to tell people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --people who are listening to this.  He's a man who--a community man--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who, basically just kind of adopted Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He, he was quite a guy.  He, he was on the West Side when I first met him, and then he came to Dunbar after I left, but he and I had a--we had a pretty good relationship.
Speaker 1: He was a book distributor for years, all over the Midwest and the South and--
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  That's his other life that people don't know about (laughter).  We met him in other cities.  I mean people know him all over the Midwest.
Speaker 2: I had no idea.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I always wondered what he did.  Cage kept that secret from me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Yeah, I think--wasn't Jimmy Tillman in the music department over there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--no, he was--he may have been--he came in a couple of--he used to sub for me sometimes.  He's a drummer.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He and I met and, as a matter of fact, I think he did a gig with me one time--might have.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's blues drummer and was always involved in the shows of Black Ensemble Theater up on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 448865
Speaker 1: Were you able to change conditions at Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] while you were there?  I mean really, was that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We--while I was there, we were rated by the California State Department of Education--an outfit hired by the state--California State Department of Education, that was evaluating nationally.  We were rated as one of the top eleven schools of our kind in the country two or three times.  I think I might--I--oh, man, I didn't--I should of put that in--I'll have to ask my wife [Ruby Stephenson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that's something, that's good for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Chicago [Illinois].  The city, as a whole, was sort of suffering, I guess, in terms of a rating, I think, in those days, you know, so--so you were exceeding, I guess, what the expectation would be for Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Right.  They were on--they were--the newspapers, front page, or somewhere prominent in the newspapers in those days.  We used to get a lot of publicity, and we were always a school at that time, that--people always wanted to meet there, to you know, to--for, for a couple of things, for a couple of reasons.  One was that we were--I guess we were easy to get to.  Another was that there would be no trouble.  They knew there would be no trouble, ever.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of fundraisers were held at Dunbar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and events, concerts and things, right--that's true.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you left--any other stories about Dunbar you wanna tell before you--
Speaker 2: Well, we did a--well, with the jazz band we used to--we used to go play for people in jail, people in hospitals, people, you know, you know, who needed some kind of lift.  We made a record that sold like crazy.  We--I still get calls for it sometimes.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.  I'll get it for you before you leave (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I've got, I've got a copy of the record.  Dunbar in Concert, maybe or something like that, but it did some nice stuff like 'Little Darlin'.'  Some nice, some nice jazz pieces.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was on piano and the rest of it was kids and--and the bandmaster played trumpet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The rest of 'em were all kids.
Story_ID: 448866
Speaker 1: You were in Chicago [Illinois] during a lot of the desegregation turmoil from, I guess, the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], all the way through the '70s [1970s], I guess.  You were talkin' before, off-camera, about the struggle, in terms of real estate and, you know, your own personal struggle in terms of buying a house and being able to use the facilities in the neighborhood and so forth, and public schools were going through a lot of turmoil in the '60s [1960s] with the Willis Wagons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Willis Wagons.
Speaker 1: --and all of that.  Now, can you--did you--you know, what did you think of all that, and how did you act in all that?
Speaker 2: I thought it was absolutely ridiculous.  We--I had small children at that time, and we moved into--where I formerly lived, 8836 Calumet [Avenue], and so my kids went to [James E.] McDade [Elementary School, later, James E. McDade Classical School, Chicago, Illinois] which was, you know, right in back of us.  But when they got a little older, they had to go to Burnside [Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois], which had a principal who was really under fire, and there was still a problem with, with--we--let me just get the setting here.  When we moved in, they'd built all these new homes in that section, and we were almost surrounded by Eastern European people, by Polish people, as a matter of fact, and it was oil and water, you know.  And they were old--
Speaker 1: Just finish that sentence.
Speaker 2: --they were older, and they were of a different culture, and there was just no, no mixing, and just didn't work.
Story_ID: 182544
Speaker 1: --We were talking about some of the housing problems.  You were in a--you say you moved into--when you moved to 88th [Street] and Calumet [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], you were in the Eastern European neighborhood and had some problems using facilities, I think.
Speaker 2: Yes, the--I guess the differences in age and culture--most of the families that moved in were younger families with young children, and let's say a different cultural outlook, and we moved in with, with a group of people who were older and who--with whom we didn't react--didn't, didn't interact and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would it be true to say, from what I've heard you say, that the class that was moving in, the black class, was a professional class, basically.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Young--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --moving in, and the class that was there was older, white group that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Older and more blue-collar.
Speaker 1: Yeah, blue-collar, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that would--and that's--you know, that, I found, has always produced more profound differences and more trouble than color or anything else.  Class and culture--class, essentially--always does.
Speaker 1: So, there's a lot--resentment on more than one level.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.

Speaker 1: The Willis Wagons--
Speaker 2: Now, those are named for [Benjamin] Ben Willis who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ben Willis, who started using these mobile units, and so they named them after him.
Speaker 2: He was superintendent of the schools [Chicago Public Schools, CPS], right?
Speaker 1: He was superintendent of schools and he was a very strong superintendent.
Speaker 2: This is during the late '60s [1960s], I guess, right?
Speaker 1: This was the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Fifties [1950s] and late--'50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s].  He had to leave--let's see, when did he leave?  He left just before--he left just before the '70s [1970s], just late '60s [1960s] he left.
Speaker 2: So he was there--basically, he was the superintendent that was contemporaneous with the first Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, right?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And he was--he was a man who brooked no resistance of any sort with--from a board member or community group or anything.  He did what he wanted to do and in spite of whatever anybody said, you know.  He, he was his own man.  He did what he wanted to do, and that was ultimately his undoing.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened?
Speaker 1: I think things just grew, and grew, and grew, and grew.  It was like an--like an acorn (laughter) grows to, to, to an oak and, and people had just had enough.  He had to go.
Speaker 2: His wagons were designed, were they not, to contain the overflow of students in the black community when, you know, when--I guess when the city [Chicago, Illinois] was trying to keep the black community within a certain geographical area, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was at least the feeling of, of many black people.  The--Willis was a hard man to read at times.  There were some, some good things about him and--for example, you knew what the plan was with him in terms of--as an administrator.  You knew, all right, you're at this stage, here's what you're expected to do, then you'll go to this stage, which is where you'll do this, and then you'll go to this stage--then, you know, and then this.  Nowadays, you might--because of the way things are done, you might have a woman--a person, a person who is a classroom teacher now, today and tomorrow might be the principal of the most complex building--complex school in the city, which bodes ill for that school and that's--there--you know, here--many of this might happen again.  About three years ago, you only had about 20 percent of all the principals in the city that had three or--had three years of experience, and it's almost like that again.
Story_ID: 182546
Speaker 1: Administrators need some experience.  It doesn't mean that experience is the be-all or end-all because sometimes, a young new guy can come in and boy, that's what's needed, and he--and he doesn't have to have a lot of experience.  For example, if he's eclectic enough in his outlook, he can do all kinds of things, you know.  You don't have to be old or--but so old to--just--with administrators, a base of knowledge of, you know, of your craft, and a good personality, will get you over--will do it.  Having the personality that will let you inter- interact with people on a reasonable level, and knowing something about your craft, knowing your craft and willing to learn and that sort of thing, and willing to win some, lose some, you know, that sort of thing, that'll do it, but so often now, and especially with the way things are now, it's gone crazy.
Story_ID: 182547
Speaker 1: Now, you went on from becoming principal of Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] to district superintendent, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) District superintendent, yes.
Speaker 1: And maybe we can explain--there was something you were explaining off-camera about the handling of funds.  Maybe we should talk about that first, and then I'm gonna ask you some questions about the--what's going on now, as opposed to what went on when you were in administration.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Many, many years ago, as opposed to now, principals had no idea about accounts.  I mean about their own internal accounts.  They didn't know what was going on.  And I have to say I, I--because of my [U.S.] Army training, I knew about internal accounts because if you're in the Army, you better be aware of those accounts or you may be charged for a cannon (laughter), or an aircraft or something that's gone astray.  You'd better keep up with those accounts.  When I first arrived at Dunbar, I was being charged for seven clerks and I had four, and I tried to find out what--where are these three clerks?  And I couldn't get an answer, and I kept on.  And after about the fourth inquiry, I did something I knew I'd get my hands smacked for, but I thought it would be effective.  I not only jumped over my district superintendent, but I jumped over my area superintendent to the general superintendent.  I got my hand slapped, but I got an accounting, and as a result of this, there also came a formula for clerks, so I did the whole system [Chicago Public Schools, CPS] a favor and I also got another clerk.  I got a fifth clerk, I got that--those other two clerks taken off my books, and so forth--you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Now, you realize what you're doin' here?  You're really--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --making trouble for the system (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, no, no, no, no, no because if I'm gonna be charged with a clerk, charge me with it, but make me--but let me have it.
Speaker 1: Now, where do you suppose that the money for those extra clerks was going?  Where was that money going, if it wasn't going for clerks at Dunbar?
Speaker 2: They were--there may have been two extra clerks somewhere at the central office, or at some district office, or at some school where they shouldn't have been, or something like that, or they may not have been clerks.  They may have been--gone into the salaries of some, some job that should not have existed, but the point is, the powers-that-be had the power to create a position and fund that position if necessary--if it's a necessary position, but don't charge me with it because if I'm audited, they're gonna say, "Where are these clerks?"  And I'm gonna say, "I don't know," and then I'm in the soup.  So, that's the thing.
Story_ID: 182548
Speaker 1: So in this way, the whole system [Chicago Public Schools, CPS] got to know, here are the rules; if you have so many staff, you'll have so many clerks.  If you have so many, such-and-such a number of administrators, you have so many clerks, you know, that kind of thing.  And that's the way it should be.  There should be a clear understanding of what staff, you know, what staffing organizations consist of.  Now, going on with that, in the past, quite a--well, sometime ago, staff in, in the central office did not function as staff.  Staff are supposed to be support people, they're not line.  There's a difference between line and staff.  Again, as an [U.S.] Army officer I'm keenly aware of that.  The line has the power. The staff supports the line, makes it possible for them to function.  The staff does the little stuff that makes it possible for me to get my job done.  Now, I tell my--I tell my people in the school [Dunbar High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], as a principle, "I want you to think of me as a big-time, big-time super teacher aide.  I'm makin' it possible for you to get your job done.  You tell me what you need, I'm going to see what I can do about gettin' it for you."  That's my job, 'cause if you don't get the job done, I haven't gotten my job done.  And that's what we're all about.  We're all about--not about me sittin' here in a desk lookin' good, we're about you teachin' that kid to read, or teachin' that kid to do math, or teachin' that kid history or language or, or music or whatever.  If that doesn't get done, all this other stuff is crap, and the same thing--with all those people downtown, they aren't down there to juggle funds and all that kind of stuff, they're there to get--put those funds in the best place to make me able to do what I need to do for these teachers here.  Now, in the past, those--a long time ago, those staff people functioned as line.  They would tell the principals what to do.  That's not the way.  They might say to--now, you might say to a principal, "Here's what's available," or "here's why--here's the formula," or you know, explain it, something like that.  I mean principals can't call the shots, you know, all that kind of stuff.  But, no, no, not the way it used to be.  And that thing I was saying to you about the superintendent--assistant superintendent for voc. ed [vocational education], my kids at Dunbar generated a tremendous amount of money.  He told me he wanted to take some of that money and do something else with it.  I told him, "No.  My kids generated it because they needed it, so no, it had to come to me."  And we needed it and we got it.
Story_ID: 182549
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a public perception--you hear conservative columnists always talkin' about it, that there's this deluge of federal funds, you know, for poor communities, and it's--somehow, it's wasted, you know, and the implication is that it goes everywhere--it goes to--I mean no matter how much money you pour on these problems, it's not gonna solve 'em, but the money doesn't really get absorbed by the problem areas a lot of times.  Is that true?  Would you agree with that?  I mean the moneys that would usually come in at Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinos], or a place in the inner-city, are oftentimes siphoned off to other things.
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you this--I went to Washington [D.C.] a few years back to testify at a [U.S.] Senate hearing.  The reason was that I was trying to get alcohol and drug money to come directly to the city [Chicago, Illinois], to come to the schools, or at least to the [Chicago] School Board instead of going to the state because if it goes to the state, they will apportion some of it out to some farmer to put a bridge over his pig farm, or whatever, before it gets to me, and that's the kind of stuff that goes on.  They siphon money off when it goes through all these places.  Why should it go to the state?  It should come directly to where it's needed and that's what happens.  Now, in terms of it coming to the poor kids, it's hard to say if it's always used appropriately.  I'm not sure that you can always say that, but I'll say this.  People of means have kids who can come home and look at books, who can look up things on the Internet, who can--who have resources, who can travel.  People of means--look, when you travel, that alone is an education.  People of means have to understand that, and perhaps they don't know that, but they should.  People without means need every break that they can get, and maybe there needs to be a breakdown so that people can see exactly what's goin' on with that money and--at the local level, so that they know that there's none wasted.  Let me give you an example.  Some of the rules make you waste money, for example.  Some of the Title II money--ESEA [Elementary and Secondary Education Act] Title II money, mandated that you use it only for Title II kids.  Okay, let's suppose that the money was--brought a play into the school, and you've got an auditorium there.  Why can't you have as many kids as you want in that play?  Technically, only the Title II kids should come in there.  Why not have as many kids as you can come in there?  You haven't--you haven't cheated, you haven't--you know, by bringing kids in.  I mean are they siphoning any of the play off?  I mean that kind of stuff.  Those are some--there are some stupid rules that they apply.  You know, sometimes you have a half-empty hall or you--you know, that kind of stuff, you know.  They do ridiculous things.
Story_ID: 182550
Speaker 1: When you left Dunbar [High School, later, Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], you went on to become a district superintendent, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, with fifty-nine schools.
Speaker 1: And what district would that be?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Well, first was District 11 with twenty--with twenty-six schools--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that was down in the area near Dunbar, not too far from Dunbar, Back of the Yards [Chicago, Illinois] and all.  Well, not Back of the Yards, around Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois] and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then, District 9, Southeast out here, fifty-nine schools from the Lake [Michigan] to the Dan Ryan [Expressway], and from roughly 67th [Street] to the city limits, with doglegs in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what were some of the highlights of your service as a district superintendent?
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).  Well, that was a period of--again, I, when I went to, to District 9--
Speaker 1: This is--what year is this now?  This is in the '80s [1980s], right or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is '88 [1988] to '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989], in particular. Eighty-eight [1988] was a year that was, wasn't too bad but '89 [1989] and '90 [1990], and maybe--and part of '91 [1991].  I inherited a district that was made up of two districts, which had been, I won't say largely neglected but I'll say which had been, in my opinion, not given the best of care in some areas.  For example, I found racism rampant in some areas among principals.  I found laziness among some principals.  Let me give you some examples.  I'm just gonna name some things.  There was one principal whose--who, in whose family that principalship had been only--that school had only been in his family, and only three principals had been there, okay?
Speaker 1: Now, where--I don't know if you should name the person, but--you can if you want, but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Southeast [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Is it a school on the Southeast side?
Speaker 2: Southeast side, and it's the largest school on the Southeast side, the largest elementary school on the Southeast side, and it has Latinos.  And the principal was a dipsomaniac.
Speaker 1: Was a what?
Speaker 2: Dipsomaniac, a drunk.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And he made no bones about it.  I mean he, for example, lost about--well, he would have lost $750,000 if I hadn't done something to keep him from doin' it, but he lost a significant amount of money because of--because he didn't comply with stuff 'cause he was out drinking or out, anyway.  I had to--oh, I just suspended him, and rode him until he resigned, okay?  Got a--and that--this is where this was a miracle, got a young woman in there who has done well.  I was surprised.  I frankly was afraid that--'cause she was so young and inexperienced, I just--but she was an exception that proves the rule, and she was just a teacher, but it was a big elementary school, which is not as complex as a high school, and she's done well.
Story_ID: 182551
Speaker 1: I had another case where there was a principal who had two small schools where he had never--where they had never, in the twenty or so years that he'd been there, had a single assembly, or he--and he had never collected lesson plan books, and when I got him--rid of him, the principals who came in behind him caught bloody hell from the teachers who were unused to any kind of discipline, or any kind of requirement from the principal.  One principal did very, very well.  She was able to turn things--the other one caught it.  She was just not--okay?  Okay, that's two.  There was one school where the guy--I had to leave my home at Christmastime to go over and talk to the Hispanics.  They were ready to riot almost because this idiot had taken a thirteen year-old girl and was putting her in the second grade because she had just come in from Mexico and couldn't speak the language.  He was putting her in the second grade.  He also had a storeroom full of supplies that had just turned rotten with--I mean he just wouldn't let the teachers have supplies or anything--just--and he was just--he had to go.
Speaker 2: Was there any reason for them--him not lettin' teachers have supplies?
Speaker 1: He's--that's just his personality.  There are lots of guys--lots of people who--I'm doing it because I can do it because I am, I'm in charge.  He--this guy was the same guy who took a black guy as his assistant because he felt that that would take some pressure off him, and put him down in the basement at a door, and wouldn't (laughter), wouldn't let him do any--do anything as a, as an assistant, and wouldn't let him relate to--
Speaker 2: This is on the Southeast side [Chicago, Illinois], too?
Speaker 1: This is the Southeast side.  This--then, I had another who wouldn't call--okay, you know, I mean, I'm not hung up on titles, okay?  But if you're hung up on, on yours, then okay, I'll be hung up on mine.  This guy had a doctorate [degree], and when I found out that my predecessor, who also was African American, he would not call him Doctor, okay?  Also, when I got there, he had sent the police to a student's home with such a vivid picture of this guy that the police approached this guy's home with drawn guns with his son there.  This guy was absolutely vitriolic and, you know, he--I mean he's, you know.  And this guy had no--well, at any rate--and he would not give information about, about how principal selection was supposed to be done.  So the--it, it turns out that the local school council chairman is--was a woman who played tennis in the park there at Tuley [Park, Chicago, Illinois], and I played tennis at Tuley, and she knew me, and she's a younger, a younger woman but she knew me and, and she, you know--so she called me.  She said, "I can't get this guy"--you know.  I said--he--I knew he held a meeting every Friday, a teachers meeting every Friday, and the teachers didn't know what to do, you know.  I said, "Tell him you want him to invite me to your meeting," but he didn't do it.  She called me saying, "He won't do it."  So I called him and said, "I want you to invite me--I asked that you invite me to the meeting, but since you didn't do it, I'll be there.  I'll be there Friday.  Put me on your agenda."
Story_ID: 185972
Speaker 1: So, on the following Friday, I was there at the meeting.  He introduced me as Mr. Stephenson [HistoryMaker Richard E. Stephenson, Jr.], and of course, I started to explain the [principal selection] process, and about--as soon as I started to explain, he interrupted me.  He said, "Mr. Stephenson, so-and-so-and-so-and-so-and-so."  And I noticed that the black teachers looked at each other and punched each other, and I thought, Oh, yeah, that's right, this guy refused to call [William] Bill Finch, Dr. Finch.  And so, I said, "Okay."  So I addressed this guy as Charlie [ph.].  "Oh, Charlie--listen, Charlie, you so-and-so-and-so-and-so."  He was--and he is Dr. Charles--I've forgotten his last name.  Oh, man, that killed him.  The teachers just--you could see 'em, you know, light up, and we, you know, I did this several times.  Well, there was no more of that.  At any rate, I told them.  The next night was the--the next Tuesday night was the council meeting.  I've never seen a council meeting like that.  I went in--
Speaker 2: It's a local school council meeting [for Chicago Public Schools; CPS].
Speaker 1: Local school council meeting for principal selection.  I went in--dead silence, and a auditorium full of people.  Nobody talkin' to anybody.  And when they wouldn't talk to--you know, they weren't--even the council members weren't talkin'.  So I got up and I explained to the council, and to the people that this is the most important thing that a council, council could do, select their principal that, you know, if you don't do it, I have to do it, and after all, you're gonna be with this person for the next four years, and you don't want me to select who you're gonna be sleeping with for the next four years.  Well, that got their attention.  They voted him out ten-nothing.  As I left, couple of--one of the council--well, I'd better not tell that.  That's kind of bawdy.
Story_ID: 185973
Speaker 1: What did you think about school reform under [Mayor] Harold Washington [in Chicago, Illinois] with the local school councils and such, and that's--I know that's--it's worked some places and hasn't worked in others.  What do you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Now, I don't think they're as powerful as they used to be.
Speaker 2: Well, school reform, you know, in my opinion, is not the way it should be.  If you--it is all--many of the things it shouldn't be.  If you wanna see how it was--if you want--had wanted to see how it would be, you should of referred to Ocean Hill-Brownsville in 1969 in New York [New York].  That district is still suffering from that.  Everybody fought everybody.  There was corruption, there's all--there are all the things that went wrong.  I predicted this stuff and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you think that local school councils are not a good idea.
Speaker 2: Local school councils are a good idea, but I think they should be advisory, not the last word on selection of the principal because there are too many things that happen in terms of--I can cite too many instances that--and I predicted this on Florida legislature in 1988 or--yeah, '87 [1987], '87 [1987] or '88 [1988].
Story_ID: 185974
Speaker 1: Tell us about how you became a school superintendent--or interim superintendent in [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, I was--actually, I was kind of surprised.  Three years prior to that, I got a call when I was district superintendent, and--from one of the television people, and he asked if I could--if he could come interview me, and I said, "For what?"  He says, "Well," he, he told me that--and this was when Mr. Kimbrough was being touted.
Speaker 1: That's Ted Kimbrough.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He said, "I was told that if they want to--want a superintendent that you ought to be the one that they"--and I said, "Well, I didn't apply for the job."  He said, "Yeah, but I'd like to come and talk to you."  Well I said, "No."  He said, "Yeah, but can I even talk to you?"  So I--he did.  I let him come and talk, and he interviewed me and put me on television.  This was three years prior to that.  Well, 'course my phones lit up like Christmas tree.  Well, when Ted Kimbrough came, there were two people that he didn't trust, me and [Robert] Bob Saddler.  He didn't trust me because my council voted against him, voted a law--we were filing a lawsuit against him really, with which I had nothing to do, and Bob Kimbrough--Bob Saddler he couldn't touch because Bob Saddler had the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], you know, and that sort of thing.  But--and I--a year and a half later, we were the two guys he trusted most because he'd come and get me and send me out of town for him and, you know, that kind of stuff because he knew I was gonna do my job and so was Bob, no matter what.  We--I wasn't lookin' for his job.  Then, when he left--I don't know whether he suggested me.  I can't imagine why 'cause he was, in effect, fired.  But some of the board members, I think Florence Cox, the board president, wanted me, and two or three others, and that was it.  I just thought I'd give it a whirl and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were an, you were an interim superintendent for, I guess a year, right?
Speaker 2: About eight months or so, about eight months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 185975
Speaker 1: Do you have any reflections on your years with the [Chicago] Public Schools [CPS]?  I mean just an overall like assessment.
Speaker 2: Well, I hope we won't go back to that business that cycle of strikes or anything, you know, from what I'm hearing, but I think if we're going to talk about administrators and teachers getting more training, then we've gotta have people at--board members and people who are making decisions that are talented having some training, and understanding some of the issues.  When I talk to administrators and I ask them, "What is it that would be first on your wish list?"  You know what they say first?
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: Pay teachers more.  Administrators are making decent money now for the first time.  Teachers are not making any money, and these are the people that everybody depends on.  Lawyers depend on 'em.  They--you can't be a lawyer until you're taught.  You can't be a doctor, you can't be a fireman, a policeman you can't be anything 'til you're taught, and yet these people are not making as much as some truck drivers and you know, that kind of stuff.  You gotta pay these people, and they don't get any respect.  So if you pay them, you can make demands of them.
Story_ID: 185976
Speaker 1: Now, you've been involved with higher education.  You were director of the United Negro College Fund [UNCF], or the chair, rather--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, chair of the United Negro College Fund here in Chicago [Illinois], or nationally?
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago.  Okay, all right.  And you're also--you also work with the Joint Negro Appeal, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is also a college fundraising (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a--well, that's a--that's for raising money, period for black educational causes.  It's defunct now.  It's gone out of existence.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know in 2002, you were honored by National Association for Equal Opportunity in Education [NAFEO], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're an active alumnus of Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (laughter).  Hefner, President [James] Hefner asked (simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: Yeah, he got me in on that fifty million dollar--shouldn't forget Hugh Hefner (laughter)?
Story_ID: 185977
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I am hopeful that we won't become complacent about the little bit of progress that we've made.  We made a little, and we see--I see people, young professional and young semi-professionals, saying such things as, "I don't need to vote because the vote--my livelihood doesn't depend on a vote."  They don't know.  I mean they simply aren't thinking.  I'm--I just--and I would like to see some sort of way out of the plight that young black people have--find themselves in.  Such a large percentage of young black men in jail.  There are no young black women (laughter) with male partners.  That's, that argues badly for the future.  When I was a principal, I had a young social worker who came into my office once when I was--I was just there from playing tennis.  I was on vacation and I was playing tennis in back of the school and I came in and was, you know, just sponging off a little, and there was this insistent knocking on my door--phone ringing and ringing, and I finally went, and it was the social worker, and she says, "I've got an emergency."  "What is it?"  Well, a social worker, you don't know whether it's a kid or, you know, what's goin' on.  So I let her in, you know, not thinkin' I was half-dressed, you know?  And she comes in and she falls on my couch and starts cryin' and I'm alarmed, you know.  And she says, "What are black women gonna do?"  I said, "What?"  "All these black men, they're, you know, they're on dope, they're in jail or they're faggots, or, you know, whatever."  I said, "No, no, no," you know.  But that was her theme, you know?  And--"Or they're married," she says, you know.  And next time I saw her she was with some married guy, you know?  A married lawyer I know who had a daughter as old as she was.  You know, that kind of thing.  But there are guys out there and--but I guess the dope thing really is something that I'd like to see disappear from the world, period.  I think about 80 percent of everybody's problems would go then. So much emanates from it.

Speaker 1: Are you optimistic about the direction the [Chicago] School Board is goin' in today, with--I know [Richard M.] Daley as mayor basically took over the Chicago Public Schools [CPS], in '93 [1993], '94 [1994], or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm not optimistic about it because what he's saying and the fact is education is too important to be left to educators, and that is certainly not the direction you ought to be moving in.  He's--he has a guy with a bachelor's degree at the head of it.  'Course he's--'course that's Daley's mouthpiece, but he--it's not the direction I would move in, period.  The educators down there are being put out to pasture.
Speaker 1: So he's boiling it down to a management issue rather than a, an education issue?
Speaker 2: Right.  And you--it isn't that simple.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's like the business with the reform movement.  I had a--gave a speech to the Better Government Association and--which I decried the reform movement, and told 'em about some of the horrible things that had happened.  And afterward, you know, I told 'em, you know, "Any questions?"  Afterward, one guy, only one person asked me a question.  All the others understood.  He said, "Well, even though all this has happened, don't you think it's better now that the people who are under the system are making the decisions?"  I said, "Well, let me ask you a question.  Let me respond to your question this way.  I've got a doctorate [degree].  I've been an [U.S.] Army officer, I've had statistics, calculus.  I can pass any course I might need to run your business.  How would you like to have me, and nine other guys like me, make the decisions about your business?"  It was over.  And see--but you've got parents with fourth grade educations and fifth grade and eighth grade educations, making decisions about millions of dollars, selecting principals, selecting teachers, selecting textbooks.  I mean, hey, I'm not saying they shouldn't participate, but let's be real.

Speaker 1: Sir, at this stage in your life--now you've retired.  Now, you were--you worked for the charter school--what was it?
Speaker 2: Right.  Youth Connection [Charter School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Youth Con- yeah.  Now, you were in charge of inspecting the activities of twenty-six charter schools in the city [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  How was that?  I mean what did you--what do you think about the charter school concept?
Speaker 2: I think you need as many different forms of schools as you can have because that gives you another option these days especially, but--and I'm, I think they need it.  Charter schools simply can allow you to design a school for the needs of a particular group of kids and that's what's needed.  I agree with 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay, now and what do you think about the voucher system?
Speaker 2: I think there's not enough money already in public education.  They cry every time you ask for money.  Why you gonna give it away to somebody else?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They say that--they say public school teachers are cryin' are making excuses.  Look, businessmen are hypocrites.  As a principal and as a district sup. [superintendent] and all that kind of stuff, I see businessmen or I saw businessmen or I went with businessmen to lunch and all that kind of stuff.  They spend all kind of mon- all kinds a money at lunch and all that sort of thing and everything.  They don't want me to have a bologna sandwich.  They want me to have a bologna sandwich or something.  They do not--if you take somebody to lunch, they don't, you know, hey, they want--they say, "Do as I do.  Do as I say, don't do as I do."  They'll have fifty, one hundred dollar, two hundred dollar lunches, and they don't want you to do what they do.  Well, I'm not saying I should take somebody to lunch for two or three hundred dollars a day.  I'm saying that a principal is a business person.  Occasionally he needs to take someone to lunch to sell them on the idea of supporting his school, supporting his community, and that kind of stuff.  I--and another thing was, when I was superintendent, I saw what they were doing tax-wise.  I saw that the very people who were screaming the most about schools were not paying their taxes.

Speaker 1: What would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Noise.  My kids.  I'm hoping that I hope that the kids--my four kids and whatever grandchildren--and my grandchildren will carry on what I've tried to do in their own ways.  I hope the principles that I hope I've imbued within them will carry over--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and within any other kids with whom I've had contact.  Some of 'em, on occasion, get in touch and tell me, "Yeah, that's it."
Story_ID: 185981
Speaker 1: --Is there anything that you would do differently when you look back at life?
