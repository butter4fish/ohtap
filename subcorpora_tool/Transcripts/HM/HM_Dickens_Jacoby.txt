Speaker 1: Now you know more about me then I know about you right now. Except I know you, I know you own bowling alleys.
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: I'm what I like to do is start by talking about. Are you from Chicago?
Speaker 2: I was born in a small town in Florida. In the pan handle area Panama City Florida.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about growing up? you know what your family was like. who your mother and father was that type of thing.
Speaker 2: Well I guess I can start by saying I was born a a very young age. (Laughing) that's kind of obvious isn't it. And my mother was Marie and my dad I'm a junior his name was Jacoby. And we lived in this little town in Florida that probably had a population of 4,000 today it's probably a hundred thousand. I'm going back sixty-eight years ago when I was born. And it was quiet community. This was before integration we went to all black schools. And I didn't go to a one- room schoolhouse as you hear so often. It was two school two room schoolhouse and we had four grades. And one and four grades in the other. So one through four to kindergarten it was in one roorn. And from five through eight that was in another classroom. And they had two teachers in the total school.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about growing up in your town? what was it like or do you have any favorite childhood memories? you know of your family?
Speaker 2: Well as I have stated before it was a small town in which I never ran into the integration problem as a small kid. Because of everything we did was in our own community. And I truly didn't venture out of that community. too often. So I wasn't a victim. I may have been victim but I wasn't aware of it that I was a victim. I wasn't aware that we were poor. I was just we had the basic essentials I had a couple pair of shoes. And change of clothes and we ate three meals. You know but we were a poor family. But my dad had was employed. And you know so we did all right. until the advent of television (unclear) took me into other households. I was able to see what the rest of the world what the world was truly like. And it wasn't just limited in the small community I found myself being born in. Yes.
Story_ID: 6516
Speaker 1: Do you--how would you describe your father?  What type of person was he?  What was his belief structure?
Speaker 2: He was a very strong man and always emphasized the importance of going to school and getting an education. And I often wonder why because my father I think probably finished about the fourth or fifth grade and he then had to go out and help the--to the fields because they lived in a country area, and work in the fields. But he was very strong man and a very intelligent man. For a person who didn't have formal education. Very strong in his beliefs and was really my idol. And was a very forceful part of my life and--We spent our whole life together. And he died in 1982 or something like that. But the only period that I wasn't with my father in the same town with my father was when I was in the army. You know. Other than that we had a relationship. Not only was he my dad he was my best friend.
Speaker 1: You know that's ver-, you don't think of that in the black community a lot of times. Or that's the stereotype you know of relationships between father and son like that.
Speaker 2: Well I--there's one thing I omitted. My mom and dad divorced when I was three years old. So that he was my mom and my dad for a long period of time. And he brought his mother in, my grandmother came into our house after he and my mom divorced and my grandmother was the person who did all of the cooking, and all of the things that you expect the mom to be doing. But my dad did all of the punishing all of the praising all of the going to schools to check on you. So you know, he was, he was my idol.
Speaker 1: And do you--can you talk about your grandmother a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yes my grandmother--I understand where my dad got his strength from because she was a very strong person who didn't take any flack from anyone, you know everything was very straightforward, very persistent about time and what time you got home. You know you couldn't let the darkness catch you not at home. No matter what day of the week that held true. That held true seven days a week. And she had very strong rules but they were only the same rules and regulations that my dad had so they were a pretty good team and there wasn't any conflict and I didn't have the ability to use one against the other. Cause they were really together you know how sometime kid go and say, "Well dad said so and so."  You didn't have that option with them.
Story_ID: 6517
Speaker 1: Did you have any brother or sisters?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately I only had sisters. (Laughing) I only had sisters. I offered to my dad and opportunity to trade off five of these girls for one brother. He took--he threw me out of the house. No, he didn't like that too well.
Speaker 1: Where were you were you the oldest, youngest--?
Speaker 2: No, there was two older and one--and three younger.
Speaker 1: I; So how was it growing up in a household you know with five, five sisters? Were you spoiled because you were the only boy? I mean, you know what was that hold experience?
Speaker 2: It was terrible. Because I did not have my own space. I always wanted an area for my clothes. And I wanted not to be in conjunction with the girls. But they would always take my shirts and wear them and I would go out smelling with cologne and all that kind of thing. I I think that kind of motivated me to leaving home (laughing). And making sure that I could earn my own way in this life so that I could have that separations. Today I'm married and I don't, my wife can't use the same closet that I use. So we have our clothes you know it little idiosyncrasies that you grow up with. But--I love my sisters. And I was always protective of them. never got in altercations or fights with people, only when it concerned my sisters and if someone was not doing the right things by one of them they had me to deal with. And so I was always the protector, I was always a pretty good size for my age anyway so I was able to look over that.
Story_ID: 6518
Speaker 1: My first teacher was Carrie B. Shaw (ph.) who is deceased at this point. She was a very important asset in my life. She gave me the confidence and made me think that I was smartest kid in the school. I was not--there was a girl who was valedictorian when I graduated when I was in school. I was second and I always held it in my mind that she was first because she was a girl. That was not the case (laughing). She was just really a sharp kid. But she told me that I had the ability to be the smartest kid. Now I didn't wound up being the smartest. she gave me enough incentive and reason on why I needed to work harder and that was the only thing that stood between me and being the best. And I remember a phase that she taught me. And she--I think it was "The problem with success is it's too often disguised as, as hard work."  In other words if you can take that hard work issues out of it everyone would be successful. But you know in order to truly be successful you got to work hard. And I will remember that. She taught me that in the forth or fifth grade.
Story_ID: 6519
Speaker 1: Do you think that having grown--you know, had that initial experience in a segregated town what do you think that did in terms of your own (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well I'm certain that it has left some impression and things on me maybe some that I truly aware of. Growing up in a community like that and having my mother early on and then my grandmother and my granddad all pumping me to be better. And you know, a favorite saying in all black households in that time, "Boy you got to be a twice as good as the next person to succeed in this life, you know-- it's just not enough to pass. You just got be so far above everyone else so that you won't be refused. because of your race" and all of those kind of issues you know. Those things were pumped into most black kids of that era and I think we carry those through, throughout our lives. And you know maybe I still have a bit of that left in me.
Story_ID: 6520
Speaker 1: Do you have any other favorite childhood memories?
Speaker 2: Well you asked me about the church early. Back in those days you had--church was an all day thing on Sunday. You went to Sunday school and then the morning service began and then in the evening you had what was called BYPU Baptist Young People Union something like that. And then there was a night service. So Sunday was just blown away because you really spent the entire day in church and then there were other programs, you had singing groups and things during the week so. Our community and focal point was the church and school. we look upon the school naturaly for education and entertainment because to plays and things together for us. And the church did the same thing. The church and the school really worked closely together in small communities. Because often times your your grammar school teacher may have just been your Sunday school teacher you know. So we really had a close knit community and all black business did well in that era. Well in, in terms of the kind of business that was available because as a black kid I only went to the black store. You know the white stores were too far away and I could walk a block in be in the black businesses. So that was there relationship that they entire community had with the businesses that were in our community.
Story_ID: 6521
Speaker 1: Do you remember ever hearing stories that your grandmother would tell you about her growing up, where her family was from--how--'Jacoby' is even (unclear), that's a--how did that name come from?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's and grandfather's person that they worked for--this is one step away from slavery--they were sharecroppers for this gentleman he was a very wealthy man. At least they deemed him as being wealthy. And his last name was Jacoby. He was from Scotland as I recall. And so they chose to name my dad after this gentleman because he was kind and they taught he was superior to other sharecroppers. (Laughing) you know, the people who owned the properties, you know. They gave my dad the name and I'm stuck with it.
Speaker 1: Okay back to the stories
Speaker 2: Oh and the stories that she told she told many stories. She took me back even into the area of her father and how they lived and it was a very poor living, you know they were living off of the land. And if they didn't plant it and raise it they didn't get it. Whenever they had a little money and they went to town it was for things like salt and sugar and they even had [sugar] cane which they would extract the juice from into to put into things to sweeten in certain items. So they really had a poor, very poor existence. Yes, even know there was no such thing as running water. They'd go down to a stream get buckets of water and bring it back to the house. And the homes they built themselves and I have some pictures hand they weren't too, too nice either, you know. And naturally no indoor plumbing or anything of that nature. They had chickens, pigs, cows later on when they could afford those kind of things. They just kept, you konw raising new stock and things and that's really how they existed.
Story_ID: 6522
Speaker 1: Now you, you grew up not in a huge family but a still, you ,know, family of six, right? How was that? You know growing what were you--did you guys do everything together? Did you
Speaker 2: I was reminded recently when my daughter asked the question. "What did you do, Dad before television?" I said "I don't understand the question."  "Well you know y'all had nothing to watch at home."  I said, "We were a very close knit family. We didn't go off to our individual rooms and watch television. We were a group and sat around and we would talk and play games." We were much closer than families are today. you know people think the television bring you together. I I think you bring yourself together. Often times in dialog between the group I, I think that bring you much closer.
Story_ID: 6523
Speaker 1: I was about thirteen or fourteen when I came to Chicago [Illinois]. Maybe fifteen. We came here in 1946 and I thought Chicago was a terrible place. I came here and everything was new. And people were above us and around us and side. And I was accustomed to having all of this space in a little small town in Florida. And came here like in August in '46. And a month later school started and all of a sudden Chicago was a fine place. Because I meet all of these kids and you know there life wasn't as dreary as I thought it would be. All it takes is for kids to go to school and, and you meet a whole 'nother family out there. And then I begin to like Chicago I liked it so much I've been here since that time.
Speaker 2: Describe Chicago in the 40s [1940s]? What was it like, you know, here? I mean where did you, actually where did you end up moving here?
Speaker 1: I moved--I lived at 43rd and Wentworth which was a community on the edge of the white community. We were the first family in, in the, in that building. That. was a four-unit building and we had the back first floor apartment with a washroom that was approximately the size of a telephone booth. (Laughing) you know and there was no bathtub and when you got ready to take--I almost said shower--there was no such thing as a shower. When you got ready to take a bath you a got a number three tin tub out and you put some water on the stoveand you heated, heated it and you poured that in and you had a area that was a corner of the kitchen that you pulled a curtain around and you got in the tub and that's where you took care of your business. Because the washroom didn't have those facilities. In the '40s Chicago was not the greatest place to be in. We could not go to hotels in the downtown Chicago area. Every high school prom of that era was held at 45th and King Drive and the building is still there. It was, it was, later on became Chicago Met. If was the Parkway Ballroom. And the only reason why all of the schools had their, black school had their--we just couldn't check in or get the facilities downtown. There weren't restaurants downtown that you could go in in 1946. So once again we kind did everything in, in our own community. To going downtown to me was going to 47th and King Drive [at that time South Shore]. That was like Time Square in, in the eyes of a thirteen fourteen year old. You had the Regal Theater and the Savoy Ballroom and you saw all of the big acts that came to the Regal Theater. They had live shows and Lena Horne and Count Basie and Sammy Davis [Jr.] you know and people of that nature were appearing there on a regular basis. So that was our world. I walked many days form 43rd and Wentworth over to 47th and King Drive to go to the Regal Theater. The next block it was the Metropolitan Theater they didn't have live shows they just had movies. On occasion we go there. it was all lit up and neon signs and you know it was our Times Square. I don't remember going downtown the first time. I don't recall but I'm sure it happened sometime later.

Speaker 1: In your teen years were you, did you have a job? You know, were you just going to school--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: In Florida before leaving Florida [as a young teenager] I had a job then. I worked at a grocery store after school. I worked from four to seven every evening Monday through Friday. And on Saturday I worked all day and Sunday I work a half a day. On Sunday the store was close but I had to clean the meat cooler and do all of that. And anything that was slightly stale or something like that they gave it to me and I took it home and we washed it up you know and that was part of the I guess part of my salary. Because for that period of working I made one dollar and fifty cents a week. And I was very pleased to have that job. I it it seem small today but it wasn't really that small. I had money to go to school with and I could buy candy when many of the kids couldn't buy it because I had a few coins. And then when school was out I got a big increase. I was now working six and a half complete days and then I made three dollars. Out of that three dollars I was able to keep a dollar and I gave, the two dollars was given to my parents. And you know, we just had a great life. We left there and move to Chicago and my first job in Chicago was while I was in high school. And I worked for the last year of high school part time for Goidblatt Brothers at 39th and Wentworth in a warehouse. And made some more money. I was making thirty seven and a half cents a hour on my first job that was about 1948.
Story_ID: 6525
Speaker 1: What age were you then in 1948?
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: What are were you in 1948?
Speaker 2: 1948 No I was seventeen. Because I was born in thirty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay okay.
Speaker 2: I got a, I skipped a grade I got a double at some point in grade school. So I was really kinda a year ahead. you know of other kids that age, you know. Yeah. I was seventeen when I graduated.
Speaker 1: When you graduated. Okay. Now any of the people you know today were you in school with them, I mean where did you go to high school.
Speaker 2: I went to Wendell Phillips High School here in Chicago. In Panama City Florida for the first two years I was at Rosenwald High School. At Wendell Phillips I met many friends and many people whose name that you would recognize today. In my class--I only flunked one class in my entire career. And that was in high school that was a class at 7:45 in the morning. And the class was music appreciation. And I had to do is get there 7:45. But who wants to listen to Beethoven and Bach at 7: 45 in the morning? So I just simply didn't go. And and one of the person who was in that class with me that also failed the class was Sam Cooke. Can you imagine (laughing) Sam Cooke the singer. But--after failing the class parents had to come to the school. So naturally that parent was my dad. And my dad came to Wendell Phillips High School because I had failed this class. He never had to come back again. Oh yes he did he had to come back once. And when he came back the next time it was at my graduation. (Laughing) Oh yes he, he made it very plain and clear that that was unacceptable in this family. No one fails anything. You only fail--the only reason you failed is because you didn't show up. And and no one is good enough not to be there. And you know I really got a pretty good going over as a result of that.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher when you were at Wendell Phillips?
Speaker 2: Yes her name was she was a Spanish teacher and her name was Frances Albert. And she was a old maid. She had never been married and she was a elderly lady at that time. But as the world would have it I met Miss Albert probably twenty years later and she could hardly walk, she was downtown. So this lady was trying to cross the street at State and Adams. She was going south. So I helped her across the street I did not know who she was. And when I got her across the street she said, "Let me look at you again. Are you Jacoby Dickens?"  And I almost fainted. I said who in the world could this be. She said, "You don't remember me but I remember you."  And then she spoke a little Spanish to me. And I answered--I knew, I still remembered a little and I answered her back to whatever it was. And she said, "You still don't know who I am."  And she said "Take yourself back to high school."  And I got it I had it then it was Mrs. Albert. And just saw her that once and never saw her after that but--and I just remember standing there seeing her disappearing walking to the next block. And I watched and looked at her as long as I could. But that's my memory. Because she was my favorite. She always was special to me. I liked the way that she, when she walked into the classroom, there was a special aura that came over the classroom.  I never once heard her say "Class be quiet." When she walked into the room there was something about her demeanor--it was like the Queen of England walked into the room or something. She had that kind of impression and it wasn't just on me. Because in the class if you were in the middle of a sentence you didn't finish it--Mrs Albert had walked into the room. Now there were others who didn get that kind of attention you know from the same kids. But there was something about her and she never raised her voice and she spoke in very monotone. But I think spoke so softly because, in order to hear her, it had to be quiet in the room. Because if it wasn't absolutely quiet you could'nt really get everything that she was trying to pass over to you, you know. She was a special lady.
Story_ID: 6526
Speaker 1: Wendell Phillips has a very strong history. And I don't think there was anything that Wendell Phillips high school had to do with this. And I'm reminded of this fact because my daughter always jokes to me to me--jokes with me about, "Why is it everyone that comes up and you're talking with them, you all went to the same high school?"  I said, "My dear in 1946, there were only two all black high schools in Chicago." That was Wendell Phillips and DuSable. Now there was a small per cent of kids over at Hyde Park, maybe less than 5 per cent, Englewood had maybe 7 or 8 per cent black. there was one school on the West Side of Chicago. The name escapes me now, that had a few blacks. But with very few exceptions that was where all black kids went to high school.
Speaker 2: So some--Who were some of the people who when to Wendell Phillips that you can tell us about?
Speaker 1: I, I think I spoke about Albert Porter, Sam Cooke, George Johnson, Johnson products. slightly before my time, Joan Johnson was in my era. I don know. The names escape me, but , there are--It's innumerable the number of success stories from that era that went to Wendell Phillips High School.
Speaker 2: Now after--Do you have--? Okay, I'm going to ask one more memory question.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Do you have any, any memories about, you know, whether it was around school, or at fun, or you know, something mischievous that, you know something that--in those high school years, things that you did? Did you sneak into the Savoy Ballroom when you weren't supposed to or you know--(laughing)?
Speaker 1: Well, I did quite a bit of that. And, And believe it or not, I got away with it because of my size. I was about six-foot tall. And you know, even back in those days, I grew very early and fast. And although I had the young face, I was able to talk my way into a lot of different places. And, you know that was a come-on for kids. I mean, you know, "I was in the Savoy Ballroom." Well, you know, "How did you get in?" and  you know all of that. Later on at the Regal Theater I knew the doorman and after a certain hour, they would let you come in. You know, so I saw the tail end of a lot of movies (chuckle). You know, you know then it was free. And I think I saw more baseball games after the seventh inning, since I only lived about seven or eight blocks from Comiskey Park. After the seventh inning, they used to let the kids come in for free. So I'd be there waiting for the seventh inning and praying for extra inning games so that I could see more baseball. And we did that. That was part of our entertainment. And, and even on occasion, I was caught once sneaking into the park, going over the fence (chuckle). And they held me, and they didn't lock me up. But--once again my Dad had to come and--that didn't happen any more (chuckle).
Speaker 2: Now describe what the Savoy Ballroom was back--like back then.
Speaker 1: Savoy Ballroom was--
Speaker 2: It was--When I ask a question, I need you just to pause so when I--
Speaker 1: Okay. So you what to go--start over?
Speaker 2: Yeah. What, What was the Savoy Ballroom like back then?
Speaker 1: The Savoy Ballroom was at one point a skating rink, dance floor. They had dances and big bands would come and play there. It was a multipurpose kind of ballroom. And we thought it was just the Taj Mahal you know, to go to the Savoy ball--. They had boxing there, They would set a ring up in the middle of the place and we saw fighters. It was nothing really big-time. Mostly Golden Gloves and some amateur and semiprofessional kind of fights. So it was very multipurpose kind of building. Right next door to the Regal Theater.
Speaker 2: Okay. And what was the Regal Theater like then?
Speaker 1: The Regal Theater was a beautiful theater. we thought it was the prettiest theater in town. But only because we had not seen the others (chuckle). But it was a large theater. movies every day and on weekends or on certain days, they would have acts come in for two or three days. And we saw the best black talent in the country at the Regal Theater. Everyone was there from Sammy Davis to Eartha Kit. The whole.. Everything, you name, name it--if--A black entertainer of that era appeared at the Regal at some point in their career. Big bands, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmy Lunceford, right down the list.
Story_ID: 6527
Speaker 1: Now in--[age] 17 you graduate. What do you do at that point?
Speaker 2: At that point I started to--I was working at Goldblatt's [warehouse] and going to Roosevelt University part-time. I mean at night. I was working a full-time job and going to school at night and that continued throughout my--career until army. And then I was inducted into the army in about 1951--'52, '52. [1952] And I spent two years in the army and got out and went back to school. You know and working and going to school. I did that for 30 years I think. Long period.
Speaker 1: So you worked and went to school. You were urn--So it-- Now what--Why were you going to school? Were you going--?
Speaker 2: Ev--Why was I going to school? Every time I found a deficit in my knowledge, I went back and took night classes. Even as late as 1978 when I came to the [Seaway] bank. And , you know, I went and took banking classes at night. I always had a desire to learn and whatev-, whenever I found something that was foreign to me, I, I took advantage and went back to school and picked up those, that knowledge. And that, that was the way my life has been.
Speaker 1: Now over this--So you're saying over a 30- year pe--Not a 30-year period? Yeah, so I--You know, I'm speaking from 1948 when I got out of high school until 78. At some point during that 30-year period I was in and out of college, taking classes and doing different things. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now were--was it mainly at Roosevelt or did you..?
Speaker 1: No I, no Roosevelt, another school was called Williams. I went to Chicago State--it wasn't Chicago State then. It was Chicago Teachers College. And  even spent ,  a year arid a half at Florida A&M. So.
Story_ID: 6528
Speaker 1: One person had told me you've had a meteoric rise and why, why did they say that?
Speaker 2: I didn't look upon it as being meteoric. My goal and objective in life, I wanted to have all that I needed to live my life the way I wanted to live it. But I didn't necessarily want any publicity as a result of it. I made a couple of mistakes in that path that let the outside world know that I had a few accomplishments. First was when I--first was I bought a Rolls Royce: That was a mistake (chuckle). And that brought a lot of attention--the--you know. It shouldn't have, but it did. Secondly is when I came on the board at Seaway Bank which was in the mid '70s I would say. And shortly after I was here I became vice chairman and not too long after that I became the chairmanship. So maybe that's where some of this "meteoric rise"--. But there was a long period of work that didn't get any attention. I started back in the '50s [1950s] in business so to speak. I formed, put a crew together and I started buying apartment buildings. I would buy boarded-up buildings and rehab them and bring em up and lease them out. And at the peak in my career I had over a hundred apartments. Not in one building, but in an assortment of buildings. And I did that for a number of years. As a matter of fact, I did it all the way until 1971 or '72 [1972] and I decided to--sell and I sold at a very good price, because I had--they were good buildings. They had been rehabbed and so I sold them at an appreciated price and I went into business. My first business, actual retail kind of business was a bowling center. I had a bowling center across the street from the bank, Starlight Lanes. I did that in '69 [1969]. In '75 [1975] I bought my second bowling establishment, that's Skyway Bowl. My daughter still--My daughter owns that now and runs it very successfully. So you know, there were a lot of things that happened during my career that didn't get the attention but, you know, when you have things that are showy and fancy car, you know which I didn't need (chuckle). But, I was able to get a very good deal on it. So I--You know, I've always been a sucker for a good deal, so I purchased it and--and in the early-middle 70s the chairman of Seaway Bank asked me if I would come on the board of this institution. And I was happy to do that.
Story_ID: 6529
Speaker 1: When I got out of the army is was 1954. I had saved 50 dollars a month for that two-year period so now what does that equate to, about twelve hundred dollars. And I go from that back to Goldblatt's [warehouse] working. I went out and bought an automobile, '54 Bel Air Chevy brand new and the company that financed it for me was charging an exorbitant figure. So I thought in order to get out of that crunch that they had placed me in, I'd go and get a second job. So I got two--had my second eight-hour job. And I continued to work both of those jobs. Incidentally after seven months I had enough money to pay the car off so I just went down and paid cash on it. Because in five years I never touched a dime of that second job. Tho--That check went straight to the bank. I never touched it. And after I paid the car off I never touched it. So for the next five years, I worked these two jobs. And I was able to save in that period a lot of money. Well, for that day it was a lot of money. It was somewhere between 35 and 40 thousand dollars. And that was 1959 that I had that. So I said, Wow! You know this is a lot of money. So then the idea came that maybe I ought to buy some real estate. And believe it or not the first person I went to was Dempsey Travis and he put me in touch with someone who was trying to sell a four-unit building and I purchased that building in 1959. And from that 1959 through '72 [1972] 1 was purchasing real estate, rehabbing it and in '72 1 started selling off.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: So does that kind of fill the gap in a little bit.
Speaker 2: No it fills the gap a lot. Where did you--Where did you get that from? Why were you such a spendthrift sort of? I mean, how the savings? Well that goes against the grain of most--You know black people are viewed as consumers, so--?
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't tell you the earlier part. The earlier part prior to going into the army I couldn't make it from payday to payday. I was just spending--. If I had a date I had to go to my dad [Jacoby Dickens, Sr.] and borrow a couple of bucks to take this, my date to the Regal Theater. You know. That's all it took. You know I had the ice cream and all. All of that could he fit into two dollars. So finally this happened in about 1954. I was out of the army and I was talking to my dad and told him I was a little short. And for the first time in my life my dad turned me down, and gave me a scolding. He told me that he was ashamed of me because here I am a grown man and I can't make it from payday to payday. And boy! He just gave me up and down you know. And that may have been the last time I have cried. II didn't cry in front of him. But as soon as he left I cried. I didn't want him to see me crying. And --But I was really hurt by his scolding, and hurt by the fact that he just simply said. "I'm not going to do this."  And I was hurt. And I made a vow to myself that I would never ask him for another dime. But it was a lesson. I--Later on I said, Well you know, this is the best thing that he's ever done for me Because I started saving my money and, I was not making a lot of money. I was only--I was making less than 40 dollars right after the army 'cause we were getting about a dollar an hour at that point you know so my total income was probably take home about  30 bucks. But I saved 10 dollars. I saved 10 dollars out of 30 every single week and then as I started to get an increase and promotions and things, the salaries and things went--.  And you know savings and having some money is infectious. I mean, you know, once you get on the roll of doing this, you know and you reach goals and objectives then you're not satisfied with that objective any more 'cause you've achieved that--you've got the 30 or the 40 thousand, or whatever it is your goal has been. And then you want more. And , I guess that's the way of--all of those things occurred. You know, you have to continue to make money throughout your life. even if your name is Rockefeller. If you're spending your principal and not making any money, eventually you're gonna be broke. And since I've been poor and I've had a few dollars, I--It's much more fun having a few.
Speaker 2: So, were you friends at that time? Were they? I mean who were you sort of hanging out with? Who were, you know, who was influencing you at that time? Were you the only--Were you the only spendthrift in the group?
Speaker 1: Yeah and they talked about me (chuckle). And they really talked about me.
(Videographer?: unclear)
Speaker 1: It was your father and that was it?
Speaker 2: You mean the reason why I turned to being frugal and, and saving?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Laughing) Right
Speaker 2: Oh I think it was definitely my father. And I think it was he I was trying to prove wrong. I wanted to prove to him that I was some good. I was worth something. And I was a valuable asset to the community. It was very important that I prove this to myself. But sometimes I think that it was probably equally as important that I prove it to him. And I prove it--And I really proved it to him. When my Dad retired I--gave him a new Cadillac. Surprised him and presented him with this new Cadillac. I bought him a new home. He loved the prizefights. We traveled all over the world seeing prizefights. And--we had a great relationship. Don't get me wrong, it was a few days that it took me to get over, get over his denial of that two dollars that I wanted to go on this date for, but we had a great relationship after that. And he was the biggest single influence in my life. It's, its just no question. In, In so many ways. He was a very principled person and had the innate ability to dissect the most complex problem, and make it so simple. And I, I was always seeking my dad's advice. Even at the point when I went into business. You know, even while--early on when I was in Seaway [National] Bank, I was not chairman at the time--but I'd tell him about different situations and he always had the simplest means to the solution of any person that I'd ever encountered, you know? So - you know, we were--He was my light and--and I think I became his. (chuckle)
Story_ID: 6530
Speaker 1: So you were an employee, but then you moved to being an entrepe--Was, was real estate your first sort of entr--entry into sort of being in business (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Absolutely
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Real estate was the first. And I missed the point about my becoming an engineer. You know I, I became an engineer for the Board of Education. And in that pursuit, much of my knowledge about buildings and you know was naturally as a result of that. That's why I was about to put my own team together and rehab these buildings.  We did everything that was needed in the buildings except put a new roof on. You know, we didn't have all of the equipment to do that with. But everything else we could fix it. You know, I had a crew of five guys and we took care of all of these buildings. And all of the new projects that I would purchase we get in there and do the rehab on it.
Speaker 1: And at that time what was Dempsey Travis doing? I mean--
Speaker 2: Dempsey Travis at that time in 1959 was in the real estate business. And his office was on 47th Street, north side of 47th Street in the 400 block, half a block away from the Regal Theater and Savoy and all the places that we've been talking about. And--he was an entrepreneur at that time. And had been for a period of years. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now who, who--I, I know your father--your father wasn't in business though.
Speaker 2: No my father was never in business.
Speaker 1: So who were those people in the black community that you admired or looked up to? You know and wanted to sort of emulate, or be like?
Speaker 2: I read--I'm a great reader of success stories. I read about the lady in Indianapolis Indiana, first black millionaire. Her name is escaping me at this moment. , I read her life story, and I read the life story of John [H.] Johnson. I read life stories of Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts. I read all of their stories and --You know, I don't know if I emulated anything. But it certainly tells you one thing: the only way to true success in this--country, if you really want to have more money than you have to have to cover your current expenses, I think the quickest and simplest way is in business. Now there are many people who have good jobs and they are able to send their kids to college, and buy a home and do all of that. If that is the zenith of your desires, then a job will cover that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Excuse me, can I have you--? Let's just start--'cause we--I'm sure--(unclear) Yeah. It was too loud, the truck going by.
Speaker 2: Oh. If your desire in life is to achieve at different levels, there are certain levels that can be achieved with a job. An a job can get you a happy family and send the kids to college and have a home and--But if that's the zenith of your desires than that's fine. But I wanted a little more than that and reading all the things that I read about, and all of the things, none of those people had jobs, they were all entrepreneurs. And they were out seeking and starting businesses and, my, just immensely successful. Arid business is the opportunity there. You know, when you have a job there are limitations. You agree to do, to perform something for a specific amount. There may he some incentives in your job that if you did a little more, you get a little more, but it, it's so very limited. In business I don't look--that there are any limitations, if the market is too small, then you can try to do things to expand the market. And its just unlimited as to how much you can accomplish. And it's all left up to you. And when it's left up to me I think that I'm in control and if it's successful I get all the praise and if it's bad, I get all the negatives, so--and you work hard to--to achieve.

Speaker 1: Now why do you think Chicago has been such a good place for a black business?
Speaker 2: I don't know if we get the credit that is due. But Chicago, I think has more successful entrepreneurs than any other city in the country. I read somewhere that Los Angeles had more. But these --Evidently they're talking about Ma and Pa operations, you know small businesses. In Chicago you have some major, major success stories, and you have had all the way back to the time of the Overtons who had the cosmetics way back when in the '30s and even earlier than that. And the Binga Bank which was one of the earlier black banks in, in Chicago. You know, in that area along State Street say from 37th to 35th was like a black Wall Street. You had a lot of success stories in there. Why Chicago? I think it's a working class community and since Chicago was as segregated as it was, all of the blacks lived in almost in confined areas and so that presented opportunities to people who with desires of going into business. Because many of the white entrepreneurs did not want to come into our community to do business. So if you had the wisdom to open something up within the community, you had an opportunity there that was, I think unlimited. When you look at successes--When you look at what the market is like today in the world we--Over 400 million is spent by black folks in this country for goods and services. So just think of what that would rate, if you would put it at a rating for countries. We would be the eight or ninth largest country in the world, just by the amount of money that we spend for goods and services. So I just think that if you're in any major metropolitan black community, there's an opportunity to do land office business. And--because people have needs for goods and services that if you're providing that void for them the opportunity is there.
Story_ID: 6532
Speaker 1: Mr. Dickens so you started--Okay, so you're in real estate and you--Okay so you made--and you got in real estate, you have these 100 properties, you made--you had a pile of money after that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What--Then you went and got the bowling alleys.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Bowling, bowling alleys, and expanded those. Made , it was very successful. And during that venue, I was asked to come to Seaway [National] Bank by Ernest Collins who was the chairman at the time [and founder of the bank]. And he said, "I'm having a few problems over here and I think they're trying to put me out." He said, "I own 33 per cent of the stock. Why don't you come in and I'll buy some more and you buy some and if you--If we both buy enough, we'll have 51 per cent and we can control this thing." In about seven months all of that had occurred. And I was on the board and he made me vice chairman. And a few years after that [in 1982] he was an older man than I was arid he said, "I want to get out" you know and so we started discussing about what price he wanted for his stock. And we haggled about that for about two years and finally we came to an agreement that he changed twice--he would tell me one number and come back and say, "Naw its got to be a little more."  And well I had already figured the situation out. I knew how high I could go in, in the purchase. And his first number was very attractive. His second number was even attractive. The third one was not objectionable. I fought like it was objectionable, you know. But finally we agreed and the change over took place. We--he was bought out of this in December 31, 1986.
Story_ID: 6533
Speaker 1: You know what it takes to get to that point--it takes something that too many of us are not willing to do. And that is sacrifice.  Sacrifice you know I was not living in a grandiose lifestyle during the periods of time that I'm talking--. Although I had some money but it wasn't important. I did not need fancy clothes I didn't even need the fancy automobiles because I spent my time working. I remember when I opened the first bowling center in 1969 for the next five years I spent seventeen to eighteen hours a day in that business. So you know that was just time to go home and sleep for five hours and get up and come back. So what did I have I didn't have any need for the fancy and flash in my life, you know, because I was in pursuit. In pursuit of making some money.
Story_ID: 6534
Speaker 1: So how much money did you make off of that housing in 1960? Even though the fact that you had 30-4-, What'd you have? You had saved 30 -40 thousand,  that's a lot of money.
Speaker 2: I had saved--I had saved that prior to going into the real estate business. I was some where between 35 and 40 thousand dollars if my memory serves me right in 1959 when I purchased my first building. And from that I started getting more income and it just keep going up. I mean as soon as I get a nice little stake of dollars I'd be in pursuit of another building. And that went on and on until I think my highest number of apartments was 106 apartments. And collecting all these rents I collected all of my rents. I, I rented them I put people out,  I did everything, you know,. you know I was the manager of those properties and as I told you before, we rehabbed them all. How much money did I make? I don't know. I really can't tell you because when I sold the buildings I didn't go in one day and sell them all. You know I would sell a building and I had all of them on sale at one time. And over a period of 3 maybe even 4 years it took me to get rid of all the properties I had I sold them all except for one. I kept the original building which was a four flat because my dad liked to work, he had--put himself. He was a carpenter and he liked to dab around and he had a little shop in the basement. I didn't sell that one till he died. (chuckle). I just kept it because he liked to go around there and work. But all of the others I sold and I sold them at a appreciated price. So I don't have a number to throw at you. But I took those kind of dollars and I went into the bowling business. And from that I went into other things. I brought televisons I brought two television stations along with other people. I had partners.
Story_ID: 6535
Speaker 1: Let's go back to the bowling alleys. How did you identify with the bowling alleys as a business to get involved in?
Speaker 2: Okay I was joined a league and it was called Daddy-O's Fun League. [Holmes] Daddy-O Daylie who was a disc jockey and Budweiser was promoting some bowling at the time and so I went into the league and bowled the first year and the next year they voted me as president of this league. And I really got interested in bowling and saw the revenue streams and all of the things that this would kick off and I stayed involved and Daddy-O hired me as what did he call me? "Commissioner of Bowling." Some grand title like that. I just helped organized some stuff, you know. We were at South Shore Bowl on Stony Island around 68th Street and I was a (unclear) then we came to the bowling center that I wound up owning, which was across the street on 87th and Cottage Grove, that was Starlite Lanes. In 1969 Daddy-O and I together purchased that establisment. The next one I purchased  [Skyway Bowl] alone. And having worked at it, I knew everything about the bowling business. I didn't know the behind the counter and I didn't know the books, the ledgers I went back to school and took some accounting classes. You know that was a part of that process that I went through and I took some accounting classes so I had a better understanding of the back side of the business as I call it. And--it just went on from there.
Story_ID: 6536
Speaker 1: Did you have any advisors along the way during these early years? Or people or were you, was it trial and error? And if it was trial and error were there things that, you know, were there lessons learned you know that benefit you today or whatever?
Speaker 2: In the engineering, in getting my engineering license, my advisor was an engineer who was one of the first black engineers. I was in the group that were it was originally five black engineers in the system. From the beginning of time up until 1959. I became an engineer in 1962. In I was in a group the next group after that. Today there is over a hundred black engineers in the Board of Education system. I worked for the Board of Education and my advisor was Tom --Thomas Haydon (ph.). And he was a black engineer. And I came into his school and as a janitor. My first few months in the Board I was a janitor while I was waiting to be called out for the engineering exam. And he told me he said he took a liking to me. And we became almost like father and son and he was just constantly giving me advice and helping me and really a true mentor in the engineering piece. When it came to--he helped me throughout my career with that. When it came to the next step in my life in the real estate where I would have to say the--physical end of it the building and all of that, having acquired some of those skills as, you know working as an engineer and my dad was the biggest influence there. And I would have to say Dempsey Travis. You know. At that time Dempsey later on had started writing his books and things. You know, people can be an influence on you and you not have any talk. You don't have to talk to them or touch them or even know them. Even though I knew Dempsey. But you read about what they do and you observe and they unknowingly become your influence. So I had many people who could fill in those kind of influences. I met other people who were in the same business of acquiring buildings. And I learned and they taught me. It's amazing how generous they were with information. Here I am trying to go into the same thing and trying to do what they were already doing. But no one every said no and they always had advice for me. And I was grateful for them.
Story_ID: 6537
Speaker 1: So you, so--at what point were you a millionaire?
Speaker 2: I wasn't even aware of it.
Speaker 1: You weren't.
Speaker 2: I was not even aware that I was a millionaire. It occurred sometime in '70 [1970] or '71 [1971] And how I became aware of it I was getting some life insurance I was getting a hundred thousand-dollar policy--partnership agreement between Daddy-O Daylie and I because we had gone we were going into business. And I didn't want something to happen to him and I would have to inheritant his beneficiaries and vice versa, he wanted the same situation. So we called this real estate agent who we knew Leo Blackburn, was with Mutal Benefit Life and so during the process of filling out the form for the insurance and the financial statements and I had to put down all my assets and you know go through the whole bit. And when I handed this I hadn't totaled anything up. I was just interested in answering questions. And after he went over this and we went to the adding machine back in those day and punching in he said, "Well you have a net worth of over a million dollars" I said "You're crazy." I said " that's not true." And he brought the paper over and showed me. That was my first knowledge that I was worth a million. I think that was an asset that I didn't no along the way. I mean your just busy doing you know they say if you can count your money you don't have very much. (laughing) So I wasn't to involved in counting at this time, at that time. I was involved in trying to achieve. And I don't think I brought an article of clothing from '69 to '74--you know, some work slacks and a shirt and I was there. You know, wore neckties occasionally at church and that was about it or a wedding or something and there wasn't too many of those in my life at that point. So I was busy. Busier than I had ever been in my life. That was the busy period in my life.
Story_ID: 6538
Speaker 1: Ernest Collins [founder of Seaway National Bank] did you know him beforehand? I mean how did he pick Jacoby Dickens?
Speaker 2: Very strangely. When I was trying to get a loan to try and go into the bowling business. I went downtown and had my package put all together and I think I was in half of dozen banks. And I got turned down by all of them. Finally the 6th or 7th bank I went to was Continental Bank and the loan officer that looked over my package and was very admiring of it and said "Well there isn't anything I have to ask you to bring." That officer's name was Roland Burris, the former attorney general of the State of Illinois. And in less than ten day I got a phone call from Mr. Burris telling me my loan had been approved. And the loan was to buy Starlite Lanes so [Holmes] Daddy-O Daylie and I went down and put up our ten percent of what we were asking for and what we were asking for was something like two hundred and sixty thousand dollars. So we had to come with five percent a piece of ten percent totally of twenty six thousand dollars. I put my thirteen thousand dollars on the table and Daddy-O put his on there and we walked out the owners of Starlite Lanes and the rest is--what we have been talking about. That was a major step though.
Speaker 1: Now what happenee here with the bank?
Speaker 2: Oh how did-- let me tell you about the how did Ernest Collins come to me. I was in pursuit of the second bowling alley this is about 1974. And I really didn't get it until 75 and I went back to Continental to make this purchase. And they told me no. Your record is good but you are just moving too fast. We would not like for you to move this fast. So Ernest Collins heard about this. He was a friend of some one down at Continental. Ernest Collins walked in the back door of the bowling alley and said "Why  don't you let Seaway do this loan?"  And I said, "Let you do it?  I'll be delighted for you to do the loan."  And I came across the street and in a couple of weeks I had the loan to buy Skyway Bowl. And that occurred in February l975 I paid my loan off in less than seven months later--from Continental Bank not at Seaway--and I brought all my business to Seaway Bank and I had a seven-year deal to pay off the loan for Skyway Bowl and I paid it off in three and a half years. Business was that good. And whenever I got ready to make a loan after that I just made a phone call and a few days later I had what I was looking for. But by this time I had a track record. I had a proven track record and I had impeccable credit and so it was not an issue. And the only place I was asking for money from that point forward was Seaway National Bank. Because now I had a relationship here and they showed me they believed in me. And I haven't borrowed any money from anywhere else--I think--in the last--for the next-- long long period of time. After becoming chairman of Seaway Bank it's not as wise to borrow money from the institution that you are  a head of and there are limitations. So on large ventures I've gotten involved in, the casino boat  and stuff like that, well then I had to take the loans outside of Seaway. I'd much rather have them here and pay the interest to Seaway. Because you know being part of the ownership I get a piece of that. But the laws just don't permit me to do that as much as I would like. So then you have to take it some where else.
Story_ID: 6539
Speaker 1: It was probably a big deal in that date to be at a downtown bank? At some point, was there a black bank at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes there were black banks and--and when I borrowed money to go at--in 1969 Seaway was here. Independence was around. That, that was about it. But I thought the numbers I was asking for was a little large in those days, for, for the banks so--when I got the loan at Continental Bank I got it under the SBA [Small Business Administration] program and it was the largest loan given to a black at that point in 1969 and we only talking about a quarter of a million dollars. You know which is miniscule by today's standards. And I think miniscule by the standards of that day. But they just weren't giving money readily to black entrepreneurs. And the reason why this institution had its beginning in 1965 because the people who started this institution could not get loans at downtown banks. They would not loan them money. They would not loan Ernest Collins who became the second chairman of this institution money in those days. So they decided to do their own thing how fortunate they did. Although today everything has changed you can go anywhere that you, where your financial statement will stand the light of day they will happily loan you some money. But we're talking about the mid 60s [1960s] now Late 60s
Story_ID: 6540
Speaker 1: Here you are, you've been in real estate, been in the bowling alley business and now your become a banker. Now what is that whole experience? Or was it a different experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's entirely a different experience. I didn't know banking. I learned my banking in that room next door to where we are sitting now, in the boardroom. I became on the board and I really learned the--more banking in that room, although I did go to school after that, but my real knowledge even it continues today. I I think I learned something for every board meeting that I chair. I think there's something to be learned. Because when you're talking about loans there is absolutely not two a like. There is no two alike. So there's always something new and different. Now mind you while all of this is going on I wasn't leaving one business and going to another. I kept those businesses as I went through all of this. Except for the real estate I sold everything off in the early seventies. The bowling business, I held that until a couple of years ago and my daughter now owns that business. The television station that we purchased we just sold them in June of '98. [1998] so all of these things were going along at the same time. It wasn't like I had left the bowling and came to the banking they were stair steps. They were business that I was running at the same time.
Speaker 1: Why did you get out of the real estate business, though? Why was there the decision to just get rid of the properties? Was it becoming too much of a hassle? To much of a management hassle ? Because real estate a lot of people say that that's the best business.
Speaker 2: And I agree that it is but the reason--you asked me for the reason why I got rid of it and the reason is this:  in the late '60s [1960s] early 70s [1970s] the advent of dope and controlled substance was getting to the point that it almost that it is today. Well it is even worst today. But--and people just simply didn't have re-, respect for you properties. You know they would tear things up and you would be rehabbing a building that was unoccupied and you put in new bathtubs and come back the next day and find them torn out and the pipes gone and all of those things. I wound up having to put someone, a watchman in the place to sleep there at night and all of these kind of things. And those are the kind of things that drove me away from that business. it was just a change I know many people who were in it and still doing well in it. My temperament wasn't of the such that I wanted to remain and continue to deal with that not only that. It was just to many other and I think easier ways to make money. I think more people are making more money in real estate today than in any other business if you look at it worldwide. But I think there are easier ways to get to whatever your desired goals are. And I chose not to remain in real estate.
Story_ID: 6541
Speaker 1: What are you proud of with, that has happened under your leadership at Seaway [National Bank] what changes have occurred? What do you feel like you have accomplished? You know in this time period.
Speaker 2: When I came to Seaway, when I became Chairman I think the size of Seaway was maybe eighty seven million dollars. Today it is in excess of a quarter of a billion dollars in assets. This isn't something that I accomplished alone. I have over two hundred employees many of which, some were here before I was and many that I have brought on board and we have a good sound functioning team. We have a history of success and we fell in the high performing category for the last fiftteen consecutive years. And high performing can be further defined as any financial institution that returns more than one percent return on its assets, is define as a high performing--we have exceeded that for over fifteen years. We're making money, we're providing a service to our community. We formed what we call a CDC Community Development Corporation whereby we buy re-, old boarded homes and rehab them from roof to the--you know--I'm back to this real estate thing but not in the same fashion. But we rehab them and, and, and put in low to moderate income families. We even give them the mortgage at a very good rate. And we've done a number of these and we've had no failures. People are proud of home ownership and they don't take it lightly. They pay their debts. Our debt ratios are very low. We think that we--No community is important if you don't have a strong financial base--people have to have financial services. And I'd like to think that we provide that and--back ten years ago you had seven or eight financial institutions in this town. That has dwindled greatly. Currently there are Community Bank of Lawndale, Highland Community Bank, Seaway National Bank--are the only three banks left. Now there's a savings and loan you know here. So there are a total of four black financial institutions. It was more than seven I said seven it was more than that at one point. So I think we've just stayed the time I don't ever see the day when there will not be a Seaway National Bank. Many of the black banks have sold. And sold to the majority. Even after I'm gone. I don't think that is going to occur here because of the kind of structure that we have set up.
Speaker 1: Now what were your plans for the future for this bank? What would you like to see you know accomplished?
Speaker 2: I like what to see what I have thought of all my life. I would like for it to be bigger. They did an interview with me on Channel 2 oh, maybe ten years ago and they asked, What do I want at this bank? I would like for it to be a billion-dollar institution and it's going to get there. Not from the standpoint of making more dollars for Jacoby but being a larger institute enables us to give more service to the community, make more loans, do all of the things that are necessary to make this a thriving community. And that' s what I want to see happen. And it's not a dream it's going to happen, it's reality it's on the path to making it just that.

Speaker 1: Mr. Dickens, what do you think would have happen to this community had Seaway [National Bank, Chicago, Illinois] not existed here? And what things have, that, you know had it not been for Seaway, that you can point to today that would not exist?
Speaker 2: Okay what would have happened to this community if it had not been a Seaway. Well there were other black banks around during our beginning in the mid 60's [1960s]. So much that has happen in the community would have happened. I think it was on a grand scale by having another financial institution here--one that was dedicated and focused to making this a viable community. We've always been the largest provider of community services. When other banks had--black banks had--ten thousand accounts and we had twenty-five. We still lead the parade in those things plus we cater more to smaller accounts. A person can come in with a hundred dollars and open an account. We have to be sensitive to those kind of needs and we have to have low to moderate income checking that people can't find at other institutions. We have a program, well we had a program where we had no money down to purchase a home. And we did that successfully for a long period of time. Now we've elevated it to one percent down. Now you can have one percent down and purchase your own home. We've done a number of those loans and I must say they have been very successful. When you look at other institutions and there bad debt ratio you will find Seaway and many of the black banks are not in that category. Believe it or not, black folks pay their debts. And we at Seaway have been successful because residents, black residents of this neighborhood have been kind enough to come in and do business with us. And because--if we had to depend on others  we would not have been successful. So we are very pleased to be in this community and to be of service to the customers that we have. We have twenty-five and thirty year customers that have been here. And we had a program here where we were giving awards out and we had to reorder--we didn't know we had as many as we had. So it turned out that we had many more thirty-year customers than we had recognized at that time.

Speaker 1: You know, in this whole era of mega-mergers, how can a bank like this stay independent?
Speaker 2: How did we [Seaway National Bank, Chicago, Illinois] stay independent? It is really not necessary for us to be bought or merge with another institution in order to be successful. Our return on assets are much higher than all of the downtown banks. Well, number one is not that we operate so much better than they do. They are much larger. As you grow in size it becomes much more difficult to return one percent of every single asset that you have in the institution. But I think we run a good ship and --How do we avoid the mergers?  We just continue to be competitive and we can be at our size and we continue to give service to our community and I think they will continue to be loyal and to bring their business and--to Seaway. And I don! t see the day when we--I don't ever want this to be anything but an independent. I would like to purchase another bank. And we have been in pursuit of that for the last ten years. And have bought one but I would love to buy other institutions. But I'd  like for those institutions that we purchase to be contiguous with the area that we find ourselves in. And I would just like to spread out and cover a much larger area.
Speaker 1: What do you feel about this whole thing that happened under the Community Investment--Community Reinvestment Act--where downtown banks you know are now making a presence here in this community--forced--it is but what are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: I think the Community Reinvestment Act was a good one even though it did increase competitiveness in my neighborhood here. Heretofore you did not find downtown institutions with the presence in the black community. They were forced by the CRA Act to come out here. Not that they're doing so much more business then they were doing before because, I'm sorry to say it, but often time people were getting on buses going downtown to take their deposits to them. Now they've just made it more convenient for people in this area to do business with them. But all banks should be sensitive to the needs of the community. And that's all what CRA was about. You should not be refused a mortgage at State and Madison because of the color of your skin. And the records will show that was occurring. And--so CRA has driven many of them to our community. But we haven't lost business, customers to them because of them coming to our community. What has happen is we're simply not growing as fast as we were before the CRA Act. Because now when people only had two or three choices now they have dozen of choices. And the primary reason why people go to certain institutions it's a matter of convenience. Why get in you car and drive to the other side of town, when there is something within in walking distance, something within a few blocks. And--so many people come to us because of their convenience. And I'd like to think others come to us for even better reasons-- they're loyal and they see what we're doing in the community and that's the reason why they will favor us with their business.
Speaker 1: Now have you learned lessons or have there been--do you have different perspectives now because you're a banker? Were there surprises that you learned? You know that you had perceptions, you know as a business person? you know and now that youre a banker you have a whole different perspective?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I have a different prospective, I don't know why everyone wouldn't do business in their own community because when you do business in your own community those dollars take five and a half to six turns before they exit the community. When you take your business out of the community the dollars are gone every day at five o'clock. So--and never to return. So I just--I just never understood and I still don't understand why everyone wouldn't bring their business to--They don't have to bring it to Seaway but bring it to an institution that's in your own neighborhood because I think that institutions that have areas in your community are more sensitive and, and more understanding to the needs of the community. We made loans here a large number of loans that people had been turned down with downtown. We understand--nobody understands this community more than we do. We live here. We live it everyday. I had a church to come to me that had five members and wanted to borrow a large sum of money. In excess of a million dollars. And with the program, I talked to the minister and we went over this, and he showed us all of his plans of what he was going to achieve and all of this. To make a long story short I wound up doing that loan. And I'm not sorry because it has worked out to be very successful. I must admit that he did get some help from the superior organizations. You know like the Methodists have something that's above the churches and they kind of help guarantee a part of the loan. But today that is a very successful church--this was almost seven--no, this was a seven year loan and this was about five years ago. There right own target, there right on target. Their membership has grown multi numbers they have a day care center in it. That particular church is in Matteson Illinois. You know, so it's not right here but it's very successful. Very successful. But you gotta believe. You don't loan money to buildings I guess that's your collateral but you also loan to people. And if you have an understanding and a commitment and I think many things--he wasn't able to get this loan anywhere else even with the conditions I had named. But we gave it to him. But that's just many of examples of what occurs. It only occurs because we understand it we know it better than other people. You know it more than numbers on a paper. You have to see a little bit further.
Speaker 1: What is your philosophy about--business and the black community. Because from the time you first got involved in business and now there's been a big difference, a difference in terms of maybe the types of business people are in involved in, you know, the opportunities. And I==and I the reason why I asking this question is you said your philosophy that it is better to keep things within the community. But you--my point what is your philosophy there are a lot of young MBAer that didn't cut their teeth, they cut their teeth in school and--.
Speaker 2: We don't have to go downtown to open a business. There are 400 billion dollars being spent in the black community today. It's more than that today. Because I think those are 1998 numbers. You can open a business in the black community if you're giving the community what it wants at competitive prices I think that you can do, do, do well. I'll admit that too much of it--sometimes we think that leaving our community we can get colder ice somewhere else. I mean I'm using that as an example but we need to give own communities an opportunity. You know if you're buying stale bread from a grocery store if you go and buy all the bread the next day your going to get some fresh bread. that's that's pushing the point a little far. But I just think we need to make a concentrated effort to do business in our own community. Seaway Bank has two hundred forty plus employees. We're an equal opportunity employer, we havea couple Caucasians in that mix. But my point is simply this. We are hiring people in our own neighborhoods. People don't have to drive downtown or take public transportation. Many of my employees walk to work. Because we're right here. And whenever I hire someone in this community I think that's--that helping the entire community. Because now there's another income that can afford to raise their families and have a good life.

Speaker 1: Do you think the Civil Rights Movement was a good or bad thing?
Speaker 2: Outstandingly a good thing. I'm fortunate enough to have--to have been born prior to this Civil Rights Movement. I remember what life was like prior to, and I certainly remember what it's like today. When blacks are in the highest economic position that they've ever been in the history of this country. And much of that and much of that can be contributed to the Civil Rights Movement. We've lost some ground in the more recent years. There are some thing people you know now talking anti-affirmative action. You know I was on a panel at a downtown place a year or so ago and I was asked the question "Do you think Affirmative action is necessary?" And I thought I would give him a shock and I said "No." And a little rumble in the room and I said "I haven't finished I said no, if I had the ability to forget the period to 1615 until today, then I would say no to affirmative action. But since I don't have that ability to forget all of the occurrence that have occurred against black folks then I would have to say affirmative action should be and should continue to be a viable part of our philosophies for this country. We have a lot of undoing to do and we haven't came close to achieving that."
Speaker 1: Well what about the brain drain that's occurred, you know, in the black community? What about people who say that, you know,  it was better then?. We had everything in our community--we had our doctors, we had our lawyers, we had our teachers you know we had everything here. And we had people who--we had people in the community that people could actually look up to and say they wanted to be like. What about that?
Speaker 2: We--. That was important. All of those things were so important to have it in our own community. But I'm not going to substitute today for that period. We need to continue to have some of those philosophies that we had in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s]. And we need to think more about doing business with each other as opposed to continue to take our dollars away. But I think there's--there's much to be learned about that period and certainly we should take more of those lessons to today. Because it is just so important as a community--. You know we're never going to have respect from the rest of the world when--if we don't have respect for our own community. We must continue to work on that. You know the greatest problem we have in this country is crime and unemployment. And I think I have answer to both and that answer is simply education. With education an individual has something to give. And he also has something to lose if he violates the law. To those individuals who are uneducated and don't have anything better to look forward to than going to jail or doing something so they can go to jail so they can get three meals and a place to sleep. We have a sick society. So we need not only to have better education I think in order for people to go to college we need to get more involved in that process. You know we can go to grammar school and high school for free. I don't know there needs to be some work done so that people can go get involved in higher ed and much lower numbers than there are today. I think it is criminal for a child today to go to a community a wind up with a ten, twenty thousand dollar debt. That they start off their adult life with a debt of twenty thousand. And the only thing there trying to do is get an education to try and improve themselves. We need to do it better. We got dollars to spend in every country, we're helping here and we're helping there and we're leaving too many things undone here at home.

Speaker 1: You've been very involved at Chicago State [University] Why do you--why have you been involved in that way and you've adopted them sort of over the years you know your name is emblazoned (laughing) I told my father (laughing) while I was there I saw Jacoby Dickens's building. But why, why that institution, and why--you know?
Speaker 2: They have up to some point up to ten thousand young students in that institution. If youre looking to help somewhere you want to help as many as you can. And Chicago State just so happen to have the highest concentration of desirous young men and women in the city of Chicago, in one place. It's in my neighborhood.  And I have other motives. I have many of my employees that come from Chicago State. And they come prepared to hit the ground running. I'm--the school of business has produced a number of our stars at Seaway National Bank. I even have some of my upper level management in teaching programs--they teach classes over there at night. So Chicago State is just--sure, it's my pride and joy. But it's my pride and joy for what it produces. It produces young men and women who are going to be become tax paying citizens. And that's what we all want in this life. There going to be able to live there lives at a level at which they think is important. That's very important to me. And the other thing, when you support an institution like that--these are kids that are not forced to go there. In high school you gotta go and if you don't go the truant officer pick you up. But they made the step to go there so we need to help them stay there. And we need to help them not leave what this burdensome of--even in an institution like that students leaving with twenty thousand dollars [debt] I think it's criminal. We can give more to higher ed and particular--here's a state institution. And often it is thought of as having all the dollars it needs. State of Illinois only furnishes about forty seven percent for the budget for that university. That other fifty three percent has to come from where else? From the students, and our ability to raise dollars over there has to cover the rest of that. So it is very important that, I think, that the country gets on a program to help our young people to achieve--diplomas in higher ed, in higher education, and not have them leave with this big debt. Because too often they drop out along the way. And you know who's the loser there? The country is the loser you know. We need more success stories. And I think Chicago State is playing a big role in that. We're the lowest--it's the cheapest institution to go to in the state of Illinois of all the state universities. Our fees are low they should not be because we have greater needs. We got to try and keep them low so that low to moderate income families can afford to come to us to get an education.

Speaker 1: Now I want to go back to the TV deal--the TV station? What interest you on that? What was your sitting here you're a bank president, you got your bowling alleys--
Speaker 2: Bank chairman.
Speaker 1: Bank chairman, sorry. You got your bowling alleys, but you what--are you perceived in town as a deal maker or people bringing deals to you? What, what was the source-was this a group of people you know?
Speaker 2: Opportunities--one needs to always place themselves in a position of being able to take advantage of an opportunity. There was someone that wrote that it is better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have it happen, than not be prepared and have it happen. You know, here is this wonderful opportunity that has been brought to your feet and you're unable to do anything about it. I was just fortuneate enough to have the opportunity to come--along with some other people, we had a number of stockholders in both of these television stations--and I I thought it would be a good deal. We did it a long time ago over twenty years ago when the government was trying to get more minorities involved into the media. This provided--we were able to buy both of those stations. We brought them at different times but--I think we paid about three million dollars for the first one which was a tremendous bargain. And it, that station was a A-,  NBC affiliate in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The second station was a ABC station in Bangor, Maine. And we brought both of them at decent prices. We didn't make a lot of money along the way. The real upswing came when we sold them. We sold them in 1998--and at an appreciated value. (Laughing) a very handsome value.
Speaker 1: Now (unclear) (laughing) I was just thinking--You know how I understand your use of discretion but you know--and there are people out here that are like banding around (laughing) it's understated. Okay is that--the group that you were involved in were they friends of yours? Who were the people who were involved in the TV station?
Speaker 2: Some I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: Some of the people that were involved were individuals that I knew. There were a lot of doctors, dentist, medical physician some business people. Some I knew some I didn't. But we were all pulled together as a result of this and presented with an opportunity. It was a much larger group. Everyone did not choose to go in. Those that chose to go in we were in that venture for in excess of twenty years all together. And everyone did well everyone did well, you know as a result of that buying in. You know, that--it turned out to be a good opportunity.

Speaker 1: With your whole thing with your casino gambling--okay you were a part of that. Because that was noted in the paper, it was only, well all the names weren't listed. I remember reading an article, your name but there were a lot of names I don't know if they were listed. But what are your thoughts? Why was that an opportunity for you and why were you interested?  I know it means a lot of money. (laughing)
Speaker 2: Then that answered the big part of the question. (laughing)
Speaker 1: (Laughing.) A cash cow. But why were you eager to get involved in that? I want to ask that question.
Speaker 2: Opportunity--being prepared in the event opportunity comes along. I had no thoughts about being in the casino business ten years ago. But then as I read and saw what great opportunity these things and the kind of dollars they produce, I said it would be wonderful if an opportunity came along. I put together a group seven--six or seven years ago. And we put up a million dollars as a warchest to seek to get a boat in Chicago was our goal, is to get one of the five boats in Chicago. And we spent a lot of money in pursuit of that. But as you know that simple hasn't occurred. If you want what my thoughts as to what may happen as far as Chicago is concerned, I think Meigs Field may very well wind up being a land-based situation. I know some people have talked about it being a park when the airport days our over with--I think it has only a couple of years in the agreement with [Jim] Edgar that--it would then come to Chicago. But I think it may be a park but a casino park, a land based, and I think the city of Chicago may run the whole operation. Back to why I think--I just think as you said, is a cash cow. And if we're able to get pass this lawsuits which I say are unjust. you know it's some people who are saying we should have got it. Well everyone can't get it. Someone did get it. And it's going to work out. I think when we finally get a judge and sit and look at the facts on the issue the people who have it now will have it then. Now you made a statement that not all the names were shown. This is very public information they may not have been shown on the first statement, in the listing in the newspaper, but all of the names have been shown. Because you can't hide anything here. The application for membership that you have to go through the Gaming Commission here is about an inch thick. And I forget the number of pages but it took me two weeks with my CPAs and my attorney to get through all of this application and to make sure. You have to tell them about every thing that has occurred in your life in terms of business, the kind of licenses you've held, who you were in business with--just total details. So if you got any skeletons in your closet I strongly recommend that you do not apply for the ownerships in one of these boats. Because you know it may not be in your best interest to have these unknowns known about you so-- You have to be clean and forthcorning and you have to tell them about everything. The investigation even on myself is not over with. Matter of fact it is barely begun. They check the basic things your earnings if you paid income tax that's easy. They can do that over the computer in a few minutes. But when they start checking character references and all this, this investigation may go on for as long as two years. And I don't have real problem with that. Because you know what they are trying to do. They are trying to keep out the wrong element out of this business. So I think it is a wonderful opportunity that I was happy to go into because it doesn't require me. At this point in my career I don't want things where I have to put in a lot of time. I don't even have to go to a meeting. I have the best watch dog in the country watching this operation--that's the State of Illinois. And I'm sure you understand exactly where I'm coming from here. It's a wonderful opportunity and I was delighted to have been asked. And I think I was very fortunate to have been asked.
Story_ID: 6548
Speaker 1: In your business deals, did you do business with you know, friends, or you know people you got to know, were there--? 'Cause there's a lot of discussion in the black community that people don't--you know, "crabs in a barrel" type philosophy. Has that been true in, you know, in your particular experience?
Speaker 2: I don't think so because I haven't did --Too often we don't form partnerships, where a group of us will go in and buy a much bigger business. If you'll look at success stories across the country and black entrepreneurs, they're all sitting in a little white ivory tower, up there by themselves. And not too many people have been brought along at the partnership level with them. They are successful, but usually they are successful by themselves. And that's not negative in many respect. John [H.] Johnson [of Johnson Publishing Company] is probably the largest black in the country in terms of business. It's a private company, and he does it very well. Look at success stories across the country. Now is that--How does that equate to what's happening today? Too often today our smartest and brightest are involved in corporate America. And they get pigeonholed up there in corporate America. The old story of the glass ceiling eventually comes into place. I think we may have three or four minorities who are heads of Fortune 500 companies today, but that's miniscule, in my estimation of what it should be. I think the people of today are not as hungry as we were--as I was in the 40s , 50s and 60s. So they have a wider range in which they can go at making a living. They can go and make 100,000 dollars working for someone. That--I never had a job working for someone else where I made 30,000 dollars. Not in my entire life. The only way I made money was working for myself. So sometime this kind of knocks us off a bit, when we can have that his and hers BMW and have the big home and sometimes I think that limits us because then we become contented because we can go to the spa and take vacations and live the life but--I think having your own business--Look at all the other successes that you can bring along with you. I have 240 families and many of that 240 families are living as a result of Seaway National Bank being a viable business and I make a grand living out of it myself. But at the same time, look at all the other people that are, that are being helped. And I need every one of them. If I didn't need em, they wouldn't be here. So it's not like it's--I'm giving them anything. They are earning their keep. So, I just think our brightest young people today ought to be thinking more about business. Doing their own thing. When you got a job, that's really what you have. And someone pays you a prescribed amount of money, and you live within the confines of that and you don't have much room to expand out of that. Your only hope is promotions and cost of living and those kind of things. You know, which won't get you there. You'll live a good life, but it won't get you to true wealth. It just can't. You can't get there with it, you know? Stock options and golden and platinum parachutes are not available--as available to many of us as they are for others.
Story_ID: 6549
Speaker 1: How do you think this the--what I talked about, some feeling of the lack of mentorship that goes on? Do you think that, that (unclear)? The perspective about that? I don't know. I think there's more mentorship today. I know its available, and I know we have more success stories to draw upon than we had, had early on. Why more of it is not being taken advantage of, I don't know. At Chicago State [University] we have a mentorship program, whereby we go out and get Fortune 500 executives, CEOs to mentor students at Chicago State. And we have many black entrepreneurs that are in the mentorship program. I realize this is a very small part of a big problem. But I just think more is available e today. And with education, and going to college and getting a degrees, it just opens up--Or it should opens up worlds and worlds to you. There isn't enough-- What's the word that you used? There isn't enough communication going on among us. We need to do a better job of that. We need to be more open and receptive to the phone calls that we have, that ask us to come and speak to the student body, and to different things. I, I always tell the story, one of my trips to Chicago State, I was asked to speak to the class of business. And when I finished talking to them, one of the young students stood up and said, "Mr. Dickens, I had the impression that people in your position were born wealthy."  And he said, "Based on some of the things you said to me, you were poor." And I said, "I'd like to correct you there. I was never poor. We just didn't have any money. Because poor is strictly a condition of the mind and I never allowed those conditions to enter into my mind." So, you know we, we, we--and the questions and answers, these kids can ask some questions. And believe you me, I think it helps me more than it helps some of them. Some of the questions that they ask. I always look forward to those exchanges. You know?
Speaker 2: Besides your father which--there's--that's a beautiful. I've never really--You don't hear that much.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: You know a lot of times, people say, "My father was missing, or (unclear)." But I have a similar relationship with my father. But besides your father, who influenced you in your life? Were there people that you've not mentioned today? Or that influenced you, or that you admire greatly, or--?
Speaker 1: I had many people that I admired greatly. People that I had personal contact with. there were a few of those. But I, I always thought that I took my inspiration from everybody. I thought everyone that was, was a success. I thought that was--I thought that person helped me although I never talked to them personally, I, I never had the contact, I never had the ability to ask them questions, but I had the ability to observe from a distance. And, and admire. And,and have a lot of respect for their achievements and, and what they accomplished. And so many of the success stories have been--an inspiration to me, and continue to be today.
Speaker 2: Okay. What about our leadership, our black leadership? People say that--There are some people who say that we don't really need black leaders.  There are other people who say,  You know this is, you know, that Jesse Jackson is our leader,  or you know, Farrakhan is our leader--I mean but--Do you have any views on black leadership and its role--you know and, and--?
Speaker 1: I think we always need leaders. There is a certain segment of our population that leans heavily on having leaders than others. I subscribe to having strong leadership. I don't mean necessarily civil rights or what have you. Those are important. I think they're important and I support them. I think our business leaders should be playing a bigger role in helping to perpetuate the--a wide range of young men and women to become, to get into business. I'm just hung up on this. I've had a little bit of success in this area and I'm just sold to it all the way. And I, I it's--every time I get the opportunity to talk to students, I talk about these areas. I have many students that I have sponsored. and my wife and I are still sponsoring kids in the Link Program. I don't mean the debutante ball. We have a Link Unlimited Program where we get sponsors for kids through and send them to private high schools. And even --the program doesn't help them after they graduate from high school but the sponsors for the program often time get so attached to these kids; they help them all the way through. I had at least three students that are officers in Seaway National Bank, that came from these kinds of programs. And I've been with this for over 25 years now. a long, long period. And presently we have three children that we are sponsoring, paying their tuition through high school. And having some other kind of relationship with them. The most recent thing we--I'm not Catholic, but it so happens that these three kids are Catholic. I went to the Catholic, I went to the mass with them two Sundays ago. And it was kind of nice. It was like a family. And then we left there and we went to 39th and Michigan to that new restaurant there and we had brunch together. And I got some of the smart--I never had smart kids of my own (chuckle). But in this program, all three of these kids made the honor roll. And they are not at any easy kind of situations. You know, they are at some of the better high schools in the city of Chicago. And they are, they are, they are achieving. So I--This is exhilarating to me to me to and, and, and to see this thirst and the interest that they have. And you know, I got one kid that's straight 'A'  all of last year. And straight 'A', he's got one 'B plus' and he was ready to call in his congressman (chuckle) to investigate why he got that 'B plus'. And , you know, it's exciting. And it's just so wonderful to see kids doing well. And the one. . This is a boy, a male. Manzilli Davis (ph.). What a kid. Thirst, always great grades. And you know when we talk about black males being the dying society , it's wonderful to be in the presence of some of those that don't fit into this mold. Cause they're not all like that. Too many of em are. And we need to do whatever is necessary to get more of em in this stage where they're motivated to do well. You know. And I'm still trying to find out why Manzilli, who comes from a family of five, he is the only one that has this kind of desire and drive. You know, he has four sisters. And usually it's the females that are the ones who are the achievers. But he just stands out there and I keep quizzing him, and I haven't quite found out but we have three more years together. And I'm gonna keep grilling and I'm gonna find out what's inside of this guy that makes him have this desire. Because Manzilli has this work. I mean study. He just doesn't show up in classroom and leaves and pass the exam. He works at it. I mean, so it's just not all a gift. This kid works. And he--I'm sorry, I'd like--I invited him to a [Chicago] Bulls game. He said, "I can't go because I'm--" (chuckle) He's working!. I said "The kid doesn't want to go and see the Bulls play?" You know? Not that they're that great a team (chuckle) but  I didn't much want to go, but I thought I was offering him an opportunity to him (laughter).

Speaker 1: Do you have thoughts about the role of the church and how it plays in the black--You know what role it plays? (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Well there's a saying in the black community, and its true. "More money changes hand on Sunday morning than any other day of the week." Now that's not true in other communities. But on Sunday mornings, I have a facility [bank] that we used to leave open on Sundays. For the simple reason that the treasurers of the churches wanted to come and deposit that money so they could have immediate access, which is good banking, I mean good business to do it that way. But it just shows you we have a very large number of churches. I'm--I believe in God Almighty and I go to a lot of different churches. I don't have any particular church that I go to singly all the time. And part of the reason being, we finance, Seaway [National] Bank finances more churches I think than anyone in Chicago. And it's been very successful for us. We've never had a failure with a black church. And--so as a result of that I have to go and show my presence at these churches. And so I get around to quite a few in the run of a year. So I'm (unclear). What do I think of it? Whatever brings people together and helps to take them in the right directions, you, you got to be in support of that.

Speaker 1: What about politics in the black community? What do you--What are your feelings about that? I mean, you know--as a businessperson, what, what role do you see politics playing? Or have played?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think politics played a very vital and important role. It should--We should all exercise the right to vote. When you look at the vote in a presidential election being slightly less than 50 per cent, we are--Here we are electing someone to lead this country and less than 50 per cent of the eligible voters go to the poll. Back to our community, we can do anything that we want, in the city of Chicago. People say, "When do you think we will have the next black mayor [of Chicago, Illinois]?" We will have the next black mayor when we decide, we being the entire community--when we are able to galvanize around candidate and say, "We think this gentleman will be a good mayor." That's the day we will have a good mayor. There's one other thing we have to do. We got to put on a strong voter registration drive. We got to get all the eligible voters in a position to vote, you know, because blacks often times move a lot. And you know, if you register in one location and you move next door, you're not eligible anymore until you reregister. So we got to do that kind of house cleaning. And it will happen whenever we decided its going to happen. What is my prospect as to when this will happen? I don't have a clue. Because I cannot identify that individual that has the ability to bring all segments of our community together, the way it was in the period of Harold Washington.
Speaker 1: So what were your views of' Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: Well, very good one. I was chairman of Harold's re-election committee , his last time around. And on the Finance Committee the first time around, when we couldn't buy a television spot. So we had five gallon drums with the lids tied on and, welded on, and a slot in there, and having the people to drop money (chuckle) in those slots. So we could go out and buy television commercials. You know because television stations are not going to give you any credit to a politician. And I really and truly understand it. And it wasn't just Harold Washington, They wouldn't give any credit to anyone who--in that situation. But politics is very important. Any time someone is making a decision about your life, I think you ought to have a hand in choosing who that individual is going to be, and who is going to represent you. So to vote is just one of the more important things in our lives. And not too many of us--Too many of us do not exercise that right. The question comes, what is my-- what difference is my one vote going to do?  Well if enough people say that, it's the difference in who's president of the United States. And you can ask Mr. [President Bill] Clinton about that. He can tell you that. And speaking of Mr. Clinton, I think he's an excellent President and he in this period until .January when he goes out, I think he's gonna be even a better President, than he's been in the past. See because we should not have politicians running for the next period the day after they are elected. So I don't think a President of the United States ought to have two terms limit. I think it ought to be a six-year term and you're out of here. Because then we get the best of him from the very first day. He doesn't have to start running for re-election right after he's elected. And  also with representatives. , people who are representing communities. Maybe I would consider a little longer period for them. But I don't want them re-elected. I want them elected one time and you go on your way.
Speaker 1: What do you think Harold Washington's legacy was? What was his legacy?
Speaker 2: Integrity beyond belief. Harold--really didn't like money. I'm serious. That was not a goal for Harold Washington. So how can you buy an individual that doesn't have any real desires to--for making any money? You know, that's what contaminates most of us. is the desire to have money. And too often our political, people are elected and then they start running in the circles with the people who have money. And then they try to live like 'em and as a result of trying to live like em, they find themselves in an area doing wrong things. And wind up getting caught. It just makes me sick to think about the mole coming to Chicago with 50,000 dollars and almost able to contaminate 50 per cent of our city council [in the FBI investigation "Operation Silver Shovel"]. There are many strong black representatives there that were not contaminated by, and I owe an undying respect to them. But those people who could he had for $5,000 weren't worth very much to begin with.

Speaker 1: What are your feelings about George Johnson and what he was able to do in this (unclear)?
Speaker 2: One of my shining armors. Here's a gentleman who didn't start with wealth to put it mildly. He tells the story of he and his two brothers going up and down the alleys around Giles in. in the 37th, 38th, wherever they lived down there and collecting pop bottles and taking them and getting a deposit. See that's the kind of thing that inspires me when I would read and--I happen to know Mr. Johnson--and hear the stories that he told, and how he rose to the level that he rose to. And I just think it's to he admired. And I, I'm just so pleased and happy for him, because --In addition to that, he's one of the nicest persons you'll ever know.

Speaker 1: Dempsey Travis?
Speaker 2: Dempsey Travis, entrepreneur. Dempsey Travis tough businessman. One who doesn't take much quarter from anyone. But no matter what you say about Dempsey Travis he is a successful person. And in many ways the most, one of the most likeable persons that you'll ever know. He's just a tough businessman and , you know. I, I don't hold that against him. I, I think that he--I know that he's done well. I know that he's done well.
Story_ID: 6554
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I came through this life and I was able to ha-, make some achievements. I was really able to provide for my family and really gave them more than they needed (chuckle). And I was able to help a few other people along the way. And after I'm gone, I think that will be my legacy. Because I don't think--I don't think my children are entitled to everything that I have earned. Just being my child is not enough. They're gonna have enough. But I'm going to benefit many other people as a result of my efforts. And I have a foundation. Its a private foundation and in this foundation much of my assets are gonna be left. And I'm already distributing some of it. You made mention of Chicago State earlier, I gave a sizeable donation to them and I will continue the rest of my life. There are many favorite organizations that I have, the Urban League. anything that's involved with helping our youths. I'm not trying to sound like a great guy, but that's just the way. the way i.t is. And if I have any legacy at all I think it will be there.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: Anything else I'd like to say? We've been talking here for--
Speaker 1: (Laughing) I know (unclear)
Speaker 2: An extended
Speaker 1: (Laughing)
Speaker 2: --period of time and I think your questions have been good and incisive. And I hope I have been half as good, as good as the questioner. (Laughing).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (unclear) Okay, thank you.
