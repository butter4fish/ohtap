Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Aurie Pennick, A-U-R-I-E, P-E-N-N-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alma, A-L-M-A.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind Aurie?
Speaker 2: It's my mother's [Aurie Watts Baines] name and the story is she pronounced it Ari as you have.  I pronounce it Ori only because I wanted to be different from my mother and as a child saying Ari was a little harder than saying Ori, so that's the story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Does it have anything to do with gold?  I mean, it's--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: It, it sounds like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother is from the South.  Her mother [Amanda Watts] named her Aurie and my mother named me after her.  My sister's name was Artelia [Artelia Watts], so we both had very unique sounding names, but I don't know of any story behind it other than it was mother's name, as it--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: As her middle name was Alma as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born December 22, 1947, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm the executive director and treasurer of the Field Foundation of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is September 28, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, it's December 29th, isn't it?  I mean, you had me saying December (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, twenty--yeah.

Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People- (cough) People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask and, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: God, a favorite food.  Chocolate, I guess, if it's considered a food, I don't know (laughter), I mean.
Speaker 1: It is.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I don't think I do.  I don't think I do.  I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Usually late summer, early fall.  I guess I'd say late summer, yeah, that's my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, I do.  Mexico.  Yeah, Mexico.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the final one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  Play the hand you're dealt.  I learned that from my mother [Aurie Watts Baines].
Story_ID: 326914
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Burrell Baines] side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Aurie, A-U-R-I-E, Watts, W-A-T-T-S [Aurie Watts Baines].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 6, two thousand--I'm sorry, September 6, nine--one, nine, o'six [1906].  She was born in a small town in Alabama that doesn't exist anymore to my knowledge, so you might as well say Daphne.
Speaker 1: Daphne--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Alabama.
Speaker 1: Daphne, Alabama, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is that the town that doesn't exist or--
Speaker 2: Daphne exists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the town that she was born in had either merged into Daphne or no longer exists.
Speaker 1: Do you know--
Speaker 2: When she was born, there were no records of these particular places.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the place?
Speaker 2: I don't.  It's--it starts with a C but she told me it didn't exist anymore as a--as a small town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace her side of the family?
Speaker 2: You know, we were--my mother--my family is a very working class family from the South and not a whole lot of academics coming out of that.  I think I and my--a couple of my cousins were the first to, to get advanced degrees and so we never really did a lot of tracing.  And my friends used to tease me because my mother lived to be--my grandmother [Amanda Watts] lived to be a hundred and my mother lived to be ninety-two and my aunt lived to be ninety-seven, and one of the reasons we didn't do any tracing is 'cause we kind of lived among our ancestors in a way.  So I don't know much about my grandmother other than what she would tell me, and she was one of--she was a daughter of a freed slave, don't know more than that.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a daughter of a freed slave.  I don't know how that could be and at the time she was giving--you know, passing on these tidbits, she didn't give us a lot of understanding about that.
Speaker 1: So she--there was a story about--is there a story about how, how she became free?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I mean, as I said, I was very young because my mother had me when she was--later in life.  My mother had me when she was forty, so I was sent south to, you know, mingle with my cousins.  My grandmother at that time was in her nineties and so she would just make statements that I, you know, as a child never really paid much attention to; I'm sorry that I didn't.  But I know she married young and I know that there were thirteen siblings, thirteen children.  My, my mother had twelve siblings.  And somehow my grandfather was able to purchase land and we're not still sure how that all happened, but there were many acres of land by many, many in southern terms for African Americans anyway, about ten to twelve acres of land that was owned by my grandmother and my grandfather, and that's the land on which she raised her children and left it to them when she--when she passed.  But I really don't know very much about my grandmother.  As I said, my mother had me when she--rather late in life.  And so when I went south it was really, you know, to just hang around with my cousins as opposed to sit at the knee of my grandmother and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --learn some history.
Speaker 1: --as far as you know, the family was--you know, was in that part of Alabama before--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the Civil War and after.
Speaker 2: Right, as far as I know, right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That seems to be the, the beginning of, of that part of the, the family.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother have any good stories about--or any bad stories, really, about life then?
Speaker 2: The only bad stories I recall--and again as I said, I was very young, I mean, she died at a hundred but I was still about fifteen or sixteen, was losing two of her children, one to ptomaine poisoning from some pan--canned peaches, and the other was lost in World War II [WWII], I believe; I'm thinking it was World War II.  And that's--those were her two sons.  She had thirteen children, nine girls, four boys, and two of the boys died very young.  And so that's the only stories she would ever tell me about.  She was--basically was a working woman.  She worked in the fields a lot.  When I went south, I got my taste of picking cotton and trying to feed chickens or turkeys or whatever they were.  I mean, I was a city girl so none of this really made a lot of sense to me.  So we didn't do a lot of talking.  I mean, I basically went down with my cousins and got familiar with, you know, another part of my family and life, but there was no--a lot of sharing of stories 'cause we basically had to work.  I mean, we basically did the work, the chores as they were called in the morning so we could all go do whatever we want to do in the afternoon, so when I was there during the summer, we basically did chores.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was your grandfa- father alive?
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't.  I don't even know--my grandfather had passed before I was born.
Story_ID: 326915
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Aurie Watts Baines] talk about growing up down there?
Speaker 2: She did.  I mean, she liked coming from a big family.  She thought it was one of the things I had missed 'cause she had only had the two daughters, myself and my sister [Artelia Watts].  And she enjoyed having the sibling--the sibling rivalry and the, the fun and the doing things together and, and really kind of surviving as a--as a group, kind of a group survival thing that she thought was very important and, and, and helped her family, which was, as I said, a very poor, maybe not necessarily by those standards because they did have land.  But, you know, there was--there was no education.  There was no really going off to school.  Most people could hope to do was to, to go and get what was then called a tenth grade education, at least where my mother was coming from was, was the best you could get, and she was not even--didn't even--wasn't even aware of, you know, there being a twelfth grade until she moved to Chicago [Illinois], and she was well into her thirties and forties then.  So, you know, tenth grade was the, the--what you aspired to in, in--when she was growing up.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the school that she went to?
Speaker 2: The name of the school--God, I would know this.  I--she used to tell me about it.  It was in Baldwin County [Alabama].  It may have been Baldwin County High School [Bay Minette, Alabama], Baldwin County outside of Mobile [Alabama], but I, I can't remember the name of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Daphne [Alabama] is near, near the coast.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's right outside Mobile.  It's about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --twenty-five miles outside of Mobile.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did your mother come to Chicago?
Speaker 2: She came to Chicago--I was born in '47 [1947].  She came in like '42 [1942], '43 [1943].  And she was the first of her siblings, in fact, took some flak for that.  I mean, that was not what good Christian southern women did, go to the North, the big city, all alone.  She had met a person, a friend of a person who was a hair stylist, a beautician as they were called then, and my mother thought she could do that and thought that was interesting.  But according to her, her most important thing was she wasn't gonna pick anymore cotton.  That was just not for her and that seemed to be the only, you know work there.  And she'd also heard in those days if you can't--you know, you can make it in Chicago when you can't make it any place else.  So that was, you know, her, her reasoning that she'd come and become a beautician and, you know, make her living here.  And so she came in '42 [1942] I believe.  It was about five years before I was born.  And then she met my father [Burrell Baines] who--in fact, met him on the Pullman--he was a Pullman porter, so she met him on the train coming to Chicago, the Hummingbird.  And so then they married and here I am.
Story_ID: 326916
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Burrell, B-U-R-R-E-L-L, B-A--Watt--Baines, B-A-I-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: B-A-I-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Burrell Baines, all right.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Don't know.  He died when I was seven years old, so I don't know much about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd only met a few before he died and then, you know, my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] and that side of the family didn't get along very well.  I knew he was a Pullman porter.  He had been a Pullman porter for, for several years.  He had worked his way up--I guess, I guess there was a pecking order of--you know, how you--you don't start as a Pullman porter, you may start as a shoe shine boy or whatever.  And he worked his way up and had some riff with his family about him being gone all the time as a Pullman porter and not being--they--some of them were located here in Chicago [Illinois].  Some were located in other parts of the South and I'm not--I believe Mississippi, but I'm not sure.  And so there was some tension between his always being traveling.  It was--again, it was not the traditional thing to do for, at least his family thought for a black man.  They wanted him to stay and, and, you know, be, be more supportive of the, the family core.  And then when he and my mother married, again, someone who was a little more independent than even they had wanted, who--you know, her family was in the South and she was here alone, it just kind of really created a--even more of a, a schism between his family and, and he.  And then he died when I was seven years old, so I only knew him--'cause he traveled a lot.  I mean, we'd go and meet him at the train station when the Hummingbird would come in.  He'd be home for some times, three or four days, then he'd go again and so it was, you know, very hard for me to get to know him as a father because he wasn't around all the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, porters are gone a lot--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, a lot, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So my mother basically--even though, you know, they were together raised me as a, a single parent because his--the money he made was fairly good, good money, but my mother always wanted to own a home, so she was always, you know, stocking it away.  So she started working, and she had then taken the course to do hair and she was doing hair part-time.  Then, she decided she wanted to do something else and be a caterer.  In fact, my father could cook as well as she would tell it then, so they'd sometimes have these cooking competitions and she realized that, you know, she could cook as well as or better than he.  And so she wanted to do something like catering and so she started, you know, hiring herself out as a caterer.  And so she really started making pretty decent money doing hair and then catering, and so--
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she start it before your father died or afterwards?
Speaker 2: She must've--no, that was going on before he died.  I mean, that was one of the things that when he passed--and there was some--and I was--a, a lot of this--I as I said, I was seven years old, I don't really understand.  There was some concern about whether because of some legal issues--now, as a lawyer I probably could understand, but as a child, I was not privy to that she could even get social security for me.  I guess he had older children and there was some question about me even being entitled to social security, which she never got.  And so she continued with the two jobs, the, the doing hair on weekends and catering and as she called it, serving parties during the week, so that's how we lived.
Story_ID: 326917
Speaker 1: Can you describe their personalities [Pennick's parents, Aurie Watts Baines and Burrell Baines] and tell us who do you think you take after or, or what--
Speaker 2: That's interesting, yeah (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) parts of--
Speaker 2: What I know about my father and I guess what I think I probably take from my father based on my mother, my ability to talk.  He was a talker which, you know, made it good being a Pullman porter.  People liked him a lot.  He was very outgoing.  He loved to dance.  I love to dance.  He thought he was a singer.  My mother said he couldn't sing but he thought he was, and I can sing, or at least I could.  So I think some of that outgoing, you know, love of life, dancing, singing kind of thing, I definitely take from him.  And I remember we used to have little singing--when, when he was home, we'd, you know, listen to the radio or something and we'd just start singing songs, and that was always fun because, you know, it was--it was fun to do.  My mother was always very serious and even--I, I shouldn't say always very serious 'cause she had a very weird sense of humor which I also inherited from her.  But certain things, she, she always believed in it's not just enough to, to do for yourself, and I think that was part of growing up with the, the twelve siblings, that, you know, your comfort should only be as comfortable as the next person's.  And if something is hurting the next person, it ought to hurt you.  And I kind of grew up with that.  And it--and, and that part of her personality I think is--was instilled in me and I kind of resented as a child, quite frankly, 'cause I always--she used to always say, and, and, you know, she grew up during the Depression [Great Depression] and if you make a dollar, save a dime, and, you know, and I'm--it's always so hard to do.  I mean, you know, why do I have to save a dime?  I wanna spend the whole dollar.  I mean--that kind of thing or her phrase about the frivolous dollar which--I mean, my mother wasn't very--she didn't know a lot of big words, but frivolous was one of those (laughter) she knew well.  And her--you know, she used to always say, that frivolous dollar, before you spend that frivolous dollar, can you make it meaningful by giving it to somebody else that really needs that dollar?  Before you buy that piece of candy you don't really need, can you give it to the church for--you know, and so, you know, as a child, I'm like well, God, here I have this burden.  I mean, why can't I just enjoy stuff like everybody else?  I gotta worry about whether this dollar is really frivolous, whether I really need to do this.  And so--I mean, that was--growing up, it was kind of tough because none of my friends had this kind of, you know, cloud hanging over them about what they do with their spending money and their allowance and stuff, so it was kind of tough.  But I, I think I inherited a lot of that from her because, you know, very early on, I, I all--I became very conscious around--of, of people around me suffering or not doing as well as I or being very thankful for when I was doing better than some others and, and recognizing, you know, sometimes was probably more love than anything.  And the other thing she--my mother was a, a Whist player.  She was a Whist player and she smoked, so you know that was really (laughter) a seriously independent woman for the '40s [1940s] from, from, from the South.  But she used to say things like, you know--and that's why she hated Bid Whist.  She thought Bid Whist was, you know, for, for people who really couldn't--for non-card players, for wimps if you will.  Because her point is play the cards you're dealt.  Why do you wanna bid on--just, you know, you're dealt the hand; sit there and play it.  So I could never teach her how to play Bid Whist because she always thought that was a cop out, that if you're gonna be a Whist player, you just sit there and, you know, have enough guts to play that hand that you're dealt.  And that was her story about life.  I mean, she--you know, she only had a tenth grade education and was the first of her siblings to come south [sic. north] and then eventually most of them did come to Chicago [Illinois] and, and make their, their, their homes here.  She was--you know, she was kind of a maverick and she was just kind of a determined person that just kind of, you know, whatever you threw at her, she found a way to, you know, make it work.  She--I never heard her really bemoan anything.  I didn't for the longest time know that I--we weren't well to do.  I mean, I was the, you know, the daughter of a single mother and she was, you know, not well educated.  I didn't know we weren't, you know, middle class or whatever the class thing was back in the day.  Because my friends who had both mother and father, we all--you know, I had pretty much as everything--as, as they had, so I never really kind of--I never knew any distinctions of, of class or, or, or values.  Because my mother kind of said, you know, her, her favorite phrase, if it's for you you'll get it and if it's not, don't worry about it.
Story_ID: 326918
Speaker 1: I mean, she [Pennick's mother, Aurie Watts Baines] just kind of had a very calming, at least in my life, influence around things you wanna--you know, if you really want it, go for it.  And don't complain about, well, you know this one did this to me.  Now don't get me wrong.  She was very cognizant of, of discrimination, fought that, too, and hated that, and in fact told a story about working on one of the cleaners.  I--I'm not sure it's still around anymore, (unclear) or however it was pronounced, and was told that she could only be a bag girl because--no, when she was hired, they asked her could she read and write and she said yes, and they didn't believe her so they made her a bag girl.  And they hired a young white woman who barely could read and write who would have to ask my mother to write some of the names down when people came in.  And so my mother one day wrote the names down wrong and she told the girl.  She said, you--, "I wrote these names down wrong and unless you tell the boss, you know, that I did that, they're not gonna know that these names are wrong and I did it on purpose.  I switched the names and I can tell you who they are but you're gonna have to go tell the boss that I did--that I read and write," and she said, "Well, he'll fire you."  She said, "I don't care."  She said, "I just want him to know that I can read and write and you can't."  And the woman wouldn't tell.  The--(laughter) I mean my mother was ready to lose her job and the woman would not tell.  She was so embarrassed to not say that she couldn't read or write, so they finally figured it out.  And what, what happened was the woman told the man that she really needed help in the--which she probably did, needed help with taking in the clothes so my mother was promoted from a bag girl to actually helping to write in and, you know, do what this other woman really wasn't doing and my mother was doing.  And I kept saying, "Well, you know, why would you risk your job?"  She said, "'Cause I was just tired of--."  She said, "You, you know I needed the job but I also needed the respect more."  And so--I mean--and for her, you know, that was kind of her way of protest, you know, I'm not gonna keep doing this and not let this person know that--you know, I told him I could read and write, but I don't get the job and you're doing--and she--in fact, she--the woman got to be her friend.  They, they were friends for a long time.  So, I mean, she was just kind of, you know, that way and, and, you know, never really ashamed of who she was. Because when her catering business wasn't working well and sometimes it--you know, it was--it was seasonal, she'd, she'd be a domestic, you know.  But she'd go to work sometimes well dressed at--for, I now understand for domestic work 'cause she'd have a hat on and, you know, she'd dress up like she was going somewhere.  In fact, one of her--the women she used to clean house for on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] asked her why she came to work looking, you know--'cause she'd have a little bag where she'd change her clothes and she'd put on a little thing with the--sometimes have a little white apron with it which was really kind of interesting, and she said because, you know, I have to respect what I do no matter what it is.  And, you know, so--and so the woman promoted my mother.  I guess you'd call it promoting.  She made her like--'cause there were other woman who, who clean house and she made my mother in charge of the other women because she said she, she dressed too well to just be a domestic.  So, you know, that was not my mother's intent because she would bring the other clothes but, you know, people see--you know, people read different at, at least back then, I guess read different body language and different, you know--how you bring things forward in a different way and that worked to her advantage, that people saw in her that she had respect in whatever she did, so they--without her even really going for that promoted her to, to doing different things, so.
Story_ID: 326919
Speaker 1: And sometimes she'd [Pennick's mother, Aurie Watts Baines] even take me.  I mean, it would be--when she couldn't have--when school was out or there were no babysitting, I got to go to some of these beautiful homes on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] and she'd bring dolls and stuff for me to play with, but sometimes I'd play with the pots and pans of the--in the kitchens of the--of the, the places that she cleaned, and so I got very familiar with very good things.  I was always--even as a young child, I always knew things that a lot of, you know, my other friends didn't know and didn't care about.  Like I could tell that if you hit China a certain way, you get a sound, you get a certain ring.  And like, who cares--I mean, you know, that was not anything that most little kids cared about.  And I wouldn't have cared about it but that's how my mother entertained me by saying, you can tell this is China--but, you know, just little silly things that I grew up with, with an appreciation for stuff that, you know, wouldn't normally be the case, but it wasn't 'cause my mother had any kind of false attitudes or anything about--you know, about that.  It was just to keep me entertained and--you know, while she could clean house (laughter) and do what she had to do, so I learned a lot of--you know, here's a serving spork versus a salad fork.  Here's--you know, just stuff for me to, to play with, but it really helped me kind of get a gleam of the other part of life that most little black kids growing up in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] on 59th Street didn't see, didn't have that lens of the world.  Had--many had not even gone off the block no less gone to the North Side to Evanston [Illinois].  And we got to walk through Lincoln Park [Chicago, Illinois] one day coming back from one of the places she was working in, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's been some speculation and talk about--I mean, it's interesting subject.  I mean, day work and, and people leaving--I mean, my, my aunts and my grandmother went, went out for work.  And--you know, and people have wondered like whether--they're certainly bringing back some culture when they're going to these rich places, but they also bring some, too.  Is there--do you have any stories about that kind of exchange?
Story_ID: 326920
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the, the only exchanges I, I really recall--because most of the time when, when my mother was there, the, the, the madam of the house or the, the--they weren't there, but sometimes they were.  I mean, sometimes--and sometimes they'd wanna talk to me which was--I always found interesting.  And they were amazed--first of all, they didn't know my mother's name was, was Aurie [Aurie Watts Baines].  They called her Alma and that's because several of the women she worked for said Aurie was just not the right name for a black person.  I mean, they were very honest back then (laughter).  I mean--you know, I mean, it was in the '50s [1950s], you know?  So Alma was the name they called her.  So they called her Alma a lot.  And in my mind Alma was the one that was, you know, odd, but anyway, whatever made them comfortable.  So--and so they'd call me Alma's daughter.  And so Alma's daughter, I'd sit down, and "What are you doing in school" and, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and "What have you read?"  And I was a reader.  I used to love to read.  And so I'd usually have read something, you know, 'Charlotte's Web' [E.B. White] or something, you know, and they go, "Oh, and what are--," you know, and I think they were actually amazed that I actually had read it and could talk about it.  And not that that was different from most of the kids in my class, but who had they--you know, having not been in contact with any, any little African American children, I think they were amazed, you know.  Because we're talking about, you know--although I don't really believe it was a segregated then as it perhaps is now, class-wise, it clearly was.  And so, you know, the, the--you know, here are, you know, very middle or very upper middle class whites, you know, and, and their cleaning woman's daughter.  And so, you know, they're thinking, well clearly she won't, you know, know these things.  And, so I mean, that was kind of a challenge.  And, and someone asked me to--I can never--my mother got very--sometimes she'd get very upset about that as well, as them kind of drilling me and asking me little things 'cause it was like, well, you know, that's not why you're here.  I'm not bringing you here to entertain them, I'm bringing you 'cause I don't have childcare and, you know--so one--I'll never forget, somebody asked me to spell Mississippi or something that I guess was supposed to be a trick word and, and I spelled it and they're like--so then it got to be like spelling bee time.  Well, fortunately for me, I was good at spelling and so they just--so, I'll never forget this one woman grabbed a dictionary and said, "I know there's one word you can't spell."  And I said, well, you know, I--fun to me, what did I care.  I was a little kid.  And dictionary, well clearly I can spell dictionary.  I mean--you know, I mean, I thought she was gonna get--you know, my fear was she was gonna start thumbing through the dictionary and--, "You can't spell dictionary."  So she got it to hide it from me so I wouldn't see the word dictionary.  Well, dictionary, that was an easy one.  So I spelled it and she actually got angry.  She actually got upset.  And my mother said, you know, she really was upset with you.  And I'm like, well wait, what did I do wrong?  And I mean my mother wasn't saying it--you know, and she said, "I bet I don't--she won't call me back."  And sure enough, she never went back to that woman's house 'cause I would ask that, 'cause I'd, I'd always say, "Did you ever go--did the woman, the dictionary lady ever call you back to--?"  Never called her back.  'Cause, you know, sometimes she'd just do different--you know, friends would refer people to other people.
Speaker 2: That offended her sensibilities, I guess.
Speaker 1: It offended her because she--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess she thought she was tricky.  And I thought I was gonna be tricked 'cause I'm thinking, whoa, she's gonna, you know, find something in the dictionary that I've never heard of, but dictionary?  I mean--and, and again, I was pretty good at spelling, so that wasn't gonna be the trick word.  And so I kind of, you know,--
Speaker 2: As, as a kid, how, how did you sort this out now, you know--
Speaker 1: You know what?
Speaker 2: --watching this and being on the end of that?
Speaker 1: It's really funny because I don't think I did.  I mean, people--you know, I--when I look back on things that probably--you know, if I'd probably been a little more sensitive, maybe it might've marked me or something, but I think I was just one of--and, and I think because my mother's attitude was kind of steady as you go and it is what it is kind of thing that I never--until I got to be a teenager.  As a young child, I just never--things just kind of happened and I never put them in any one place or another and I never tried to, to evaluate them.  I just kind of, you know, rolled with the punches.  I became a, a Lutheran which was, again, something very unusual, I guess, back then because a woman--I was about seven or--seven years old in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], jumping rope on a Saturday, you know, jumping--you know, and this very tall--that's how I can remember her, Dorothy Anderson [ph.], funny names I remember, was a white woman who came--and this was when Englewood was integrated.  We were probably the second or third African American family to move on the block, so we kind of stood out, my family did.  And I was out jumping rope on the front yard and she came up and said "Hi," you know, "do you belong to a church?"  And we did.  My mother belonged to Olivet Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].  And I didn't like Olivet.  I mean, it was a big church, but when you went there, kids went one way and adults went another way.  And kids went to the little Sunday school class where you got the graham crackers and the, the milk and you sang, "Jesus loves you," and you did--you know, and it was just boring to me and I'm like no, I don't wanna do this again and, you know, crayons.  I mean, it was like--for me, it was just a big Sunday that was wasted, even as a child.
Story_ID: 326719
Speaker 1: You were talking about how you were introduced to the Lutheran church by a lady--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She just, you know, was--she gave me a little pamphlet that talked about the Sunday school and the church.  And I do recall because she always reminded me--and she stayed a member of the church for very, very--many years even after the community, you know, changed to a predominantly African American--she said I was the only child that had ever asked her could I get to go to the service because I was so used to--from my other experience with the, the Baptist church, having to go away to the--what they called the children's service, which really wasn't a service, like a little Sunday school.  She said--
Speaker 1: Now, now Olivet's [Olivet Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] a long way from Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], isn't it?
Speaker 2: Well, it really wasn't.  It was on forty--around 39th [sic. 31st Street] I guess and King Drive [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  It wasn't King Drive then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was called South Park.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: And when we first--
Speaker 1: And you were in Englewood or where, where--
Speaker 2: Well when we first--the reason we belonged to Olivet is that when my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] first moved from the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], I was born, of course, like most people in Cook County [Illinois].  When she moved to the South Side, we moved to 39th [Street] and Vernon [Avenue], so Olivet was just like a walk, you know, a lengthy walk, but a walk.  So when we moved to Englewood, she just continued to stay with the same--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --same church.  So the, the Lutheran church that this woman belonged to was just two blocks further south.
Speaker 1: What's the name of it?
Speaker 2: Bethel Lutheran Church of Englewood [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she invited me to come, and she said, "Absolutely you can come to the service.  In fact, our Sunday school goes on right before the service and, you know, the--when the Sunday school is over, you're--you can come down to the service, of course."  And so that excite--you know, that was exciting to me 'cause I'd never quite--kind of sat through a full church service.  I couldn't have been any more than about six or seven.  I was--I was, you know, fairly young.  So I told my mother and my--because my mother was catering and doing more of her catering business, some Sundays she'd work.  So I couldn't go to, you know, Olivet by myself on the bus.  And so this--oh, and this Dorothy Anderson [ph.] person, "Well, if you need somebody to walk with you, you know, I'll be happy--tell your mother that we--I would walk you to church.  You know, come outside and I'd walk you to church."  So I told my mother this and my mother was kind of skeptical.  She--you know, she wasn't quite sure what Lutheran meant.  'Cause I had members of my family that were Catholic, so she kind of  knew what Lutherans were, but she really--you know, she was a southern woman, and so she kind of had her doubts.  And I said--I just really begged her 'cause I really--the part that really interested me was I get to go to a service like the--like the grownups and I really wanted to see what that was about more than anything.  So she finally said, well, as--you know, "Let me meet with the woman that's gonna walk you to church, and if that works, you know--," and I found out just by talking to some of my friends that I had another friend who belonged to the church who went to the same grammar school [William G. Beale Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And she said, "Well, you know, you can go to--I'll come pick you up.  You don't have to have Ms. Anderson pick you up; I'll come pick you up."  So then my mother kind of felt better about it 'cause this other young girl that I knew also went to the church.  So to make a long story short, I started going to this Lutheran church and it was, you know, very Lutheran.  We--you know, we had almost like a Catholic Mass.  We even did the kneeling.  A lot of the service was in Latin and we did--because of the German background of the Lutheran church, we learned some songs in German.  So we learned a song called 'There is a Green Hill Far Away,' I remember this, in German.  And so I was so excited to go and sing it for my mother 'cause, you know, she was still working on Sundays.  And I'd come home and--what, what she couldn't understand was that the services were so short 'cause she was used to much longer churches--church service.  And she wasn't sure I was really, you know, going to church.  I'd leave at nine [a.m.] and I'd be back by eleven [a.m.] or twelve [p.m.], and she's like, oh--even before then 'cause the Sunday school would start at 9:30 and then we'd go right into service, and service was about an hour.  So I'd be home and--you know, in most two hours.  And she was like, I don't know about this church.  Are you really going to church or are you just--you know, so finally I came home and I sang her this song that I had learned, and I sang it in German.  And my mother's eyes got wide and she looked at me and she said, "You're learning to sing in tongues.  I don't like this church (laughter)."  And, you know--and I said, "No it's not a tongue."  And then I didn't know what it was and I called my girlfriend who had gone and I said, "Are we signing in tongues or what are we doing?"  And she said, "Oh, no that's German.  We sing in German."  So I told my mother, I said, "No it's German, it's German.  We're singing a song in German."  So that kind of, you know, shocked her.  And then she really got interested in going 'cause I really--I really got interested in the church.  At the time, I was only one of four African American young people in the church, and I think there was really one African American, maybe two African American families that actually went.  But it was fun for me.  I mean, I loved the service.  I actually--I mean, they even made it so once you left the Sunday school, you actually had like little assignments to take down words that you hear in the service that you may not understand or that you wanna know more about, and then you'd go look 'em up in the Bible.  And I thought that was kind of cool.  So I really kind of learned a little bit about bible study through this process of going to Sunday school and they prepared you, and usually the Sunday school prepared you a little bit about what the speech was--the, the, the sermon was gonna be about in the service, and so you kind of looked for it.  And they had us in a little row up in the front where we could take notes, so we kind of felt special, the young kids did, so I really liked that.  And so I was really eager to go to church--
Story_ID: 326720
Speaker 1: From that, my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] started to go to the church.  And quite often, my mother got very upset when I think his name was Reverend Jackson, Joseph Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] then, who around the time Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Chicago [Illinois] had a bit of a tiff with Dr. King.
Speaker 2: Right, it was a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And my mother, you know, being--
Speaker 2: Denounced Dr. King, actually.
Speaker 1: Yeah, very--yeah, very, very openly denounced him.  And I think when they were talking about renaming South Park King Drive [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] and that's when he closed the door and said the church [Olivet Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] will never, you know, have its front door on, on, on King Drive, my mother left the church and started going to this Lutheran church [Bethel Lutheran Church of Englewood, Chicago, Illinois] with me and really found it--she just fell in love with it.  And by that time, the, the, the community had changed even more and there were more African Americans--more African Americans going to the church, more African American adults going.  And--
Speaker 2: So when, when did you start?  How old were you when you started?
Speaker 1: Oh, God.  I had to be--when I really formally joined, I had to be about eight or nine 'cause we didn't move to Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] 'til I was about seven or six, so it had to be--
Speaker 2: So you started going a little earlier--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --than when you formally joined.
Speaker 1: Right, right, before I formally joined.  Because I--you know, my mother wasn't quite sure what it was.  I mean, she got comfortable with me singing in German but, you know, she'd had--she had--hadn't been able to go because of her work.  And then when her work subsided because it was seasonal and she actually could go and then, again, after the thing with, with Joseph Jackson, she said--you know, she wanted to see what had me so excited about going.  And at first, she was kind of--she, she was used to good southern preaching and Lutherans are not known for that.  But what she, she liked the fact that, you know, the kids were involved in the service.  She liked the fact that, you know, the--that people were very warm to her, very--you know, unlike, at least the one time I do remember going to the--to the other service, the kids were kind of--you know, we were all separated over to the side.  It was just--as a child, it just made me feel kind of like I wasn't a first class citizen in the church.  In the--in, in this particular church, at least at that time, we were up in front, we had like little special pads for us to write, and, you know, they made us feel good and, and welcomed.  And they made her feel the same way and, and invited her to join the Lutheran church women's group.  And she loved to cook, so it was perfect when she would, you know, help with some of the cooking and we'd have big--we'd have different--a lot of Lutheran gatherings with young people.  And as I--particularly as I became a teenager in the church, she got more and more involved 'cause there were a lot of things that we had.  We had our own--we had a, a minister--when one of the second ministers had came, was very much into community and we had--even before he came, we had like a basketball team and cheerleaders.  So we had our own kind of little community within the school.  And a lot of the young men, particularly--you know, again, growing up in Englewood, it was--which was getting tougher around this time, a lot of the young men who couldn't--who didn't wanna be involved with some of the other activities that were not, you know, necessarily legal, became involved in some of the church activities.  So then we saw a lot of the high school boys that, you know, started joining the church so they could play on the basketball team; you know how that goes.  And then we had our own cheerleaders and the parents would, you know, do things for us and we'd have days where they cook for us and raise money for uniforms, so it got to be really a, a great thing.  And, and it got me involved in Englewood as a community, not just the church, because this church became very much a community focus.  And, and in fact too, in some ways was kind of a leader in, in doing some community activities beyond just, you know, the bible study and the church kind of stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm thinking about your--you reminded me of Bethel New Life [Chicago, Illinois] on the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it--
Speaker 2: --on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.
Speaker 2: Another Bethel Lutheran.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And their minister was named Dave Nelson [David Nelson] and Mary Nelson, and our minister was named Sherwood Nelson.  So not only did we have churches similar, we had names of ministers very similar, and at that time representing two of the largest African American churches in the Lutheran, Lutheran church because, you know, they're--they were still evolving and, and Bethel on the West Side and Bethel on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] kind of became infamous as the Nelson boys in the Lutheran church.  And they were--they were very different but very similar in terms of their outreach and that--and seeing the community as, as--the, the total community as part of the church, not just those who go to church there.
Story_ID: 326721
Speaker 1: Now was your, your mother [Aurie Watts Baines] involved in organizational life to--you--I know you said earlier that she was always about helping other people and, and community.  Was she a, a member of any organizations before--
Speaker 2: She was a member of, God, see, I'm so old.  What is the name of that group?  Not the Masons but--
Speaker 1: Eastern Star [Order of the Eastern Star]?
Speaker 2: Yes, Eastern Star.  Thank you.  Yeah, she was an Eastern Star and I know that too because when there was no childcare, I got to go along to those meetings where they dressed in the white and had whatever those rituals were they did.  So, yes, she was involved in that.  When she joined the church, she got very involved in the Lutheran church women and, and some of the tag days and some of the things that they did.  She became the first woman--first woman council--church council member of the church that--the Lutheran church that we joined.
Speaker 1: The first woman period?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And again because, you know, we were one of the first African American families to move in and so this church council had been primarily white men and then, you know, of course a few men gone, but my mother became the first woman to join the, the Bethel Lutheran Church [Bethel Lutheran Church of Englewood, Chicago, Illinois], church council.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  The first woman period, right?
Speaker 2: In that church, yeah.
Speaker 1: In that church, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, so she was her own history maker of sorts.  And she loved cooking.  She would do stuff for the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] and was a girl--she joined--when I was a Brownie, she joined the, the, the mother's Brownies league or whatever it can--then she be--when I was a Girl Scout, she did all that.  'Cause all of that was focused at our church so it was a way for her to get involved with that and she could do it on some of her own time which was good, because as a I said, all this time, she was still catering and doing some, some domestic work, so.
Story_ID: 326722
Speaker 1: (Cough) Let me go back and ask you some questions and we always ask some the--you know, they'll be mad at me if I don't ask these (laughter).  But we had a good conversation going, so I just let it go.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But we, we always ask people, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Earliest.  Earliest.  Oh, I do and it's interesting you should--'cause I--it's one that I every now and then I have a flash--a dream about.  My earliest childhood memory was when we were on 39th Street [Chicago, Illinois] living in a walk-up and we had a bird, a parakeet named Chipper.  It was really my--my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] had gotten it from someone.  And the bird had gotten--my--he liked to be out at night.  He--my mother used to tease, 'cause he thought he could read the paper, and so if you're reading the paper, he'd like to be out and be pecking on--I don't know, that was her thing.  And I'll never forget, she called me.  The bird had gotten out and somehow the window was open.  I think I had left the window open.  Something, something happened with the window.  And she called me to help her so the bird wouldn't come, and I decided not to do it.  I decided to do something else and the bird got out.  And she was kind of upset by it but, you know, she--really, you know, she wasn't--it really upset me that I didn't immediately respond to whatever she wanted 'cause I was thinking if I had done that, maybe the bird wouldn't have gotten out.  It--you know, it flew away out the window.  So that--and I had to be--I couldn't have been any more than--'cause we lived on 39th Street when I was like five, so probably was no more than about five years old.
Speaker 1: Did he ever come back?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Probably not.  I mean, you know--but, you know, I just always felt that I had let her down.  You know how you always have a--you know, and, and, and, again, it was--like I said, it was something that I would have flashbacks of or something and so I always kind of wanted to go that extra mile somehow because I was in another room.  I think I was doing--you know, I, I was either playing with--but I was doing something.  I know I was playing.  I was either playing with blocks or doing something.  Not block--not little kids blocks but doing something with the blocks, trying to build something.  And she called me and she said, "Come here, come here, the bird is getting out."  And I'm like, "Okay," you know, and then I did go, but by that time, you know, she couldn't do whatever she was doing and the bird had gotten out, and she was disappointed.  And I was disappointed for her that I hadn't moved more quickly.  So that's a--the first--and I--as I said, I had to be about five.
Story_ID: 326723
Speaker 1: Another question we always ask is, can you describe some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?  Smells always would be my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] made the best sweet rolls on the face of the earth, I mean, bar none.  I mean even with the, the ones with the big--lady with the sweet rolls.  I'm not good with names, Ann Sather's has nothing on my mother's sweet rolls.  My mother's sweet rolls were--when she would go south to visit relatives, they'd come, bring in the yeast and the flour for her to make sweet rolls.  So the smell of the sweet rolls and the fresh cinnamon.  I mean, I just--you know, always is in my nose.  And sounds, sounds.  You know, sounds of air, air raid drills in high--in grammar school [William G. Beale Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, growing up, you know, and during the Cold War era, the sounds of the--of the air raid, the, the, the fire department for the--for the air raid drills had always been chilling to me so that when the White Sox [Chicago White Sox] won the pennant or whatever they won and they let the air--the--I don't know if you were in the city when they let all the, the, the air raid--the same sounds, the, the--all the fire departments across the city.  Well, really on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] 'cause the White Sox had won the pennant.
Speaker 1: It was like '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '50 [1950] or something [sic.].
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958]?
Speaker 2: They did that and I--
Speaker 1: Go, go White Sox?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Go--right.  And they let--you know, they did the same thing that, you know--and nobody knew.  I mean, I guess, you know, basketball--I mean, baseball fans knew that's what they were doing.  But I was--I was horrified.  I just meant they're coming to get us.  This is it.  This is what we practiced for and I'm not in school.  But the only place I knew was--to hide was in the basement at school, and here we are at home.  So, yeah, the air raid sound, that sound was--is, is a sound I remember from my childhood.  Smells, sounds, what was the other?
Speaker 1: Sights, sounds, and smells, that's--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's about it.  And--yeah, that's about it.
Story_ID: 326724
Speaker 1: By the time you were seven or eight you were in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] and, and where'd you go to school in Englewood?
Speaker 2: William G. Beale [Beale Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], right on the corner of 60th [Street] and Sangamon [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go there all, all, all your grade school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  There were two schools.  There was an old school that I started in and then while I was going, they built a newer school that kind of eventually replaced the old school.  But it was a real big red--one of those big red buildings.  It was kind of, you know, interesting.  I mean, I liked--in fact I liked the big school better than the newer school for some reason.  I think the newer school to me just didn't seem to be like a school 'cause it was all one--kind of two floors and it was very sleek looking, but the old red school, the big red school--it just looked like a big old red schoolhouse, you know, and it kind of had that flavor to it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Englewood is interesting for--you know, because of the--at one time it was one of the premier neighborhoods in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  There was a show there--
Speaker 1: There's so many churches and schools and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --shops and--
Speaker 2: There was a show called--well, there, there--they had three shows.  There was the Southtown [Southtown Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], there was the Princeton [sic.], and I can't remember the other two 'cause there was one that they called the dirty old men show that you could never go to there (laughter), you know?  Then, there was one that had the, like the midday show, the cartoons you could go for a dollar.  I think that was the Princeton.
Speaker 1: It was the Englewood [Englewood Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], I think they called it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Englewood, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the one.  Yeah, that's right, where you'd go for a dollar for the cartoons.  Then there was the Southtown that was this huge mega theater that when we first moved there actually had premiers.  I mean, I'll never forget, my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] and some of the neighbors went up to, to--it was on 63rd [Street] where the old cars--I mean, cars was Southtown.  And it had ducks in the pond and I guess swans, I'm not sure.  It, it had birds in a pond.  And they had premiers there and I think it was 'The Ten Commandments' where some of the stars from 'The Ten Commandments' were actually there, so we were all out in the streets watching these movie stars go in.  It was an amazing theater.  And I used to tell that story, nobody believed, and a friend of mine finally gave--found a book that talks about Eng- Englewood history and there it is.  The Southtown Theatre with the ducks in the pond.  So, I mean, it was just an amazing theater.  Now, of course, I recall that we had to go up to the balcony because, you know, you weren't allowed--African Americans weren't allowed on the first floor.
Speaker 1: Even in, in Chicago--
Speaker 2: Oh, clearly.
Speaker 1: --when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: --yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: Okay, we're--
Speaker 2: --a given.  I mean--
Speaker 1: --we're talking about the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: --they didn't say it but it was a given.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: The early to mid-'50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: The early '50s [1950s] 'cause I was--yeah.
Speaker 1: But when did that practice stop?  Do you--do you remember?
Speaker 2: You know, I--you know, I don't recall when it stopped.  I just--you know, I, I--the only--the only show that I ever recall it actually being an issue was the Southtown because it had the big balconies.  The other shows--I mean, when we went for the cartoons, we went all during the day so it didn't really--that kind of segregation never really came to mind.  But the Southtown and I think because my mother went with me and it was later at night and it was evening, I just remember that, you know, African Americans went one way and the whites kind of went--it was just--I don't recall seeing signs that said that.  It was just a natural kind of thing.  So that had to be late '50s [1950s] maybe or maybe very early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there still white people living in Englewood when you were--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --little?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As I said, we were about the third family to move on the block.  I went--when I went to grammar school, there were whites there in my grammar school class, a few when I went to high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], not many, but when I went to grammar school, clearly was fairly integrated.  I'd say, you know, 20 percent were whites in grammar school.  So, yeah, it was--it--you know, and the church, I--the, the Lutheran church continued to be integrated almost to the very end.  I mean, you know, people would--even when they moved from the community continued to come back to that particular church.
Speaker 1: So Bethel [Bethel Lutheran Church of Englewood, Chicago, Illinois] is not--it's no longer in Englewood?
Speaker 2: No, it's still there.
Speaker 1: It's--okay.
Speaker 2: It's a--it's a newer church.  It's been--it, too, had to be re- redone, re- rebuilt if you will.  It's a much more newer church than the original one that I joined, so (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 326725
Speaker 1: Did you like school?  Well I suppose you did the way you described, you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.  I mean, I liked--I liked learning.  Learning was, you know, fun.  I, I liked to read, so reading, you know--liked--you know, once you learn to read, you kind of--everything else kind of falls into place.  And my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] always made it fun.  My mother tells a story of, of--that she taught me how to read which probably was true by, by reading cartoons to me, reading Nancy and Sluggo and, you know, helping me see words.  And so I, I could read by the time I was already in school.  I mean, I was--I was a reader when I started kindergarten.  And I started late, too.  That's the other thing she always reminds that I was behind everybody else.  Because I guess in those days you had to be a certain age and if you weren't, you had to wait 'til that next year.  So I technically came in a year behind everybody else, but because I could read, I immediately moved forward.  So--and she, you know, just, like I said, basically taught me how to read by her reading me the cartoons which is something she did with my daughters [Faith Pennick and Keidra Chaney] as well and I could see that they could read, too.  So she probably was right when she said she taught me how to read.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any favorite teachers in grade school?
Speaker 2: I did. What was his name?  I had--his name was Mr. Burts I believe.  No, that wasn't his name.  Ah, Diatweiler [ph.].  Now, see how did that come out--his name was--and he was like my seventh grade teacher [at Beale Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois].  Had a lot of white teachers in, in the beginning, of course, you know, because it was--it was the school.  And many of them--shouldn't say many, some I think had problems with the neighborhood [Englewood, Chicago, Illinois] changing and the population and just had not been prepared to teach, you know, black students.  That was a new thing and, you know, so we were a little different perhaps than what they were used to.  And so there was some--I mean, I could--you could tell that there was kind of some discomfort, but Mr. Diatweiler was an African American teacher and very stern, wore these--first time I'd ever seen horn-rimmed glasses and--but he was a very--he was very conscious about us being, you know, kind of the new African Americans to this particular community in this particular school.  And I, I always felt he went an extra mile to--with our class.  And you always had your homeschool--your homeroom and your other even in, in grade school.  And, and what happened to me was kind of an interesting--this was during the time of the Willis Wagons when they were--you know, there was a, a explosion of African Americans and people to the city and so they didn't know what to do.  Some of the schools were not big enough, so they were adding some of these trailers to the back of the school.  This was the school before they--the red school before they tore it down and built the newer school.
Speaker 1: These are the--
Speaker 2: Willis Wagons, yeah, so--and one of the teachers said something about--and it was quoted in one of the community newspapers that we, meaning the students, were--I, I really can't remember the term, but it was--it was least--less than desirable about--like we were just kind of wasted cargo or something not quite like that.  But it, it, it really stated that we were--you know, we weren't gonna be the creme de la creme and so, you know, it didn't matter whether we went to Willis Wagons or it didn't matter about, you know, our books being old.  And I remember this Mr. Diatweiler saying whatever you do, do not buy into that.  Whatever you do, know that you are this.  I mean, he constantly would always kind of take his time to do the opposite 'cause we were about seventh or eighth grade when this happened.  And he kind of said whatever you do, understand you are--you know, you're the best at the best or you're the--you know, I mean, he just used to kind of drill and particularly for the guys who I thought--think took it, you know, because it was--you know, he, he was a good role model.  And, you know, I, I think it made a difference, at least for me 'cause whatever that was that this other teacher had said, I was determined not to be.  I wasn't quite sure what it was, but I knew it wasn't good.
Story_ID: 326726
Speaker 1: And so I was, you know, kind of determined.  And we had been tracked.  I mean, if you could read well, you know, you were tracked away from some of the others, so some of us kind of--there was an experimental group of us who were in mixed grades.  I think we had grades five through eight, yeah five through eight 'cause it was based on a reading score.  So if you were in fifth grade and you read at eight or ninth grade, you'd be in with all the, you know, all of us.  So we all had, you know, reading scores and fairly decent math scores.  So it was kind of a--I, I don't know what this was called in--at, at Chicago Public Schools then, but we were like experimental program 'cause we didn't--we didn't have the same programs that the other kids did, so we all kind of were separated off to ourselves for a while.  No, it had to be three through seven because Diatweiler [ph.] was eighth grade [at Beale Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois].  So for a long time, we only went to school--we only went to class with these so-called smart kids. And so by the time some of us were ready to roll into the eighth grade right before graduating, this was the first time we had encountered other kids--other, you know, other kids who had not been tracked into this little pilot project or whatever it was.  So, I mean, it was--it was hard for some of us because we were used to everybody reading at the same level, reading at the same thing, you know, doing some of the same things as these were everyday kids who could care less about some of the stuff that we had thought, you know, all the kids did.  So it was--it was good to hear a teacher continue to say, you know, you should--you could be the best you can.  You can continue.  Because you know how kids are.  You usually--you, you work with your peers, and if your peers aren't interested in this, you know, why should you be interested in it?  And I, I always felt that that was--it was a disservice not only to us but to the rest of the kids that we were all separated out for so long.  And, and we were kind of the nerds of the group.  I'll never forget, we had not--most of the kids were going on field trips and our class hardly ever got to go.  I mean, our class of the seventh, eighth, and--five, six, and seventh grade.  And then when we go--when we went, we had to have like three or four extra chaperones.  And so it was kind of like we were, you know, either too special or too stupid or something (laughter) to go on a field trip and come back whereas the other kids could go, you know, with just a written note and they'd go with their teacher and they'd--very seldom did we ever go on a field trip.  And that kind of--you know, we did a lot of science stuff, we had a lot of projects, we did a lot of--we had speakers come in.  That's the first time I'd ever been familiar with people coming outside of schools to speak.  But we never did a lot of the everyday things kids did.  So by the time we were in the eighth grade and joined, you know, the rest of the group, we were kind of stigmatized as being the nerds or the something, and so it was very kind of hard to integrate back into the--to the regular school program, so Diatweiler was our teacher and that was good because I think he kind of helped us integrate in whereas some would've just not probably cared about that, but, so--
Speaker 2: He sounds like a good one, so--
Speaker 1: He was a good one.  He was really good.  He was very stern, very stern with the boys in particular 'cause we had some wild boys, and especially the boys that were smart.  You know, if they were smart, they kind of got away with it.  You know, they could do--if their grades were good, they kind of got to do almost anything they wanted to do.  And so he kind of put 'em back in check and said, yeah, but, you know, there's another part of this that you gotta understand, so that was good, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 326727
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about high school.  Now, you went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yep.  High school was interesting.  I mean, you know, like all kids, you know, you--it's the awkward period where you don't know who you are.  It was also a time when, you know, things were changing for African Americans and so, you know, it was just--it was--it was interesting.  I loved to sing, as I said so I, I was--I joined the choirs right away.  And then it was one of the, I guess the first times for me anyway that I became cognizant of the color line within the African American community.  Because in my family they--you know, they're all hues.
Speaker 1: Now you started in '62 [1962], right?  Sixty-two [1962] or sixty--
Speaker 2: In high school, I started--
Speaker 1: Yeah, high school.
Speaker 2: When did I start?  I graduated '65 [1965] so I had to start--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I mean, it was like, you know--as I said, I had not been the--you know, color was not an issue.  In fact, you know, we were still colored then (laughter) so it doesn't--you know, we weren't really formally called blacks.  So I, I had not really been--and as I said, some things--I, I think I was sometimes kind of dense or just, you know, I didn't pick up on perhaps what, what other folks were picking up on.  And so when I got to high school and I realized that there was this kind of color caste system--because some of my best friends were far lighter than I, so we never, you know, until we got to high school and, and it got to be like the, you know, the very fair-skinned girls went this way and then the, you know, the, you know, what do they call 'em?  The--well, the high yellow girls went this way and the brown skin, and if you're dark-skinned got, you know, dropped off the face of the earth kind of thing.  Well I--you know, that was kind of new to me.  I mean I really--it sounds naive but I just had not experienced that 'til high school.  And it became not only a caste system but there was a reward system in that.  The cheerleaders, I tried out for cheerleaders as did several others but, you know, clearly when I look at the hue of the cheerleaders and the cheerleading coaches who were teachers were all--they could all be family.  I mean, they were all fair-skinned and so all the girls were all fair-skinned.  And so, you know, it was a very cliquish kind of thing.  And so that if you weren't a certain color then you could be--my color, I could be a, a majorette but I clearly couldn't be a cheerleader.  You know, just silly, yeah.  So I had never really experienced that kind of thing and it just got to be a major--
Story_ID: 326728
Speaker 1: You were saying off camera before we got started that this, like--this whole idea of this color--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the color--
Speaker 1: --difference, you know--
Speaker 2: The color casting was new to me.  I, I--as I said, I grew up, you know, pretty much as a single child.  My mother [Aurie Watts Baines] had never really--you know, my mother kind of always said people are people and, you know, that was how we dealt with it.  And even, even, again, dealing in, in, in a predominantly white world, she just--she always carried herself as an equal even though--you know, clearly she--you know, she, she wasn't economically, so I never really saw that in that--in that way.  I never captured it.  And when I went south, I had all hues of colors of family and we just kind of all played and, you know, nobody--at least I didn't pay any attention.  And when I--high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] it really became clear to me that there were favorites given to those who looked a certain way versus those who didn't even though among some of those who looked that certain way, they were surprised by it as well.  Because I think some of us--as I said, some of my best girlfriends then and now are far lighter than I am skin color wise, but that had never been an issue 'cause we just kind of never thought of it that way until, you know, you're put in a circumstance where a certain person gets rewarded because of the way they look versus anything else and you being to, to recognize the, the inequities and/or injustice.  And I--you know, my, my mother was kind of, you know, my best friend on some of these things and I said--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: Did you see it in those days as a function of a, a general American racism or did you see it as just a problem that black people have?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what it was.  I--again, you know, I wish I could say I was deep enough to see--you know, to see it as general racism or--I just--I really didn't know what it was.  It was--it was such a new phenomenon to me.  I didn't know what it was.  I didn't know what to attribute it to other than I thought maybe these particular coaches like girls who look like themselves.  I mean 'cause they were all fair skinned and light.  I'm like, well, you know--still it wasn't fair, but at least, you know--so when I talked to my mother about it and she talked about in her own family, some of her own sisters who had feelings about their grandchildren or their own children based upon whose skin color was what or whose--and it just--so then it became clear to me that it was at least in my mind a problem with black people that somehow if you--you know, if you're--and my mother used to--and her phrase with people would say if you're white, you're right kind of thing.  She never used it herself, but she said that was kind of the--where this kind of came from--
Speaker 1: Where you wanna rhyme, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: If you're yellow, you're mellow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  White, you're right, yellow, you're mellow, all of that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Brown, stick around.
Speaker 2: And--right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And if you black, get back.  I mean, and I, I had never heard that 'til I actually brought it to her and then she started saying all these things, that these were, you know, characteristics of things that she grew up around in the South and, you know, so clearly it was going on there.  So as my friends and I--again, we're all hue--all, all colors, all hue--kind of, you know, we, we, we didn't let it separate us and we just kind of called it what it was.  We called--it was kind of wacky and, you know, silly and not really--you know, I didn't--I really didn't--in my own naivety, I didn't see it as systematic racism.  I thought it as something people outgrow, you know, like--you know, it's a silliness and it's a phase and people will outgrow it.
Story_ID: 326729
Speaker 1: And then as things got deeper and as I--of course, I got older and my mother [Aurie Watts Baines]--during all of this when I was continuing to go south, I was about--yeah, I was still in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I guess I was, was a freshman or sophomore, I--again, things--you know, I'd always gone on the Hummingbird.  My mother trusted the train system 'cause she'd have these travelers, people--travelers and immigrants, people would, you know, identify you and they'd put a little name tag on you and they'd watch you and so here I go with my--you know, my chicken and my sweet rolls and I'd ride south and--you know, every--almost every Thanksgiving.  And she trusted the Hummingbird because it--you know, she knew all the stops it would make.  And so--and it had been the train my father [Burrell Baines] had been on so she was very familiar with it.  And one year--and it, it happened almost every year I'm sure, but I just--it never--you know, it never clicked with me.  We were--we, we got stopped at a certain point and the, the nice woman, there's always a very nice woman, white woman, would come and say, you know, you have to move to the back of the train.  And I got so used to it that it never--you know, I pack up my little stuff and I'd move to the back of the train.  And then one year when I got back there to the back of the train, I realized everybody was black and it was like, you know, a light bulb goes off.  And again I'd taken--been south at least three or four times by myself.  I still don't understand why my mother would do that except that, you know, she wanted me to visit my relatives.  But--and this one time, I went back there and it just, like a brick before I could sit down, everybody I saw on these particular cars were African American.  And it was--it just hit me, you know?  I'm moving to the back of the train.  Been doing it, you know, two or three--never--as long as I had my chicken and my stuff, you know.  And people were always very nice and it wasn't like it was dirty or anything.  I mean, it was--you know, it was all pretty much well kept.  And then coming back, I realized boarding in Mobile [Alabama]--we boarded the back of the train.  And then after a certain line you could--you know, you were free to move forward, you could go to the--to the food car or any of these things.  And so it just--it had occurred to me all around the same time when I'm finding about racial casts in high school, that when I was going south, you know, once we passed the Mason-Dixon Line, you had to move to the back of the train.  And nobody else around me would have to move 'cause I'm leaving Chicago [Illinois].  I'm with everybody in Chicago at least coming--and I--and so it all kind of--you know, it, it became larger than a problem of black people and larger than something, you know, people will outgrow.  It finally clicked to me that there was something else going on in the world that me being a black person was a major part of and not necessarily in a good way.  And all of this around the time--pretty soon, you heard about the civil rights marches going on in the South, and Emmett Till, of course was a--was a major, major deal.  And this had happened earlier, but I--you know, again, I thought it was just a, you know, poor boy just ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  But, now, you know, all of this is constantly from Chicago standpoint 'cause that was never forgotten.  This was a Chicago boy that had been, you know, murdered, and all of this was just all kind of like coming to a--to a head, all of the stuff that had happened in the past and all the, the, the voter registration and all the lynchings you were hearing were about--and I--you know, I got introduced to the Jet.  I had not been reading the Jet.  You know, it's--you know, it's an adult magazine and--for the most part.  But then as a teenager, we started reading some of the stories of what was happening.  And so then it became to be more than, you know, my school, this cast system.  You know, it became to be a, a, a wider problem, and one that I really wasn't sure where to go with that.  I mean, you know, on the one hand if I believe my mother and she said you can be what you wanna be and you don't let anybody, you know, hold you down, then maybe it's black people's fault that they aren't who they are.  On the other hand, now, you know, I've seen this--I've experienced this cast thing.  I've been told to go to the back of the train so something is not--you know, as--in the mind of a--you know, of a confused teenager, not jelling in the way--you know, if, if she's right then they're wrong and if they're right, she's wrong.  You know what I mean?  Something wasn't, wasn't jelling for me.  So, I mean there was a lot of struggle in my mind about what was right, and, and a lot of struggle, you know, around the issue.  I mean, I got my mother to stop calling people colored and calling them black, although, her thing is we're not really black.  I'm like well, you know, white people aren't really white either, so, you know, had to get her past that little piece and then--you know, then she was really into it.
Story_ID: 326730
Speaker 1: But I mean, there were a lot of--I mean, we learned from each other 'cause I learned a lot about southern life and how, you know--she said, well, you don't--you have to realize, my growing up in the South my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] would say was very different perhaps than some peers.  'Cause I'll never forget, she said she had an older sister who slapped a white girl.  I mean, and that was never heard of in, in their time, but the white girl spit on her, so her sister slapped her.  So my grandmother [Amanda Watts] had to hide her daughter.  My grandmother was known for carrying a shotgun, and so she patrolled the house with a shotgun.  And my mother's older brothers--'cause they knew the sheriff was gonna try to come and take, you know, my mother's sister out of the house and probably lynch--you know, for slapping a white girl.  So my mother [sic. grandmother] sat up with the shotgun with her sons.  And they--you know, if they were gonna come to get her, they were gonna have to come through 'em.  And finally, the, the sheriff did come by himself and said--demanding an apology from my daughter--from my mother's sister to this white girl, which my mother's sister did not wanna give, you know, because she spit on her.  But my grandmother said, "Well, I apologize for my daughter," but my, my mother's sister never did apologize and she went on to become a, a Baptist minister.  So, you know, my, my mother was used to her family kind of, you know, going toe-to-toe with stuff, you know, because they just--you know, they--not that they were ignorant but there were just certain things they weren't gonna tolerate, and if they did it, they--you know, they were up with the shotgun and they was just gonna, you know, do what they had to do.  So I kind of had some of that I guess in me, so I--this notion of kind of accepting things as they are was foreign, and I blame my mother for that, that I just couldn't, you know, accept things as they are as, as she admitted she wouldn't either.  So I began to look for things that would help me change some things and, you know, I quickly found them.  There was always, you know, friends of the Panthers [Black Panther Party] and this and that group, and this was as I was older, you know, about to get out of high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 326731
Speaker 1: And the other piece of it, of course, I fell in love.  And then you had the Vietnam War going on which, you know, added even more complication to, to I think my enlightenment around civil rights.  So, you know, I mean--I mean I, I learned a lot about myself in a really short period of time because the same time, I was worried about--learning about being a black woman in society.  I was learning about what's going on in other countries, at least a tainted view anyway about Vietnam and what that meant and, you know, why, you know--
Speaker 2: How did you feel about the Vietnam War in those days?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I mean, in, in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: In high school, you know, it was again one of those things that everybody wanted to be like John Wayne.  You know, some of the guys including the guy I was dating, you know, his biggest dream was to be a paratrooper and jump out a airplane and some of the other guys, their biggest thing was to be a--you know, a marine and, you know, 'cause that was macho and is a manly thing to do.  So, some of them enlisted.  I mean, they didn't even have to be drafted.  They enlisted because it seemed like the right--you know, the right thing to do.  And as I became older and, and particularly as Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] began to take his stand on, I began to look at it differently.  You know, it did give me pause, you know, because at the same time, I'm still grappling with, well, you know, some place in the South people still aren't voting the way they should be voting or not allowed to vote and yet you're willing to give up your life for a country that, you know, depending upon where you live, you may not be able to vote.  So, you know, again, it was that kind of, if my mother's [Aurie Watts Baines] right, they're wrong.  So it was--you know, it was a very confusing, confusing time.
Story_ID: 326732
Speaker 1: I did marry.  In fact, the--
Speaker 2: Now, did you get married in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I had just graduated high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it's really funny 'cause my girlfriends will tell you I was the last person to ever get married 'cause early on, I wanted to be a lawyer.  I mean, that's all I really talked about.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you weren't even thinking about--
Speaker 1: I wasn't thinking about it.
Speaker 2: --getting married.
Speaker 1: It was like--
Speaker 2: But you--but you fell in love, right?
Speaker 1: Marriage was so far down the road.  And, you know, again, he said, "You know, I may have to go to Vietnam.  If I know you're here when I get back and--," you know, and, and I bought it.  And I think he was--I mean, I shouldn't say I bought it.  I think he was--he was very serious about that.  I mean, he was young, too.  I was seventeen, he was eighteen.  What did he know?  What did either of us know?  And so he--we got married in October in I believe '65 [1965] and that--no, that can't be right 'cause my daughter [Faith Pennick] was born--no, that's right, '65 [1965].  And then he was--at November, he was shipped off, so--
Speaker 2: Okay so you didn't plan to go to school right after high school or, or college--
Speaker 1: I did.  I planned--I went to--I took a, a exam for Navy Pier.  It was still at Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois]--University of Illinois was still at Navy Pier.  By the time I enrolled that September, they had moved to Circle Campus [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  So I enrolled in college that September and I married that October, so I was in college when my husband--when we married and when he went off to Vietnam, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, did he make it back?
Speaker 1: He did.  It's funny.  He changed tremendously during his tour, and I changed during my time in college--
Story_ID: 326733
Speaker 1: I became much more aware of Vietnam as a--as a world issue.  I became more aware of, of African Americans.  I mean, you know, this is the time of all kinds of things going on.  I, I even joined, which he [Pennick's first husband] hated, I joined, I think the name of it was the black draft counselors movement to counsel African Americans about--African American men in particular about the draft, about not being drafted and--
Speaker 2: Now, now this--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: These days at Circle Campus [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], things were jumping from what I heard.
Speaker 1: Oh, real jumping.
Speaker 2: You know, they--the--
Speaker 1: Real jumping.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: One because--
Speaker 2: Buzz Palmer [HistoryMaker Edward "Buzz" Palmer]--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the, the African American Police League [Afro-American Patrolmen's League; African American Police League] people were there.
Speaker 1: All of those people were around.  And, and they were--I mean, it was--it was a very--it was a very confusing time again because, one, the school had just opened and there had already been some hoopla about the school opening from Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois] and about the then Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley] saying he didn't want it to be a black boy school, that he wanted it to be a four-year college and not just a school that, his words not mine, black boys went to.  So, I mean, there were very few African Americans in that first class and so we kind of stood out.  I think it was like--I can't remember the number, twelve hundred freshman and maybe one hundred of those were African American.  So the, the campus was new and people were just, you know, getting used to it, and so there was a lot of new stuff, and there was just new stuff going on.  I mean, it was--it was a happening time.  We're talking '66 [1966] I think now.  And, you know, things were just going on around.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was coming to Chicago [Illinois] and the, the, the march on Cicero [Illinois].  And, and, and, you know, it was the first time for me anyway that I became--I began to take things personally.  I mean, these things were actually personal to me now; they weren't before.  But once I saw things where, you know, whites, you know, throwing cans and making--I mean, this is Chicago.  This is not stuff in the South or, you know, that my relatives would be experiencing.  This was in my backyard.  I mean 'cause, you know, where he was walking in Gage Park [Chicago, Illinois], that was--you know, you could ride your bike there in, in--when--from Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] when I lived there.
Speaker 2: Marquette Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Marquette Park, right.  You could ride your bike.  At least, I used to ride my bike to--so seeing all that, it just--it became very personal to me.  It became a personal affront that people who didn't even know me, just based again on my race, hated me, I mean really despised me.  And then Dr. King's infamous words of Chicago being the most racially segregated city in his mind, just really stuck with me.  And I--you know, I just became, you know, just kind of not disappointed but I, I, I became very sensitive to that kind of piece.  And it, it, it angered me.  There was kind of a--an angry frustration in me that, you know, here all of us who had thought we had done the right thing, gone to school, you know, went to college, all the things my mother [Aurie Watts Baines]--get a--you know, to get a good job, get a good education, those kind of things.  Well, you know, it was--seemed like it was being thrown in our face.  And, and on the one hand, I was very angry about the rioting that went on.  I mean 'cause some of the, the--when I'd walk out on the--on our porch, some of the people throwing cans were people I knew and I knew they knew better.  So I couldn't--again, I couldn't marry, you know, their action with, you know, the other--the, the people I had so despised seeing in Cicero and I'm like, well you guys, guys aren't really doing too much better than they are.  You know, it was just a--it was a very complicated time for me to try to figure out who I was in the midst of all of this and at the same time, you know, think about Vietnam 'cause it was all kind of converging at the--around the same time.  So it was--it was--it was a time of much happening, I mean, but it was also a time for me of much confusion, of much struggle to figure out just what makes the most sense for, you know, a little black girl from the South Side of Chicago.

Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to hear Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] when he was in town?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I heard it on the radio.  I did not go.  And I can't remember--I had plan--in fact, a group of us had planned to go.  I--it was something very, again, frivolous that came up.  It wasn't like we, you know, made a, a great conscious decision.  It was something that came up at the last minute and we decided not to go.  'Cause again, we could've rode bikes or walked or whatever and it wouldn't have been a, you know--but, no, I did--I heard it on the radio.  I didn't hear him actually speak, although some of the neighbors did and came back very inspired and very energized, and I--so I had kind of missed that I hadn't seen it firsthand because it probably would've, you know, gave me a little sense of direction that I clearly didn't have based upon what was going on.
Speaker 1: I know Dr. Porter [HistoryMaker Reverend Kwame John R. Porter] was I think in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] in those days, about four blocks from you I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in '64 [1964] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) John Porter, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Christ Methodist [Christ United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So a lot of the Chicago [Illinois] ministers that were--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, lot of--well again, I mean, it was--it was really a time for Chicago.  I mean, the, the Chicago Freedom Movement, if you will, started right then and there with all of the, the named people.  In fact, my minister [at Bethel Lutheran Church of Englewood, Chicago, Illinois], the Sherwood Nelson which John Porter--who John Porter knew well was--had gone and came back and preached about how important it was, you know, from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you know people that, that went south with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] or SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I knew--well, John Porter and his wife, June [June Porter], and some of those people I knew of.  But, you know, for me, it wasn't something I was ready to commit to.  In fact, I wasn't really sure quite frankly at that point in time was I was ready to commit to nonviolence.  It was real--you know, there was a flirtation with--in my mind about, you know, the other side of the coin, particularly after I saw the anger and the, the, the hatred on, on the faces of some of, of, of these folk in Cicero [Illinois].  I'm like, well, why would I be nonviolent with someone that despises me, so, so vehemently.  And it--so, you know, I wasn't really sure.  Again, I admit to a lot of confusion during that time about just what made the most sense for me.  And again, you know, growing up when violence wasn't as rampant.  I mean, it--you know, violence was a statement.  I mean, you know, it wasn't as clearly, you know, something that people expect.  I, I just wasn't sure where, where it fit and whether, where I was ready to commit.

Speaker 1: Having had a, a, a husband that, that talked about being rewarded for killing Vietcong, you're kind of--you know, all of this again just made it all kind of a confusing time to, to figure out just what makes the most sense--
Speaker 2: So how did you get along when he came back?
Speaker 1: Unfortunately when he came back, he came back disabled.  He had--he had--because of--he had been on the front line during all of his tour and was about to, from what I gather, be assigned a second tour which they, they were doing very frequently in Vietnam and he tried to commit suicide so they sent him back.  So he was--he was considered disabled.  So he went back--they sent him back to Fort Benning, Georgia, where myself and his brother, my, my brother-in-law went to, to, to meet him and see how--you know, see how he was getting along and I stayed a couple of weeks after that to, to just be around to see, you know, what I could do while he was recuperating or, you know.  And he never really did recover, I mean, not psychologically from that.  He was--he was never the same person.  So we were never--we were two different people.  I had gone off to college [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I was not the little high school girl.  I'd gone off to college.  I'd, you know, been a part of, you know, this rally, that rally, protests here, protests there.  And it was just very different for him.  I mean, he had been in the midst of a war and had seen some horrific things.  And so we were just not the same people.  We were still young but very different people.  And I think we wanted the same thing, we just didn't know how to get it together anymore.  We were just not the same people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, a lot of men didn't recover--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --from the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: He just was not the same person.
Story_ID: 326736
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors at University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] that you can think of?
Speaker 2: There was a woman, Dr.--what was her name, Grace Holt, I believe, black woman, who I met--I--she ended up putting together the, I think it was called the African American alumni alliance, but when I first went there, she was just a regular professor.  She hadn't moved into this other piece.  And I had gotten a scholarship through some program or another, and she met with me and said if there's anything you ever need or want, give me a call.  And I couldn't find--I mean, you know, it was college campus.  It was hard for me to locate people no less try to figure out how to--I couldn't even figure out how to get to class.  I mean, the school was so new and we were trying to--and then I ran again--ran up--I ran into her at something else, almost a semester or two--'cause I had a--I really had a hard time.  I mean, again, my public school education vis-a-vis what they were requiring, particularly for someone under scholarship at university--at Circle Campus was very foreign.  One of my experiences was to find out I had placed out of the French class.  I had taken French all through high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], so I was very proficient in reading it.  And so I'd taken a written exam and I had placed out of beginners French and I was in conversational French.  Couldn't understand a word that was being--that, I mean, it was like two foreign languages.  I said, how could this be?  And of course they attributed me being the only African American to me just being a dunce.  Well, I later found out that the instructor that I had in high school for most of those four years had a Cajun accent so that her pronunciation of certain words was just totally different from the Parisian accent.  So I could read it but when it was being said, I just had no clue.  So I had to spend a lot of time in what was called SWAT [Study, Workshops, and Tutoring] at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and I had a tutor, a French tutor who really just basically kept the conversation in French going so I could finally understand the Parisian accent because, you know, for almost three years all I understood was the Cajun.  I mean--so, I mean who knew, at least I didn't know.  So here I was, struggling my first year at University of Illinois, really didn't--did very poorly, did poorly in my conversational French 'cause I would--you know, I had placed out of beginners French, did poorly in rhetoric, believe it or not, and English.  And, you know, so I was--I was, you know, it was--it was almost a, a, a given that I probably was not gonna be able to come back and this Grace Holt person who is now deceased, this Grace--I ran into her and I--you know, I just started letting it all hang out, just saying I'm--you know, this is happening to me, what do I do?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And she said, "You know what?  Here's SWAT at University of Chicago, here's--."  She had on her own created some little mentoring--not mentoring, but tutoring kind of program for students, particularly African American students were just floundering because, you know, there was no real support base there.  And so I--you know, I went to SWAT, I went to the, the, the program she had a couple of times, but the, the man--young man she had there who was helping people with rhetoric or English, says I don't understand how you could be failing rhetoric or English.  I wrote things, we started talking, I said, nah, it ain't you.  So go back, have some confidence in what you're doing and writing 'cause he--you know, he--I mean, just write freely, you know, sit down and write.  So that gave me some confidence and I did that.  But for the--for the French, I really needed some tutoring.
Speaker 1: Now, now, now what was SWAT?  What does that stand for?
Speaker 2: You know what, Student Working--God, I wish--
Speaker 1: W-S-A-T?
Speaker 2: W-S-A-T, at the University of Chicago.  It was out of the (unclear).
Speaker 1: S-W-A-T.
Speaker 2: S-W--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: S-W-A-T.
Speaker 2: SWAT, yes.
Speaker 1: I don't know what's wrong with me (laughter).
Speaker 2: S-W-A-T, right.  No, but I think it may even still be going, but out of the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of--at the University of Chicago, and it was a--basically U of C [University of Chicago] students who, you know, were volunteering to, to tutor.  I have to admit, I was one of the--they usually were, were working with, you know, students from the neighborhood who were high school students.  I kind of snuck in as someone already in college trying to do, do French and so one of the, the guys who did the SWAT who, you know, did the interview said, "Well, don't tell them you're already in college, 'cause technically you don't count."  But it was--it really helped me because I just--I would've never gotten through French without having someone just constantly, you know, repeat in--with the Parisian accent and emphasis other than what I learned for three years.
Story_ID: 326737
Speaker 1: Now, what was your major?
Speaker 2: In college [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Political science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then I, I--
Speaker 1: Now, why did you decide on political science?
Speaker 2: Well because I always thought I wanted to be lawyer and, again, [HistoryMaker] Anna Langford was my role model and that kind of thing and I thought that made sense--
Speaker 1: Did you know here at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But then I switched to criminal justice.
Speaker 1: I mean, did you know Anna Langford?
Speaker 2: I did meet her when my minister [at Bethel Lutheran Church of Englewood, Chicago, Illinois] introduced us.  My minister, Sherwood Nelson, became one of her fans and--oh, excuse me--and really got me and several other members of the church involved in her campaign.  And I'll never forget, I was taking a political science class and the political science teacher kind of--'cause I'd walk around with these Anna Langford buttons on, and this is the same time Bill Singer was running, and Bill Singer--was it Bill Singer?  God, I'm not sure if that's his name.  I think Bill Singer was running.  And he--of course everybody--he was gonna be the independent alderman and Ann Langford was running as an independent 'cause the Dem- Democrats wouldn't run her.  And so he said, well, you know, glad you're trying--no, it wasn't--it wasn't Bill Singer, it was--God, I almost thought of his name because he was a political science teacher there.  Oh, and he and Anna ran at the same time and both won, but it wasn't Bill Singer.  It'll come to me.  And he was supporting, of course, the U of I [University of Illinois] professor who was running, and they both won.  So, you know, not only was she a black woman but she was an independent and--Simpson--is it Simpson?  Bill Simpson [sic. Dick W. Simpson] I think it is that was the alderman.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, way back--and, and it was U of C professor [sic. University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago].  I think it was Bill Simpson.
Speaker 1: Samson?
Speaker 2: Not Samson.  You're thinking--
Speaker 1: Simpson, okay.
Speaker 2: No, this is Simpson.  This is--yeah.  I think it's Bill Simpson.  It might not be Bill, but it's Simpson, I'm almost sure because he was the first quote, independent alderman from the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] and clearly having an independent alderman come out of Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] which was at that time patronage heaven was, you know, almost unheard of.  And so my political science professor would tease me about my buttons and say, "Well, you know, good to have hope" and blah, blah, blah.  So, of course, the day after the election when the both won--Dick Simpson.  Dick Simpson is his name.  Dick--I knew it would come to me.  Dick Simpson.  And they both won, he kind of shook my hand and said, "Well, you probably have a better story to tell than I do."  I mean because it was--you know, Dick Simpson was a liberal and he was, you know, running from a traditionally--fairly liberal community whereas Anna Langford was running against the tide.  I mean, she was running against the system, she was running against, you know, male dominant--I mean, she was running against everything, you know?
Speaker 1: Who was the alderman before she was elected?
Speaker 2: The alderman.  Somebody Murray [sic. Paul Sheridan].  Gosh, I should know this.  I--it--it's gotta be--because it was--it was a white alderman.  I think it was--John Porter [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Kwame John R. Porter] would probably know all this stuff 'cause he, too, was involved with Anna.  He and my minister and--were all involved in Anna Langford's campaign.  Something Murray, but I can't--I knew he was an Irishman that I cannot recall.  And the, the other part of that on the other side of Anna Langford was Father Lawlor's [Francis X. Lawlor] ward.  He also won.  So as Englewood abutted what's now called West Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]--you know, you couldn't go on the other side at least back in those days of Western [Avenue] 'cause that was Father Lawlor's ward and he was very much a segregationist and, you know--so you had Anna Langford in the 16th Ward, Father Lawlor in the--I think that was 15th Ward, you had Dick Simpson in the North Side, so it was a--I mean, it was up for grabs in terms of the political system, the patron--the, the old plantation.
Speaker 1: That's a big, big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah it was a big--
Speaker 1: --in Chicago [Illinois] with the Daley [Richard J. Daley] machine at its height, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  That was at the beginning.  At least that was the thought of the Daley machine's, you know, demise or at least it had a chink in the armor because--I mean, no way was Anna Langford supposed to win because the mayor had endorsed his alderman and all of the forces were out there with all the money that they commanded.  And then you had--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --ministers like John Porter and mine--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and regular people.
Speaker 1: William Dawson [William L. Dawson] was still alive then, too, right?  Wasn't he?
Speaker 2: William Dawson was still alive.  He was not as active.  In fact, the person that had taken over in Bill Dawson's place was Jim Taylor [James Taylor], big Jim Taylor, who was the mayor's main man and not only was the, the committeeman, he was the state representative, and he was very much anti-Alderman Langford, and anything like her, you know?  He was very much connected to the--to the old machine.
Story_ID: 326921
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're talking about, let me see, Murphy [sic. Paul Sheridan] was the--
Speaker 2: Right as I would recall.
Speaker 1: --white alderman--
Speaker 2: He was the--he was the white alderman.  And I think it was--
Speaker 1: --before [HistoryMaker] Anna Langford.
Speaker 2: --at a time when they were--you know, I grew up before seventy-seven neighborhoods.  People can't imagine that, but there weren't always seventy-seven neighborhoods.  And the--and the, the wards were different.  And I--if I recall correctly, there was one huge mammoth ward on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  Then, it got divided up in what became now probably West Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] or maybe some parts of Gage Park [Chicago, Illinois] that was the 15th Ward, and Anna Langford got the predominantly black ward of, of the 16th Ward.  And unfortunately, I guess she was left--that left, you know, the white ward to be, you know, to itself and, and the African Americans to themselves.  And so when Anna decided to run, you know, of course the, the machine at that time put an African American up against her and it was just, you know, foregone conclusion that she'd lose.  Not only was she at the time to be the first woman, but clearly she was running against a, a machine that, you know, a machine community that had been so much controlled by patriotism that the likelihood of her winning was almost impossible.  But, you know, again, she did win.  And that's why I said in terms of the--when my professor said, "I bet your stories are--you know, you have a better story to tell than, than, than Dick Simpson's [Dick W. Simpson]."  Well, I think that's true just because it was just--the, the resources weren't even given.  I mean, the--we were actually doing cookie sales and bake sales.  I mean, we got no, no democratic resources, none of that stuff 'cause all of it went to, to, to the machine's candidate.  And, in fact, it was one of those things--and Harold Washington at that time was just a lawyer if I recall right.  He wasn't even a state legislator, had an office on 63rd [Street].  And Anna was one of the first people to say take the money and vote for me.  I mean, Harold used that later, but I recall her saying, you know, when they--'cause, you know--
Speaker 1: Now that, that refers to a practice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Some people when they hear it now, they think it's fictional but it's real, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, absolutely true.  I was there.
Speaker 1: And in Chicago [Illinois], they would do what?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  They would pass out money.  They would pass out--not a lot.  I mean, it didn't have to be a lot, five, ten dollars--ten, fifteen dollars a vote, you know?  And, you know, you were committed to, to vote for, you know, this particular--my, my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] remembers when it was chickens.  It wasn't even food.  It was like, we'll bring you two chickens (laughter).  I mean, you know--so, I mean, it was just an amazing time.  And, and, and my mother having come to the, the Chicago in, you know, in the hey and the real throws of the machine, didn't even know that there was such a thing as a primary.  I'll never forget when Harold ran, I said, "We gotta go vote in the primary;" she said, "What is that?"  I mean, she's never had to bother with that before any.  It was a new--a new phenomenon for her that, you know--primary, never bothered with that before.  So I mean those were things that, you know, people take for granted now but were new and, and really groundbreaking in Chicago back then.  There was--there was a lot of excitement going on.
Speaker 1: So, so Anna Langford not only was the first black woman elected but she was the first black representation for that, that ward.
Speaker 2: Absolute--real ward representation, real people representation.  I think a lot was on Anna's shoulders.  I mean, that's when SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and a lot of other groups were involved in voter registration and stuff.  So there was--you know, Operation Breadbasket [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois].  There was a--you know, I'll never forget we'd go to Operation Breadbasket and she'd be there speaking.  The other candidate didn't even feel he had to do that because, you know, as far as he was concerned, you know, it was a done deal.  But, yeah, I mean, it was--it was a really in some ways a very exciting time.  It, it got my--it whet my appetite for--not for running.  I never thought I could be a politician 'cause Anna had a smile and a charisma that I don't think I have.  But it did--it, it, it whet my appetite for, for seeing political justice, of seeing, you know, the underdog can win.  And it kind of really, you know, got me excited about Chicago as a--as a--as a place of hope that, that piece of it.  And so, you know, when, when Harold Washington ran even the first time, I was excited, but the second time, I was just--I was just--I just knew it was gonna happen, and largely based on my experiences with Anna Langford's campaign.
Speaker 1: Now what, what year was it Anna Langford won?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.  You gonna make me try to think this out.  Okay, my daughter [Faith Pennick] was born--so it had to be--after--it was after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--had to be like late sixty--had to be like '68 [sic. 1971], '69 [1969], doesn't it?  Yeah, it had to be around there.
Speaker 1: I'm--that's what--I was thinking that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm almost sure it had to be about '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968] or '69 [1969] 'cause I know my daughter, my oldest daughter was a baby--not baby, baby, but she was like walking, so it might've been '69 [1969].  She was born in October of '68 [1968] so it might've been sixty-nineish.
Story_ID: 326922
Speaker 1: Now do you remember where you were when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: In '65 [1965], I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, '68 [1968], I'm sorry.  I'm thinking about President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].
Speaker 1: Kennedy, that's--yeah, '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], what was I doing?  Oh, I know what I was doing.  We were watching--'cause I was pregnant with my daughter [Faith Pennick].
Speaker 1: Well, maybe we can start with President Kennedy.  Now that, that--now that was a--kind of a devastating--
Speaker 2: Well, that was--I mean, if we start with--I was in high school.  In fact, we were--I was in my science class and somebody just, you know, burst in the door.  It was like almost I guess third, third, third period.  It was--the, the day was, you know, not over but we were--you know, it was not the first period of class.  Someone burst in the door saying, you know, "They shot the president, they shot the president."  And, you know, the instructor said, "What are you talking about?"  And he said, you know, "They shot President Kennedy."  At the time, we didn't know he was dead.  So to the--to the principal's credit, he--you know, people were all, you know, running around and he said, "We're gonna have a meeting in the auditorium and so we can let people know."  And, you know, so we immediately had all the teachers prepare us to go into assembly as it was called.  So we went into assembly and before we could all gather and get--you know, 'cause there was quite a few students at Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] then, he had died.  And so as they were assembling, they asked the a capella choir--I was part of the a capella choir--to sing, so we came out and sang a couple of spirituals and it was just so hard 'cause a, a lot of us were breaking up.  And we sang a couple of spirituals and one other song, might've been the battle of the--I can't remember, but it--I mean, so it was--I mean, it was a very moving day and one girl almost fainted.  It was just really, you know, bad.  Because who--you know, we never lived through that kind of thing.  I mean, we--Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] was the closest we'd known to a, you know, a president being assassinated.  So it was a very, very bad time.  They didn't wanna let school out because, you know, how do you do that.  I mean, you know, there--people don't know--it just wasn't the kind of thing where people were prepared as a system, as the Chicago [Illinois] school system [Chicago Public Schools].
Speaker 1: Why do you think that the assassination of John Kennedy had such an impact on the black community?  I mean, would there have been as much of a let--as much sadness if, if Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] had been shot or--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think we reacted to what our parents reacted to.  I mean, my, my mother's [Aurie Watts Baines] impression of Ike was he was a golfer.  He was a golfer and, you know, he did good during the war [World War II, WWII] but if there ain't no war and ain't no golf, he's useless.  The only thing I remember she liked and it may influence my hairstyle now is she liked Mamie Eisenhower's bangs.  I mean (laughter) that was the only thing I could remember my mother talked positively.  You know, his wife's bangs are pretty good, but other than that--I mean, the--he was kind of lackluster and, and, you know, at a time in the late '50s [1950s] when, at least for black people, things were changing and, and, you know, and he kind of like ignored it or, you know, didn't really seem to put that on the agenda.  Kennedy, although we now know that may have been a misinterpretation of his intent seemed to at least understand it and my mother was so impressed with him calling Mr. Meredith, you know, James Meredith, Mr. Meredith, so--you know, from the South, that was, you know, that was an amazing thing to have the president of the United States refer to a black man as mister anything.
Speaker 1: That's after Meredith tried to--
Speaker 2: You're right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --integrate the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: That's right.  And he kept referring to him as Mr. Meredith.  And that was just, you know, in her mind and I think she's right.  That sent a message around the country that this is a man to be respected.  And, I mean, he just--you know, he, he, he--I mean, his speech--I mean, many of us, you know, along with Dr. King's speech of I Have A Dream memorized Kennedy's, you know, inaugural speech about ask not what you can do for your country--ask not what your country can do for you but what you can--I mean, there were all kinds of, of, of pieces that, that connected to rightly and wrongly the African Americans.  And I think--so we as young people reacted the way our parents were reacting to, to the news, the way the adults, the way the teachers were reacting to his--to his--to his assassination.  And I also think because it was an assassination and not an illness or not--you know, I mean, you know, who--the, the very fact of being vulnerable enough to, to have within our country at that time an assassination I think was a--was a, you know, kind of a--an unnerving piece.  I think there was that and, and who he represented or at least we thought represented the African Americans was what created it.  So, you know, even though they couldn't release us early and after we did the assembly, I mean, we basically did nothing until the first bell rang and then they let us all, you know, go.  'Cause I mean, people were--the teachers were--I mean, some of the--I remember some of the teachers were crying.  It was just a very emotional, you know, time.
Story_ID: 326923
Speaker 1: And where were you when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?
Speaker 2: When Dr. King was--'cause I remember I was pregnant with my daughter [Faith Pennick], my oldest daughter, and I was watching something, some--something.  And what unnerved me was Walter Cronkite 'cause his voice was always so striking, and it wasn't the kind of immediate thing that you can get now, immediate news alert and they just show it.  They kind of say stay tuned for--you know, so you had to wait (laughter), you know.  Unlike now, they can run it across the bottom of it or just, you know, say it.  So you had to wait for Walter Cronkite and I think it was like--it seemed like forever, but maybe three or four minutes.  And he, he, he wasn't in a, a suit jacket as I recall which was amazing to see Walter Cronkite, you know--this is, you know--and he said, "This just in, Dr. King has been killed in--."  It, it wasn't even shot.  They knew he was dead, has been shot in Memphis [Tennessee] and, and, you know, it was just like, no this, this can't be.  I mean, how can this be, you know?  Just had a president, it seemed like yesterday even though it was several years ago, this cannot be.  And so we immediately started, you know, trying to find news and turn on some of the radio stations.  And, you know, it was--it--again, it was just like the--unlike with, with Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] where you had the--this emotional upsurge because it was like an--you know, you just couldn't believe it was happening.  And so there weren't any tears in my group and I was--I was with mostly people my age.  There weren't any tears, it was just a lot of confusion and, you know, people were like, well what do we--what do we do?  I mean, and, and they were talking about closing the schools and a lot of other stuff and you're like, well, you know, I--what do you do?  I mean, so--I mean, it was like it, it was horrific but it was kind of like after Kennedy's, you can almost except any--if they can assassinate a president, why of course wouldn't we expect that they would assassinate Dr. King, that kind of thing, you know?  It was kind of a--there was almost this kind of callous reaction, at least of, of the, the people my age, kind of like, well why wouldn't we expect this?  They--you know, they can kill a president.  And at that time, you know, the thought was they were killing a president because he was promoting, you know, integration and African Americans.  Of course they'd kill Dr. King, why not?  Why--you know, why would--what, what else would we expect?  So there was a callousness about it.  And then that--then, of course, that just kind of later translated to a lot of emotion and then, you know, the riots and the, the whole thing.  But I mean in the beginning, I think there was just kind of disbelief and this callousness about the whole thing.
Speaker 1: Was there any violence in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]?  Any, any riot?
Speaker 2: There was--well, they had--yeah, they had it.
Speaker 1: Rebellion?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They had a lot of--what, what I remember most about that, because I was pregnant, was Mayor Daley's [Richard J. Daley] shoot to kill or maim order and it sent a chill.  I mean, that to me was as chilling as hearing Dr. King died, was for a mayor to get on and to give the order to his police to shoot to kill or maim.  And I knew he was talking--I mean, for the most part it was Englewood.  There were some on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], but Englewood really--I mean, from that point they changed 63rd Street and the way everything was designed around what had happened in that riot.  And it just--you know, it seemed to, to, to add insult to injury to say shoot to kill or maim.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember--this is interesting.  You may--you may not remember them, but do you remember the Topographical Research Center [Black Peoples Topographical Research Center] in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: There, there were some ex-Vietnam [Vietnam War] vet--there were some Vietnam vets--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --that set up this and their theory was that, that Englewood was redesigned because of the riots and (unclear) was built as a bunker and they, they had a lot--
Speaker 2: I had heard that.  I--but, you know, I, I, I didn't know where it come from.  But living in Englewood, of course, that's what we heard that they built that as kind of to--you know, since you all did this, we're gonna build it this way so you--one, one you won't have access to the commercial strip but also we've got this buffer that I was--it was called buffer then between the--at that point was--which was more middle class and white community in the rest.  I mean, there were all kind of stories going around at, at that period of time.  I mean, you know, people react to tragedy, you know, differently and I think fortunately, there weren't a lot of--at least to my knowledge, a lot of policemen did not shoot to kill or maim but the, the fact that the order was given, you know, just sent chills up my spine.  And again, my husband who was now back from Vietnam said these were the same kind of orders that he had been given in Vietnam.  Those were exactly the kind of military orders you were given when you take a village.  So I'm sitting there listening to him and I'm--you know, so, again, it, it was--you know, it was a time where you just--at least for me, I just wasn't sure--I often felt like a, a, a person without a country.  I just felt like, you know, we don't belong here, but then where do we belong?  I mean, just the, the, the whole lack of grounding and footing--
Story_ID: 326924
Speaker 1: Quite frankly after Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death, I started working with John Porter [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Kwame John R. Porter] and, and my, my minister [Sherwood Nelson] and others and the school called the Englewood School of Human Dignity [Chicago, Illinois].  There was first the Woodlawn School of Human Dignity [Chicago, Illinois] and then the Englewood School of Human Dignity which kind of merged with it to teach African American history, basically to teach African American history.  And the importance of that was for us to connect as to why we're here as a--as a people and why we deserve to be here and, you know, deserve to be treated with respect here.  Because, I mean, you, you lose a lot of that when you see all this going on.  You know, you forget about the decades of, of slavery and, and the contributions made, you know, historical contributions made for--by our ancestors, so--
Speaker 2: So you taught African American history in this--had, had you been taught any African American history yourself?
Speaker 1: Only the--only the--only--I mean, they sent us all to--in fact my husband did too.  They sent us all to a training piece and the only--in fact I think John and several other people trained us.  Only that piece--and it wasn't the academic--through the academic lens if you will that would be in a--in a university.  It was--it was purely socially political in terms of understanding the social and political context of history of African Americans, which to me made it even more rewarding.  It wasn't the--you know, the Booker T. Washington and the, you know, W.E.B. Du Bois debate which, you know, most everybody knew.  But it got to, to the Fannie Lou Hamers who were--who were contemporaries, if you will.  I mean, they were around now.  I mean, it wasn't just trying to wrap your arms around who went before you.  That, too, but it was also who's, who's in the mix with you now?  Why is it important for you to care now?  And I really missed it and I wished that kind of school were, were--and maybe it is somewhere and I'm just disconnected to it were, were going on now.  Because I think that's--for young people anyway, it gives you a place to get involved.  We went to Jackson [Mississippi], at least my husband as I was too pregnant to go.  I mean, he went to Jackson, Mississippi, to look at--it gave you a real--a real flavor of who you are as a people which was missing then because clearly even though it was beginning to be taught in the public schools and the--and the universities, it--you know, it was--it was always through a filtered lens and so you wouldn't necessarily get the, the, the array of discussion that we were able to and John Porter was a master at that, at, at--we taught white racism, which was amazing to teach then because just the, the, the notion of saying white racism was supposed to make you evil and, you know, you go straight to hell.  And we had whites taught--whites taught with us.  All of our teams were integrated teams and when we taught.  So it was an amazing time.  And, and that kind of got--I know it got my husband through to some degree and it really got me through because, you know, I was like, why do I wanna bring a baby in the world, like this kind of thing.  So, I mean, that was--yeah.
Story_ID: 326925
Speaker 1: You were still in the Circle [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] when Fred Hampton was killed--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in '69 [1969], too.
Speaker 2: Yep, Mark Clark and Fred (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And as a political science major at Circle then, I--that must've--
Speaker 2: Well, it--
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet him, Fred or Mark Clark?
Speaker 2: I--you know, I met--I hadn't met Fred.  I had met Mark Clark and didn't know who he was.  As I said, I could be dense.  I mean, I knew--I knew he was, you know, a part of the Panthers [Black Panther Party], but I had--you know, I just met--I was with a group called Friends of the Panthers, who basically, we were too chicken to be Panthers and (laughter), you know, (unclear).  And I met people like, you know, now Congressman Bobby Rush [HistoryMaker Bobby Rush] and others who were, you know, not the chickens.  And we wanted to be on the periphery and so we did--you know, we helped out with the kitchen and we did some tutoring, but weren't really in the--in the group.  So I met Mark Clark at, at one of the--in, in fact in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] in, in one of the kitchens.  And, you know, only knew of him through that meeting, very soft-spoken and he--again, if you look at the color cast, very fair-skinned young man.  And so, you know, to see him kind of--he and Fred were like a contrast in color and really in, in demeanor 'cause what I knew of Fred 'cause I had--I didn't know him, but--Fred Hampton, he was very, you know, vocal and, you know, whereas Mark was kind of the, the shier of, of the two.  But they were seen as the, the, the leadership and so I knew of them but never met them together.  Met--as I said, I've met--I did meet--but this was after he--I did meet Fred Hampton's mother after the case.  So when it happened, I mean, it was again one of those things where you kind of--you're, you're, you're numbed down almost to, to the, the horrible--I mean, how many people did they send in to kill people in their sleep kind of thing?  And it was--I mean, people--some people were ready to take the street.  And, and people really don't really realize that it was the Panthers that kept that from happening.  It clearly was people like--I can't say I saw Bobby Rush, but some people like him who were of the leadership that kept it from being--it could've been really, really, really, really, really bad.  And they kind of, through, excuse me, their own demeanor and their own connection with people, talked people out of action, you know, of violent reaction.  And clearly some things did happen.  I mean, they didn't get to everybody, but it could've been much more orchestrated and much more violent and deadly for the--for the--for the masses had, had it not been the Panther leadership that kind of said this is not the time and, you know, Mark and, and, and Fred would not have wanted that.  That's not how you react to that.  And, in fact, what happened for some of us was to work on getting, is it Hanrahan?  I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Henry Hanrahan [sic. Edward Hanrahan]--
Speaker 2: Hanrahan, out of office, right.
Speaker 1: --who was the prosecutor--yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, to get him out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) prosecute.
Speaker 2: --of office which was amazing 'cause he was a Democrat and he was, you know, part of the, the old guard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Machine.
Speaker 2: --and that's when Bernard Carey came into existence based upon a reaction by black--of black voters which, you know, had heretofore been traditionally Democrat.  For them to switch sides for this would be, you know, never--unheard of, and again--
Speaker 1: And they made the difference on a countywide [Cook County, Illinois] level.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now that--that's really--
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: I, I just thought (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: --about that myself.  Black people--
Speaker 2: I mean, outside--
Speaker 1: --made a difference--
Speaker 2: Right.  Outside of the city, at that time anyway, there were very few other than Phoenix [Illinois] and very--you know, selective Harvey [Illinois] weren't a lot of black people.  But the organizing was beyond black people; it really was beyond.  There were young whites.  I mean, there was a, a lot of connection to this as this is the time to make a difference.  And, you're right.  The first time--and, and at least since I've been in Chicago [Illinois] all my life that a, a Democrat lost a seat that had been traditionally Democrat forever in a county election.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Just--you know?
Speaker 1: Who would think that he would lose it because of the murder of a Black Panther, you know?
Speaker 2: Of all things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there were some black people who clearly were not comfortable with the Black Panthers.  I mean, they, they didn't win everybody over.  But how they died and why they died just--there was no explanation worthy of, of anything other than insult and I think that just got people really revveted up, black and white, to say no, no, no, we can't--we can't--you know, we, we can't tolerate this kind of behavior.  So, yeah, it lead to county-wide political action that had made a, a, a difference of who--again, no one would've thought that that--from such (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --from such an occurrence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did you play a role in--
Speaker 2: Well, again, like--
Speaker 1: --campaign for--
Speaker 2: You know, I did--
Story_ID: 326926
Speaker 1: You know, I worked in, in one of Bernard Carey's offices on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I did some organizing in the community I was in.  I, I wasn't a leader in any way, but I did--you know, I stuffed envelopes, I made phone calls.  I mean, I did that kind of--the behind the scenes things people did.  And people were surprised because, you know, Bernard Carey's Republican and people are like, you can't possibly--you know, you, you work for [HistoryMaker] Anna Langford over here and Harold Washington.  Wait, this--you're confused.  But, you know, you could easily connect the dots and it wasn't about, you know, a party anymore.  I mean, 'cause my argument is that was--Wallace [George Wallace] had been a Democrat so, you know, we can't be stuck on parties.  We gotta--you know, we gotta get beyond that and look at, at the people and what they represent, so--
Speaker 2: Now, now that was--this is interesting time, too, on, I think, what was--Hurst [Charles G. Hurst] at Malcolm X [Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois] was a--I don't know if he was always a Republican, but he was a Republic- Republican I know.
Speaker 1: As far as I knew, he was always a Republican.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, I mean, I didn't--I didn't know the man very well, but I mean, he--but he, he was--he was Republican--you know, he was one of those--'cause my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] said and, and it's true, that's still true now that a lot of the people in the South are Republicans because of the Abraham Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] connection which I still quite don't understand, but--so, I mean, Republicans in the South weren't always, you know--and in fact according to my mother, you couldn't tell the difference between them and Democrats.  I mean, they, they both had the same philosophy and so in some ways, Republicans were much more likely to, to be respectful of, of African Americans in the South than, than the Democrats.  So I think he kind of came with that kind of, you know, what have the Democrats done for me lately kind of attitude and as I recall they kind of had that for a while, so it, it wasn't--you know, he was one of the few that was open about it but I think there were some others that kind of had that sense of--you know, the Democrats in Chicago [Illinois] have had their necks on black people, so why are we so loyal kind of thing, so--
Speaker 2: So--now, during these days, did you--did you know any of the activist lawyers or, or did you see--
Speaker 1: Other than--
Speaker 2: --them as models or--
Speaker 1: You know, there was Anne Langford, there was Jim Montgomery [HistoryMaker James D. Montgomery], there was Sam Adams [sic. Sam Forbes Adam].  I mean, there were--you know, you could name--Eugene Pincham [HistoryMaker R. Eugene Pincham].  You could name 'em, Kermit Coleman.  I mean, I could name the five that I knew of and only one woman in that mix.  And so those were the ones I kind of watched and read about and looked to see what they were doing.  Kermit Coleman was really involved in some of the, the black draft counselors, at least as I recall, were, so--I mean, they were kind of the ones that were legendary to be--to be out there and to be in the--Bill Cousins [HistoryMaker William Cousins, Jr.]--to be in the forefront of change as it relates to African Americans, and so those were--and again as I said, the only one woman that I knew was Anna Langford.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If there were others--
Story_ID: 326927
Speaker 1: So, anything else about UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] of those, those days before we move onto--
Speaker 2: Well, my first real big pro- well, there are two big things.  One, I joined Friends of the Panthers there, there.  And my first real big protest where I almost got arrested, just barely missed it, but did get suspended, was for a--the book 'Tally's Corner' [Elliot Liebow] that was written and some of us were protesting that book because it was--in our mind, it was--it was taught--in fact, it was I believe in the same political science class, and he, he said I respect your, your right to disagree, that it was--no, it wasn't his class; it was another.  It was taught as if this were a factual--I don't know if you know the book 'Talley's Corner.'  It--
Speaker 1: Tell us, yeah, about this.
Speaker 2: It's a book written by this white journalist who lived among African Americans in this city, he gives it a fictitious name, and it's near this street called Tally's Corner, and he talks about living with them and what they told him and what they did.  And it kind of like said here's the--if you wanna know about black people, here's the inside story.  And we said as black people, well, you know, guess what, black people tell you what they think you wanna hear and, you know, you just got your lens on and that ain't necessarily the real deal, and we don't want it taught as if this is, you know, all black communities all over in urban settings.  And--
Speaker 1: Margaret Mead's research in Samoa where they--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --told them whatever they wanted.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know it.  I mean, if I think you wanna hear I like greens and chicken, I'll say I like greens and chicken.  I mean, you know, so we kind of had that and the, the, the instructor--in fact, we asked the instructor not to have it as part of the readings and he refused, and so some of us went out, black and whites to our credit, and it was sponsored I believe by SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and some others.  And so we basically protested and stopped students from going in and--in the class and they sent the guards after us and so some of us got suspended, those who were visible and some of us didn't, and I always could not figure out who decided who got suspended and who didn't, but--so, yeah, that was my first--
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about that, who--about who got suspended?
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting because, you know, it was--it was an interracial group and some whites, several of the whites got--but more African Americans got suspended than white.  More African American women than anything, which really kind of threw me because we weren't the majority of the people.  I mean, there were three women--I'm--I may not be--three women, like six African American men, and like five or six whites, and only two of the African American women--all three of the black women got suspended and then two of the whites.  So, you know, when you kind of look at the numbers, you're going, what is this about?  So, you know, we expected it.  I mean, it wasn't like--we talked about it.  We figured that would--that would happen, so we, we took it.  But it was--we never really did understand.  And we asked--and everybody.  I mean, the whole group asked to know, well what--how was the criteria who would be suspended given, you know, we were all part of this.  How did you determine that?  And never got an answer to that but never really expected that we would.  But all three of the black women got suspended even though none of the--there were more black guys and there were about equal number of--well, there were about two white women, about five--three white men, two--one woman and one white man got suspended, but all three black women.  Now, we were probably the most visible and I can't say we were louder, but we were there, so--
Story_ID: 326928
Speaker 1: You graduated in--with a political science degree and--
Speaker 2: No, 'cause I changed it to--with all this going, I changed to administration of criminal justice and political science was my minor, so I graduated with the B.A. in administration of criminal justice.
Speaker 1: Okay, administration of--
Speaker 2: Criminal justice (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Criminal justice.
Speaker 2: They had just started that program while I was there [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  It, it didn't exist when I first started.  It was started by the law enforcement--what was that called?  The law enforcement associate--the law enforcement something association, EEEA [sic. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA)], the law enforcement something association.  Federal government had just started funneling money really to--for police officers to train people who were interested in law enforcement.  And--
Speaker 1: So did you see yourself becoming a criminal lawyer--
Speaker 2: I thought--
Speaker 1: --or something like that?
Speaker 2: I thought I would.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: At some point I thought I might even join the police force, but that changed after the shoot to kill or maim kind of thing.  And so then I got my B.A. in that.  Then, I went--I was a caseworker in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois].  I became a public--a public aid case worker which was really kind of great 'cause this is when my husband and I were separating and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you graduated and you came out in what year?
Speaker 2: I came out in '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I got my degree in '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really stopped attending class in like '70 [1970] or '69 [1969] for--you know--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: You know how it takes--it took a little longer to--especially with the suspension and clearing those little things up.  So I got my degree in '71 [1971], but I, I really stopped taking classes--
Speaker 1: Okay, so by--
Speaker 2: --like '69 [1969] or '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: --by '70 [1970], you were a case worker in--
Speaker 2: I was a case worker, um-hm, with--
Speaker 1: --in Englewood?
Speaker 2: In Englewood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, it was perfect.  There's a little story there to tell.  I had really applied for public assistance because my husband had, had--and I had separated.  My baby [Faith Pennick], she was about two I guess, two years old, and I didn't know what to do.  I mean, my mother [Aurie Watts Baines], you know, still was doing what she was doing, but, you know, how--she couldn't take care of me and my daughter.  So I applied for it and when I was applying, this woman, white woman, said, "You know, you have a degree, you could be a case worker."  I said, "Oh, I didn't know that."  I, I knew about case worker aides but I didn't--you know, I really didn't know.  She said--in fact, she said, "You could be a case worker aide," that's what she said.  And I said, "Well how do I do that?"  She said, "Well you can just fill out this application."  Rather than going on assistance, what they do at that time was people could work.  If you had--you know, if you could pass the test, you'd have a job.  You wouldn't need to receive public aid.  So I said, 'Okay, well let me get that, that information.  And when I looked at the information, I said, "Well, this just goes to high school.  I have a degree."  I mean, I have--she said, "You have a degree?"  She said, "Well, you could be a case worker."
Story_ID: 326746
Speaker 1: What was life like as a--as a case worker?  I mean, what did--
Speaker 2: You know, it was--
Speaker 1: What did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) very interesting because I didn't get Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]--when I went to take the exam, it was at Lane Tech [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois], my first going to Lane Tech on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I'd only gone on the North Side to go to Riverview [Riverview Park, Chicago, Illinois], so this was a new experience to go over there to do something else.  So when they called me and said, you know, you, you are--been accepted, I really think because of my name rather than where I lived, my first assignment was in North Side and took me a long way.  I had a piece of a car and it took me a long way to get over there and it really was kind of--you know, my mother [Aurie Watts Baines] was working now so I had to try to drop my child [Faith Pennick] off at childcare and it really was, you know, an inconvenience but, you know, it was a job, so, you know--and that was before I knew--really even knew that you could ask to be reassigned, so I was assigned to a North Side--I don't even know where that was on the North Side, and I was going into homes, rather than people coming into the office which was an interesting piece.  They were actually doing site visits.  I think that's how they were--they were calling it and I was partnered with a case worker who was leaving.  He was--she was going off to get her master's [degree] so she was leaving.  And she had a very nice rapport with her clients, but they were all middle class women that I could discern, very middle class.  And, in fact, this one woman--because I had gone to park my car 'cause we were using my car 'cause her car--so the white case worker had gone up ahead of me.  So the woman had--I guess let her in and so I came and rang the bell.  And she--I guess the case worker didn't say that she was--you know, that I was with her or that, you know, someone else was coming in.  And the woman said, "Well, you know, we're not interviewing for help right now and if you'll come back."  And I could see the case worker's eyes were like, oh, this is not good.  And I said, "Excuse me?  I'm with--," I can't remember her name.  I said I'm--she said, "Oh, oh, I'm sorry, come in." And--I mean, then they both looked kind of like, okay, now how do we go from--where we go from here?  Because she was--she was on--she was receiving public--her husband had left her.  I think he was a doctor or something.  She had no visible means of support and so she was entitled to public assistance.  And so they went through the, you know--she was trying to show me how to do a site visit.  And, you know, she asked questions about, you know, are you working?  And clearly she had two very young babies, so we knew that.  But, you know, all I could think of is in my mind, well why aren't you gonna ask her a question about the help she's hiring and what is she gonna use for that because if she's got money to hire help, why are we buying food and, you know--so anyway, that never got asked.
Speaker 1: That is an interesting--
Speaker 2: Never got asked.
Speaker 1: This is an interesting story.
Speaker 2: So that was--you know, so it was--so, you know, we went back to the office and, and so she asked me where I live, the, the case worker that I was assigned to.  I said "I live on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois]."  She said, "Well why are you coming way over here?"  I said, "Well, I don't know, this is where they need case work."  She said, "Well, you know, you can ask."  And I think she would've been--she was much more comfortable with me being reassigned and quite so was--so was I.  I don't think she was doing it so much as because of, of anything other than just letting me know, she said, "Well, you know, you can be reassigned.  I'm sure there's someplace on the South Side so you're not coming all up here and coming against traffic" and blah, blah, blah.  And so I worked for about three weeks out of this office and I put into--what I put in to go was the Auburn Gresham [Chicago, Illinois] office which was--which, which--no, no, the Roseland [Chicago, Illinois] office, but that was gonna be very far south.  And so somebody called--I guess it's when they really--this was when the, the case workers were under the county and not the state.  She said, "Well you know, there is an office almost in walking distance of your home if--they're, they're looking for a case worker as well.  I could--you know, there is a slot at Roseland but, you know--," and I said, "Oh my God, that would be wonderful, can I get it?"  She said, "Well, let me see what I can do."  And so sure enough, I got placed in Englewood, which was blocks from my house, so I could drop my baby off at the childcare center, at the Montessori school, be at work, and be sitting at my desk early, so it was perfect.
Story_ID: 326747
Speaker 1: But after I'd done that, I said, I wonder, you know, if maybe I would've learned more about how case work differs for some people had I stayed on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] in the--in the much more--it was near Uptown [Chicago, Illinois]--I know it was far north like near Uptown, so if I'd stayed there and figured out what they do for those people compared to--'cause it was very different, at least the training I got was very different, 'cause I was still a trainee, very different than the Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] office, very much more--
Speaker 2: How to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) authoritative and rigid about who's doing what.  I mean questions were very, have you slept with a man--I mean, just very unusual, I thought very intrusive questions.  Have you slept with a man or where was the baby conceived?  I mean, all kinds of--you know, none of the kind of questions that were asked of this woman.  So, I mean, I began to even with that--in that system noticed that there were some distinctions about just how--you know, who's on welfare and who gets treated a certain way for being on welfare.  So I mean that was--that was a very interesting time.  And as I said, that's when I learned about this difference between being a case worker and a case aide, and I was a case worker, although most of the people when I came to that office assumed I was a case aide because the vast majority of them were African American women and even though I--you know, and, and all the case workers had degrees, so, you know, I kind of stood out both ways.  I stood out because I was a case worker and an African American woman and, you know, I was--I was not a case aide, so--and even some of the supervisors treated me a little differently like I was, you know, kind of--you know, the--some of the--well, the African American case--supervisors were very happy to see me but some of the white ones didn't quite know what to do with me, that I was--you know, I wasn't an aide, therefore, what am I?  Well, I'm a case worker.  Like, you know--and, and one of my experiences when I took over from the--I ended up finally taking over a full caseload from a white man, I'll never forget him, Larry Frankel [ph.], had a beard, and real wild hair, and that's when they could wear--you know, it was--people could wear what they wanted.  And I went to this woman's home and I said, "I'm, I'm--you know, I'm Ms. Pennick [HistoryMaker Aurie Pennick].  I'm the case worker."  She said, "Oh, you've been here before."  I said, "No, I haven't.  I'm a--my first time.  I'm--you know, I replaced, replaced Mr. Frankel."  She said, "All you case workers look alike to me."  And I thought that was kind of funny because I said, you know, in her life, hey, one case worker, you know--and here I was thinking it was such a big deal that I was this African American woman case worker, and this woman says, "All y'all look alike to me," so it was kind of humbling.
Story_ID: 326748
Speaker 1: So how long did you do that before you went to law school?
Speaker 2: I did that for about.  Well, I didn't do law school--I did that for--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about four year--four and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, what was interesting, during the time all this changed, they changed--they actually stopped hiring case workers.  It's just--it's an interesting system, so everybody became case aides, so a lot of people coming in after me, woman, African American woman particularly with degrees came in as case aides.  They froze--I guess they called it froze the, the case worker job--the test so nobody could take the test.  So if you wanted a job right away, you come in as a case aide, which meant you made less money.  So there were quite a few women who were coming in with degrees who were case aides.  And one of us, one sat next to me, she wanted to go to law school and she wanted to go to police department [Chicago Police Department].  And I thought I wanted to go to, to get a master's [degree].  And so we were talking and she ended up going to the police department and, and, and then to law school, and I went on to get a master's in criminal justice 'cause they had just started this new master's program at, at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] where I had graduated.  So, you know, I said, why not?
Speaker 1: Now, when did you get master's in criminal justice?
Speaker 2: I got my master's--again, I got the paper in '81 [1981], I think I finished the, the--all the course work in like '79 [1979], you know, I had--there was some debate about my thesis at the time.
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: My thesis was that--I can't remember the title but that the number of African Americans incarcerated had, had less to do with the crime committed than it had to do with race.  Duh, but back then, that was a biggie, so, you know--'79 [1979], you know, nobody wanted to admit to that.  So, you know, there was--I had to have--in fact, really, the only reason I got out was they changed the, the head of the department.  Dave Fogel [David Fogel] came in as the head of the department and said, "I don't know what all the confusion was about, but here's your ticket," you know?  I mean, it was--'cause it--I had done the thesis, it had been read, and I got a mixed review.  Half my committee said absolutely correct--in fact, no, I take that back.  That was in the beginning.  All the committee said, you know, it's a--you know, it's a paper, but the department head had problems with the--he said it wasn't thoroughly researched and I didn't validate my premise or some--you know, anyway.  So it sat and it lingered, and so I functioned as if I had one and I would get one eventually and it--but it didn't happen until they changed the head of the department, which was so funny because it was Dave Fogel and I remember because that's the time after Harold Washington got elected, I went on the Police Board [Chicago Police Board] and Dave Fogel then went on the Office of Professional Standards [Chicago Police Department Office of Professional Standards], so we got to see each other again and he, of course, remembered, you know, 'cause he kept saying, "My God, what is this all about?"  I said, "Look, you tell me, I don't (laughter), you know.  I have no clue."  So it--it's so funny how life just intersects in a--in a way that you wouldn't expect.
Story_ID: 326749
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I, I did that and went on to--after getting the master's [degree] in criminal justice [from University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I--well, I divorced, remarried, had another baby [Keidra Chaney] while I was in school.  Never--always had babies going to school, except law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois].  And so then once I got out of my master's I--well, while I was--before I completed my master's I quit being a case worker because I--it was just too much, and I was married, so I--you know, I had a support.  It was just too much to go to work full-time and try to go to school part-time, so I quit and went to school full-time and got my master's.  And then after that, I did some part-time work after I got my master's--well, after I had finished the course work, at Salvation Army in their work release center there and got a real flavor of, of what's called community corrections, if you will.  And--which was good because part of my thesis on, you know, who gets incarcerated and who gets, kind of was reaffirmed for me based on just looking at some of the, the profiles of the men that have been incarcerated versus some of the whites that had been incarcerated, so then I just started looking for work to do that would be within my background, you know.  But I really--because I was--at this time, I had two children, and my second marriage wasn't going too much better than my first.  He, too, was a, a Vietnam [Vietnam War] veteran.  And I wanted to be close to home.  I--my--I was living in my mother's [Aurie Watts Baines] two-flat--the first floor of her two-flat in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] so, you know, there were a lot of reasons.  So I wanted to again work back like I had as a case worker as opposed to working downtown at Salvation Army, and a job came up.  I'd never heard of a group called Coalition of Concerned Women in the War on Crime.  Ethel Payne--do you remember Ethel Payne?  She was a journalist, used to work for the Chicago Defender, had her own radio station, I think talk--I can't remember what it was called.  She had her own radio station, one of the few black women that had a little radio station.  She and--
Speaker 2: Not WSSD [WSSD Radio, Chicago, Illinois], was it?  The little--
Speaker 1: I think it was.
Speaker 2: That little station that--
Speaker 1: It's like--yeah, and the--and what's the black guy's--oh, God, Carl Rowan.  She and Carl Rowan had--one of the first African Americans to have their own little radio stations on--to themselves where they just kind of gave their opinion.  I can't--I wanna say 'Perspectives' but I'm sure that's not what it was called, but she was--so I'd never met Ethel Payne.  I'd heard of her and she worked for the Defender.  She had--she and a group of women, [HistoryMaker] Earlean Collins on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and Rosa Moore [ph.] from the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and some others had put together a group called the Coalition of Concerned Women in the War on Crime.  And through this LEAA [Law Enforcement Assistance Administration] program, the same program that sponsored my master's degree, they had gotten money to start this rape counseling service and anti-rape hotline, and they had an office in Englewood, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's the Coalition of Concerned Women--
Speaker 1: Women in the War on Crime.
Speaker 2: In the War on Crime, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  There's only one man on the board and he was from Englewood, God what was his name?  Willie?  No, what was his name?  God, I hate that I can't remember.  Anyway, he was a wonderful man from Englewood and I remember him, so--in fact, he recommended me for the job when I was looking and said I really would like something in Englewood.  And they had a small office in the YWCA--YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Englewood, and--
Speaker 2: Now, were they--were they part of the Citizens Information Service at all or--
Speaker 1: No, they were just a small--in fact, they--it predates it.  They were just a small group of black women that came together and got this LEAA money to run--work on--in fact, they came together--really, their first response came together after the Hampton/Clark [Fred Hampton and Mark Clark] murders, and talking about a way to get the police to work with the black community, and they really came up with a very interesting--and it got stolen as a matter of--they came up with what was called a block watchers program where there would be individuals on the block--CAPS [Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy] now does this, but--where they would be actual individuals on the block who would be designated to watch out, could be block watchers if you will, and to just see, you know, who's doing what and to work with the police as opposed to against the police, and it was really seen as a police, police-community relations program, and in it was a--was they added a rape hotline, which they inherited from the League of Black Women who had no money to keep this hotline going, so it made sense that they would do this.  So I was very interested in it.  And from the Englewood standpoint, it was, you know, again not, not as close to being a case worker.  It was right down the street and the hours were perfect.  They were like nine to three, and a lot of community workers--since I was from Englewood, I knew a lot of the community groups that we were meeting with, so it was a perfect place.  In fact, [HistoryMaker] Josie Childs was the executive director at that time.  And so it was--you know, I did that and I can't really even recall how it all happened, but Josie left and with my master's in criminal justice, I became the heir apparent, if you will, and became the executive director of that, and, and with that, got to work with Ethel Payne more closely, John Sengstacke [John H. Sengstacke] and a lot of other folk that--Othello Ellis at centers for--at--yeah, center--not centers, Abraham Lincoln Center [Chicago, Illinois] and lot of other folk, got a lot of national travel which I'd never done before because they got this Washington grant and it was a model, quite--which I didn't know at the time for community groups to come together and to do this kind of police relationship.
Story_ID: 326750
Speaker 1: Because we [Coalition of Concerned Women in the War on Crime] had an office on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and one in the Duncan Y [Duncan YMCA Chicago, Illinois], one in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], one in Auburn Gresham [Chicago, Illinois], one in--can't even--I mean just was a, a, a very well thought out--from these women's--and South Shore [Chicago, Illinois], one in South Shore, point of view.  We ran the rape hotline.  We had rape counseling.  I had trained people who could respond to, to women who had been raped, so it was a major deal.  I did some testimony before [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun when she was a state legislator, she and Monica Faith Stewart [HistoryMaker Monica Stewart].  So it was a--you know, it was a--it was--for me, it was a, a window to do good as well as it, it satisfied my need to, to, to deal with justice, and so that was--I was--I was very excited about being able to, to do that.  Unfortunately, the funding ran out.  And when we tried to raise money locally from places like United Way [United Way Worldwide], things were said--I made some--I look back.  I almost--I, I have to laugh and look back on what was okay to say then, questions like, well if this is so important, why isn't the, the broader women's community embracing it?  Or why isn't the women's community embracing it, assuming that black women are not--you know, it was just--you know--
Speaker 2: Now, this is interesting.
Speaker 1: --why don't you have support letters from the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This, this is interesting because--
Speaker 1: --broader women's community and you sit there and you go--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --well I don't--first of all I don't know what the broader women's community is.  I mean, we're doing testimony in front of Carol Moseley Braun and Monica Faith Stewart who were legislators at that time, but wasn't enough, so--
Speaker 2: This is very interesting to me 'cause I know the history of Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety.  I used to--
Speaker 1: CANS, right.
Speaker 2: I worked for them for, for nine years.
Speaker 1: Right for Warren [Warren Friedman], yeah.
Speaker 2: CANS came out of the urban crime prevention program of--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Citizens Alert--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --which is a program of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I ran that later on (laughter).
Speaker 2: And--yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And that Citizens Information Center was a spin-off of the League of Women Voters.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: So these are the white women--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that--
Speaker 1: Absolutely, you get it.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: You get it.
Speaker 2: And so--your funding is cut off because the larger community is not in it and then I see CANS starts up in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, in all of the models--you hear what I'm talk--this is all predating CANS and you heard block watchers.  And we even tried--
Speaker 2: That's when--
Speaker 1: We even called it parent patrol where parents would go to the schools and help, you know, not just to, you know, people cross the street, but help kids walk home if they need to.  We had a service where if a child had to go home or had to be escorted home and the mother or parent wasn't there, we even had a program where there would be like foster parents that the mother would agree to that if someone would take that child, get that child there in my absence say if I'm, I'm--can't get home, there's a person on the block or nearby that I know that you can get my child to.  Because, you know, not everybody had cars back then.  I mean, we had all this worked out and Ethel Payne to her credit and a lot of those--those were some hard-working women--Willie Pitts [ph.], that was his name, in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]--hard-working people who figured out little things with no money 'cause there was not a lot of money involved in this.  I mean, no--you know, and we did it in five communities.  So it did become a model and I knew Warren Friedman.  I mean, Warren knows me from this.  In fact, I--he was at the university when I was still working for the Chicago--for, for them.  Because, you know, it was a model.  It got written up in, in, in Ebony and Ethel Payne was on--I was on talk shows.  I'd never been on a talk show before in my life, but because it was new and it was done by primarily blacks.  That was--that was the issue.  It was lit--it was run by black women and--a black woman and it was founded by black women.  And that--now it would be seen as a, a--you know, expected.  Then, it was kind of like, well wait a minute, why isn't there--again, I'll tell you what was said to me.  Why isn't the broader women's community?  If it's so important, why haven't they embraced it?  So--but as--and, and they kept getting--I mean, CETA [Comprehensive Employment Training Act] to the--again, to the city's credit, CETA kept them money so whereas we lost some LEAA [Law Enforcement Assistance Administration] money, we were never able to get--they were never able to get real foundation money, but CETA gave money so they had some--so, job training programs came out of that.  So I did some, some consulting work with them as they, you know, were trying to do it.  Then I went on.  After that I had met--what was her name, [HistoryMaker] Ruth Wells, I think who ran Citizens Alert while I was running Chicago--the Coalition of Concerned Women, so we knew each other 'cause we ended up at some of the same law, you know, community enforcement conferences.  So when she was leaving Citizens Alert and I was thinking about going to law school, so I didn't wanna do a, you know, a five-community thing which will require me to drive all around the city, I ended up applying for her job and I was the interim executive director for Citizens Alert for about two years while I was in law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, all of that's connected.
Speaker 2: So that was before Mary Powers.
Speaker 1: No, Mary was there.
Speaker 2: Mary was there?  Okay.
Speaker 1: But she was--she was on the board.  She wasn't (unclear)--Mary was one of the--in fact, she--I think she was one of the founding board members that came out of the Alliance at the end--the Alliance Against Repression or the Alliance--
Speaker 2: Yeah, against racist.
Speaker 1: Race--right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, repression [Alliance Against Racist Repression].
Speaker 1: That's where she came out, right.  Mary Powers was there, so--but she was on the board then, so--yeah, I did that and was in law school, evenings.  I, I basically said I wanted to just disappear.  I mean (laughter), you know, I wanted to do this kind of work, go to law school 'cause I went law school evenings.  They--you know, there wasn't a whole lot of time in between.
Speaker 2: Now, were you on the police board [Chicago Police Board] during this period of time?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  I didn't get on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was before.
Speaker 1: --police board until--'cause Harold [Harold Washington] hadn't won yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 326751
Speaker 1: And my life is just all a bunch of circumstance.  I--while I was at Citizens Alert, put in a proposal to the Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois] for funding, and in doing so, found an organizer that I'd known, Peter Earl [ph.], Latino man, I'd known for years in the community, real agitator, and he worked there.  He was a--in a fellowship program.  It was called a minority fellowship program.  And it was astounded like, my God, the Community Trust's, which I thought of as this very conservative foundation that I had taken training on how to raise money from them.  I said, "My God, Peter, they've hired you?  I mean (laughter), you know, what's going on?"  And he said, "Oh, you'll love it.  They have this minority fellowship program and they want people that know the community."  I said "But, Peter, you're more outspoken than I am.  If there was anybody that--."  He said, "Oh, no, but they don't care about that as long as you know the community and--," I shouldn't say don't care about it but, you know, if you know the community, you know how to--you know, know how to behave, you'll, you'll be okay.
Speaker 2: Now, this--
Speaker 1: "You should apply for it."
Speaker 2: This is maybe a--was, was that, that a signal to you that, that Chicago Community Trust was more serious than you thought they were?
Speaker 1: It was--you know what, it was astounding to me.  I'm gonna tell you, more astounding than them telling it was a minority fellowship, to see him.  I mean, he was just not--and I didn't know--you know, I didn't know the foundation world at all other than trying to raise money for it, but it was astounding to see this man that I'd seen in the community, you know, at some of the rallies and--you know, that I'd been a part of going, my God, you're acting--he had on a suit and tie and he was actually working there.  He was like, "Oh, yeah, he said you should look into it."  He said--he said, "I bet you'd be a great fit."  And he, too--I was already in law school and he said, 'cause I wanna go to law school at some point.  I don't wanna do it now 'cause I'm--he still wanted to do, you know, some community stuff.  In fact, he was still involved, you know, with--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --with politics.
Speaker 2: So you started law school while, while, while you were at--
Speaker 1: I was at Citizens Alert.
Speaker 2: --Citizens Alert, okay.
Speaker 1: And before then, I ran a battered women's shelter, so--
Speaker 2: That's pretty good.  You're right around the corner from the law school.
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was--at John Marshall [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which is why--
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Marshall.
Speaker 1: --it was so perfect when I left the battered women's program, like, be right downtown, right across from John Marshall.  So that's why it was so perfect.  And I really wasn't job hunting when I went to Community Trust.  I was pretty comfortable that I'd be at Citizens or at least 'til I finished law school.  And Peter said, "No, you'd really like this.  You just need to come and see what it's like."  And I said, "Well, aren't you gonna be--?"  He said, "No, it's only a year program." He said, you know, "They can only tolerate me for a year and, you know, you'd get to learn the road for a year" and blah, blah, blah, so I said, "Well, you know, what the heck?  What've I got to lose?"  So I just threw my hat in the ring, never really expecting anything from it since it was only the third fellow that they would've had.  The first fellow, and show you how life is, was Handy Lindsey [HistoryMaker Handy Lindsey, Jr.].  So the second one was Peter Earl.  And, you know, the likelihood of me,  [HistoryMaker] Aurie Pennick, being a fellow was, you know, so I really--you know, I'm still doing my Citizens Alert work and very much involved and I get the job.  So, you know, I guess people were shocked as me getting a job as they were Peter, Peter Earl, but it was--it was a really--it was called the minority fellowship program, and it basically to, to the Community Trust credit, was the first if not only program that brought in people of color to get them exposed to philanthropy 'cause philanthropy at that time was very white.  Most of the program officers were white.  All of the, the presidents and executive directors were white men.  So this was an entree for people of color to get into the mix to actually see what philanthropy is like and if you're lucky maybe you'll find something down the road.  And so that's kind of what happened.  Handy became my mentor and I was asked to stay a second year, which was unusual 'cause it was usually a one-year fellowship, but Bruce Newman [Bruce L. Newman] who was the executive director then, I used to always tease that he made me stay another year 'til I got it right.  But because I was in law school and he was a lawyer, he kind of, you know, had some, some empathy for what I was doing 'cause I was still going to law school evening.  And then they sent me to New York [New York] as part of this fellowship to work for the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation [New York, New York].  So not only was I working at the trust, but I got this experience of working with a national foundation which, you know, again, never would've expected.  From that, I got head-hunted to work with the MacArthur Foundation [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], which was a national foundation, so the work at, at the McConnell Clark really made a difference.  And I did that until I passed the bar, a little longer 'til after I passed the bar, and then met with [HistoryMaker] Joyce Hughes who was the general counsel for--well, I--let me back up a little bit because when I was at the trust--
Speaker 2: Let's put some dates to some of this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, let's put some dates.  When I was at the trust in the--had to be '84 [1984] 'cause I graduated--no had to be '83 [1983].
Story_ID: 326752
Speaker 1: I had just left Citizens Alert, and Harold Washington I think got elected in '82 [1982] if not mistaken?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983], okay.  Well, I knew it was close. And he appointed me to the police board [Chicago Police Board], so that's when I went on the police board which was, again, very interesting, 'cause having come from Citizens Alert, some of the aldermen thought I could not be impartial, that I'd be biased 'cause, you know, Citizens Alert was the police watchdog.
Speaker 2: It's the--yeah, police--
Speaker 1: Very much so.
Speaker 2: The, the police watchdog.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, very much so.
Speaker 2: Right.  It comes out of a radical left (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --organization.
Speaker 1: So I got really scrutinized and I'll never forget that David Orr was there, I believe Troutman [Arenda Troutman].  That seems early for her, but I believe--I can't remember who the alderman was if it wasn't her.  I think it was Alderman Troutman.
Speaker 2: She must've been just elected--
Speaker 1: Just elected.
Speaker 2: --around that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I--I remember 'cause I remember she was so tall and I'd never met her before and I think that, you know--
Speaker 2: Arenda Troutman, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so I--they had me and they grilled me about can you be impartial and, you know, all this work and, you know, we--who would you be representing?  And, you know, although I no longer--and I remind them I no longer work for Citizens Alert.  And I'll never forget, Roman Pucinski comes in.  He was part of the committee but he was late.  And, you know, of course they defer to him.  And David Orr did a good job, I thought, of trying to balance the questions, but, you know--and so they defer to him, Roman Pucinski, and he just sat there for a little while and said, "Okay, this is it, (unclear) I'm through."  And he just said, "Well, anybody named Aurie gets my vote."  Well, his daughter--and I didn't know where the heck that came from, then, Aurie Pucinski, I'm like--
Speaker 2: Aurelia Pucinski.
Speaker 1: I'm like, of all--I mean, here ago--who knows.  And he--that was it.  He said that, end of the committee meeting and I was put on the police board.  Can you believe it?  I mean--so, I mean I walk out shaking--
Speaker 2: That's the way things work.
Speaker 1: I mean, you know.  And they deferred and I just thought, "Oh God, what is he gonna say?"  'Cause, you know, I mean, I was just--by this time, I was ready to like, you know, this is free.  I don't need to do this (laughter).  I can, you know--but that was the end of that.  And so I sat on the police board.  It was a very interesting experience.  Reverend Daniels [sic. Wilbur Daniel] from Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], the, the Antioch Baptist Church [Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] was the chair of the board.  And so we helped to elect Fred Rice [HistoryMaker Fred Rice, Jr.], the first, you know, police superintend- African American police superintendent, so that was, you know, an accomplishment under Harold Washington, so it was a--you know, I, I felt very--
Speaker 2: That--that's some of the police board's related to that election of Fred Rice's--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yep.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was the group that, that--
Speaker 2: So the police board actually--did, the police board actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Made--well, we made recommendations--
Speaker 2: Recommendations, okay.
Speaker 1: --of three and he was part of the, the--there were three.  I think he was the--one of the top candidates and, yeah, so--but, you know, I--it felt good to be part of, you know, the, the history of, of selecting the first--Nancy Jefferson, who was wonderful, was on the board then.
Story_ID: 326753
Speaker 1: She was in decent health then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, the police board [Chicago Police Board] meetings and I've been to them.  I wasn't to--I, I hadn't attended one until mid '90s [1990s] but police board meetings in the mid-'90s [1990s] were really--if, if you haven't been to one, it's a--really a tense event.  People who have deep-seated grievances with the police department [Chicago Police Department] about police brutality or wrong-doing, they come before the police board with their grievances, and many have come back over and over again.  They're emotional, they're angry, some, some of them shout and, and--you know, it's--tell me--tell me--do you have any stories on those days?
Speaker 1: Well, it--you know, again, I was--it was--it was a blessing because I think with, with Nancy's [Nancy Jefferson] presence, and Nancy Jefferson was, you know, the consummate activist in Chicago [Illinois] and people respected her, and quite frankly I think with, with Reverend Daniel's [Wilbur Daniel] leadership.  I mean, he had that, you know, that very, you know, spiritual, you know, sense of it.  They were very sensitive to people.  That was when Richard Brezak was just about to go off and so there were some issues, but there were still some sensitive--very--the only--the case that I recall coming up was the Wallace Davis case, and isn't it funny 'cause I ended up knowing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Wallace after.  But that was the case.  That was the major case at that time.  That and the, the Wilson brothers [Andrew Wilson and Jackie F. Wilson], the brothers who supposedly shot the policeman and they went on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] rampage.  So there were several but, again, they were--they were isolated.  There were not many issues that had not been addressed.  And the--and the good news when Dave Fogel [David Fogel] who came and head of the Office of Professional Standards [Chicago Police Department Office of Professional Standards], he really did open up the, the office and really did, I think, a much more thorough and balanced investigation.  I think prior to that, there were some issues of whether--you know, not even from just the community side, but even from the police side.  I mean, there were some accusations that things were not fairly investigated.  But I think Dave Fogel, the same Dave Fogel who gave me my--you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what you just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) really came in and, and, and balanced some of that out.
Speaker 2: What you described when you describe the names, it sounds like a more liberal police board than what we have today--
Speaker 1: It wasn't much more--
Speaker 2: --you know?
Speaker 1: I wouldn't call it liberal, but a much more sensitive.  I think we still had some of the--I mean, let's be real.  We still had some of the same constraints.  But, again, you had Harold Washington as mayor.  You had Dave--I mean, the, the whole--it--you know, the, the opening up of the city, the, the, you know, the, the recognition as some things do go wrong no matter, you know--and don't get me wrong, we still had--what's the guy's name, he was still around, Burgess or whatever his name was, he was still around.
Speaker 2: Jon Burge.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Burge.  He was still around.
Speaker 2: He was the commander of--
Speaker 1: He was still around.  He was the commander.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, I mean, isolated and--I mean, there were things--there were--I mean, there were still some--I mean there were--we had some policemen actually filing complaints against other policeman because when Fred Rice [HistoryMaker Fred Rice, Jr.] got to be the superintendent, there were issues of people, police officers in some of the district offices writing Fred Rice and showing an African American with the Chinese--you know, I mean fried rice as opposed to Fred--you know, I mean, that kind of stuff and all kind of racist things, so--
Story_ID: 326754
Speaker 1: So, you went to the--
Speaker 2: Community Trust--
Speaker 1: Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois].  You, you had a fellowship before and you did it for two years you said?
Speaker 2: Did it for two years.  As I said, part of it was to send me to a national foundation and--of my choice, which I thought was really--you know, they, they worked it out that I could choose a place where I'd like to just go for the summer and, and they did that which was very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So you went to New York [New York] to McConnell?
Speaker 2: I went to Edna McConnell Clark [Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's Avon [Avon Products Inc.] money which I now know, didn't know before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very--it was a national foundation, and it did criminal justice which again was my background, you know, it funded criminal justice, national criminal justice.  So that was a nation--it was a good match for me and it gave me an experience of living in New York for a summer which I'd never done and also seeing how a national foundation worked.  Then I got Rebecca Riley of the MacArthur Foundation [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] was looking for a second person under her as assistant director to the special grants project in MacArthur and that's when I went there for about four years, so it was my segue into philanthropy, so it was a--an interesting time.
Speaker 1: Okay, well how, how was it to be in a, a--you know, a, a--an officer at a foundation and, and how did your perception of the foundation world change, you know, once you got on the inside?  What did you think it was before you got into it and, and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I always had the feeling it was and, and, you know, just to be blunt, white boys with toys kind of thing that, you know--you know, their money, what do we do with it?  But it really--it turned out to be much more difficult.
Speaker 1: Let me just interject this, that I think it--there was IRS [Internal Revenue Service] legislation--I mean, laws that, that changed--it, it was really like they formed--they, they would fund their daughters'--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there were very, very loosely formed--
Speaker 1: Puppy farm or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Most of it was to keep it within the family or in some way, form (unclear).  And some of the federal legislation laws, IRS, internal revenue laws changed, you know, primarily because of that.  There was a lawsuit when I went to MacArthur and I think it also led to my coming into MacArthur by Roderick MacArthur [J. Roderick MacArthur], the son of John D. [John D. MacArthur] who sued the board of MacArthur Foundation.  He did a board derivative suit for that very thing, saying it was self-serving, that they were giving to their own little pet projects.  When I came on the board, Jonas Salk was still on the board and what was that woman's name, Shirley [Shirley Hufstedler]--she had been under Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.].  She had been head of education [U.S. Department of Education].  I'll never remember.  I'll--it'll come to me.  And so there were prestigious people on the board, 'cause it was a paid board.  I mean, it--you know, they got paid for, for board meetings.  And so, you know, I was the first African American program officer.  They did have clerical staff, but I was--support staff, I was the first African American program officer.  Paul Harvey was on the board.  And I think it honestly was in response to Rod's [J. Roderick MacArthur] issue of it's not a diverse foundation.  Clearly, there was no people of color on the board, but there are no program officers of color on the staff.  How can this be reflective of, you know, of anything?  And so I came on board and it's interesting because the special pro- special grants program at that point was Chicago [Illinois] and West Palm Beach [Florida] which is where the, the, the foundation really got a lot of its money from the--from Florida bankers.
Speaker 1: So, so this is 1984--
Speaker 2: This has gotta be--
Speaker 1: --eighty-five [1985]?
Speaker 2: Eighty--about '84 [1984], '85 [1985] 'cause I only stayed at the trust at the two years, although they--you know, they did offer me a full-time job, but at that time I got more money, so to--and more money to spend at MacArthur, so that was very interesting.  I had learned through the Community Trust that it's not as easy as one thinks, giving away, as Bruce [ph.] said, other people's money.  You have the responsibility of due diligence of not only making sure that the organization is who it says it is, but that the money will be used wisely.  I mean, there's not this whole thing of, you know, give it to you 'cause I like you.  I mean, there's gotta be more to it than that.  You've gotta be able to plead your own case.  And so I learned that.  I thought I, I, I learned that very well at the Trust, the, the integrity of the process as well as making sure that the organizations are respected in, in, in doing it.  There's no reason--as they used to say, just 'cause you're saying no to an organization doesn't mean you have to hurt their feelings or make them feel bad.  There's a way to say we can't fund you but yet we still respect what you do.  And that, that held true at MacArthur.  I think it was different, much more money to give, much broader range 'cause they could give nationally and I was invited to, to--as the only African American program officer, I got invited to a lot of events nationally that I'm sure I would not have otherwise.  But it, it gave me a lens of, one, how philanthropy operates and the differences within foundations, the community trust at that time was very different from the MacArthur Foundation which was an--a--an independent foundation.  The Community Trust just virtue by the way it is created by law has to operate differently, so they were very different.  I mean, Mac- MacArthur had its own, had two or three buildings in New York.  I got to stay in the penthouse of one of those buildings that the foundation owned for a couple of days with my kids.  I mean--you know, I mean it just--difference even within the philanthropic communities so that was--that was very important for me to learn having been on the other side of trying to raise money all the time.
Speaker 1: And MacArthur's money is--was insurance--
Speaker 2: Base--
Speaker 1: --based.
Speaker 2: Bankers, Bankers Life--
Speaker 1: Bankers Life.
Speaker 2: --and Trust.  Right, Bankers Life and Trust [sic. Bankers Life and Casualty Company, Chicago, Illinois], uh-huh.  And so, yeah, I mean it, it, it, it was just--you know, and having, you know, board members elect themselves versus the community foundation where you have certain people that get to appoint board members were all part of my learning process about the foundation world, and it was very interesting.  I, I learned a lot.  I grew a lot in terms of my own understanding of--you know, how you think if you're born in the city you know everything about the city and I realized once I got in philanthropy, I knew everything about my part of the city which was basically the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the downtown area.  I would get lost going to the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], it really gave me a chance to really understand the city as a whole and how some of it was very much alike and how some of it was very different, and I really appreciated that 'cause I would not have gotten that otherwise, so it got me out of my own comfort zone of, of, of what I knew and that was good.
Story_ID: 326755
Speaker 1: Then, as I said, I met--Harold Washington was alive then.  In fact, I had met him--I had passed the bar and I really wanted to do some legal stuff, and there were two opportunities to work in his administration.  And one was with the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority], the CTA law department and I knew of [HistoryMaker] Joyce Hughes from some--our paths crossing.  And she interviewed me and said "How would you like to work in the CTA Law Department?"  And so I left MacArthur [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] and that's what I did.  Unfortunately, as I was doing that, Harold Washington died.  I mean, I had met with her I think in that October, planning to leave the first of the year to go to, to CTA and Harold Washington died in November, so, you know--
Speaker 2: This is 1987?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  It put some, you know--I mean, it kind of slowed up a lot of stuff because, you know, Joyce wasn't sure she wanted to stay at the CTA since he had appointed her.  I mean, so there was just, you know, people thinking out what they wanted to do.  So I ended up--still ended up going to the CTA and working under Joyce Hughes for a couple of years.
Speaker 2: Did the, the administration change much when--I mean, did, did things change once [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer was elect--was--
Speaker 1: At the CTA?
Speaker 2: --became the--
Speaker 1: Not really.  I mean, I think some of it was very much, you know, recognizing it was transition as opposed to permanent.  I know when I went to the CTA under Joyce, Joyce had changed it tremendously which is what Harold Washington had wanted, that it was no longer, you know, the old boys network.  It was--she opened up not only the law--the, the, the law office itself in terms of who she hired as lawyers, but some of the private attorneys that were getting some of the money from the CTA changed.  I mean, you, you had more African American partners of firms actually doing some of the in-house work, so a lot of that had broadened.  She, you know, really didn't get credit for a lot of the stuff she did in terms of changing the pay scale for lawyers in the CTA.  When I came on board--well, she had changed it, thank God, shortly before I came on board, but many of the lawyers hadn't made as much as some of the secretaries.  I mean, it was just--you know 'cause lawyers were not part of what the, the business was.  The business was driving buses and trains, and so they didn't know where lawyers fit and Joyce had to really professionalize and modernize the law department, and so I was proud to work with her to do that.  So when, when Harold died, there was a--kind of a, you know, a period of time where not the law department, but the CTA changed from I think there were about two or three heads of CTA in less than a couple of years and so that was--that was trouble for the--for the law department because, you know, you have to respond to whoever the head of it is, so it changed about--I can't remember there were at least three or four changes during my time there in terms of who actually ran the, the CTA itself based upon the changes in the--and who--in the mayor's office.
Story_ID: 326756
Speaker 1: So you were at CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] until '92 [1992], right?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and what, what happened in '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was enjoying my job and got a call--I had been doing some work for United Way [United Way Worldwide].  The chairman of the board, [HistoryMaker] Clark Burrus, at that time had asked me--had asked the general counsel, my boss, if I could be the, the CTA's point person for United Way given my background in philanthropy and it made sense, so I was the point person for that.  And I helped the United Way come up with their discrimination category.  They had a whole category where they wanted to fight discrimination in Chicago [Illinois], so I helped them come up with the, the, the context for that.  And in so doing, I guess my name got bandied around when the head of the leadership council was thinking about retiring.  And quite honestly I was--it was one of those cases where I was really enjoying what I was doing 'cause I was doing law as well as I was doing some of the, the work for the board in terms of contract resolutions.  I helped with the draft of the first anti-apartheid ordinance.  I mean, so got to do a lot of, you know, things that, that made a difference to me in addition to, to practicing law.  So, when the headhunter called about the Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities [Chicago, Illinois] which I knew of because of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] visit to Chicago and I knew that that was an outgrowth of that.  I initially said, "You know, I'm not interested.  I'm--know, I'm doing what I'm doing and thanks but no thanks."  And then I had a good friend who interviewed for the job who I thought would've been perfect for it and she came back saying, "No, you know, I think you'd be ideal for this not only because of your, you know, issue around, you know, equity and discrimination, but because you're a lawyer and they still do litigation and they have a whole legal department and, you know, I think it would be a neat fit, and so I gave 'em your name."  So the headhunter called me again and he said, you know, I know we talked but I really think if you just put your hat in the ring, you know, see what it's like, you know, so I did, and the rest is history.  But it wasn't something initially that I thought about 'cause I was quite comfortable doing what I was doing at the CTA.  And so in '92 [1992], I started with the Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, and at the time had not appreciated--
Speaker 1: Now you started at, at, at--as the president and CEO of that?
Speaker 2: I start--uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: President and CEO, yeah.  Carol [HistoryMaker Carol Moseley Braun] had--Carol (unclear) had retired.  At the time, I hadn't really--I mean, I knew of it because of--I--you know, I was cognizant of Dr. King's coming to Chicago and living on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] so I knew some of that history, but I really hadn't connected the leadership council that closely to all the people that I--that I knew and respected like Al Raby and Bill Berry and those folk.  And I only knew teensy bits about Dorothy Gautreaux only because I lived in West Pullman [Chicago, Illinois] and there was a Gautreaux health center which was in Altgeld Gardens [Altgeld Gardens Homes, Chicago, Illinois], so I didn't know at all that the leadership council had been the group that was in charge of monitoring that consent decree that came out of the lawsuit.  I wasn't even aware of the lawsuit, quite frankly.
Speaker 1: Now who is--who is Dorothy Gautreaux and what was--
Speaker 2: Dorothy Gautreaux, interesting enough, came from New Orleans [Louisiana], her family with the, the name Gautreaux, was a public housing resident in Altgeld Gardens.
Speaker 1: She was a black woman?
Speaker 2: Black woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And when Dr. King came to Chicago in '66 [1966], she was part of the group along with Al Raby and others, she was very much an activist, who had urged Dr. King to come to Chicago for that summer.  And at the same time she and several other residents of public housing formed a class and filed a discrimination complaint against the Chicago Housing Authority for racial segregation and racial discrimination and de facto segregation--the--I'm sorry de fact segre- discrimination.  And that case eventually included HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and became a major, major case [Hills v. Gautreaux, 1976].  She filed it in 1966.  Unfortunately, she died--she had died by the time the [U.S.] Supreme Court in 1976 affirmed it and created the, the, the Gautreaux Program [Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program] which the leadership council ran.  So I had to--you know, I had to quickly kind of research--I, I was aware of the Arlington Heights case [Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp, 1977] that the leadership council had tried at the U.S. Supreme Court, 'cause I read, read that in law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois] about the, the testing and fair housing laws--well, no the, the one--the--Arlington Heights was the fair housing laws; the testing case was the Bellwood case [Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 1979].  So I read several of the cases that the leadership council had filed at the U.S. Supreme Court but I hadn't connected Gautreaux because that was not a leadership council case; that had been a separate case, but the leadership council was administering that program.  So unbeknownst to me when I walk in the door, I'm faced with a lot of the civil rights fair housing history that I'd read about and, and not really understood going in was gonna be part of my charge.  And so, you know, from 1992 to 2002, I had the pleasure and sometimes the anguish of running that, that organization.  At the time, it was the largest and the oldest fair housing organization in the country and the only fair housing organization started by Dr. King.  And by that, I mean by his coming here and the outgrowth of that with one of the--one of the charges he said to the--gave to the city of establishing some kind of mechanism to assure fair housing, so I did that.
Story_ID: 326757
Speaker 1: Well what is the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program?
Speaker 2: The Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program came out of the lawsuit that Dorothy Gautreaux and others filed against CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] and HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and what the [U.S.] Supreme Court said was you have got to develop a mechanism.  Public housing has segregated by class and race these people.  You have got to come up with--it was supposed to be a short-term remedy, a short-term solution to this by giving vouchers to public housing families to move into non-segregated areas of the region, not just in Chicago [Illinois] but of the region, supposed to be a short-term project 'cause eventually you're gonna build housing, public housing the right way so we won't have to do--that was gonna be the scattered--
Speaker 1: So as to decentralize--
Speaker 2: --site piece, right.
Speaker 1: --public housing.
Speaker 2: It was gonna be the scattered site piece that was gonna really be the, the remedy.  Well as it were, the, the, the section eight piece took, took wings and became really the, the, the, the, the, the, the program, if you will; it was a success story.  When I--and I remember even I was still at MacArthur [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] when the leadership council held their first registration because they--at the time, they were on State [Street] and you had to walk--I had to walk past their offices to get to, to MacArthur and I thought it was a fire.  I saw all these people out in the middle of the State Street and the policemen on horses.  You know, and then later I read that that had been the first registration for these certificates, these housing--thousands of people had taken to the street to get these certificates.  So after that, the leadership council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois] started doing a phone registration, phone-ins, and as many as, you know, fifteen, sixteen thousand people would try to, to, to, to register for something like, you know, four hundred slots--I mean, four hundred vouchers.  I mean, they would accept two thousand people, you know, with people knowing that they would drop off, but they--most of the times, there were like three hundred, two hundred vouchers a year that they had.  So that piece of the program really got to be the, the, the signature of it.  And HUD looked at this saying, God, this may be the way.  Maybe we won't have to build housing.  Maybe we don't have to build scattered site.  Maybe we can give people vouchers, they can move into existing housing, save us money, and, you know, also undermine--get, get away from the segregation in class and race, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah and around that--the time that you were there, the--I know the Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] was knocked down and--
Speaker 2: Well, not really, no.  I mean, they were just about to do that, 2002--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I left in 2002.  They--the, the, the CHA--the, the transformation plant had just been endorsed so they hadn't really started knocking them down yet, but they were closing them.  They were closing them and, and some of the families, particularly Robert Taylor [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois], some of those families, were coming into some of that program.  The difference, though, and I--and some of the, the--the leadership council had a phenomenal staff.  Some of those people had been there almost from the, the day the organization opened the door, so they'd seen a difference between the first group that came in 1976 and the group that was coming in in say 1996.  They--the group in '96 [1996] was much younger, had many more children.  Often, this had been the only placed they lived.  The groups in '76 [1976], older, sometimes whole families intact.  Sometimes you had a husband and, you know, I mean more educated, had some job experience, and often had lived other places.  This was not their only placed they'd ever lived, so there was a very difference in the--in the profile of these families.  And, and that--for that reason when HUD and Secretary Cisneros [Henry Cisneros] who loved that program; he was the HUD secretary, they--we tried to caution him that this not a panacea.  You can't put all your eggs in this basket.  You need to still be building quality public housing throughout the city not in segregated ways, not hopefully in, in massive high rises, but don't put all your eggs in this one basket because it doesn't work for everybody and it clearly won't work when Chicago's housing market heats up as it has.  So, you know, but--you know, sometimes in the rush to replicate or in a rush to find a quick fix, you know, vouchers seem so much easier than building public housing the right way.  So in some ways, you know, the, the leadership council became the, the, the mantra, if you will, for decentralizing and demolishing public housing and going to vouchers, even though it was against what those that the leadership council had advised, that this is not a panacea; it's gotta be a mixture of both.
Story_ID: 326758
Speaker 1: So how do you feel with the net result of this?  I mean, I, I know some of the housing activists complain there's not enough places for people with vouchers after the destruction of Cabrini [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and Robert Taylor [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and Darrow Homes [Clarence Darrow Homes, Chicago, Illinois], and other places.  Are people getting the--are, are they able to find housing, you know, in the city?
Speaker 2: No.  That's the simple answer.  I mean, again, it was--it was--it was--I mean, we could see it coming in '96 [1996] where the housing market was heating up.  I was born in the city.  I mean, people have turned lofts into places that used to be warehouses.  I mean, people live on skid row.  I mean, they live in these, these--you know--
Speaker 1: Our offices are--
Speaker 2: --three hundred thousand dollars and, you know, these three hundred thousand--
Speaker 1: Our offices are in a area that used to be skid row.
Speaker 2: Yeah, $300,000 lofts that used to be skid row where, you know, I would be afraid to go down Madison Street because all the, you know, the homeless guys would be on the--so, I mean, who knew that this was gonna happen?  And so, again, a practice that puts all its eggs on being able to use vouchers I think is a mistake.  The vouchers don't, don't pay the fair market rate anymore.  And so--I mean, but, again, that was--and we were a small group.  We could tell 'em that in, in '96 [1996].  But I think HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and, and the government want something that's simple.  And, you know, don't give me any bad news.  Don't complicate it.  We wanna do this and don't complicate--you know, don't complicate, complicate it with facts.  I think they're not getting the kind of units not only in the city but in the suburbs; there're not there.  Middle class, lower middle class people are not moving, so if they have a decent unit, they're not moving up because, one, they can't afford it so that lower income people could come in which was the case in '76 [1976].  You had people in '76 [1976] in the Gautreaux Program [Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program ]--even, not even '76 [1976], in '86 [1986], early '90s [1990s] had moved to Arl- townhouses in Arlington Heights [Illinois].  'Cause they were--you know, landlords were happy to get that voucher.  It was guaranteed rent, the unit sitting vacant, you know?  So, I mean, so you had people who could move in--move up into Arlington Heights, get jobs there 'cause there's--you know, there are jobs out there.  Well, now the jobs are not there and neither are the units.  So this, you know, what was a good strategy in '76 [1976] and maybe even '86 [1986], we knew in '96 [1996] was not going to fly in the long term and clearly 2006, it's not--it's not gonna fly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a--when I hear stories of people, I think at first it was Minnesota everybody was going to--
Speaker 2: And south, they were going south.
Speaker 1: And these--
Speaker 2: And even the South--
Speaker 1: And even going--
Speaker 2: --now is like, you know--
Speaker 1: Las Vegas [Nevada] would be a big--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --destination for some of them.
Speaker 2: Yep.  South, some people were moving to--in fact, some people moved to New Orleans [Louisiana].  Some people moved to New Orleans at least in our--the program that the, the leadership council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois] ran.  They moved--Texas.  But even that now as you know is not, you know--given what's happened now, think about it.  With the housing displacement of people in New Orleans and Houston, you add--
Speaker 1: Due to the hurricane--
Speaker 2: --public.  Right.
Speaker 1: --and stuff that most (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You add public housing people to that mix.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: Hurricane Katrina.
Speaker 2: --I can do the math.
Speaker 1: And Hurricane Rita, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And just think about the ones from--Ivan [Hurricane Ivan] last year.  People from Ivan still have not been placed using vouchers.  So just do the numbers.
Story_ID: 326759
Speaker 1: Now there was a--there was a piece in the biography I read, one of the biographies I mean we, we had off the Internet or I believe or they were faxed over, and where it said something about you moving to Grayslake [Illinois] and how, how does that relate to the housing--
Speaker 2: That's a real interesting story.  I, I--at the leadership council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois], it was a regional organization and did work in Lake County [Illinois] and one of the board members who actually became the chair of the board was helping to develop a new concept, a new environmental community called Prairie Crossing [Grayslake, Illinois].  And I had met George Ranney [George A. Ranney, Jr.] and his wife at the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] at something I was speaking at and he had told me about it and said, "You know, we really want this to be different.  We really want this to, to be done the right way and we'd like to have, you know, racially diverse and economically diverse development."  I'm like, "Well, you know, you're talking to the right gal if that's what you want."  And so we talked about it and he really--he wanted to know, well what, what are some of the first things I should do.  And so we pro--we, the leadership--they, the leadership council decided--said--agreed to, you know, provide some technical assistance, so we went out to do that.  And in the midst of it, I'm leaving Chicago [Illinois], it's early in November, you know, fall-ish, winter-ish, a little bit of snow on the ground but, you know, nothing major, and I get out there, and the further we go out, the more snow is mounting.  And I'm like, I haven't been this far until I was going to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  I mean, I think, who would live out here?  This can't be still part of Illinois.  You know--you know, I'm a South Side [Chicago, Illinois] girl.  So my vice president at the time who had been from--who was from Iowa, you know, all--this is the way farm country--rural countries are all like this, so don't worry about it.  So we get out there and snow is everywhere, and so they take me around in a pickup truck of all things and I'm dressed in my--you know, my downtown suit and they're showing me this one house and a barn.  And so, the--fortunately, my vice president is in charge to provide their technical assistance 'cause I was just rolling my eyes and going, oh God, nobody's gonna live here.  This is desolate.  It's all this snow and it's all this farm stuff and what is this?  And then the person, Vicky Ranney, who is one of the principals of Prairie Crossing, George's wife, started talking about her dream for this community to be everything a community should be from the environmental aspect or from the human aspect, that people and the environment can coexist, and we can do it with affordable and, and, and racially diverse housing, and--you know, and it--she wants that to be part of the ten principles of the place.  And so I'm--you know, and, and then she showed me some architecture and they named one building after the first African American architect licensed in Lake County and then--I mean, I'm like, wow, this is--you know, this is serious.  I mean, you know, nothing's been built, so this is already on the--this is not an afterthought.  This is already on the drawing board.  And I had been thinking about moving.  My, my youngest--my oldest daughter [Faith Pennick] had moved to New York.  My youngest daughter [Keidra Chaney] was, you know, gonna be graduating college soon and, you know, I thought I'd move downtown, you know, 'cause I lived far south in West Pullman [Chicago, Illinois].  And, I don't know, something hit me and said, you know, it'd be nice to be part of a experiment, if you will, you know, a pilot of something that if it can be done well, it would be really great to be a part of.  So even though I moaned and groaned all the way out, when I told my, my VP that I was thinking about moving he said, "Oh, not you, not you."  He said nobody would ever move there 'cause it's--you know, it's too desolate, it's too rural, it's too everything.  And I signed up for it.  And, you know, they, they--because it was new and it was emerging, I was--I had the lot of my choice, if you will, at a, a price I could afford.  And so, there I am.  Never knew even Grayslake existed growing up.  In fact, as far as I'd ever gone, you know, and understood was, you know, Great America [Six Flags Great America, Gurnee, Illinois].  After that, I--who knew was out there.  And, and Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois] 'cause I had had, you know, the two husbands.
Speaker 1: Is it--is it further than Great America?
Speaker 2: It's right across--it's a little further, believe it or not than Great Lakes, the, the, the naval base.  It's--and it's further west.  But it's little--it's not quite as far--it's not quite as far as Gurnee [Illinois].  So it's short of Great America but a little bit further than--
Speaker 1: Now, is this the one that has like a Metra line close?
Speaker 2: Two Metra stops, yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Prairie Crossing.
Speaker 1: I've heard about it, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's a farmland, really, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Very natural setting.
Speaker 2: Natural stuff, right, yep.  And the houses are built very sturdily.  We have really reduced energy bills because of the way the homes are built.  Not as racially diverse as I would want and clearly not as affordable as we had hoped it would start out.  But, you know, again, when you start out with those things and everybody wants to live there, of course, then the price goes up, so--but I'm, I'm very happy.  It's a--it's a long commute, but I love it.  It's, it's really a--
Speaker 1: How long does it take to get out there?
Speaker 2: It depends, about an hour and ten minutes every, every way.  And on the late train it can be almost two hours--no, about a hour and a half.  But I, I learn--I do a lot of reading, a lot of, you know, kind of reflecting, if you will, and so I've learned to make use of that time.  I used to work every second of that time and then that just made my day for like--you know, it was a twelve-hour work day, so I stopped doing that now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, having, having worked downtown and sometimes it takes that long to get to South Shore [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well that was my point.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And when I was in West Pullman, it took me--I, I still took the train and it could take that long, you know, so--but I really--I mean, the summers are just beautiful.  I live right in front of a lake and so I, I love it.  It's wonderful, for a city girl.  I'm still getting acclimated to it.  And in fact, it was my daughter who had gone to University of Wisconsin in Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], got real familiar with that kind of, you know, environment if you will.  And so when I first moved up there, I said, "Why are these ducks so noisy?  These ducks are just keeping me up.  They're just--."  "So, first of all, mom, they're not ducks, they're geese."  I went, "Oh, okay, well that explains a lot." I thought they were just long-necked ducks.  I didn't know what they were.  But now I'm a little more familiar with the--a little more familiar with the, the environment.  But, you know, for a city girl, I didn't know what it was, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 326760
Speaker 1: So when did you come to the Field Foundation [Field Foundation of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Again, it was--you know, I had taken a year off from the leadership council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois], well not from it--I retired from that.  You know, I thought I'd--I really thought I'd practice law for a while, do some writing and some consulting and some law, and I did a little bit of each of that, and I started writing my mystery novel--
Speaker 1: What is it--
Speaker 2: --my murder mystery.
Speaker 1: I wanna ask this question and I just--was the leadership council, did it seem like a--like, like a no-win situation in, in the--in terms of the where poor people were gonna go and--
Speaker 2: Well, you mean with the--with the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] transformation?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I--you know, I don't wanna--I mean, 'cause they're still trying to work on that.  I think if there was any--and I think is what people ended up saying.  If there's anybody that can make it happen, this is the group because they had the history, they had the training, they had the three suburban for housing centers so they knew the sub- suburban as well as the city piece of it.  I think it is a uphill climb.  I mean, you're, you're again working against the grain which fair housing does anyway.  Fair housing works against the grain.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So if you let the fair--if you let the, the, the private market work, it will--it will segregate by race and class.  So fair housing in and of itself works against that grain.  I think that--you know, I don't--I can't say it was a no win, but victories we knew would be, you know, small and far between.  I never forget, one of the counselors found a home for a woman with eight kids.  It wasn't in an a--what was called an opportunity area, but just finding a home for a woman--a nice home for a woman with eight kids was a win.  So were we idealistic about finding all of these people homes in what's called opportunity areas which are less than 30 percent African American, less than 10 percent poverty?  Let's be real.  I mean, you know--but I think that there was--the best ever--the best faith effort you could ever want from any group would be put into it.  But they were--they were not naive.  They're not naive.  They know of the, the barriers and the, the--you know, the restraints.
Story_ID: 326929
Speaker 1: It's a book called 'American Apartheid: Making of--the Making--Segregation and the Making of the Underclass' ['American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass,' Douglas S. Massey and Nancy A. Denton].  It was written by, at that time, university professor, Douglas Massey, about fair housing and, and segregation, and the impact of segregation on a--on a particular people, in this case African Americans.  He wrote it quite interestingly as a response to Bill--the other university professor, you know.  Bill, oh God, he's gonna kill me.  Bill--the--Wilson, Bill Wilson's book that said race doesn't matter and that it was class.  And Massey, a white man, just got--
Speaker 2: Oh, William Julius Wilson.
Speaker 1: William Julius Wilson, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, that, that--yeah.
Speaker 1: Bill--that Bill Wilson.
Speaker 2: 'The Declining Significance of Race' ['The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions,' William Julius Wilson].
Speaker 1: 'The Declining Significance,' right.  You know, that's it, 'The Declining Significance of Race.'  And Massey kind of said, nope, un-un.  And as we know, Bill Wilson did--you know, he did rescind that.  He did take it back after a while but it never got the publicity of his--of his book.  And Massey pretty much just tore him apart.  And even though he wasn't writing directly to him, what the book said, if you look at, historically, the people that have been denied access by violence because he, he went back to the 1927 riots and all the other issues that denied African Americans access to, you know, better housing and, and housing of their choice, that the segregation that is in Chicago [Illinois] cannot be accounted for solely by race.  He said there is no other group of people including at least then when he did this book I think in '93 [1993] or '94 [1994] including the Latino population, clearly not the Asian population, that is as isolated and segregated by race as African Americans in Chicago.  He said if we were just to do it by norm, just, you know, let it--there's--it still wouldn't shake out this way just because people--human beings just don't operate this way.  So there's got to be some forces at bay that are perpetuating this, this isolation and segregation.  He even talks at the good works--speaks of the good works of the leadership council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois] in the book which is why I read it when I first came on board, but he also said that's not enough, that it's just not enough for fair housing groups to do what they do, because the system, if you will, so perpetuates segregation that it, it, it would take another system to undo it.  He talks about white flight and the depredation that, that systematically follows that.  He says it's not that African Americans degrade a community, it's the systematic defunding of a community that makes it--you know, that, that, that attributes to crime and all the other things that people point to when communities become predominantly African American, so he takes everybody to task in that book including elected--black and white officials.  He blames black officials who benefit off segregation, by keeping a community all black, they can guarantee their jobs, so they think.  He clearly takes the white community to task for denying access to the black community.  So it's a--it's a very--it was a very provocative book and it became my Bible, if you will, in fair housing, but it also got attention of, at that time, Secretary Cisneros, Henry Cisneros, who also read it and because the leadership council was so prominently mentioned, got to know the leadership council better because of that.  But that book pretty much said that without fierce interruption of the system and not just by fair housing groups, although he gives us--them much credit for the good that's been done, segregation will continue and, and what you have is what we have.  You have an isolation of people by--not only by class but by race who don't know each other.  He talked about the, the notion of communication skills being thwarted and talked about which we see a deterioration of education opportunities, that middle class blacks would find that they would--their educational opportunities would deteriorate not by base of income but by base of isolation and segregation from other opportunities that whites know about that--just by, you know, being in the same place at the same time, and I'm living proof of that, you can have access to, to some of these opportunities.  And he said denial of that will systematically undercut African Americans and particularly lower income African Americans from ever coming out of, of poverty, which is why he--the book is called the making of the underclass, and that if segregation continues as it has in this country that you will make African Americans particularly a permanent underclass population.  So it took a lot of controversy, a lot of black scholars disagreed with it in the--in the beginning and in the end could not refute anything that was written in that book, so.
Story_ID: 326930
Speaker 1: Before we move onto Field Foundation [Field Foundation of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois], I wanted to ask you about the, the HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] conference [Habitat II].  You were a delegate from--to--
Speaker 2: In Istanbul [Turkey]--
Speaker 1: Istanbul--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in '96 [1996]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know Doris Jones that went over there.
Speaker 2: Yes, Doris went, yes.  In fact, we were part of that same group.  That was a very interesting--I, I had been--again, under Henry Cisneros I had been picked to, to, to become part of the U.S.--official U.S. delegation which I was very, you know, humbled by.  It was a very interesting trip.  We got briefed by the state department [U.S. Department of State] as to what not to do as women, you know, and not to cross your legs or, you know, smile or whatever.  But they hadn't really, I don't think, briefed us, and at least me as part of the delegation, to what to expect in terms of the demands of the U.S., particularly those when--that wore the U.S. official delegation button.  I was lobbied by some African countries to try to get the United States to vote in favor of housing as a human right, I was lobbied by some EU represent--European Union representatives to try to get the United States to, to buy into that.  The United States was one of the only major forces at that convention, at that conference that did not subscribe to housing as a human right.  And when I tried to work with the state department to better understand it, clearly the message I got was, can't do it, don't even ask, and, you know, that kind of thing.  So that was--I really was kind of disappointed in that piece of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause this is during the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration.
Speaker 2: This was--Henry Cisneros was the secretary of HUD.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And--
Speaker 2: So--yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: --he was known as a liberal from San--
Speaker 2: Very, very--
Speaker 1: --San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 2: And, and understood housing, understood housing.  He's really--very much understand housing as a--as a, a, a--
Speaker 1: He's a Mexican American.
Speaker 2: Right, next step and, and a way to, to, to acquire wealth in this country, but I--and to this day, I don't understand exactly why and how that was an issue, but it was very clear that the state department and HUD was, was taking a very rigid stance on that, that they would not--even though it was meaningless in some ways because if you declare it a human right, it really means nothing.  I mean--and, it was interesting, one of the comments I got from an un--a, a non-official state department person said, "Well, the fear is if we say that the--then homeless people will sue for housing."  I said, well that's insane.  They can--I mean, our constitution doesn't guarantee it because we're saying it--here in the declaration, it's just that.  It's a separate declaration.  You know, I mean, if that's the case, you know, people would sue us for everything we've ever declared, that we like the environment which we're not protecting, but so--I--it was just real clear that they, they--all they knew was that they weren't going to, to accept that and, and sign onto it, and the response I got about why was never really articulated, so I was disappointed in that.
Story_ID: 326931
Speaker 1: The other thing that I didn't talk about and I just briefly do wanna talk about the Leadership Council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois] and the Community Trust [Chicago Community Trust, Chicago, Illinois], I was also part of a group that went to South Africa shortly after the release of Nelson Mandela, in fact after his election of--and, again, not being prepared for what I was going to see, being very naive about apartheid like I guess I have been around a lot of issues.  I just assumed apartheid's over, you know, new day, things are going to be great, not recognizing that, again, getting back to Massey's [Douglas Massey] piece about a system.  The remnants of the system were still there even though apartheid was over, and so dismantling a system is much more than who you elect as president.  It's, it's a--it's a, a, a full force campaign, if you will, to try to, to, to put a balance in place and, unfortunately, I just don't think that's, that's happened in, in South Africa.  So it's--when I read--what I read now about AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and others, I could see that just from our visit there of about fourteen days, of how much and how many resources it would take to get in and undo what had been done for decades, and those resources just were not there.  The government was pretty much broke and so, you know, I, I look at that.  And, and we had gone down--I had been invited as a part of the leadership council to talk about housing segregation and how, you know, and housing of, of millions of people based on race had been so isolated and so away from the mainstream.  You had people on one part of South Africa that had four car garages and you--in, in eye shot, you had a, a Bantustan that people were living in huts.  So, you know, that kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what--
Speaker 1: That start kind of--
Speaker 2: What's short of redistribution of the wealth is--
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.
Speaker 2: --can make--
Speaker 1: What--or, or a massive infusion on--and they were--I mean, to show you how--we went to Soweto [Johannesburg, South Africa] and they were having a celebration which, you know, some of us couldn't understand, but they were celebrating Porta-Potties, having Porta-Potties put into Soweto.  I mean, these were things I avoid like the plague or at the park or when I'm playing golf, and here they are putting--people having a celebration for, you know, Porta-Potties.  It's an upgrade in their lives.  So, you just have no clue of, of, you know, how things are, how bad things are in other places until you make those kinds of trips.  So when I went to the Istanbul [Turkey] to connect, the whole idea of housing as a human right seemed absolutely right to me based on, you know, South Africa and some others, and--but that--our country would not subscribe to that.
Speaker 2: This is during a liberal democratic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) During--
Speaker 2: --administration.
Speaker 1: --the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.
Story_ID: 326932
Speaker 1: Now Field Foundation [Field Foundation of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois].  We're, we're at--we're, we're--
Speaker 2: How did that happen?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, again, as I said, I've known Handy [HistoryMaker Handy Lindsey, Jr.] all of the--in fact, he was also part of the group that went to South Africa, so we've known each other off and on--
Speaker 1: Handy Lindsey, right?
Speaker 2: Handy Lindsey, Jr., the former head of the--
Speaker 1: I had to do that to make sure that the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, Handy--
Speaker 1: --transcriber knows who were talking about.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Handy Lindsey, Jr., the former president of the, the, the Field Foundation.  We've known each other for a lot, our kids know each other, and it's been, you know--
Speaker 1: And he's black--
Speaker 2: He's African American man, the first African American man to run the, the Field Foundation here in Illinois.  We knew each other from the Trust [Chicago Community Trust, Chicago, Illinois].  He was my mentor at the trust.  And when he was deciding to leave and take another job at the, the Cameron Foundation [Petersburg, Virginia] in Virginia, you know, I expressed some interest in this job, his job, old job.  And he's like, "Well, I can't see you wanting to do that.  I mean, why?  I mean, you know, you've kind of semi-retired and why would you wanna come back and do that."  Well, one, I wanted to come back and, you know, walk in his shoes which I thought, you know, he made such a stellar contribution to the philan- philanthropic community in Chicago [Illinois] and, two, I really did wanna get back in philanthropy.  I'd been, you know, at the Trust and MacArthur [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], and, and coming in even with the small foundation and, and being its head was interesting to me.  And I thought if I was ever gonna come out of my semi-retirement state, this would be the job that would--that would get me out.  And I applied and here I am.  It was--it was interesting because some of the board members I knew, some I didn't know.  I didn't know Marshall Field [Marshall Field V].  But it was--you know, I was very--it was a very--he is a very pleasant man and in meeting him I just knew immediately he'd be someone I'd love to work with and for.  And I--you know, I, I, I was very candid with him as I--you know, as you can see transparency is one of my advantages and disadvantages I think, that, you know, my life as a--you know, a little South Side girl from Chicago has been great.  I mean, I--you know, I, I mean it's been cake, I love it.  You know, but if I got the Field Foundation job, it would be icing on the cake.  But if I didn't get the job, it would still be cake 'cause I--you know, coming from where I came, I, I can't--I can't complain.  Again, you know, I think I did good about playing the cards I was dealt, so I'm, I'm, I'm happy with, with who I am and where I am.  And fortunately, you know, I guess the board appreciated that--my candor and here I am.
Story_ID: 326933
Speaker 1: What are the priorities of the Field Foundation [Field Foundation of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] and, and, and what, what--in what ways have you influenced it, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, you need to see--
Speaker 1: --or, or made your mark?
Speaker 2: Right, it--it's a broad--we have a broad guidelines which I love and that pretty much came from Handy's [HistoryMaker Handy Lindsey, Jr.] influence.  And we do education, public education programs.  We're one of the few foundations that can fund public schools directly.  We are--we fund culture.  We fund health issues, not, not single issue of health issues.  The only single issue we would fund is AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and that's because of the, the, the pandemic in the community.  We do community--what we call community welfare and urban affairs, which is the breath of, of things.  We do housing and fair housing.  So, we--and legal--we're one of the few that still continue to serve--fund legal services, so we do a wide array of things for such a short budget.  We--our funding is about two million [dollars] a year, so that's very small grants.  But we try to--we try to be strategic so that our small grants make a difference.  We also wanna fund projects, small projects or projects that are directly connected to helping the disadvantaged, particularly communities of color or communities that have not been included in, in the past.  And so that's how we kind of look at things.  In terms of making my mark, you know, don't know.  I mean, I'm still trying to, to grapple with that.  I know one of the issues that I'm concerned about and we're looking into is what kind of programs and funding is there for just--how do I say it?  Just the average guy.  Not, you know, youth that are wards of the state or youth that are, you know, troubled, but just the average adolescent teenage guy, boy, and this comes from a woman who's been on the board at the YWCAs [Young Women's Christian Association] and still involved in women's organizations.  I have two daughters [Faith Pennick and Keidra Chaney] and very much a feminist, but I am concerned that everyday guys, boys, don't have the kinds of attention, if you will, or the kind of programs that they can get into.  I know when I lived on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], a lot of the programs were geared toward at-youth risk, risk, children who've been, you know, labeled one way or the other by the school system or they're already in a gang.  But what happens to the guys who don't have those labels, who are kind of like--kind of on their own trying to be, you know, free of some of these labels and some of these, these--the, the baggage that accompanies it?  And so we're looking internally and externally to just see what, what there is out there and if there's something we could either make our mark on or be the catalyst for exploring more deeply.  'Cause I just think we're--I mean, there's a lot of programs for women, good, I mean, needed--more are still needed for women.  But I think that, at least in my life as a--as a woman and as a girl, you know, the, the kind of resources to the men in my life have not been there that would've made my life a lot better had they had resources that they could, could pull upon.  And largely because I think, you know, men are different.  They don't, you know, don't wanna necessarily be counseled in the same way women do; well, that's fine.  But is there anything that, that can give guys a kind of ability to help themselves spiritually and, and, and psychologically and personally without already having been labeled or going through a system?  So that's what we're looking into and we don't--we're not quite sure where that's gonna go.  But other things--I mean, we're very much--I'm very pleased with the--with the way the foundation's going.  And as I said, if I can even keep it going in, in Han- in the direction Handy established all these years, I think I would've done a lot.  But I think things are changing.  I mean, you know, since, you know, not only 9/11 [September 11, 2001], but now Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and what the impact on all of us in the non-profits that that's gonna have.  So, you know, I--we're looking at, I'm looking at, well, what's the best role for a very small foundation with a very broad mission?  And that's gotta be--it can't be stagnant.  It's gotta be looked at again in light of some of the changes in our--in our own environment, so we're looking at that as well.  So I can't say there've been any really major marks that I would say were, were [HistoryMaker] Aurie Pennick's, but that's why I wanted the job because I think they were doing already some of the things that, that I wanted to be a part of.

Speaker 1: Is there any one particular project that you funded that you really--well, is, is there a good story about a, you know, that you could tell us about?
Speaker 2: Well, there's one that we're--I mean, there are a lot that we're particularly excited about 'cause we do fund emerging organizations and we got a--quite a few in that bag [at the Field Foundation of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois].  But there's one in particular that I'm, I'm--we're kind of proud of and that's in the west Humboldt Park [Chicago, Illinois] area.  We funded, at least in the Midwest and we think maybe in the country, the first urban public land trust, getting to the issue of affordable housing of an organization that will be able to, if this succeeds, protect affordable housing in perpetuity so that as a community gentrifies, if this land trust works, housing built on that land will always be affordable, and so that's kind of exciting for us and particularly--
Speaker 1: Now that's--I've heard, you know, something like that discussed in Humboldt Park and who was it--there's a couple other the organizations (unclear) Medina [ph.] was--
Speaker 2: I'm not familiar with them.
Speaker 1: --discussing that at one time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with and--they--there was a--I think there was a--some parcels in--
Speaker 2: There could be.  There may be--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --come altogether.  We're working with--
Speaker 1: Humboldt Park when they were--they were talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, the west Humboldt Park--
Speaker 1: --making--
Speaker 2: --a community development (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --corporation and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so, yeah, and so it probably is a part of the same grouping because it's been thought about for a while and now they're trying to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were really--
Speaker 2: --to put it--
Speaker 1: --trying to make sure that their, their community remains intact--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because it's--they were--
Speaker 2: Right.  Another one that we most recently funded is in the LeClaire Courts [Chicago, Illinois] public housing, LeClaire Court's public housing to help some of the residents there kind of form their own CDC [community development corporation].  I'm familiar with the LeClaire Courts through my work at the leadership council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois] and it's really a very interesting community.  It was the first resident--it had the first resident management corporation in the country, one of the first, and so now under the transformation, it's trying to find its way and we funded some of the residents there to try to shape its own community development corporation.  That's one and there are just a variety of ones.  They're all small grants but, again, strategic in this way.  We fund a lot of healthy--community healthy schools programs to, to work with obesity, childhood obesity in the schools and food programs like that, so yeah.

Speaker 1: Is there anything else about the foundation [Field Foundation of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] you wanna say to--
Speaker 2: It's a very--well, I think, you know, for me, again, this is--you know, all foundations are different and having worked at the Trust [Chicago Community Trust, Chicago, Illinois] and MacArthur [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], I love the idea of a small foundation with a very informal but sensitive board.  I mean, this is a board that knows a lot about everything from Marshall Field [Marshall Field V] to George Ranney [George A. Ranney, Jr.] to (unclear).  I mean, we know--I mean, we know--I mean we know--I mean there's--Logan [Lyle Logan].  There's a lot of knowledge on this board.  And it helps when that happens when you make proposals 'cause you're--you don't have to tell them where Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] is or tell them--you know, which I found with the national foundation, you gotta do a lot of the catching up for them so they can be with you.  But this board, you really don't have to do a lot of that, and that's, that's really rewarding, that they really come with a lot of knowledge about the city and the region and the issues, so--
Speaker 1: How--do, do you think you'll stay with this a long time or?
Speaker 2: I hope to.  I mean, this is someplace I hope to really retire from, the, the, the real retire word as opposed to--'cause it--I mean, it's, it's a great work.  I mean, it--I've been able to do some travel as well with this job which I appreciate.  I--you know, I'm on some boards and it, it supports that work.  I'm on the board of the council and the Parliament for the World Religions [sic. Parliament of the World's Religions] and so it kind of, you know, supports what I do with that as well.  So, I mean, it's, it's a wonderful place to work and I hope to stay here 'til I retire for real.

Speaker 1: One of the questions we always ask and as we, I guess, wind down, as--we always ask it.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.  You asked it as the last question.  You know, I--I'm--you know, I'm, I'm very troubled by the, the, the, the schism I think within the African American based on class.  I mean, I think that we in the middle class, myself included, have without con- unintentionally or with--even without knowledge have lost touch with what it means to be really poor or, or in the under--underclass kind of piece.  I think New Orleans [Louisiana] just brought it all out, I mean as someone said invisible people blown in on the winds of a hurricane [Hurricane Katrina].  We have that in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean, I've known about it through the leadership council [Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, Chicago, Illinois].  But when I try to talk to people about it or at least when I try to and I still try, there's not a sense of it, well it really can't be that bad, but when we saw what we saw in New Orleans, we knew how bad it was and I--we have absolutely that same mirror here in, in Chicago and elsewhere across the country.  I think, you know, it's one thing to talk about what, what, you know, lower middle income and lower income people should do to be able to work their way up the bootstraps kind of thing, which I'm not totally necessarily against.  It's another to talk about what the responsibility is of the middle class to facilitate that, to make that happen, to make that doable, if you will.  And I--you know, I--and I don't wanna beat up on this 'cause, you know, this is my mother's [Aurie Watts Baines] thing about that frivolous dollar, but I think when I see the, the Lexuses and the Jaguars and all of that stuff and I say, is there somebody we could be feeding or is there somebody we could be help educating?  Is there a scholarship fund I can be--you know, I think that's the kind of thing that, that my concern is, that I think we have more wealth in the--in the African American community.  That's the good news.  I mean, there's more middle--there are more people who are middle class than ever expected to be; I'm one of them, that's the good news.  But I also think there's more need in ways that we're not familiar with or one that we really want to believe.  I think it's, it's easy to think that because I've made it, other people can or will rather than looking at what's becoming really more and more a nation of have and have nots and, unfortunately, there are more of us on the have not end than, than I think ought to be and I think that--my concern is that we just aren't quite getting that, that nexus that made the Civil Rights Movement join the, the, the middle class educated Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] with Fannie Lou Hamer isn't there anymore and I think that's the--and not to say, they had some issues, too, but at least they, they were all, you know, after the same thing.  I think that kind of nexus doesn't exist among us and that, that, that disturbs me 'cause I think that kind of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --nexus ought to always be there.
Story_ID: 326937
Speaker 1: Is there any major thing that you would do differently if you had it to do again?
Speaker 2: God, one major thing?  Well, I, I would say it was getting married, but then I wouldn't have my daughters [Faith Pennick and Keidra Chaney], so that wouldn't work.  So, you know, I don't--I don't think so.  I think, you know, it's been one of those that if I done one of those things, I probably wouldn't be where I am and I'm, I'm pretty comfortable where I am.  I think--and not giving myself any credit.  I kind of--as my story says, I kind of fell into, but it's, it's the--again, it's the, the, the ability to be at a place of opportunity and take advantage of it.  So if I change any of those little things, I think I would change my ability to be at those places, so I don't think so.  I think I, I play the hand I was dealt, again.
Story_ID: 326938
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy is my two daughters [Faith Pennick and Keidra Chaney], one who is doing a film, a documentary ['Silent Choices'] on the reproductive rights of African American women, another who is a writer who just made a presentation at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] on media policy as it relates to, again, African American music and entertainment.  So I think my legacy is having two strong black women out there who are gonna keep on keeping on and keep on trying to keep issues of, of race and class and as--and gender in the forefront, and I think that's, that's all anybody can hope for.
Story_ID: 326939
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't touched upon that we think--you think is--we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well the last question is similar to legacy.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, I think I'd like to be remembered as a person who--a serious person with a decent sense of humor.  I've been accused of being sometimes too serious, especially with people in all my personal relationships.  On the other hand, I can laugh and make jokes about some--anything.  I think I'd like to be remembered as someone who saw the serious nature of life but also saw the humorous, humorous side and tried to work somewhere in the context of that.  I would love to say somebody who makes a difference but, you know, I think all of us do in our own way, so that--that's something I would give every human being who really kind of, you know, took a breath and, you know, even the opened the door for somebody is making a difference.  It's not enough in my life.  I think I would like to be remembered as somebody who tried to live life with a sense--with a serious side and yet a sense of humor about, about, about life.
