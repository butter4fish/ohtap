Speaker 1: And now if you would, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan, the next couple of questions are some People magazine-ish type questions, just to help us get familiar with the process.  And if you would just give us short answers to these questions that would be great.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Would you please share with us your favorite food?

Story_ID: 192154
Speaker 1: And now if you will, let's talk a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where your mother was born and where she grew up, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Willie Mae Glaspie, that's maiden name.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for us please?
Speaker 2: G-L-A-S-P-I-E.  She was born in Texas, in East Texas.  It's a little place out in the country, I think; I don't even know if it had a name, it was something like Whitehouse, Texas.  I'm sure that they probably gave it that.  But that's where she was born, that's where she grew up.  And then we lived in Longview, Texas, so she left the country and moved ten miles to (laughter) the town called Longview, Texas, and that's where I was born and that's where I grew up until a certain age.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up as a young girl in East Texas?
Speaker 2: Well, oh yes, and matter of fact, I even saw it.  Well, I mean if, not when she was a young girl, but I saw the life because it was still there.  I was born in 1937 and so my grandfather was still alive and my relatives who lived in the country.  And so we would spend a lot of time out there so I saw the environment in which she grew up in and the people that she knew, yes.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother did not go to school; I would say she probably had about a fifth grade formal education.  She had a Ph.D. in wisdom.  A very kind lady, never heard her swear; never saw her smoke or drink and I never knew my father.  And so I was a part of the matriarchal family growing up almost all of my life.  And a very fine provider, knew the value of an education, didn't understand it all, but knew that she wanted something better for her kids.  And so it was my mother and my sister [Joann Jordan], my brother [Paul Jordan] and I, the four of us.
Story_ID: 192155
Speaker 1: Now you said you never knew your father--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head)
Speaker 1: --why is that?
Speaker 2: Well because when I grew up he wasn't there and I, when I got old enough to ask, for some strange reason I didn't wanna chase him down.  I didn't go looking.  I was just satisfied because I didn't miss him, because I grew up at a time when the village worked and it--the village no longer works for us, and so I had many fathers.  And I can recall when I was about twenty-five or thirty I became inquisitive, and I asked and she [Jordan's mother, Willie Mae Glaspie] gave me a phone number of someone in Texas, I didn't have the courage to call.  I don't know what I would have said, so I didn't call.  And, in retrospect, I regret I didn't.  So I never knew him, but like I said, I never missed him, it--the village just worked so beautifully for me.
Speaker 1: Could you just share his name with us?
Speaker 2: His name?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Isaac, his name was Isaac Jordan.
Story_ID: 192156
Speaker 1: You said you had many father figures growing up, can you tell us a little bit about some of those people?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I grew up in Texas until I was eleven years old.  And Reverend Cory [ph.], at the church that I joined at a very young age, I'll always remember him.  Mr. Pickett [ph.], who had a wagon and some mules and he used to go around the garbage cans downtown picking up bananas and things and I would ride in the wagon with him.  I remember him well, but my aunt, who was the matriarch of the family, her name was Avis, she was married and so her husband, my uncle was like a father.  He--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was John Henry, and he was just like a father and--but she was, she was the boss though and so that's--that was during the early years when we lived in Tex--Kilgore, Tex--Longview, Texas.  Then we relocated to Kilgore, Texas and my aunt, of course, went to California because the, the opportunities weren't in Texas.  But my mom [Willie Mae Glaspie] and my sister [Joann Jordan] and I and my brother [Paul Jordan] stayed in Kilgore.  And my brother got in the service at the age of fifteen, he had to lie to get in of course, but he went into service at the age of fifteen.  And it was just my sister, my mom and I, and we lived in this little community that we knew everyone and everyone knew us so it--just there was nothing lacking in my life.
Story_ID: 192157
Speaker 1: What kind of work did your mother [Willie Mae Glaspie] do?
Speaker 2: Domestic, she, I think she made ten dollars a week.  I think she was working four days a week and I would go pick up her money, a check, and I'd have to go to the back door to get her check.  I remember that extremely well, and that's--I can remember the house and--which I went around the right side to knock on the back door to get her check for the week.  And it was three of us living on that and what my brother [Paul Jordan] sent home.
Speaker 1: And did your mother ever share any stories with you about the family that she worked for, did she ever share any stories?
Speaker 2: No, no, not then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, did you ever go to work with her?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I only went to pick up the checks sometimes.
Speaker 1: Mr. Jordan, how far back can you trace your ancestry?  Do you know if you came from free people or slaves?  How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: I came from free people.  My grandfather, I can go that far back, John Henry Glaspie and he was free, now his parents I can't go back any further than that.
Speaker 1: Did your grandfather ever share any stories with you about growing up, what life was like for him growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, the usual kind, "When I was young," but I don't recall them very well, I know I heard that a lot.  "When I was young we used to do it this way."  And I can recall during one Christmas he brought a possum (laughter) that he had killed and talked about how they used to cook 'em and all of that, that's one meal I passed on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --even at that young age.  But, never really about some of the challenges of their lives and who they worked for.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandmother, did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: No, my moth--grandmother was dead when I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm--
Story_ID: 192158
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Let's see, about the age of four, (unclear) about the age of four.  I can remember very well the lady who stayed in front of us had a daughter, her name was Doris.  I know she was older than me because I would hang around her all the time and she would just take care of me.  I mean it was like my friend and she was older and we lived in a house, just my mom [Willie Mae Glaspie] and my brother [Paul Jordan] and my sister [Joann Jordan] and I, right across the street from them, 'cause the following year I went to school for the first time.  I remember so well and my sister and her friend tried to abandon me, you know, they didn't want me, you know, at school her first day following her around and so I can remember them trying to avoid me; I can see it so clearly.  The playground and everything, and that I remember very well.  I remember the house we lived in it was up on some bricks and you could crawl under the house and next door to us was a Latino family and they had daughters and the bathroom was about fifty yards out back, the toilet.  I can remember that well and I remember all of that, going down to get clay dirt for my mother who ate clay dirt.
Speaker 1: Who what?
Speaker 2: She ate clay dirt (laughter) you don't even know what that is, oh gosh, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, clay, clay, it's clay, it's clay.
Speaker 1: Clay dirt?
Speaker 2: It's clay dirt, right.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And back then a lot of ladies, when they were pregnant they ate it.  They craved it.  And so you had to know how to find it and where to get it and I used to go out and pick that.  And it's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And you just ate it, just like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you prepare it?
Speaker 2: No, you don't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --prepare it, just take it back home and she would eat it and a lot of women would eat it.  And it was just something that--it was just so natural and you know, and as I--now as I travel around the country speaking on the great outdoors and what the land mean to people of color, I have to remind them that the land meant a lot to our people.  I mean that, that's what--that was our drug store.  I mean we could go out there and get medicine for almost anything.  You had to know.   So we really knew the outdoors it's not that it was just a place for fun, we knew it because you had to know what to pick and not poison.  Oh we used to get medicine out there, it was our food supply it was water supply.  I mean the great outdoors meant so much to us and I used to just spend a lot of time--we, we didn't call it the wilderness, we called it the woods.  Go back out into the woods.  And so I can remember that very clearly, the fishing holes and, I'm going crawfishing by myself and I can remember all of that.
Speaker 1: Now, going back to the clay dirt, how did you get it, did you just kinda scoop it up with a shovel and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, you just go in with your hands, you can get out, part of it was gray and part of it was red, you're going for the gray portion of it.  Oh, when, when some of the seniors hear this--I mean if they see this (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, no, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they'll remember.  Yes--
Story_ID: 192159
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about what holidays were like in your house?  Were they very special occasions and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Christmas, that's the only one that we really celebrated.  Easter we celebrated by going to church of course.  And we knew that was a special time because we could wear our Sunday shoes.  And--but Christmas my grandfather [John Henry Glaspie] would come in from the country and we would all have Christmas together.  That was the best, and it was just my mom [Willie Mae Glaspie] and my brother and my sister and I and then poppa would come in from the country.  But the beautiful part of that, during the Christmas holiday is the day before, and that is how the people would all share.  In other words, you, you remember mostly going from house to house that night because sometimes they would cut the sweet potato pie, they'd have one that they would cut on Christmas Eve, or a cake, and you could go, just in that whole neighborhood, just go from house to house and people had something sweet to eat.  And they really just lived together and shared.  It was a caring and sharing place and that's what you remember most, more than the dinner is the fact that Christmas Eve you could go next door and get a piece of potato pie.
Speaker 1: And what about Juneteenth, did you--did your family--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --celebrate Juneteenth?  Can you tell us a little bit, at first, what Juneteenth is and how you remember celebrating it?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't mean that much, matter of fact; I didn't know what it meant back then.  But living in Texas that was a special holiday because you know Texas was the last state to get the word.
Speaker 1: The word about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Freedom.
Speaker 1: --slaves being free.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so we would all, we didn't have a park, but we would all meet in the community, and barbecue, and cook and share.  There was a lot of caring and sharing in that community, in that village.  And that is something that I never forget and I guess I never--I guess that's why I never missed a father or I never missed love and caring because it was always there.  Everybody was a mother, in other words, if you did wrong, you know, not only would I get a spanking at home I got one on the way home from someone.  And then, you know, it wasn't, you know, like child abuse, everybody had the responsibility to raise the children in that village.  And so, Juneteenth, and the music and the strawberry pop, that's how we associated with strawberry pop on Juneteenth, yeah, that was a good time.  That was a very, very rich time that I didn't realize the full value of it until I grew up and--really--well since I've been an adult and I look back on that and I realize how important those times were.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan can you give us the names of your siblings and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: My brother was the oldest; he is seventy-three and then my--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: Paul, Paul Jordan.  And my sister just passed, she was sixty-seven, no, no, Joann [ph.] was not sixty-seven, she was seventy, 'cause she just passed couple of weeks ago.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And, those were my two.
Speaker 1: Okay, and her name?
Speaker 2: Joann, Joann.
Speaker 1: And then you, the youngest?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And then me, born in 1937--
Story_ID: 192160
Speaker 1: You talked a little bit about your community.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Can you kinda describe it a little bit more for us and, you know, just kinda take us back there and just tell us what your community was like.
Speaker 2: Well, the one in, see I was in Longview, Texas until I was about seven.  And that one was, I went back there last year and it's--just isn't there anymore, it was Kilgore, Texas, was quite an oil town.  It had oil wells all over the place.  So in your front yard there could be an oil well.  And there was an oil well about forty yards from our front yard, just oil everywhere.  That was the thing--that was the big thing.  It's an oil city.  And there was a road, it wasn't paved, that separated, we call it--they were roads, but it was all black and there were some Mexican Americans who lived there.  And it was a very pedestrian friendly community of course, 'cause there weren't that many cars.  Lots of people had wagons and mules and grocery stores.  Lots of little grocery stores about the size of this room here and we weren't too far away from water, a river or either a lake.  So there was a lot of fishing and a lot of hunting.  And I used to hunt and fish a lot.  Went out into the wilderness a lot, alone, without fear, places I wouldn't go now as an adult (laughter) but I went then because it, it was, it was a nurturing environment.  Even the wilderness was a nurturing environment.  Never--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And who taught you how to hunt and fish?
Speaker 2: Some of the elders, my uncle [John Henry Glaspie] would take me fishing every week, he would get off and he'd go fishing and other elders would take us along.  They were a lot more patient than the elders nowadays with young kids and they--I guess they were glad to have the company and so they taught us how to fish and what berries to pick and which ones not to eat and what birds to kill, which one not to kill.  They really knew the great outdoors, that's, that's just so amazing how we got away from that.  They really knew the great outdoors.
Speaker 1: And did you start developing an appreciation for nature and wilderness, the woods the outdoors at an early age?  Did you really appreciate all its value and all--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh no--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that it had to offer?
Speaker 2: --of course not, Oh no, (laughter) not at all.  No, it was just a part of a good life, you know and it was something I grew to expect.  Until we--I got older around eleven, yeah around eleven or twelve.  It was, you know, everybody was going west, I was in, '48 [1948], '49 [1949], '50 [1950], the word was go west, and so my aunt [Avis Glaspie] who was the matriarch, left first, as always, so she went to California got established, got a job and then she would come back--she came back and she got my mother and took my mother up there and left us home with relatives while she go get established.  So they went to California, Palm Springs, California and got established in mobile homes.  And there were no houses, no homes just stayed in a trailer, mobile homes and then of course my mother came back and got us, my sister [Joann Jordan] and I.  And by that time, my brother [Paul Jordan] had lied at the age of fifteen and got in the [U.S.] Army, so he was gone.  So my mother took my sister and I back to California, Palm Springs in 1950, July of 1950.  We went--moved to Palm Springs to a reservation, an Indian reservation.  It was the only place that blacks and Latinos and Native Americans could live was on the reservation.
Story_ID: 192161
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, pine, and the sounds I don't hear too often anymore because the wildlife isn't in the cities now so I don't hear the sounds of the wildlife the owls and certain birds and certain insects during certain time of year.  I don't hear the--you know, I don't hear those sounds anymore but, and the smell is not there anymore.  The--now it's petroleum but, then the smell was pine and, of course, we used to have an insect called the lightning bug and we used to chase it all over the meadows because you know, I don't know if you've ever seen a lightning bug?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, all--I mean, nothing is the same as it was then.  That was, that was almost like a little heaven, I think someone would call that a little heaven then but, you don't have that anymore.
Story_ID: 192162
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your elementary school.  Do you remember the name of the elementary school that you attended?
Speaker 2: It was Longview High School [Longview, Texas] (laughter).  Everything was in one school, yeah, I only went there one year that was the first year when my sister [Joann Jordan] tried to get away from--they wouldn't--only one year, then we moved to Kilgore [Texas].  And I could remember Kilgore very well.  From the second grade on, second, third, that's when I really learned how to read good and the fourth--I can see the classrooms.  The--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What, what--was it several rooms or, were there several classes in one room, can you kinda just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No it, no, no it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --describe it for us?
Speaker 2: --it was, it was, no it was a, like a large middle school [later C.B. Dansby Junior-Senior High School, Kilgore, Texas] now, I mean, it was a large school.  Red brick, and elementary schools down here and then it was separated by just a little hallway and then you go into the high school and everybody was at the same school.  Everybody had lunch at the same time, and so it was just--we were all--I have no idea the number, the enrollment at those schools.  But lunch was served and you did everything at school.  You walked to school, there was no buses of course, and so we had to walk through the woods to get to school down through the woods to get to school then we walked home.  But, it was a good experience.  I remember the teachers well.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you remember some of your teachers?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes, I can--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Who do you remember?
Speaker 2: --Ms. White, she was mean.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Mrs. Bennett [ph.] was kind; she was my fifth grade teacher.  Very kind lady, Miss White was strict and--now I can--we call it mean back then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but she was just strict.  Mr. [C.B.] Dansby was our our mini--our--minister (laughter) our principal--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and the school was eventually named after him.  And when I got in the seventh grade is when we left to go to California, I left in seventh grade, and then when I went back last year, there's a part of the building still standing but it's no longer a school.  It was the only black school in, in Kilgore.  And everybody--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What county is Kilgore in?
Speaker 2: I want to say Rusk County [Texas], but I'm not absolutely sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us--during the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations at this time in your life?
Speaker 2: (Shaking head no) Uh-uh, no, no dreams no aspirations I had it all then.  I didn't need to dream, I had it--I had everything.
Speaker 1: And, what type of child were you?  How--what type of child were you during the elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a good kid (laughter).  I was, I was a good kid, still a good kid, I've always been a good kid, I have--no one has ever said I was a bad kid.  I don't know it's--(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: So very obedient--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, always--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --mannerable [ph.]?
Speaker 2: --all, always.  I was not a cling on, in other words, I, I could do things by myself and--but I never got into, never got into any trouble.  Never messed with cigarettes or alcohol or fights or anything, I don't ever remember having a fight.  And, but I had some, someone very close to me always--and the lady stayed across the street, her daughter.  But, that's all I can remember, but I had no needs for anything, I didn't, no, I didn't dream of anything.  I had it.  I just think, I think in retrospect I would wished that I could've kept that forever, all my life.
Speaker 1: Were you always the tallest person, the tallest boy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in class?
Speaker 2: As I--since the time I can remember, the fourth grade, I was the tallest and--yes.  And I can recall going to walk into town, we didn't go to town too often, and I can remember my first encounter with discrimination.  I didn't know what it was, but I can remember it so clearly and I can see the pop machine, it was at a service station.  I can remember the bottle.  I can remember that so clearly and on--and why that stays in my mind, I don't know, I'm thinking about it now, I'm working on a book now and I'm going back and going through some things that really will never leave me and why are they still with me.  And I, I can recall that very, very well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I wanted--back then they had soda pop machines sitting outside service stations and they were--pop came in a bottle--and then they had cases down there and when you finished drinking your pop you put the bottle in the case.  And I wanted to get a drink of water so I went--started to go to the fountain and I remember the gentleman came out and said, "Don't drink out of that fountain."  And he said, "You want some water get it in one of those bottles," that had been used by someone else.  And I do not know why, I just walked away.  I don't even know if I thought about it.  I knew it was nasty so maybe that's why, I just--I didn't, I just walked away.  But I have never forgotten that, never forgotten that.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: About nine.  But that's, that has stayed with me all this time.  Not, and not bitterly, oh no, that's another thing I'm--there's so much now that I start working on the book and I'm going back and I'm--remembered certain things and yet I can't explain right now.  I can't--I have the feeling but I don't have the words, and the biggest question of all is why I never got angry.  And I still have not been able to answer that yet.  Being a pioneer that I grew up to be I've never literally gotten angry and in--when I--we moved to California, it was a reservation, we were segregated there.  But, in retrospect, I wouldn't have traded that for the world.  I thought I was happy in Texas when I said I had it all, oh gosh, to live on an Indian reservation with Native Americans, Latinos, and--I mean, it was so culturally rich, oh gosh, and hunting with bow and arrows and, oh, that was it--

Speaker 1: Conservation Fund partners, but the lady in the middle is Beth Dowld, she works for the Conservation Fund in our Florida office.
Speaker 2: Okay and can you spell her last name?

Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Okay, all righty.

Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --yeah, Darcel's quite a character, she runs a bar.
Speaker 2: This was--I was a commissioner in the late '70s [1970s] and it was at a fundraiser for some youth.  It was a casino night.
Speaker 1: This was in the late '70s [1970s] I was fishing down on the MacKenzie River with one of my supporters.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think this is from that same--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's from the same picture in the last '70s [1970s], we were fishing for salmon.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Oh, I'm sorry I knew that was gonna happen--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in the late '70s [1970s], I went out to a classroom for some elementary school kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was [Claudia] "Lady Bird" Johnson.
Story_ID: 192164
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan we had--we were just talking about when your family moved to [Palm Springs] California in 1950, so tell us a little bit about what life was like on the Indian reservation?
Speaker 2: Well, there was no grass, of course, and most of us had centralized facilities, in the middle of the reservation at certain places there were showers and bathrooms and washing areas that we would go to and I mean just all sand.  Cars rolled on sand, I mean there was no roads there were pathways that cars had created over the years but there was no pavement at all.  And we all lived on the reservation surrounded by desert, just as far as the eye could see mountains and desert.  And it was--we used to make bow and arrows and we would go hunting in the desert with bow and arrow--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So did the Native American children there teach you how to make the bows and arrows and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and we would all go out in the desert, 110, 115 degrees and we would go hunt and walking in the desert, hunting, and they would have Indian burials that lasted three to five days.  I mean the same way, I mean, three to five days.  The chief, Chief Ward, he lived a couple of doors from us and it was a--but we could go to movies, and movies were integrated, the schools were integrated.  But Louis Armstrong came to town, he had to stay on the reservation, and yet he performed downtown.  It was sorta strange; it was half and half there.  But it was rich, wouldn't have changed it for anything.  And then I started school, middle school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: [Nellie N.] Coffman Middle School [Cathedral City, California], the first year of that, two-year school and from there to high school.  But I started playing basketball on the reservation, I started--there was a Boys Club [Boys & Girls Clubs of America] in the middle of the desert that I would go to and the gentleman's name was Frank [ph.], I'll never forget him as long as I live.  I don't know whether he was properly trained to be a Boys Club director or not, that wasn't important.  And that's--and so now, when I became a director I realized the importance of caring, the kids don't care how much you know they just wanna know how much you care.  And that's why I'll always remember him.  I knew he really cared about us; there was no doubt in my mind.  And we had a basketball court paved, it was pavement and oh, and we used to go out there at night and play five and six hours and that's all we had.  But I remember Frank was so kind and never forget him.  And we'd play basketball at night and during the daytime we would sit under mesquite trees, play dominoes, my parents [M.C. Shepard and Willie Mae Glaspie] would and I would be shooting baskets every day of my life, every day.  I didn't miss a day during that four or five years--
Story_ID: 192165
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So at this point had your mother [Willie Mae Shepard] remarried?
Speaker 1: Yes, my mother remarried a man by the name of M.C. Shepard, and he had a family in Texas, sons and daughters, but a good man, a fine man.
Speaker 2: What can you tell us about him?
Speaker 1: Well, he was a hod carrier, I mean that's the things you carry on your back, cement, when you're plastering, when you're plastering a house, you know, someone has to carry the mortar up, up to the top as they can spread it on and that's what he was, H-O-D, hod carrier.  And loved to gamble, it was so good, loved to play dominoes because at the reservation there were places under trees that you sit and men played dominoes.  But he was a fine man and finally met his son, who was about--we were about the same age, who came out to stay with us so I had an instant family, you know, brother.  And we all--my aunt [Avis Glaspie] was still the matriarch though and then she brought a large house on the reservation.  She was very enterprising, she got a large house, I mean it had about six rooms and so she started renting out the rooms to people coming through there, blacks and whites.  She didn't care, she--I mean--and, and so I just grew around--it just didn't make any difference to her. I mean, if they needed a place to stay, and they would, I mean, we're not talking about rooms separated (laughter) maybe a door, but we all lived in the same house, same--used the same kitchen, same bathroom and the house was always full.  Some people sleep in our doors, but she was making--then she bought in some more little homes, she was very enterprising.  But it, it also added to the closeness of that community and she made us work.  I worked every, every day but Sunday.
Speaker 2: What kind of work did you do?
Speaker 1: I would have to rake the yard, number one. That's--and at night I would have to go clean up a beauty salon, and she was upstairs cleaning up the apartment for the people and they had a salon downstairs.  And I would be downstairs cleaning up the beauty salon.  My sister, now--she made us work, I mean she was, she was a real matriarch and my mother [Willie Mae Glaspie] worked too.  She was over all of us--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --my mom too.  And we did that for years and then as I look back now, you know, doing the book I realize how important that strong Jewish influence has been in my life because most of the people she worked for were Jewish and they would always counsel me on knowing something about my history and also on school.  They stayed with it, I mean they stayed--and so I--it got to the point where I had an obligation to them.  As I can recall, once I was in college [Gonzaga University, Spokane, Washington] I'd just gone to college my first year and I was a basketball star.  I was hot, I was the gun from Palm Springs [California], little Palm Springs.  And I didn't realize that a lotta guns gonna be there, a lotta guns (laughter) (unclear)--I had not anticipated that and so I started feeling sorry for myself and I was getting knocked around, you know, and one day I got knocked out and they took me downstairs and put me on this--on the bench and I said, "I don't need this, I can go back to Palm Springs, get a job at the car wash," 'cause that's where my buddies were working and get me a car.  And right after that they say, okay, now how are you going to explain that to your mom, on her knees cleaning peoples' home, bragging on you right now, knowing this, where is she at, she's bragging on her college son and I say, how are you gonna face Mrs. Trob [ph.], who she worked for, and Rosa Beverly.  And all the people that was always telling you to go to school, get an education and God is my witness, I got up off of that bench and never looked back, never made second--I made first-string, went back up and never made second-string, always made first-string from that point on.  I never looked back and that shows you how adults who care, if they let you know they care about you.  Kids need to know somebody believes in them and they don't want to let them down and that's what just propelled me and from that point on my--I've been blessed, I've been blessed and God has blessed every move I have made and--but it was, it was that kind of community and--but my mom worked and my aunt worked until we finally--the land became so valuable, Palm Springs, California.  It was Indian land now.  And then there were some unscrupulous people of course, and they just wanted to take the Indian land and so they gave us notice to get out of there.  That's when urban renewal came in.  This is Indian land, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And what about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --they were--the Indians weren't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: what year was this?
Speaker 1: --telling us to get off.  No, no, matter of fact they were telling the Indians to get off--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: About what year was this Mr. Jordan?
Speaker 1: Nineteen-fifty seven [1957].  Fifty-six [1956] I left.  It was about 1959.  And so they came down, they had so many days to get off, some people didn't make it so their furniture was taken outside and set out and they demolished the homes.  And there was a little city about fifteen miles away called Banning, California, a lot of us moved there, a lot of them just went further into the desert.  The community's still there.  But they clean, cleaned off the reservation and start building condos.  You know how that goes.  It was a classic case of urban removal and the Indians had to move too until a gentleman by the name of Tonni [ph.], his father was a professional boxer, heavyweight champion I think, but he was, a senator--congressman and he came down to see what was going on and he realized what they had done to the Indians and so many judges and lawyers were disbarred, I mean they had taken their land and he gave it all back to the Indian.  And boy, the Indians, they took it with a vengeance too, and they took their land back but we had relocated then.  Farther out into the desert, Banning, California which is fifteen miles away and that's where we moved to, but I was in college [Gonzaga University, Spokane, Washington]--

Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And what were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Well, my sister [Joann Jordan] and I joined first, in Kilgore, Texas, two of us; I can remember that very well, the night we joined.
Speaker 1: Was it a Baptist church or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was a Baptist.
Speaker 1: --Methodist, Bapt--
Speaker 2: Reverend Cory [ph.].  And then we came to [Palm Springs] California there was a church on the reservation that we all went to.
Speaker 1: What denomination was it?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Baptist.  And, after that I went away to college, but I would always come back.  And in college I went to a church, up in Spokane, Washington.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in church, growing up?
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Speaker 1: Was it typical Baptist church, start--last all day long?
Speaker 2: It was typical Baptist church, and now when my audiences, a lot of times around the country, wanna know where, where did you learn to speak like that, and it just so simple, I said, "It was, it was those sisters.  I was young and they, after Sunday school, they said, 'All right [HistoryMaker] Charles [R. Jordan], Charles Ray, get up and tell the people what you learned.' Oh God, 'Stand up in front of the people--tell them what you learned today in Sunday school' and they would do that and make you stand there, 'All right, put your hands down--take your hand out of your mouth'".  And I, Mrs. Stuart [ph.], Mrs. Dukes [ph.], I can just see all their faces, Claudia, I could see them.  "Okay Charles you give the review today."  And they just stayed on me to do that.  I was very bashful and they kept working on me to make those reports and I started doing it and I started liking it and, and so otherwise I couldn't do what I do now.  I--now (laughter) that was it, that did it, they are the one who got me started.
Story_ID: 192167
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about high school.  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Palm Springs High School [Palm Springs, California].  Palm Springs Indians they were.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your experiences like in high school?
Speaker 2: Good.  It was integrated, very harmoniously, I mean the kids--lots of--well in retrospect--well lots of guys who went on to become movie stars.  I remember some of them--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Any we might know?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if you know Jack Jones was a singer.  And, but he's the only one that--there were others, I understand but they weren't in my class.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And it was a good school, I had--I started playing basketball and then became the best in that area.  I had a coach, 'cause there were no black teachers, coach was white.  But he was a good man and they were all good.  And of course I wanted to be like him, so when it came time to go to college--what do you want to do?  I want to be a coach 'cause he was the only role model that I had.  And so I got about ten scholarships.
Speaker 1: What--?
Speaker 2: And selected Gonzaga [University, Spokane, Washington], a Catholic university.  Didn't know anything about them, had never heard of Gonzaga, but the only reason I selected them, 'cause I had UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], that's where I was gonna go, is the fact that of all the universities to come down to recruit me, they're the only ones that didn't come to me, they went to my mother [Willie Mae Glaspie].  They never--they did not contact me they went to my mother first and talked to her and that impressed me.  I didn't know anything, couldn't even spell Gonzaga, didn't know anything, didn't know it was Jesuit, but the fact that they cared that much I knew I would be taken care of there, so I had a white friend of mine and he wanted to go to San Diego State [University, San Diego, California] and I want to go to Gonzaga so we agreed to go to Gonzaga two years, San Diego State for two years.  So we drove up to Gonzaga and the coach was so afraid that I would leave that he gave my friend a scholarship too (laughter) just make sure that he didn't leave because he felt that I would leave.  So--and I ended up at a Jesuit university, not knowing anything about it but enough that they cared to go talk to my mother and she was impressed with it too.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at--and actually what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Well, high school was just high school, I didn't have one date through--and I was--the basketball star--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Even though you were the basketball star?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) not one date all through high school.  I would--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Were you shy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but I worked every day.  I would leave school, go sell papers and then I started getting embarrassed because I was growing so tall and I would be coming down the street with my papers and I'd see some of my class mates and (laughter) I'd duck into a--whether I had a sale in there or not, I'd go into a store.  But every day I would work every day and at night I would clean the salon so I had a full life and I played basketball every day in my yard I had that.  But I didn't--did not one date throughout all of high school.
Speaker 1: Didn't go to the prom?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my--Nick [ph.] and I drove by the prom (laughter).  Literally, literally, and we went on to a movie.  Nick was my best friend in high school and he didn't either, he didn't have a date either.  So we drove--yeah, we went by the prom.  So I can say, "Yeah, I went by the prom for a little while."  But we drove right on by and went to a movie, no, not all through high school.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in high school?
Speaker 2: Average, C student.  Yeah, matter a fact, in--my coach--well I had a lot of--he kept a close eye on me to make sure that I was passing.  But I was just a C student, grades didn't mean anything to me and so, but I never flunked, but just the average student who just loved to play basketball though.  That was my life, every day, every day.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: And so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There were ninety-two in my graduating class, three blacks; it was a small class, three blacks.  One was killed and the other I don't know what happened to him.
Story_ID: 192168
Speaker 1: And, were you the first in your family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So was there like a lot of hoopla and a lot of excitement about that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --or was it kind of expected that you would go to college?
Speaker 2: No, there was a lot of excitement but it wasn't just from my family, it was the whole reservation.  I was--I, I tell you the village worked for me like none other.  I had the whole village was behind me, I mean I was the only one in there in the whole community, on the whole reservation who had a chance to go to college and during my basketball career they were all there at--the gym would be full of people, I mean they were, they were behind me all the way.  There was no way I could fail, there was no way I could fail, they were there and when I was going to college they were always supporting me when I would come home for the summer.  It was--I was theirs, I felt theirs and I was proud to be there, and even now when I go back I--those who are alive, I go back and thank them again.  I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like at Gonzaga [University, Spokane, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't the same as high school.  I did have a couple of dates at Gonzaga, but not from, not from--well they were--Gonzaga's a Jesuit university, yeah it's a Jesuit university, Catholic.  Jesuit priest--the priests were teachers, very strict.  Not much on the way of social life until I became a junior.  But not on campus, no, no, we--I--two of my--we had--I played basketball and we never had a winning season like they are now because some of the ballplayers who would come there were good, but they weren't there to study and Gonzaga, that's all Gonzaga was about, academics.  You're not going to ruin the reputation and, and they made the mistake, it was in the late '50s [1950's], but they were a little too bold with their dates.
Speaker 1: Meaning?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were--it was interracial dating and they were too bold with it.  I mean it was an in-your-face kind.  Walking around campus and they were only there for one year and they were asked not to come back, and they were good ballplayers.  But that was not enough for Gonzaga.  And my roommate and I played ball, and so I didn't start dating until my junior year.  I met a young lady, off campus, there weren't that many people of color in Spokane [Washington], and so we started dating and dated her until I graduated.  But, it was sorta uneventful, just, just a great university to go to, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you were gonna do with your life--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, the only role model I had was my coach.  There were no black teachers in Palm Springs [High School, Palm Springs, California], none, at no level when I was there.  And the only role model I had was my coach, and so I wanted to be like him.  So I was going to be a coach until my fourth year.  And at Gonzaga, whenever you travel you always have a priest with you and during my last year this priest that traveled with us, Reverend--Father Harrington, I never will forget him, it was our last year and I remember I was on a train, we were coming back from Portland [Oregon] and he came over and he sat with me and he said, "What are you gonna do now?" and I said, "Well, I'm gonna graduate and go back to Palm Springs [California]."  And he said, "You know I been traveling with you for four years."  And he said, "I've watched you and I've watched people how they respond to you."  And he said, "And they always gravitate toward you."  And he said, "You know, have you ever thought about going into sociology."  I couldn't even spell it.  And I said, "No, no, I'm going back."  He said, "Well, if you decide to go into sociology we'll give you another scholarship and a job to change your major."  Uh-huh, and then--so I said, "Okay."  I changed my major, became the assistant coach at Gonzaga and got my degree in sociology and philosophy, and not education as I was planning to.  And got my degree and went back home [Palm Springs, California] couldn't get a job, couldn't get a job.  And so, and I was tired; I had spent two years in the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 192169
Speaker 1: When did you join--when did you go into the [U.S.] Army (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I was ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] officer, and so you're asking about (unclear) for Gonzaga [University, Spokane, Washington], and I was in the officer training corps and I became one of the commanders and the commander and the commander's supposed to have a date for the military ball. And the queen was the one who would be the commander's date and of course there were no black ladies--girls at the school, it turned out to be a little French girl who was the queen.  Francoyse Picard.  And they didn't know what they were gonna do, 'cause I was black and so--and I didn't know, but she and I went together, and two years ago, after all this time we talked and she explained to me what they did.  They went over to the dorm and asked her would she mind going to the ball with me and so that was the date.  That was the only date I had at the school.  It was amazing, after all these years, I never knew, I never knew--'cause she was a fine person she would've gon--I was-- no doubt in my mind that she would not have gone.  But that was the life--the social life was off campus for me.
Speaker 1: And how were you received in the community?  Were you--get, "Oh wow, there's" you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --"[HistoryMaker] Charles [R.] Jordan"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: "Big time basketball player"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --"at Gonzaga?"
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--you know, a lot had to do with my height too, that would, for strangers but not the people who knew me.  I was always a good--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you do--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --kid.
Speaker 1: --draw attention, I mean, there's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, just my height alone would draw it, but the people who--but people knew me because I was a, I was a good kid.  They just knew me, yeah, I mean they all knew me and whenever--so I couldn't, I couldn't--I can't fail at anything I do, I've got too much support.  Everywhere I go I've got too much support and they were just always be--even now when I go back there they're so proud to have me to stop by their home and, you know, as I try--I can hear people, when I go by, hear my name being called, people saying, "That's who that is".  And in Portland [Oregon] too, it's the same way in Portland, I meant so much to them because God just set things up for me to be there at the right time, and I'm the one for the job.  It's not, and believe me, 'cause I-- it's nothing that I have done it's just that I really, truly of all, I truly love people.  And I really, I told you I'm still not sure why I didn't get bitter, I still don't know, and as I write I'm gonna try to find out.  I think it's--I don't know, I don't know, but I wanna know though.
Story_ID: 192170
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from Gonzaga [University, Spokane, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].  And I went back and tried to get the job, and they would not hire a person of color.  Even though--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This is in Palm Springs [California]?
Speaker 2: --yeah, even though I was a popular kid they weren't ready to take me into city hall.  And then one day I got a call--and I started working for a movie star, an actor, his name was Laurence Harvey, British actor and I was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What kind of work did you do for him?
Speaker 2: Gardening.  And then I worked for another movie star, Jack Lambert, he was an old cowboy, and I was going gardening and then one day I got a call from the mayor of Palm Springs, his name was Frank Bogert, is Frank Bogert, and he said, "Well we do have a position here, but what we want to know is if--what if you take the job and we have to let you go because of the public?"  I said, "Well, you know, I have been to college for five years, I've been in the [U.S.] Army for two and I'm ready to stay home."  I said, "I'll just find me another job."  He wanted to know whether I was gonna sue.  And he said, okay, we're gonna try it, recreation leader, and so, they hired me as a recreation leader--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: For the City of Palm Springs?
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--For the City of Palm Springs.  I was the first person of color to ever work in that city and then I started and that's how I started building my career in recreation.
Speaker 1: What were your responsibilities as a recreation leader?
Speaker 2: To work with the Little League, make sure the lights were on at the stadium, help organize Little League.  Help organize the basketball.  Go around check on the chess games and the dances, Sonny [Bono] and Cher, I used to hire them a lot.  During the Easter time Palm Springs was wall-to-wall kids, college kids.  That was where you escaped to, was Palm Springs and so I used to be in charge of all of that.  So the whole program, and I ran that until I left to go to Portland, Oregon.  And that, again it was someone else pushing me, I never applied for a job that--I've never gotten a job that I went after.  I can only remember one time--no, no, I have not applied for a job that I wanted.  No, that's not right, that I went--every job I have is because someone else believed in me and I did it as a favor to them and ended up getting the job and loving it.  I mean it, I could give you a whole story how God moves in my life, it is so clear that no way that could happen to anyone without some other Power that's moving and it's so clear to me, that's--but I--it would take me a long time to tell you about that.
Speaker 1: And what was the reaction of the community when you got this job as this recreation leader--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --was there some apprehension?
Speaker 2: Not at all, oh not at all, no, not at all, none whatsoever.  It just went--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Very well received?
Speaker 2: --smoothly.  Very well received and went smooth until, matter fact, I became the assistant to the city manager, I worked my way up in a short time and that was until I got another call from Portland, Oregon.  But yes, no, no problems at all, never been any problems at all.
Speaker 1: And very well received by the children, the kids and stuff?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.  It is honestly and I say this with all sincerity, it is hard to talk about sometime because it's frightening to see, it's just frightening to look back on all that, see how all that happened to you and you feel like--as if you were not, you weren't in control of it.  I was not, I did not lay that plan out, that plan, it came from the love of God.  And I think I have the answers to why I didn't get bitter and why I'm not bitter now for all I went through and I think it's because I do have the gift.  And that's the gift of love, I mean true love, I know what it is and I think that's--that may be the answer.
Speaker 1: And do you think that's because of the way you were brought up--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you were so loved in all of the communities--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where you lived in?
Speaker 2: I know what it is, I know what love does for you, I know what caring--just like I said about Frank [ph.].  I know what it is when you let people know you really care, people just need to know somebody cares about them, and so if that--see that's the motivation.  They're not looking for toys and money and all, they just wanna know somebody care.  And I knew I always had that.  I always had cheerleaders, everywhere I go, this organization here, I mean, this guy here; I mean that would be a story for me to tell you about Pat Noonan, the founder of this group [The Conservation Fund].  That guy is, he's just incredible, he got it early, earlier than I did, and he just took me under his wings and he has opened doors that no one else could have done.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan, we were talking a little bit about when you were rec [recreation] leader for Palm Springs [California] and so what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: Well, after, this is after I came back from service [in the U.S. Army] I was recreation leader, I'd started before I was called to service.  When I first started, I only worked for six months before Uncle Sam called me.  I knew I would have to go in the service anyway 'cause I had a commission, but I served for two years and I went back and I took my job again and then I was promoted to assistant to the city manager--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This was in 1965?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty--no that was--see--when I was,--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-one [1961]?
Speaker 2: When I, well '61 [1961] is when I started, yeah, '61 [1961] was when I started, but, but yeah that's when I first started with the city and I got my notice in '61 [1961], but I was able to put it off so I could work a while before I leave.  So I worked until 1962 then I had to go in the service.  And in '62 [1962] I went in and stayed in Germany for two years and came back and took my job back with the city again in '64 [1964].  And in '65 [1965] I was promoted to assistant to the city manager.
Speaker 1: And were you the first African American assistant city manager?

Speaker 2: Good.  Yeah, it was, it was good, it was very good.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your responsibilities as assistant city manager?
Speaker 2: I was the liaison to the house--city housing committee, you know, every city had a human relation committee then and I was fortunate to work with the rabbi, the leading rabbi in the city, Rabbi Rose, who taught me a lot about meetings.  I will never forget him for that.  A lot about meetings and how to keep things loose, so I was responsible for that I was responsible with community relations.  And some studies for the city manager as far as an assistant--as an assistant too that's what you did.  And I did that for two years.
Speaker 1: And what was Palm Springs like, what was the climate in Palm Springs in terms--during--this is the mid '60s [1960s], so someone at the height of the Civil Rights movement--what, what was the climate like in Palm Springs?
Speaker 2: Oh it passed Palm Springs by (laughter).  It would pass--unemployment was probably at zero.  Palms people just work, and it's a very hot place in the summer, I mean extremely hot, so it really wasn't that much, it wasn't, didn't hardly anything happen down there.  When it started happening was my last two years as assistant to the city manager, the students started acting up at the high school [Palm Springs High School, Palm Springs, California].  There were some tension there, there was just racial tension but nothing really blew out of proportion in Palm Springs.  Just started some, some real tension and so I would be called over there to meet with the students.  And I did that until--and I was happy then 'cause I'd built a house and I was living alone and I was there I had arrived and then (laughter) this lady told me about a position in Portland, Oregon, which I did not want, but it was my way of saying I really appreciate you caring enough about me that I would apply.  I said, you know, that I would apply but I honestly had no desire to leave Palm Springs, none whatsoever.  So I applied and then they took me through their loops again I had to go through a lot.  For the first interview--the Civil Rights Movement was really hot.
Speaker 1: In Portland?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was hot around the country, everywhere but Palm Springs.
Story_ID: 192173
Speaker 1: I went up [to Portland, Oregon] for an interview, and they thought I was white, by my resume.  And, when I went in the room they had two blacks down there, the lady just, she just said, "You should have known what we were thinking, when you walked in that room we had no idea because your resume does not reflect--(simultaneous)--"
Speaker 2: Gonzaga [University, Spokane, Washington].
Speaker 1: --a person of color.  Yeah, right, and assistant to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Palm Springs [California].
Speaker 1: --the city manager, at the time I was probably the second one in the country.  And she said, "We were so happy," her name was Bobbie Nunn; I'll never forget her either.  And I went through the interview and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What was the position?
Speaker 1: It was Model Cities director.  That I would be responsible for four and a half square miles of about forty thousand people and some good money and I was responsible for the whole area (laughter).  And, but I said, went to the interview and I really just wanted to go back up there--my roommate is from Spokane [Washington]--from Portland [Oregon], and I just wanted to see him again.  And so I went back to Palm Springs and started work.  Nothing happened for three months then I got a call from the mayor of Palm Springs [sic. Portland], says, "You know, we really would like to hire you but there is a lot of controversy about hiring you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The mayor from Palm Springs or the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Mayor from Portland--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Mayor from Portland.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mayor [Terry] Schrunk.  He said, "The people, the militants are really upset, they don't want to hire someone from California, they want someone from Portland."  And I said, "Okay."  'Cause I was fine (laughter) I said, "Okay."  He said, "But do me a favor, would you come back up for one more interview?"  I said well, I just thought I need to bring my wife [Esther Jordan] this time 'cause, you know, it's gonna be a trip, why not take my wife with me.  And he said, "Okay, bring your wife with you."  So my wife--'cause I had an aunt in Spoka-in Portland, and so I took my wife up and we stayed with my aunt a while.  I went to the interview, thirty-two people interviewed me.
Speaker 2: In one day?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was one day at a college.  This was the board of directors of that program.  And, when I came out, there was TV cameras and everything and then the Black Beret, you know the militant group and the Panth--they were they were there, the Panthers [Black Panther Party] weren't there for that because they didn't get along with the Black Beret.  But they--the cameras were there and they were saying, "Look, you will not hire this man."
Speaker 2: The Black Berets?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, they--that's right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --because you were from California--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: --you were an outsider?
Speaker 1: And said, "You will not hire this man."  And then the thirty-two people were still in there, old people and young, and I was standing out there looking at that and then the Black Beret all went in the room and ran all those people out of there.  I mean they were comin' out of windows, they just ran them out.  Just (waves hand) just broke up the whole meeting.  And so I was looking, I said, I know I don't want to come back to this (laughter) place.  So I--it didn't bother me, so I went back to Palm Springs--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Let me ask you Mr. Jordan, how did that make you feel to have a black group--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It didn't bother me?
Speaker 2: --it didn't bother you?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Well, one, I didn't want the job anyway and it just didn't bother me.  You know, I, you know I was immune to all that in Palm Springs, you know, There was no movement and I couldn't really--my heart wasn't really in the movement.
Speaker 2: But it didn't hurt at all to not be embraced by--when you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --came from an environment where you were always--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --embraced--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --by black people?
Speaker 1: Right, um-hm, no, I don't recall that--I really don't recall that bothering me because I just, I didn't want to leave Palm Springs anyway.  So I went back and I was happy and then three months later, three months I got another call from the mayor.
Speaker 2: So, six months after the initial interview?
Speaker 1: He said, "Mr. Jordan," he said, "I would love to have you."  This is the mayor, and he said, "The people that interviewed you would love to have you too."  And oh gosh, and I talked to the wife and she wanted to go and that's--I said, "Okay."  Went up there and the first meeting--and one of the brothers said, "We're gonna give you three months and you'll be outta here."  I'd already moved up there then (laughter).  He said, "Three months."  His name was Tom Wilson, I won't forget him.  Said, "Three months and you'll be outta here; we'll get rid of you."  And, so I stayed two years and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: With the Model Cities Program?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--With the Model Cities Program and then the mayor of the city, a new mayor of the city was elected and he asked me to come downtown to work for him.  His name was Neil Goldschmidt, great mayor, had some problems recently, but he asked me if I would leave Model Cities and come downtown and be on his staff.  And, so I went downtown and worked for him until--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And this is as city commissioner?
Speaker 1: No, this was--no I was a director of human resources.  He was, he was, Neil must have been 27 and had gone in with a lot of young Turks and he was gonna change everything.  And he, by the way, he did, he was very good he was an excellent mayor but some things have come out lately that have not been that flattering, but as a mayor he was very good.  And so I worked for him until I got to the point I didn't like his politic, he was on his way up and when people are on their way up they're not loyal to anyone.  And he was using people and that's one of the things I don't like for people--I--it's not the using me it's the, think that you're getting away with it.  That's the part that bothers me (laughter).  And he did and so I resigned, that's the first time I resigned out of anger, and went to work for a laboratory, educational laboratory.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], 1969.
Story_ID: 192174
Speaker 1: I became director of career education for Northwest Regional Education Laboratory [Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, later, Education Northwest].  And again, I had arrived.  Offices in Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, Alaska, and California, and no board to report to, I had arrived.  I was there (laughter) I was--so just to show you I went to Palm Springs [California], went to California three times 'cause I was saving Samoa and Alaska for later on (laughter).  That later on never came, because a vacancy came open on the Portland City Council, I should have seen it coming, Portland [Oregon] had never had a black elected to office, never.  They had tried many years, but they could not get the vote on the west side of the [Willamette] River.  And Neil called me, Goldschmidt, the mayor.  Said, "There's a seat open on the council I would like to nominate you for it."  I said, "No way." Said, "No, I don't want it, I'm happy here, gee whiz, you know.  No citizens to have to respond to."  And so Neil, being as shrewd as he was, he leaked it out to the public that after all these years, [HistoryMaker] Charles [R. Jordan] is the one who can do it and he doesn't want it and then that's when the community started calling and--.  And so it was on a Thursday, so I told my secretary "I'm gonna have to leave town, I can't take this."  So I called my wife [Esther Jordan], said, "There's some--I'm not gonna do it.  And I'm gonna go out--go to Seattle [Washington] for two weeks and hope--I mean two nights for the weekend and hope that when I get back they have selected someone."  So the black community called a caucus and they were gonna select someone and that was good, that's what I was hoping for.  And so they selected a man named George Rankin to be the candidate and I returned on Monday, but the community wouldn't accept George.  Oh gosh, and then I went into prayer on that and I realized that I was happy where I was, but I was happy because they had believed in me, the people had believed in me.  So again, I felt that I had to do it and I--so I went to the public and I said, "I will do it until you get someone else."  And so I ran and won four elections and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Sixty--went on in 1970 [sic, 1974].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I had to run an election in three months, I had to put together a campaign.  And, we got that one and I won that one and I won the next two times.
Speaker 2: How many--how long was the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Four-year terms.
Speaker 2: --term?
Speaker 1: It's a full, it's a full-time job in Palm Springs [sic], in Portland, full-time and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So from 1970 to 1974 [sic, 1974 to 1978] was your first term?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, 1970 to 1974 [sic, 1974 to 1978].  And then I ran again and I won and then I became Police Commissioner--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: As part of your duties on the city--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah on the--right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --council?
Speaker 1: --they are--the duties are assigned by the mayor, he can assign portfolios.  You got a commissioner of police, you got a public works commissioner, you know, fire and state, and he--that's, that's one authority that the mayor has the others did not have, he assigned portfolios.  And for the first time he gave the police department to a commissioner.  And I was that commissioner.  And that was five of the toughest years of my life being--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How so?
Speaker 1: Oh, being a police commissioner in a city like--oh gosh, you get complaints every night, I mean, police are busy.  And I had to fight them on affirmative action and I had to fight them on police complaints and I fought them at the [U.S.] Supreme Court, I fought them before the voters.  For a change agent to be a police commissioner it's gonna be stressful.  And so I did that until 1980, I ran, I never lost a race.  And then my kids were growing up and there was really no time for them because I--that job was demanding.
Story_ID: 192175
Speaker 1: Another lady who lived in California called and said, "You know, Austin, Texas is looking for the best parks director in the country and I told her that you were the best."
Speaker 2: And is this from your experience as the parks commissioner in Portland [Oregon]?
Speaker 1: What did I say--No I had not been--un-un--I had not been the parks director.  Well I had been the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The parks commissioner?
Speaker 1: --the police commissioner, but after police commissioner I became the parks commissioner for two years.  Yeah, I hadn't run the department; I had just become the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, no.
Speaker 1: --commissioner and she said, "And I told them that you were the best."  And this is a lady who is well renowned in the movement and in--well known and I said, "Gee whiz, how can I--."  Again, deja vu, how can I say thank you for her believing in me?  And I said, "Well Mary, I will apply for it, but I just won another four years."  Yeah, I'd just won another four years in my election and I applied and short--shorten the story Austin ended up hiring me and I said, "Oh gosh."  I just wanted to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And what year was this [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy--and I had just, I told you I had just won another four years and I--what am I gonna do, am I gonna go before the voters and ask that they--they'd just elected me--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Seventy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --or eighty?
Speaker 1: Nineteen, oh, (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980]?
Speaker 1: Yeah when I'm going back right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, nine, no--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nineteen-eighty.
Speaker 1: --wait a minute, then it was '80 [1980]--was it '80 [1980]?  I was in Austin five, five years (unclear) '84 [1984], it was 1984.
Speaker 2: Okay, so 1984, director of parks and recreation for Austin--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: For the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Texas.
Speaker 1: --Austin, Texas.
Speaker 2: And what were your experiences like?
Speaker 1: In Austin?
Speaker 2: In Austin.
Speaker 1: Very good, except for the people I worked for--people in Austin, the whole community was just excellent.  But I worked for--see Austin was the fastest growing city in the country that year and I mean, fastest, every, everybody was a developer and they were looking for the best in the country, they really were.  They hired about twenty new directors, they built a whole new team and so they were going around, "We want the best in every area, law enforcement, public works, personnel, parks and rec [recreation].  And that's--you know, that was somewhat of an honor to, to be considered the best and it was my way of saying thank you to Mary.  And so I applied and I got the job, unfortunately they had everything it took for leadership, the management team they hired, they were not ready.  They were micromanagers and I hate that more than I hate anything else I can think of in the world.  I hate a micromanager, I just, you know, and they were micromanagers and unfortunately they had heard about me.  My reputation had preceded me.
Story_ID: 192176
Speaker 1: They were going to--and then I got a call one day from this lady that said, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan, I want you to meet me on the lake."  And it was [Claudia] "Lady Bird" [Johnson].
Speaker 2: "Lady Bird" Johnson?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she said, "Meet me on the lake."  At a certain time and I met her out there and she was saying, you know, "I like what you are doing, and it was a dream that I had."  And she said that it became, "deferred when I had to go to Washington, now I like what you're saying about your vision of this lake and I want to help you."
Speaker 2: What was your vision Mr. Jordan?
Speaker 1: Well, it was--they had a lake that run right through the city, part of the Colorado chain, it was called Town Lake [later Lady Bird Lake, Austin, Texas] and I had vision of walking and events, facilities where kids could stop off and learn about the great outdoors, it was all focused on the great outdoors and a high level of maintenance, a high level of maintenance that would encourage people to get out and walk and be healthy.  And I would talk about it a lot and she, she heard it and so I met her out there and she walks--Lady--we must have walked about two miles and during that two miles she was telling me about all the benches and the flowers, where she got the money to have all those things put in and she said, "And that was my vision and whatever you need, you need to talk to me."  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Cause she's a--was a huge conservationist.
Speaker 1: Oh gosh yes, the flowers and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, the wildflower--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --but they got back to city hall, she would not meet with the mayor, she would not meet with the city manager unless I was there.  And that really did not endear me to them and they were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter.)
Speaker 1: --so, they were just downright mean to me, I mean, and I'm a nice guy and they were just mean.  I mean cursing, oh he loved to curse, the city manager, oh swear.  And they wanted me to leave, oh he, matter of fact he said, "Why don't you leave, why don't you just leave?"  And boy, then that--I would not leave, and so I stood for--it was five city managers.  I stayed five years, and this is how God works, I stayed five years and then I wanted to leave, but God would not let me.  I applied for jobs, you wouldn't believe it, some small towns and here I was supposed to be the best in the country--I couldn't get a job anywhere, Cleveland [Ohio], L.A. County [Los Angeles County, California], Lancaster, California, which is a small city.  I tried so many places I couldn't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Why do you think that was?
Speaker 1: It was God--it's the way God works.  And I wanted--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He had a bigger plan for you?
Speaker 1: --to get--I wanted to get away from them.  And in five years each one of them was fired.
Speaker 2: Each city manager?
Speaker 1: Each city manager that gave me a hard time was terminated and believe it or not, when the last one was fired I got a call from Portland, Oregon, saying, "Charles, we'd love to have you back here as parks director.  God was showing me that "I'm bigger than any man, see.  You were trying to get away from them--no, I wanted you to stay there because I want to show you how I work.  Don't be afraid of men, you know, it's me who you should fear."  And the last one was fired and I got a job back in Portland.  And I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This was in 1989?
Speaker 1: This was 1989, in November (laughter) of 19--I remember so well--
Story_ID: 192177
Speaker 1: November 1989, I came back to Portland [Oregon] and took over as parks director, and when I got back to Portland the people did a poll, and me just returning I would have run second to the mayor--to be the mayor of Portland if I had wanted to.  But, you know, and, but again, I did--I let 'em think I was for a while because see that--well that--my stock went up, you know, they know the man could be mayor so I played it for about two months, but then I said, "No, I don't want that."  And, but that just shows you how--that's what I mean, how God has worked in my life.  He shows me that I'm bigger than man; don't be afraid of man, eh, they can't hurt you.  And so I just went back and I been there every since, thirteen years, until last April, April a year ago.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan, what were some of your biggest accomplishments as--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Commissioner, park--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --the--director of parks?
Speaker 1: Director, oh, well, they would probably--they would say Pioneer Courthouse Square [Portland, Oregon], it's our downtown living room.  It's a beautiful square downtown with bricks and it's a gathering place, it's--if you go downtown that's where--if you're gonna meet someone, you're gonna say meet me at Pioneer Square.  That, and also putting Portland's parks system on the map.  And if you would call any city today and--metropolitan city and ask them what park system do you think is the best they're gonna say, "Portland is number two."  If they got sense they'll call theirs the best (laughter).  That's why I'm saying number two.  They'll tell you that it's the best--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And what makes Portland the best?
Speaker 1: Well, the people, the people really care, I mean, have you been to Portland?
Speaker 2: I haven't.
Speaker 1: Then you would have no--or I couldn't explain it to you.  You'd have no appreciation; you'd have to see it.  It's a gorgeous city and it works.  And I mean by, mean it works, five o'clock they don't roll up the sidewalk downtown.  People are alive, houses, people live down there.  And so that's what makes it a great city, the people care about their city and so if you saw it you would understand and that's why it is one of the best.
Speaker 2: And, and, thirteen years as the parks director what were some of the noticeable changes you were starting to see in the city?
Speaker 1: Well, during that time gentrification was a big one.
Speaker 2: Not unlike many other cities?
Speaker 1: Right, but it taught me a lot about how we, how we miss opportunities and not visionary, we don't project far enough ahead 'cause that land was all available.  It was there and when I went back I tried to get--the community wanted to rename the street Martin Luther King Street, it was Grand Avenue, and I said, "Gang, that doesn't make sense."  And they said, "What are you talkin' about?"  I said, "You know, why don't we buy the land and then we can name the street anything we want too, and we would own the land."  "No, no, no."  He didn't want to 'cause everybody wanted to name the street, and once you name the street you don't have anything and it doesn't make a difference in any city.  It really hasn't changed anything by naming a street; see there was (laughter) just a buyout.  I wanted them--us to get together, save the money that we were gonna use to do that and buy the land and if we had bought the land then you would have had something.  So, but that--they named the street Martin Luther King Jr. which that hasn't changed anything, but mine was opening the park system up.
Speaker 2: Opening up to minorities and African Americans--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --how so?
Speaker 1: By just doing it, I mean that's not something you need to study or--you just do it.  And, and the people, the people of Portland knew that it was their park system, they wou--it was their system, in other words, I made sure I did things that I didn't come up with all the ideas--the citizens and I would try some of their ideas and they would work.  And so the people felt good about their park systems and they felt good about me being there and the people who worked for me.  Two of my top people were sisters and they were effective, until I left.
Speaker 2: Effective, when you say effective--?
Speaker 1: Get things done, get things done.  I can call--as God is my witness--I could call right now and 8-2-3, 5-1-0-8, and say, Michelle [ph.], I need you to have five people when I get back to Portland in two days, and this is what I want and they would be there, and she would have them there.  I mean they--we still work as a team, we still get things done together and my secretary, Palma [ph.], you talk to anyone around the country that I worked for or spoke for and they'll always tell you about Palma, just a lady, one of God's beautiful angels.  And just open it up and let them shine let them have a chance to shine and, and also people in the field, not just--people without power who normally were not really heard.  And they were not black either, just anyone who felt like they were not appreciated, come up with ideas and ways to recognize them.  It was kind of traumatic for them when I left there.  I haven't been back since because we haven't finished grieving yet, 'cause it was hard for me to leave them and I hear from them all the time, and so, that was my stay there.
Story_ID: 192178
Speaker 1: Why did you leave [the job as parks director for Portland, Oregon]?
Speaker 2: I wasn't growing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You left in 2003?
Speaker 2: I wasn't growing at all.  I was doing the same thing over and over again and trying to get government to change is very difficult, I mean it's so obvious we need to change, we need to try some knew things but it's just so hard to do.  People are just wedded to the way they've always done it, they feel very secure and very safe with the way things are and they're afraid they're gonna lose something and yet, I say, "We're still losing our kids," and we keep doing--we're not doing anything differently and yet we can see more of our kids walking the streets then are in school.  And I say, we just need to do something different and it was hard--it's hard to get a government to try something different, they just want to stay with what's safe and yet safe is--we're losing.  And so I tried a lot of programs and they would work, but government wouldn't stay with them because they were new, they want--and so I just realized that I was not getting anywhere and so I had to think a while before leaving, what would I do?  And then, there's a whole another story there what happened there, Pat Noonan, the name, it--what happened there--and I mean it's (laughter).
Speaker 1: And tell us who--actually--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Pat Noonan, the founder of this group [The Conservation Fund], oh yeah.
Story_ID: 192179
Speaker 1: That is my first granddaughter, Mia Michelle Jordan, and she was born in 2002--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So that was taken about 2002?
Speaker 1: Yeah, July 3rd.
Speaker 2: And that is the love of my life, my wife, Esther Jordan, that's a picture that we took probably in the early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is my grandson, Christopher Anderson and that's my lovely daughter, Trish [Patricia Jordan], and her husband Dean.
Speaker 1: Okay, about what year do you think that one was taken?
Speaker 2: That one was taken around the same time, in the early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is my son, the Reverend Dion Jordan, he's an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] pastor and he is now the youth pastor at my church in Portland.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: That was taken in the mid-'90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Okay, last one.
Speaker 2: And that is Christopher Anderson, we call him Tiffer [ph.], he is my grandson.  That was at my son's wedding.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: Four years ago, I think.
Speaker 1: So 2000?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay, great--
Story_ID: 192180
Speaker 1: So, let's talk a little bit about Pat Noonan and The Conservation Fund.  First tell us a little bit about The Conservation Fund, what's its goal, its mission?
Speaker 2: Well, The Conservation Fund is one of the premier conservation organizations in the country.  It's chartered to protect land and water, but it also has an additional charter which has proven to be quite a tool for us and that is for economic development.  So our mission is to protect land and water and also look for opportunities that would create economic opportunities.  And that is, that is a tool that I use more than anything else to get into communities of color.  Because, as you know, they feel that we're not a part of the environmental movement and they are right, we have not been a part of the formal movement because the messages just do not resonate in our communities.  They're talking about saving land and saving water at a time when we're looking at, as [Abraham] Maslow said, the basics.  You know, and yet the twain never realize that they're the same.  Lead paint is an environmental problem.
Speaker 1: And more so in the African American--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --community.
Speaker 2: And there it's called a health problem but it's also an environmental problem, so there's a chance for partnerships there.  So the economic development charter that we have allows us to go in and we do buy land we have purchased over four million acres of land in America to set aside and protect for future generations.  That's what we do, but what we do is we have the opportunity, with this economic development charter, to say, "Okay, we're going to protect this land, but how can we protect this land in such a way that this community will realize some sort of economic return.  For example, in Georgia we're working with a small town called Lithonia, Georgia, 2,000 people and I think about 1,800 are black and the rest are white, no economic base, lost economic base but we're working on a trail, a world class hike and bike trail where millions of people are going to use.  And so what we've done, we've set up an office in that town and we're working with the people to see what can we do to assist them in building capacity so they can take advantage of all those people who will be riding and walking that trail.  So that's the economic development return and that has allowed us to go into communities of color and resonate with them.  We're dealing with challenges that they're dealing with and we're not going in throwing around all those terms like ecological survey, bio diversity, you know, we're not trying to impress we're trying to express that here is an opportunity for us to work together for us to realize our conservation goals and for you to realize economic goals and you'll realize that the two are connected.  And so that's what I like about The Conservation Fund, and that's what we do.  We don't have a membership like a lot of the others and so we can move quickly, and we have a lot of flexibility.  Conservation is something I didn't know anything about; it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Anything about--meaning--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Conservation, I didn't know anything about conservation--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But you just knew it by another name, wouldn't you say?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean now that I--in retrospect, yeah back then, you know, I wanted to protect trees because trees were beautiful, but you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But you knew a lot about the land and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --with the land, its value--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but I didn't call that conservation.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But do you think that's part of the challenge and the misunderstanding when many people believe that the African American community doesn't embrace the environment--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Conservation.
Speaker 1: --or conservation.  It's just that we know it in a different way.
Speaker 2: Right, they exclude us but with the language.  Biodiversity, ecosystem--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Global warming.
Speaker 2: Global warming, all that and sustainability, sustainable development, you know, all of that, that's how they exclude people that, when they don't want them to be a part of it.  And so they never came into our community, communities of color to try to recruit, 'cause they come in speaking like that, course they weren't gonna get any money or support and yet we were working on some of the same challenges.
Story_ID: 192181
Speaker 1: I was appointed by President [Ronald Wilson] Reagan in 1984 to serve on a presidential commission.  It was the President's Commission on American Outdoors [sic. President's Commission on Americans Outdoors].  He appointed seventeen Americans to travel around this country for a year and a half and talk to Americans about the great outdoors and what they wanted to do in the great outdoors for the next thirty-five years and on that commission he had one black and one woman.  And I was that black.  And we traveled around the country.  On that committee was Pat Noonan, I didn't know who Pat Noonan was, but he--but of course Reagan had his real shakers and movers, you know the big ones, [Sheldon] Coleman [Jr.], the Coleman Company who has all of the camping gear, Gil Grosvenor [Gilbert Melville Grosvenor] of 'National Geographic,' he had the heavyweights on there, I was the lightest one on there (laughter).  And--but during that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Say you.
Speaker 1: --time as we traveled around every region of the country--talking to Americans, thousands of them about the great outdoors and what they like to do in the great outdoors and what they wanted to do.  We were gathering information; we had studies, hundreds of studies from people at hearings, people were coming out, sharing their dreams and hopes with us about the great outdoors.  And there weren't very many people of color, so that was stressful for me because I knew that we cared about the outdoors but we were not coming out expressing it and so I was trying to be objective and listen but I was also trying to speak on behalf and that's--that was hard to do and so I struggled with that.  And we finally came up with the report and when the report was finished, Pat Noonan, whom I hadn't--I just knew him I didn't know him very well, came up to me and said, "You know," he said, "I saw your struggle and I heard your story and I want to help you tell that story."  And said, "I want you to come and serve on my board."  That was, what, that was eighteen years ago and I didn't know anything about conservation.  But, "Come and serve on my board."  So I looked into it and I did and that guy, he got it then, I mean he really, you know, I didn't tell him, he just noticed, and he has opened doors.  You talking about someone who can open doors, that I never would have been able to even darken, and he just started opening doors for me and putting me out there and making sure people heard my story because I tell it from a black perspective and not, you can see not angrily, I'm not angry--so, you know, that's why it resonates because I'm not angry with anyone.  I just tell it from someone who has seen and has grown up in America in a black skin.  And so there are times when I saw a different America, it's not the one you're explaining to me, that's not what I saw, but let me tell you what America I saw.  And therefore what's important to me, and so I can do that without offending people because I'm not angry.  And so I've had a chance to do that all around the country and he just opened doors, I mean just incredibly so and ever since I've been on his board he has done that.
Story_ID: 192182
Speaker 1: And when he [Pat Noonan] decided last year, he's the founder of this organization [The Conservation Fund], that he wanted to work on a specific project, he asked if I would take over as chairman of the board and I just, oh gosh--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: For The Conservation Fund?
Speaker 1: For The Conservation Fund, God knows if there had been any way that I could have said "No."  You don't want to do that, number one, Pat is a legend and you don't want to follow a legend, okay, never follow a legend 'cause people are still expecting the same performance from you.  And--but, just impossible after all he had done for me to say no.  And he said, " [HistoryMaker] Charles [R. Jordan], it's only for three years."  And I, gosh, and so I said, "Okay, I will do it."  And that's how I became chairman of the board and, you know, being the first person of color to ever chair an organization like this it was going to be newsworthy and so that's how the media picked it up.  And they wanna know how I can reconcile conservation with the movement of black people.  So it really gives me a tremendous opportunity to tell the story how they are connected.
Speaker 2: And how, how are they connected?  What do you tell people?
Speaker 1: Well, I have been heavily influenced by a man by the name of John Muir, he was a conservationist and he said, "I went out into the wilderness and when I picked up something I discovered it was connected to everything else."  And you think about that, everything is connected and Gonzaga [University, Spokane, Washington] had taught me the principle of causality.  Every effect must have a cause.  Nothing exists in isolation.  And so whatever we do in land and water conservation--those four million acres that we have purchased and protected, who's gonna inherit those?  And where are they now?  They're in their cities, those are going to be inherited by my kids and my grandkid, but my grandkids don't know anything about all those four million acres of land.  They're not factoring the cost of the land into their budget.  They don't realize that those lands must be protected.  So they are already connected and they don't even know it, they are connected to that, everything is connected.  And so, I just start explaining whatever you're doing in the community, like tomorrow when I'll be speaking here to this group about getting involved, why you need to get involved now, the trees in front of your house, do you realize what that tree does?  Shade, oh no, that's only a part of it, shade, do you realize that when you exhale that that's poisonous gas you're letting out into the air and do you know what that tree does?  That tree takes that poisonous gas that you just exhaled and clean it up so that you can (inhaling) inhale clean air, that's what trees do, they cleanse the air, I mean, that's why they're important.  Not just for building houses and for birds to live in, but that's the same all around.  The water you drink, where does it come from?  You know, people need to start thinking about the life sustaining part of their life and they'll realize that everything is connected.  And so, we do that, that's what I do and I help people understand whatever they're doing is what I try to work with.  And I don't carry any conservation terms in and I just go and say, "What are you working on?"  And you'll say, "Well we're working on our CDC [community development corporation], we need economic development," then the question is how can I work with you with the skills that I have at the fund and the resource that we are?  How can we help you realize your economic development goals?  And it'll turn out that it's a conservation project, whatever they're doing, it's connected to conservation.  And so, it's just a matter of taking the time to explain to people exactly what conservation is.  We're all conservationist.
Speaker 2: And is the message resonating in the African--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --American community?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, oh yes.
Speaker 2: How, you say so, so confidently--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --why?
Speaker 1: Well because if you saw my emails that I get from around the country the many articles that have been written since I've taken over as chair, [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley, we've done twice, and numerous magazines.  I can't respond to all of the inquiries I'm getting from people now who've been out there wondering the same thing who are contacting me now.  So it's resonating, it's resonating because, only because I changed the language.  And I do what I call, asset based planning, that is I find out what you're working on, what are your assets in your community.  What's important to you?  And I find out what you're working on, then I work with you on yours and then it's going to be conservation, whatever you're doing is going to be connected to what I'm trying to accomplish.  And that makes it real for you, like I said, lead paint, you're going to say, "Well Charles, I got a health problem to work on and I have no time to work on conservation."  Well, that is, by us solving the lead paint problem that solves my problem and yours.  It's like we look for those kind of opportunities, economic development, if there's economic development and economic growth in that community, it's gonna be a healthy community, you're not gonna have all the pollution and you--the cars are gonna be repaired, hopefully timely so they're not gonna be polluting air.  That's an environmental problem too.  A low income community is an environmental problem as well as a social problem.  So we can work together, and so it's just a matter of taking the time to explain to people and that's what I do 'cause I need that.
Story_ID: 192183
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes in terms of conservation and the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I am hoping that I can turn on enough people, particularly of color, to take a look at this movement and get involved in it, you won't find that many at the highest level in conservation.  It's a great career, let me tell ya, it's a great career and the salaries are healthy too, when you get at the upper level.  We don't have too many people of color at that level.  And so I try to touch as many as I can, and I do, about staying in this field and working their way up, and it's a field that is open.  There are jobs in this field, consider this, because we never did.  Conservation wasn't taught in--around our dinner table, we never heard of conservation.  It--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --was not an alternative--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --but, we talked about agriculture, so to speak, and that kind of thing, many families did and so do you think that it's all somewhat connected and it's just a matter, like you said, just using--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Just connecting--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --different terms?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's all connected it's just a matter of us being able to explain the connection.  We had so many black farmers who lost so much land.  Simply because they were discriminated against, it's been proven in the courts and they won.  Now they're trying to protect their land so for the first time we work with them and other partners to set up the first black family land trust.  The first one in America, it's now operating and they're down in Georgia this week, I think, for their first conference.  And so it's things like that and our staff assisted them in building capacity and working with them.  We own an awful lot of land, I mean; I wish I knew how much land black people own in America, a lot of it down south, a lot of it.  Not doing anything with it.  It was passed on down, you know, and it's owned by maybe fifty members of the family, we're not doing anything with it.  I'm one of those; I pay taxes every year on land that I haven't seen in twenty years.  We own a lot of land so we need to understand the importance of land and what it means now and what can be done with it.  But that is another project, that's a full-time project.
Story_ID: 192184
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about what some of your hopes and concerns are for the African American community in general?
Speaker 2: Right now?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: To respond to the violence in the community and educational system.  Those are the ones.  Get our kids educated, give 'em a fighting chance, and that means that we gotta deal with the violence in the community and you can't rely on law enforcement.  The police department cannot do it.  There's not enough officers to be on every street corner, they just can't do it.  And they can't go out there working by themselves trying to gather evidence.  Our people in the--when I say our people I mean community people, live in inner cities, have got to get involved and they got to say, "This is enough, now you gonna do your dirt, I'm gonna work with the police on this because you are destroying my community, my grandkids are not safe."  We've got to get involved and start saving the lives of our kids.  And we're not doing that and our school systems are not educating our kids, and who's gonna take care of those kids?  There are only three ways they can get what they need.  Someone can give it to them, they can get it, they can pay for it themselves or they gonna take it, and a lot of times they're taking it.  And so we've got to save our communities.  We can't save our cities without saving our kids.  And so I just want us to get involved.
Speaker 1: And in terms of your personal story you speak a lot about the village and how you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you were embraced and raised by the village and do you, do you--would you like to see that come back and do you think that there's a possibility we will see a resurgence of the village?
Speaker 2: No, no, we waited too late.  It won't come back, what we've got to do now is try something new.  And I guess that's another reason why government wasn't doing it for me.  And I don't have the answer to that, that's one of the reasons that I travel and I speak is because I have a chance to ask that question to my audience and to think with them.  I don't go into my engagements with all the answers.  I tell my audience that I wish I knew, I wouldn't be speaking to them if I had the answer, I'd be out making money, you know, doing it.  But together maybe we can--something has got to be done.  We've got to try something new.  But we gotta start with our kids, we gotta save our kids, because see, otherwise you're creating a burden for you later on.  Somebody's got to take care of those kids, somebody's gonna take care of them, and so we need to do something now.  And I don't know what it is, I really don't so I'm still seeking and getting a lot of people who are shaking their heads and saying "Amen."  But, I don't have the answer to that, I wish I had.
Story_ID: 192185
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan, when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: I think the caring, the village working, letting me know I'm--that somebody cares.  And I think that's important because it's very inexpensive.  Kids--that's all some kids need to know, is that somebody cares, that some--that I'm watching and I do care what progress you make, you know, it is important to me. I just--I think that stands out more than anything else because all of my jobs are because other people believed in me, that's why I have them, and why I took them and by taking them I also learned and I grew.  So--but people believed in me.  If no one had ever believed in me, I don't--I didn't have the drive, the initiative to go off and do those things.  I would have been in--I would have retired in Palm Springs [California] as a recreation leader or something, I would have, honestly I would have.  If people hadn't been pushing me and, and the way they pushed me was by bragging on me and, and, you know, and, that does it.  You don't want to let those people down.  And so, I'd just like to see our community get back the way that it used to be and that's the way it was.  Ask your mom.  That's the way it was.  Everybody cared about you and, and that was important, but now, they're afraid to say anything to you because you may curse them out--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --see, and then you better not curse them out 'cause, she would whip you and then when you get home your mother would whip you again.  So--but, I, I think we're just getting a little too detached.  And we're relying too much on others to do it for us.  And teachers, oh gosh, you're talking about a group that needs to be pumped up.  And they try so hard, they're good, the teachers are very good, they want to teach they just are overwhelmed.  They need help, you know, and I really hate that 'cause I just--teachers could do so much if they had the support.
Story_ID: 192186
Speaker 1: For those who are interested in a career in conservation or environmentalism, what advice or what suggestions do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well, don't look out starting--don't look--don't be looking at the bucks because when you first start in conservation it's not--there are not big bucks to you, you have to work your way up and I would say take a look at the field and what they do, and once you find out what they do you'll realize that a lot of that work you can do.  But once you get into the area, because you do bring something unique, you do bring a different perspective you are of value because people of color, seventy-three million strong in America, blacks and brown, a war like the conservation war cannot be won without those seventy-three million people getting involved.  And so, they're gonna need people who can relate to other people.  So you will be of value, so take a look at this field and see the possibilities.
Story_ID: 192187
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: Well, I figure I have twenty-two more years to go, Mia is two and by that time she'll be--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And Mia is your granddaughter?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She will be--by then she'll have her doctorate and be married and then I can relax.  And so I just wanna touch as many people as I can between now and then and let them know that Mia's coming--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and what my expectations are.  And I wanna know what they're telling their Mias because they've gotta live with Mia and the welfare of Mia depends largely on the welfare of their kids.  And I just wanna let them know what I'm telling Mia about the race problem and about other things and how I'm explaining that to her and I want, I wanna make sure they're explaining it right to their kids so that they stand a fighting chance.  Because that's the promise that I made her is that I do love her and therefore I'm gonna give her a fighting chance.
Speaker 1: And is there anything that you've done already that you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: Is there anything that I wish I had done differently?  No, and I think it's probably out of fear because I don't know where it would have taken me.  I know where I am now, I know who I am and I know whose I am.  And therefore, no, I wouldn't take a chance of changing that at all.
Story_ID: 192188
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered, what is it that you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: He cared, yeah, that he really did care.
Story_ID: 192189
Speaker 1: Why do you think that history is important?
Speaker 2: History is important because it's what remains of our past working on our presence to shape our future.  And that's why it's important, you don't have that history it can't work on your past, it can't help where you are, it can't help on your present it can't help where you are right now.  See when I told you I was looking at that book, I'm taking things from way back here and using it now to help shape my future, see, and you need all three, the past, the present in order to shape your future, you gotta have those and that's why history is so important.  If I know where I came from, then I know how I got here then there's a good chance I'll know how to deal with this.  But if I'm just, like most of the generation, young people, who are just born into this generation and they don't look back here, it's hard to explain the present without knowing something about the past.  How can you explain racism if you don't know anything about the past?  I mean, it's--so, that's why history is very important.
Speaker 1: And why do you think it's important for African Americans for us to preserve some of our missing stories and for us to preserve and share our history?
Speaker 2: Well, because America needs it.  America needs to hear that, it's important because it's a good foundation on which we can still build.  I mean it's not old and outdated.  Those foundations of sharing and caring, that was a part of our history that if we could get back to that we will be well served.
Speaker 1: And even sharing stories about the land and that kind of thing are important because a lot of people don't know those stories.
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--That's right and the land is a tremendous opportunity.  It's like if you go to a place where it happened, the story's more meaningful.  That's why we need to preserve these land because we need to take our kids there and say, "You know, it was right where slaves were sold, bought and sold, in this--right here in this spot here."  And then that opens the door for you to talk about other things.  But that's why the place is important, it's not just telling the story in a classroom, it's not the same.  But if you can go there and say, "Yes, over there, that's where the soldiers--there were 5,000 soldiers killed right out in that field, right there, that's the land there."  And you connect them and that's more meaningful to see things like that.
Speaker 1: And do you think that your perspective is shaped by--because you did grow up in a rural area and, you know, had an appreciation for the land?  And then also you had the opportunity to grow up with Native Americans who have a great appreciation and understanding of the land, do you think all that helped to really shape your perspective?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh I'm sure, oh yeah.  We are the sum total of our experiences and that was a part of my experience.  Yes, a little bit of that, oh gosh yes.  That was rich, that was so rich.  Yes, people who've touched me and people who've counseled me and who believed in me.  And seeing the many different cultures and how they lived and--oh yes, oh yes.
Story_ID: 192190
Speaker 1: And what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Or what do you think your legacy is--will be?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's gonna be that he really cared.  I mean, he was sincere, my son [Dion Jordan] and my daughter [Patricia Jordan] and my grandkids when they hear the name [HistoryMaker] Charles [R.] Jordan, they're gonna smile and be proud of it because, "Yep, that was my grandfather."  And I don't think, right now, I really don't think you'll find too many people in the country would say bad things about, about me and I thank God for that.  And I--like I said, it's knowing whose you are, keeps me well-grounded and I'm never lost, never lost.
Story_ID: 192191
Speaker 1: That was in the early '80s [1980s], a lot of the teachers would bring their kids down to my office.  I was a city commissioner then [in Portland, Oregon], I was in elected office, and so kids would come to my office and I would speak to them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That one was in the--around '86 [1986], I was parks and recreation director for the City of Portland.  And that one day I was, my wife [Esther Jordan] came downtown and we went downtown together, I remember the day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For lunch.
Speaker 2: This was next door to my office in downtown Portland, this was in the early '80s [1980s], this young lady was getting married and needed someone to be the best man so I went right next door and was her best man in a marriage.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that one but it looks like I've got a natural so that was, it was at city hall, oh yeah, that was during the winter months.  It was at city hall, that's a citizen who came in and I presented her with a letter of commendation.
Speaker 1: Okay, about what year, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Charles R.] Jordan?
Speaker 2: If I recall that suit, I can tell by that suit, if that's the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --plaid suit.
Speaker 1: --mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This was at a planning session when I just returned from the City of Austin [Texas], we were going through a strategic planning meeting and so you can see on the board back there all of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: --ideas, that had to be, let's see '89 [1989], that had to be about '90 [1990], or '91 [1991].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was in my office as city commissioner so that had to be in the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Earl--yeah late '70s [1970s], that was a realtor who came in and I presented him with an award.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was around '80 [1980], around '90 [1990] Clyde Drexler and I, Clyde was giving a basketball clinic for me.  That's Clyde--back of his head.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Out at one of the community centers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was a group of challenged young people in the '70s [1970s] that came out to the park.  I was parks commissioner and these physically challenged kids were playing that day.
