Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Larry Hawkins and it's L-A-R-R-Y H-A-W-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm looking for Allen [ph.] there, but it's okay.  Yeah, observing is Allen--what was your last name, Allen?
Speaker 2: ALLEN ROGERS:  Rogers [ph.].
Speaker 1: Allen Rogers, right.
Speaker 2: Rogers, um-hm.

Speaker 2: December 12, 1930, Chicago, Illinois, in the Cook County Hospital.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 1: Teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay. And, well, there's more, you know--maybe, if you can give us your title and--
Speaker 1: Well, here, I'm the director of special programs.  And that involves some management aspect, but I think I'm a teacher who's a poor manager, rather than a manager who's a teacher.
Speaker 2: And you're here at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: University of Chicago, yeah, and I've been here for quite a while.
Speaker 2: About forty years, I mean?
Speaker 1: Well, I hate to think of it as (unclear) (laughter) in 1968.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: For a while, I worked for the Board of Education and the University of Chicago on a letter of agreement between the two institutions.  But just recently in '98 [1998], I think, I retired from the board, so I work here now full-time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you, you were a high school teacher and coach, too, at one time?
Speaker 1: Yes, I trained as, I was trained as (unclear) actually, and the work I did was--my kind of groups was sports groups.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 1: This is December 2nd, 2003.
Speaker 2: And just to backtrack a little bit, is Larry your given name?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: And do you have, do you have a middle name?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No name.
Speaker 2: So Larry is not short for Lawrence or anything like that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I used to think it was.  People often say it but I checked that once yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 512751
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they just require a short answer.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, that's tough.  I like Greek food and the--my favorite is the egg-lemon soup and the green beans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those, those are favorites of mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I may have.  I've been wearing maroon for so long, I may think that's it, but I don't know.
Speaker 1: The colors of the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --are the maroons.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I like the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that because that's when school starts or--
Speaker 2: I--that probably is so.  And, and I'm never sure why but I, I love the fall because it's, it's all that gather and bother, and probably because that's the time the basketball season kicks in, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So a long time, that was my motivation in life.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I get there, South of Spain, on the coast of Brava right outside Barcelona.  It's a beautiful place, I love it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, finally, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Students would probably think I do, but I don't know if I do or not.  I always think it's original, but it's probably the same thing I say over different kinds of ways.  Most of my conversation is about students being able to do well.  And so, I guess it's, it's that kind of conversation.  I spoke to a young man yesterday and I was trying to explain to him that I saw something in him that he couldn't see,  And he, of course, told me funny things, but it's that kind of conversation that you're probably better than you think you are.
Story_ID: 512752
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history.  I want, I want to ask you about your mother's side of the family, and your father's side, as much as you can tell us.  And I'm gonna start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: It's Elizabeth Hawkins.
Speaker 1: Is that her--
Speaker 2: Jackson was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1907 in McComb, Mississippi, I think--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think that, but I'm fuzzy about that.
Speaker 1: All right.  What do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Only back to Uncle Bennet [ph.].  I can't describe him to you except the family folklore is that Uncle Bennett had been in the service in World War I [WWI] and got in some difficulty in the town, and was one of those people that was ultimately hanged.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he shot a lot of people before they got him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was in an altercation and was lynched like you say?
Speaker 2: I think that, that's the family talk.  I, I don't, I see nothing to say that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do they tell, do they tell why--I mean, what happened or anything?
Speaker 2: No, just I hear them talk about it.
Speaker 1: But there was a shootout and he, he was fighting back?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, he just got in his house and wasn't going to come out.  They had to come and get him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Any, any stories about what the family was doing in the nineteenth century during the slavery days and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, I don't go back that far.  They were sharecroppers.  And they came North in that big rush right after the, the First World War.  I guess they were in here by 19-, 19-, 1920.  I don't know the exact time but they came North.  And my father [Will Hawkins] worked at, you know, labor jobs.  And my mother stayed home or did day work, they called it, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --worked for other people in their homes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, I, I'm going to ask you about your father in a minute, but I just wanted to know if there were any other stories about your mother's side of the family and what they were doing.
Speaker 2: Not, not a lot that I recall.  They, you know, they lived their life in the town where they were and, and here I am.
Story_ID: 512753
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your mother [Elizabeth Hawkins].   Did she have a chance to go to school and that sort of thing when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That is a, an interesting story.  My mother went to school and because she did reasonably well at it, she was in one of those one-room school houses and she was a teacher for a while.  And, I suppose that stuck in my head a lot that, that what's she did.  I, I don't know what the circumstances were.  I never questioned that.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she, I guess, had a high school equivalency at least to be able to teach, right?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I, I think she, she would have, but it was such a different world.  It was hard for me to know exactly how it went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I suppose my conversations with her were about other things, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever visit McComb [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: I have recently but and I'm sure I went when I was small.  I do have some vague recollections of being run out of chicken houses and things, but that's, that's about it.  But we used to go south during the summer like most of the families.
Story_ID: 512754
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father's side of the family.  What, what was your father's, what's your--well, can, can you give, give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Will Hawkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know much of his side of the family and I'm trying to be sure.  They, they both came from roughly the same area.  I think he's out of Liberty [Mississippi] but I, I'm not fast on that.  I may be flip-flopping both of them in my mind's eye, but they were in those two towns that they came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they--my father, I only know him as being married to my mother.  I didn't know much about his side of the family and I don't recall any conversations about that.  I'm sure there were some.  I just wasn't aware.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you don't know much about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Story_ID: 512755
Speaker 1: Well, no stories passed down?  Did you know your grandparents on your father's [Will Hawkins] side?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Elizabeth Hawkins] grandparents, yeah.
Speaker 1: Your, your mother's, but not your--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now I, I--my grandfather, I don't want to call him papa.  I think he was Baltimore Jackson and he was a kind of guy of means.  He, he was a hardworking man.  And he was kind of the part of Humilis, the, the head of the family.  And for a long time, we, we stayed with him and my grandmother.  And what I remembered about him is him and his friend, Mr., oh, Shepherd [ph.].  They played checkers all the time.  And sometimes the family would go out to the movie or something, but I preferred to watch those guys.  And I don't, I have no idea why, but I really, you know, grown on to my grandfather 'cause my father passed when I was fairly young.  And he used to tell me about calling figures.  And I forgot that after a period of time, but it's probably why I ended up the square dance caller because it's something that he did, that he used to talk about.  I used to hear him and Mr. Shepherd talk about it all the time.
Speaker 1: Like calling square dances?
Speaker 2: Calling figures, yeah.
Speaker 1: Calling figures, they call it?
Speaker 2: That's what they--he called it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, but they're the square dance caller.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's something I never heard before.  Can you do any square dance calling now?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I do some.
Speaker 1: Give, give us an, an example of what you, of what they would do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Square dance calling)  You know, that, it's that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I ain't gone in a little bit.  But I haven't been for a long time, but for a period of time, I was a very active caller.  As a matter of fact, I spent some summers in Europe working for the German government.
Speaker 1: As a square, as a square dance caller?
Speaker 2: A square dance caller, um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Folk and square dance teacher.
Speaker 1: What it says, too, is about life in those days.  I mean, I think people now perceive--I guess, music as being--I mean it's hard for them to imagine, you know, black people in the South in a rural setting is square dancing, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was something that was done--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --quite a bit.
Speaker 2: It was done quite a bit in tunes like 'Cotton-Eyed Joe,' and those kinds of things were about black folks dancing.  I see often in, in some movies of, of those kinds of times--people dancing, carrying on, but that's what my papa did, yeah.
Story_ID: 512756
Speaker 1: My grandmother was another kind of person.  Molly Jackson, she was, she was a strong person, very strong.  They were two strong people.  And that's, that's, you know, as I talk about it, I hadn't thought about it for a long time.  But she came through the transition from where she lived to here and, and, and carried on her life.  And my grandfather died maybe, oh, ten years before she did and, you know, she was still that person in the family.  She was with us when she fell ill and, and passed.  And she used to tell me stories that, what I know about our family, she would tell me from time to time as we talked to her.  You know, she lay in the bed.  She was a--well, I admired her.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you, do you remember any, any, any of the stories that she told?
Speaker 1: No.  That's what I was kind of rolling around in the back of my head.  She only told me about herself as a girl.  And she made me understand how important the church was and what she was doing.  And--
Speaker 2: Did she grow up in in the nineteenth century?  I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, early in the nineteenth century.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And just, from time to time, talked about her life.  And she was at a stage in her illness where she was in and out.  It's something, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, you seemed to have an affinity for older people.  Did you, did you, when you were young, did you, you know, often hang around with older people and listen to what they--
Speaker 1: Some, not a lot.  Mostly I was wandering around looking at all things.  But in college, I did some work in geriatrics, and I began to understand some things I didn't understand before about the whole side of a life that everybody's going to get to that point.  And so, it just turned me a different way.  And I was--what they were doing, like my father, my grandfather, and Mr. Shepherd [ph.] would play checkers.  And they would talk and carry on and, of course, what they were being were men, and that's what I was learning with them, I think.  And, you know, they used me as a gopher--go here, get that, go here, and get that, go here, and get that.  But, yeah, I've--maybe you've put your finger on it.  I like to be around people that you learn specific things from.  And from those guys 'cause I, like my, my papa, you know, I just love--it was just nice being around them--this comfortable feeling.  Maybe that's it.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: I felt comfortable and safe and all those things you feel.
Story_ID: 512757
Speaker 1: Now, your, your father [Will Hawkins], tell us something about your father.  Now, what, what was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: Well, he was, he was a good man.  He was a laborer and he worked at different kinds of jobs.  And you're now depending on a rather shaky memory, of course.  He looked after his family.  And I don't remember him being anything but, you know, he would pop upside the head if we were out of line, but I felt he was a kind and gentle man, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how I remember him but I was maybe ten or eleven when he died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 512758
Speaker 1: Now did the family move to Chicago [Illinois] after he [Hawkins' father, Will Hawkins] died or before?
Speaker 2: Before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unless--
Speaker 1: How old were you when the family decided to move?  Or, did, did they move before you were born?
Speaker 2: It was before I was born, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, before, right.
Speaker 2: --'cause I was born in the, in the '30s [1930s] and they must have been a few years before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So maybe in the early '30s [1930s] or something, they moved up or--you figured it was before then?
Speaker 2: Maybe, I think a little before that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Before then, okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was before that.  I'm just not certain.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They basically moved up for better opportunities?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that it?
Speaker 2: In, in that whole rush of people to come to what the one guy called the promised-land, you know.
Speaker 1: Did the lynching of your uncle have anything to do with the exit from the South (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  No, that, that was, as I said, a story in our family from quite aways away, you know.  And we--I don't know this for a fact because, again, this is not the kind of thing I talked to my folks about.  But I think they came because there were better jobs and because that was a period of time when I guess they invented the cotton picking machine, and there wasn't a great need for laborers in the field anymore.
Story_ID: 512759
Speaker 1: All right, well, tell me about growing up.  Now you grew up in Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were the, what was your neighborhood like, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Duke Ellington's 'Black and Tan Fantasy' was the theme of a black radio show and I remember that clearly 'cause you hear it all the time.  And where I'm conscious of being here is when we lived at 3218 St. Lawrence [Chicago, Illinois] because two streets came together, and there was a house sitting right on the point.  And I always thought that was an interesting thing that a house was, was like that.  This was around--I think it was on this side of town around Ellis, but it's down around 31st Street.  And I had an older brother and he was who I kind of followed around and did things and watched him to see what he was doing.
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have and what are their--
Speaker 2: I only have one that's still living, my sister.  But I had an older brother, and my mother told me that I had--sometime before I was born, three other brothers, I think, that passed.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But it was, it was wandering around from one lot or alley to another doing what kids did, playing or however we were doing.  And then we moved from that part of town over to 30th and Prairie.  It's--if you know where Dunbar High School [Dunbar Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] is, our house was right in the middle of the, of the park behind Dunbar.  And that's where, I think I grew to be, you know, went through teenage years and, and to be a young man.  I stayed there a long time.
Speaker 1: That's right near the lake, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, it's not as close as the St. Lawrence was, but it was, it's, it's close enough to walk.  And in, on a summer morning you could stand in the middle of the street and look over into the lake, which is always an interesting thing for me.  In that particular neighborhood on 30th Street, there was a church there, Hartzell [United] Methodist Church--had a big gym on the side of it, but it hadn't been used for years because it's one of those institutional church groups.  And when the, when the neighborhood turned black, there was a period of time when the gym wasn't used.  And then a guy named Golden B. Darby came to town.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: Golden--
Speaker 1: Oh, Golden, okay.
Speaker 2: Golden, yeah, G-O-L-D-E-N, B., Darby, D-A-R-B-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a part of something called the Chicago Area Project.  And they came to organize communities, and he was the one that ran something called the Southside Community Committee where my community was.  And they sent a local worker there to help organize the community.  And the way they did it was to open up that gym, to get the gym, and to put it in order.  The guy who came there turned out to be a person who had a very strong influence on my life, Alexander H. McDade.  We went in and cleaned the place up and painted it, and used it for everything.  It became the community center.  It was out of there that I got into basketball and all other kinds of things that we did.  We went camping--did a lot of different things.  And I spent more time there in sports things than some other kids did, so it probably influenced me a lot more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Mac influenced us a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Alexander--
Speaker 2: McDade.
Speaker 1: McDade.
Speaker 2: M-C-D-A-D-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was an interesting guy but his work was to get parents and students and, you know, the community to start talking about what they felt were things they needed to correct in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was doing community organizing and the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was connected to the big (unclear), you had for most of the families there--is he could go down to the station and, and intercede for you if you got into trouble because through the Chicago Area Project, he was tied into the courts, so that his word carried a lot of weight.  For a lot of guys in our neighborhood, you know, he kept them on the street.
Speaker 1: That's an important connection.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was.
Story_ID: 512760
Speaker 1: But the, the center of the project [Chicago Area Project, CAP], and the center of the project all over the city [Chicago, Illinois] was, was using sport to bring youngsters together, and then doing whatever you had to do to help them to do other things.  So we played basketball and football and softball, and such things.  And at that time, this is '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].  Softball is a very, a very big game.  That was before television came in, so that on any Sunday, right in that field out there, Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois]--it was a big vacant lot near a factory.  And you'd have three or 400 people lined up on each side of the sidelines looking at guys play ball, softball.
Speaker 2: Now Dunbar wasn't there in those days, right?
Speaker 1: No, Dunbar is on 44th and St. Lawrence.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a kinda little cracker box school.
Speaker 2: Was Dunbar a high school then?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But it was, it was at 44th and St. Lawrence?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it--44th, 40th, it's in that vicinity.  But it was a part of another school, I believe.  It was stuck on another elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But Dunbar is a high school.  Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois], and those are pretty much schools that blacks attended.
Speaker 2: Now, that neighborhood in those days was more densely populated than it is now, I, I believe, right--
Speaker 1: Which part, the--
Speaker 2: --I mean, in terms of--where, where you grew up near, near Dunbar of the area that's now Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois].  And all that wasn't there, right?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It was like--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Those were--
Speaker 1: No, no, it was--the, the--you'd take out the projects and put in a lot of ramshackle houses.  And you take out Lake Meadows and put in a lot of ramshackled houses.  That's pretty much what your neighborhood would look like.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: So, yes, fewer people there.  It was, it was an interesting place to grow up.
Speaker 2: Did--were, were the neighbors calling it Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] in those days?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Well, some people--
Speaker 1: It just--
Speaker 2: Well, some people call it the black belt and they call it--
Speaker 1: The, the black belt I know in the South Side and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: So the people that live here on the South Side or the West Side, those are the two places you live.  And the South Side went roughly from about 26th Street to 51st, from Cottage Grove to maybe State.
Story_ID: 512761
Speaker 1: Now, were, were gangs a problem in those days?  Did you have that kind of an issue?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were gangs, but mostly, it was people fighting, fist fights.  You know, the news would be is there would be a gang outside.  I went to Douglas School [Stephen Douglas Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] which is here on 32nd and Giles.  And the gang at that time was Tornados--I think they call themselves.  And, periodically, there'd be some big brouhaha for some reason, and they'd all line up out there.  And, of course, we lined up 'cause it looked like a show, you know, 'cause nobody is shooting at anybody.  They were just fighting.  And that was good unless they came your way and then you kinda got out of there, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that was a, that was, that was what gangs did.  Mostly teams--maybe a fellow into doing negative things from time to time but they were sports associations more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot more--there were social clubs but it was generally the social athletic club.
Story_ID: 512762
Speaker 1: All right.  We were talking about the neighborhood and growing up.  And we--what kind of a little kid were you when you were growing up and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I liked sports, but I liked to read.  And so, I read, I read all I could find.  I spent a lot of time in the library.  The public library [Chicago Public Library Central Library] down in Chicago [Illinois] was downtown Chicago was kind of an interesting place for me.  But I liked sport so, you know, I did that kind of thing.  And hardly enough, I liked school, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not--didn't ever get into much because my older brother wouldn't allow it.  You know, he was a guy that was in everything himself, so he didn't allow much happening anywhere else.  And I suppose that particular neighborhood was a good place for that to happen, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the, the heavies in the neighborhood would be assured that I did whatever it is they thought I should do.
Story_ID: 512763
Speaker 1: All right.  Now you, you went to Stephen Douglas School [Stephen A. Douglas Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to Douglas Elementary School, and then to Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  That pretty much says how you did it, then you went to your neighborhood schools.  There weren't as many choices as there are now.
Speaker 1: And so, if you were really, really academically advanced, you didn't have a choice of going to a magnet school or anything like that?
Speaker 2: There wasn't anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that you just went to the next school.  And you'd hope that you had good teachers there but, but what it also meant in the school is that you had a lot of really bright people in the school because everybody in that neighborhood went.  And just by the luck of the draw, you'd have some awfully bright people there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember one of our schoolmates in algebra.  The university campus--we plucked him out and he came over here at about fourteen years old, you know, then went straight through 'cause he was, he was really a bright guy.
Speaker 1: And today, we have a situation where the brightest students are--
Speaker 2: All are conglomerate in one place.
Speaker 1: --taken out of, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It does something odd to the school that they don't go to.  You know, it makes it a different kind of atmosphere there.  But in that time, the neighborhood was such that everybody lived in it, and the schools were such that everybody went to them, the high schools.  Unfortunately, sometimes the counselors weren't very encouraging and but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, guys made it out.  The city colleges saved a lot of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they were city colleges in the neigh-, I mean a city college in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What--they called them junior colleges at the time and that's how they acted.  It was where you went before you went to the four-year school, but it was just as academic.  And there was a lot less career development.  It was mostly academic where Wilson [Woodrow Wilson Junior College, Chicago, Illinois], which is now Kennedy-King [College], was where I went.  It only costs ten bucks to go and your books, you know, and coffee and lunch, if you could handle that.  And graduating from there, then I was better able to get off to another kind of school
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your fav-, your favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: I work and to try to remember that.  I want to say reading because I do like to read, but that may be it, reading, hated writing, but reading was a good subject.  And, of course, I loved sport.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I loved music.  I almost forgot that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At one time, that's what I'd thought I'd do in life.
Speaker 1: Did you play an instrument when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Just sing.
Speaker 1: Just sing, okay.  Did you have a good voice--I mean, a good singing voice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But just somehow drifted away from it.

Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers at Douglas [Stephen A. Douglas Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] that you remember?
Speaker 2: Ms. Jackson [ph.], I remember her.  She, she took us all one day to Metropolitan Church [Greater Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], and I had never really seen anything like that.  And I was in the fifth grade.  You know, Metropolitan has got a lot of whites, brick stone, and such things along Wabash and 50th so.  And it was just a whole new world for me, you know, and she wandered all over with us.  She did it all her life.  As I was working here, she had a group of little cheerleaders.  And it was very unlikely that Mrs. Jackson would be a cheerleader sponsor but she was.  And she had them lined up, and I'd see them all over the city everywhere 'cause they had a good coach on the account of Chuck Frazier.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they really did a lot with those little kids from Douglas but Ms., Mrs. Jackson was the teacher.  Another teacher that impressed me was Web-, is her name Webster [ph.]?  She didn't impress me enough for me to remember her name--Beasley, Ms. Beasley [ph.], 'cause her son was in high school with me.  She was a good teacher, she was the eighth grade teacher.  And I'm sure I had some other good teachers in elementary school, but those two kinda stand out.
Story_ID: 512765
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big factor in your life growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I had to go each Sunday.  When we lived on St. Lawrence, I went to Olivet [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] which is on 31st and King Drive.  And then at 30th Street, I went to Allen Temple [AME Church, Chicago, Illinois] which they just tore down unfortunately--
Speaker 1: Both--
Speaker 2: --on 30th and Dearborn.
Speaker 1: Now those are two different denominations, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Olivet's is a Baptist church and that was the home church of Joseph Jackson--
Speaker 2: That's Rev. Jackson, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who's the head of the National Baptist Convention, you know, eventually anyway.  I don't know if he was head of it when you were coming up or not--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.
Speaker 1: He was, okay.
Speaker 2: But it had another fascination for me.  It was there that I learned about square dancing.  One of the teachers at the gym--in order for us to play basketball, which I wanted to do, they had a big room.  They put up a basket in it.  We had to square dance, and that was not something we wanted to do but we did it and, of course, I'm glad I did.
Story_ID: 512766
Speaker 1: Now, this is something I've heard before.  And I, you know, if you're not from Chicago [Illinois] and you're not of a certain age, you don't know about this.  But square dancing was a big deal in those days, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We had--they were, in fact, they're still some people that do it--heck of a job.  But we had maybe six or seven real good callers that had groups.  I had a group that met in my basement once a week.  We danced and we went around the country to different places where other blacks were dancing, you know, to conventions and that kind of thing.  It was a--what the, the--what is it, Texas kick dancing, whatever they call it, line dancing.  It's pretty much an outgrowth of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We would call them round dances--where your American dances, couple dances were round dances.  And if they were international, we'd call it folk dances, yeah.  But a lot of little tricky steps and it was a nice way to do an evening.  And for a period of time, if you could do that kind of work and especially in George Williams [George Williams College, Chicago, Illinois], that was something that they promoted, that people would hire you to come to parties to do that as a student.  So, yeah, it was, it was a big thing.
Speaker 1: Now, music otherwise, I mean, other than the square dancing, was music a--well, you, you sang, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know--
Speaker 2: And, and sang with choirs from time to time.  I liked the harmony and the, the feeling.  But I, I like jazz and, eventually, as it came to be, I liked Latin music because we all danced that kind of dance so, and I had a real hit with the Cuban types and what they did.
Story_ID: 512767
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Now you went to Phillips, right?  Phillips, I think, was one of the first high schools that black students could attend, right, in the City of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I believe it was.
Speaker 1: No, it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, that's way before your time though.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  At that time I was there, a woman named Bousfield [Maudelle Tanner Brown Bousfield] was the principal.  And she was kind of an interesting person.  It--
Speaker 1: Was she black or white?
Speaker 2: She was black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a, it--the school was crowded.  They had lots of people, you know, because we were going 'til 4:00 o'clock in afternoon.  When you're a freshman, you were there from about 10:00 o'clock 'til about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: Did they have you all in two shifts or something?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  They had a lot of kids start out, and not so many finish.  But at the time that I was there, they were still teaching Latin and full mathematics up to algebra, trig, and you were expected to, to take, you know, those kinds of courses.  Now, of course, you can (unclear) into clothing or other kinds of things but for, for--academically, you could probably do what you wanted to do.  Chemistry and physics were subjects that people got into.  I remember a classmate of mine also at (unclear) physics teacher, but he came out of that same milieu.  He was a football player, and I was a basketball player, but that's--but we pretty much--(unclear) you get your lessons.  We did.
Story_ID: 512768
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you, you started playing basketball at the recreation center right at Hartzell [United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  What position did you play in basketball?
Speaker 2: Well, I was tall, as this tall, and weighed about pounds, so I was always in the center (laughter) at the time.  Our first game, the first big game in the center, we played, we didn't do very well at all (laughter).  But we played a lot, continued to play.  Now we played basketball during basketball season, softball during softball season.  But I played at the school.  I went to high school [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I got into basketball.  I thought I was going to play both football and basketball, but during the years that I was there, Buddy Young [Claude "Buddy" Young] was playing football.  And I went out for about a couple of days' practice.  And after he got through knocking me a flip every direction, I figured maybe basketball (laughter) was a much better sport.  And I played there for, for three years.
Speaker 1: Buddy Young, now, he was a phenomenal player from what I've heard.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he--
Speaker 1: I mean, from what I've heard.
Speaker 2: --he was.
Speaker 1: He was very short, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  But he's, you know, strong guy--moved.  That's when they had those phenomenal track teams 'cause Buddy and those guys could move, you know.  They were, they were quick, they were strong, and it worked in football.  We had good football teams.  The basketball team was All right, didn't break the bank.  We played pretty much in the city.  Every now and then, we'd go off to Gary [Indiana] or somewhere to play so it'd be a nice outing.  And, ironically, we'd go to Altgeld [Gardens] to play.  We always went to Altgeld to play, Carver [High School, later, Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And, invariably, we would miss the bus coming back, 'cause we're on public transportation.  And after a while, the bus stops running there because the bus had to come 130, come back in the city.  We had to bum rides then.
Speaker 1: That's a long way.  That's 100 blocks away from home.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --basically, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  It was, it was a good run.  And the irony was, of course, that I worked there for so long--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that same place that they used to get us in.  I think high school was enjoyable.  I liked it.
Story_ID: 512769
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, were you involved in high school [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] activities, like student council and that sort of thing?  And did you--
Speaker 1: Some committees but mostly, I was in the gym or out in the field somewhere.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And most of it, the, the work that I did--that would be like student government I did at Hartzell [United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because they had meetings all over the city with different kinds of people and I was really tied very strongly into that part.
Speaker 2: So you took a leader, a youth leadership role at the community center?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was one of those guys they sent places 'cause I'd go.  You know, everybody wouldn't go.  But I got to meet a lot of different people from around the city because at the time, the Southside Community Committee was, was made up of a lot of different ethnic groups.  They had the South Chicago group which is Hispanic, and then, of course, a Chinese group.  And I think they had--JPI was a Jewish group, so we got to, you know, mix a lot.  At least I did in going around to those places.
Speaker 2: So, okay, that, that, so CAP [Chicago Area Project] established the Southside Community Committee--is that what you're saying, or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, actually, it was Chicago--the, the, what is it before Chicago Area Project did--it was, was it Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Institute--is the Institute for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency [sic, Institute for Juvenile Research].  It's over around 12th Street.  And the whole idea came out of that, and it came--it was a branch out of a guy, of a university professor named Shaw [Clifford R. Shaw] who put this together.  And he worked with Saul Alinsky to look at how to, how to organize communities and to, and to make them functional, not on paper, but actually which was a good thing.  And the person that did that--I think was the, the South Chicago Organization Community Committee, they call them.  And it was organized around sport and things that kids did.  And then as they got larger, they got more of them.  And then the Southside Community Committee was the one that I was a part of, had an organization on 51st Street, and one on 26th Street, and one on 41st Street, and the one there on 30th Street.  And we were kinda in a loose league, and we played just some kind of championship and basketball and softball.  And no, we didn't get into track and field.  I was sorry we didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay now did the, did those youth, as a youth leader, did, did you all address youth issues in the community, too, or did you--
Speaker 1: In, in some instances, I felt that the idea was to get to know about other folk.  That's what I thought it was, and to bring information back to the people in the community about what was going on.  And it wasn't, you know, it wasn't the kind of thing that was highly organized 'cause you met all the time, but you just periodically would be with some small groups of kids from other places.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember we used to go up to Camp Kiwanis--a bunch from two or three different kinds of groups.  And the whole idea was to see if they could rub off some of the edges.  And I, I think it was successful to some degree.
Story_ID: 512770
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you have a sense of what you wanted to do as a career, you know, when you graduated?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Did you consider, did you think you were gonna go to college when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that we needed some money at my house, and I was really thinking about getting a job.  But I remember talking to Mr. [Alexander H.] McDade at one point, just after I graduated.  And he asked me, you know, well, where are you going to college?  And it just really had never been a thing in my mind.  And my mother [Elizabeth Hawkins] told me about it, but I, I just thought I needed to work.  But I thought about it some and got up to Wilson [Woodrow Wilson Junior College, Chicago, Illinois] and got in.  And, I guess, just went through the process from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have any scholarship offers to play basketball anywhere or--
Speaker 2: No, there was--some of the, the schools in the South were interested in some of the players from the North, but it was not anything that was--it was not anything that I thought a lot about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you didn't imagine yourself going down South to school or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: A lot of guys did but that wasn't anything I'd thought about.
Speaker 1: Now, now when did you graduate from Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: In 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: At the mid-year, they had mid-year, and summer graduation is in--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then you went on to Wilson Junior College directly?
Speaker 2: Wilson, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went there and I stayed for a year.  And then I did get a job at Carson's when they first started hiring black kids.
Speaker 1: Where is this?
Speaker 2: Carson's--
Speaker 1: Oh, Carson's?
Speaker 2: --Pirie Scott, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --Carson's, Carson Pirie?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, they had a big move.  A guy named Chuck--what, I'm trying to think of Chuck's last name.  At any rate, at an administrative level, he, he pushed along with other people in the city to get Carson's to hire blacks.  So I worked in the men's store for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after a while of that--
Speaker 1: Did, did you have a sales position or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, I was running shirts up and down the elevator.
Speaker 1: Okay, stock--
Speaker 2: Yeah, stock.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were going to school and working at Carson's?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were, were you playing basketball at Wilson?
Speaker 2: I played at Wilson for a while but then stopped when I went away.  And when I came back to Wilson, I didn't play.  I just grad- you know, I wanted to finish and get out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 512771
Speaker 1: Now, how'd you end up at George Williams College [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, that's where Mac [Alexander H. McDade] went to school.  And I knew nothing about it, of course, 'cause it was right down on 53rd Street, 53rd and Drexel [Chicago, Illinois].  But he suggested that--well, let me back up a little bit.  One of the things I did with McDade, because I kinda followed him around a lot, was to go when he went to talk to families.  And he'd asked me to keep notes and things.  Of course, I had no idea of what I was doing.  I think the idea was--he was letting me see what it is he did.  And at a point where we talked about going on to school, because by the time I got out of the community college, I didn't know I wanted to go on.  He was suggesting that you ought to go to George Williams--that's the school.  And that's, you know, that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a school for group workers, and that's, and I think Mac had had some training there.  He'd had some training with some of the people in the Chicago Area Project, and that's what he told me, that, that gave me an idea that'd be a good place to go for me.
Speaker 1: Now, George Williams is in, was in West Castle [ph.] or is it--
Speaker 2: No, now, it's in Aurora University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It--the history is it was founded in Wisconsin at Williams Bay by the Wisconsin YMCA Secretaries Group and it was there for a long time.  Then in 1915, they put a branch down here on 53rd [Street, Chicago, Illinois] and Drexel [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  But then, they kinda went round and round and at one point, they decided to leave the city and moved on to Downers Grove [Illinois], and there, the college went bankrupt.  And they were then taken over by Aurora University which is where they are now.  But the Wisconsin campus is still there and we still use it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the Wisconsin campus is still George Williams or has it changed names or what?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's still George Williams College now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 512772
Speaker 1: Well, tell, tell me about George Williams [George Williams College, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, there was another of those interesting experiences.  It was a small school about five hundred people, maybe six hundred.  And their philosophy was that you had to work in the field that you were studying in so you'd understand it.  So they had us all in different places all around the city while we were going to school.  But it was there that I learned a whole set of things about working with groups and how you handled them.  And where I came across a man named Karl Zerfoss, and I think that's F-O-S-S--
Speaker 1: Can you spell, yeah.
Speaker 2: Z-E-R-F-O-S-S.  He would, he'd been a former basketball player, came out of Georgia, and wrote some papers that we talked about, 'cause it was the first time I was in a place where you could go by your instructor's house and sit and have dinner with him and talk about things.  You know, because that--it was that kind of atmosphere, so that this guy wrote the guidance point of view for coaches.  And, of course, that started my thinking in that direction that coaches might be able to do something other than just win games while they're working with young kids.  But he was a favorite teacher of mine, but I had a lot of good teachers there.  There was a guy named Fenszemacher [ph.] who was, who argued, you have to be a professional like other professionals or they'll, they won't treat you like one.  And he argued that to people who wanted to go into physical education.  And the, the real heavy there was Arthur Steinhaus, who in physiology, was, you know, respected around the world.  So, in that college, you had to take enough science to go to medical school.  A lot of kids did.  We had about six courses we had to take.  There were, there were people in other aspects that were good--swimming, (unclear).  It was just a staff that was good only because you could get to know them.  There were several ways that you got to know them.  And it wasn't the teacher over there and you're over here.
Story_ID: 512773
Speaker 1: One of the real things that happened at George Williams [George Williams College, Chicago, Illinois] is I was introduced to volleyball.  And, you know, I just--not that it ever occurred to me before--I mean, guys playing volleyball.  And George Williams was, in one year, won the, the national championship.  That was before volleyball became a big sport.  And because it was such a little bitty school, everybody kinda had to get into it.
Speaker 2: Now, now what year is this?
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: George Williams College--
Speaker 1: --Fifty-one [1951], '51 [1951] or '52 [1952].  I can get the exact date.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they had a terrific team there at that time.  And Chicago [Illinois] was the center of volleyball because this is the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  It was an YMCA activity.  And the, the YMCA, the Hyde Park Y, which is now a shopping center, was where a lot of ball playing came out--there and the Division Street Y.  So that they had terrific volleyball players, and if you read the history of volleyball, you'll see names of people in there all the time.
Story_ID: 512774
Speaker 1: George Williams [George Williams College, Chicago, Illinois] is also where I met two people, two friends that stayed with me a long time.  We--well, one passed.  The other, we're still friends.  It was Casey Clark [ph.] who lived in Gary [Indiana], you know, a white fellow from Gary.  And for whatever reason, we came fast friends and have been through the years.  We've worked on projects back and forth and it's--he, it was an interesting experience knowing him.  You know, I'm still--as a matter of fact, I owe him an email.  And another fellow was Henry Hall [ph.] who's like me, an African American guy.  He's from Tennessee and we may have been all alter egos, but we were friends until he died, prematurely, I think.  And he must have been about thirty-five or so when he passed, but he was terrific at this work--youth work.  He, he taught in elementary school.  And he was a person that I got to talk over whatever I was doing with my group.  And he talked about what he was doing with his group, so we were, we were just close friends, real close friends.  So that, this is what George Williams, in addition to, I think, some teachers who are unusual and have given me a view about how teachers should be--those guys.  And then, there were a lot of other friends I had that came out of there.  There were not a lot of African Americans there, but we were kind of molded into a group as it were.
Story_ID: 512775
Speaker 1: Now, did George Williams [George Williams College, Chicago, Illinois] have kind of an activist atmosphere?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: In terms of, you know, doing community outreach work and so forth?
Speaker 2: Community outreach work is what they all did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They worked in Boys Clubs, high schools, elementary schools, YMCAs, those kind of places.  And they were recreational leaders, youth workers, coaches--those are the kind of things that came out of there.
Speaker 1: And you, you were saying and that you started looking at coaching in a different way.  You were taught something about coaching that was a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Well, that was, yeah, there was this guy, Zerfoss, Dr. [Karl] Zerfoss, who--I remember the first pap-, paper I wrote.  He told me, he said, I know you can do better than that.  He was right.  I tried to write it ten minutes before class as usual.  And came to be a guy that I spent a lot of time and gained a lot of respect for.  But his writings argued that coaches had a role beyond teaching the physical aspect of what they did, that their role was that of the, the counselor coach as it were.  And some of his writings, I find--well, I got to see, I haven't done--don't know where they are now, but he was writing back in 1990 about those kinds of ideas.  And it's the basic idea that I argue for right now--that coaches have a function, if it's properly done, that can aid in the positive development of young people.  It can cause them to want to do things different than they have been doing.  And it can inspire them to be, not only good citizens, but good students.
Story_ID: 512776
Speaker 1: Now, your college life was interrupted by a [U.S.] military stint?
Speaker 2: Right, went off to the military.
Speaker 1: When was this and what happened?
Speaker 2: In '53 [1953], I was drafted.  I think I didn't send the paper back 'cause I was in the reserves.  That was during the time when, you know, they weren't mad about it, but if you didn't send things back, then they sent you a nice letter saying come down to visit.  So--I went off to Fort--what was it, it's in Kansas.  I can't remember a thing.
Speaker 1: Fort Riley?
Speaker 2: Riley, yeah, the great Fort Riley, that was Riley.  I trained down there, and then ended up being in a permanent party in a replacement unit to "repple depple" [replacement depo] where we sent people back and forth.  And I stayed there in what was then called Camp Funston as a part of Fort Riley until they closed it.  They decided to close it.  We were all given a little time to see if we could find some place to land, and so I was able to get up to Fort Sheridan [Illinois] and--
Speaker 1: That's just north of Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's just north of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's up near Ravinia.  I was there for about six or eight months, and then the--it was a big crisis in Formosa [Taiwan].  And so, the thought was to send people to Formosa.  And I got caught in that sweep and was sent to the West coast, and ultimately to Formosa.  But on the West coast again, because I was able to understand the Army gobbledygook and to type pretty carefully, I went over to volunteer in the, their placement office which is the office that sent you right you were going.  So I was able to hang around there for a while until they got a levy, you know, an order to send some people to Okinawa [Islands of Japan].  I got on that levy.  It went through Formosa but on to Okinawa.  And I had really about eight months there that were phenomenal.  I ended up as a chaplain's assistant.  And Chaplain Fleming [ph.], he's a Mormon, and he was interested in sport.  And because I played all kinds of things, we got along very well.  Well, he was interested in sport and somebody could type his sermons correctly, so that I spent my time there in Okinawa until we ended up--well, I played football which was not very productive.  And then I ran track which is equally unproductive.  And in basketball, we, we were runner-ups in the Far East championship and got to play around and, you know, in the Far East a little bit.  And then in volleyball, which was a sport I learned at George Williams [George Williams College, Chicago, Illinois], we won and came back to the states to play.  And because by then, my time was so short that there was no point to go back.  So I came back to, to North Chicago, and mustered out of the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was, this was an interesting ride.
Speaker 1: So, how long were in, in the Army?
Speaker 2: Two years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a few months.
Speaker 1: So you came back in '55 [1955]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you went back to George Williams College, and to continue?
Speaker 1: Right, and finished in '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 512777
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, then I--a friend of mine named Ben Blewett [ph.], who was one of the guys in the neighborhood, was working at Carver High School [later, Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And he knew I was graduating and told me that the coach at this school had just passed, and they were looking for a physical education teacher.  So I went to apply and was accepted and got cleared with the local Board of Education.  And I went to Carver, and that began another adventure that was different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was--now Carver is on the far South Side of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: It was in Altgeld Gardens.
Speaker 1: That's a housing project.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was a housing project.  It was originally built for war workers, I think, for those steel mills out there.  But it was a housing project and at the time, the Chicago Housing Authority had an interesting approach to this whole thing.  It was a nice garden area.  It was like a small town.  People knew each other and there was an established kind of order because people had lived there for a while.  It was a terrific place to be.  The high school was located at the edge of the, the project.  It was never a very big high school, about five or 600, 700 kids.  And I was dropped there.  And basketball, of course, still my interest and I, of course, that was what I did--was a basketball coach, as well as the physical education teacher.  And the kind of experience there that was interesting is I worked with a woman named June McLaren [ph.] who had been a classmate of mine at Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  She--we, we both worked in the same gym, worked out of the same office.  So, I think she helped me to understand that, you know, everybody had to have some time in the gym because she did the cheerleaders, and I did the basketball team.  And we would argue and fuss about who would have time, but we eventually worked it out. And it was helpful later when it got to be more imperative that we share.  And I already had the idea, you know, that you had--we had to take the kids to the library or for a pep talk or something, so she could have the gym so she could work that out.  But my first experiences at Carver were, were pretty good, and then it just kept getting better and better and better.  And one year, a fellow named Carl Dennums [ph.] bought me a group of students who were in his eighth grade class.  Now, Carver was kinda half high school and half upper grade center.  On one side of the school is seventh and eighth grades, so on the other side was the high school.  That sounds smaller--was really, and he said, I've got some guys--they're going to really make the team go.  And I said, okay, I'd like to see that.  And then, I went over to see Mr. [William] McQuitter who worked in the park district.  And he pointed out, these guys are gonna be something and so on, so on, so on, and so.  And they were alright.  It was a group of young fellows, they were all friends and they were the damnedest group of kids I've worked with.  There's one of them I never did understand until I saw Michael Jordan.  I really didn't understand it until I saw Michael Jordan.  If--
Speaker 1: You were--expect him and what, what?
Speaker 2: Because of what he could do.
Speaker 1: Who was he?
Speaker 2: Darius Cunningham, Peter Cunningham [Darius "Pete" Cunningham].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At about 5'9", maybe 5'10", he was able to do just a whole lot of things--shoot it.  He could--oh, he could just do a lot of stuff.  He was a terrific guy.  But it's not just him, it was the height.  And Cody [William "Cody" Anderson] and Harold Jenkins [ph.], all of those guys who made up a kind of whole cloth and they were our freshman group.  And I, I really think that one of the reasons people think of me as a good coach is because of those young people.  Because no matter how screwy I came out with ideas, they took them and made them sense of what I wanted them.  So I spent four years with them and it was, it was a lark.
Story_ID: 512778
Speaker 1: Now, you had them from what years to what years?
Speaker 2: I had them from--I got there in '56 [1956] so they came about '57 [1957], not '57 [1957]--
Speaker 1: So they were there '57 [1957]--
Speaker 2: I think about--
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: --about '60 [1960], '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: --Until '60 [1960], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  But by that time, they're drawing such attention because they, they really were good basketball players.  They were fundamentally sound, not so much my doing, but Mr. [William] McQuitter in that park district 'cause he wouldn't let them get out of there--not knowing what they're doing; and Mr. Cridell [ph.] in the seventh grade where they played for him.  Now, all of those guys were part of the coaching staff.  We all got together and talked about what to do.  And in '62 [1962]--in '61 [1961], I think, Cazzie showed up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he became--
Speaker 1: This is Cazzie Russell?
Speaker 2: Russell, Cazzie Russell.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: He became a major player.  He must have come around '60 [1960] because '62 [1962], I think was his senior year so maybe it's '59 [1959] or so.  I'm, I'm not clear.
Speaker 1: Just to backtrack a second now, Mr. McQuitter was a part of a legendary Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] basketball team that won a lot of games and then went to Xavier University [of Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Xavier--
Speaker 1: --in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah, didn't lose a game for four years.
Speaker 1: And didn't lose a game in four years, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Charlie Gant, Mr. McQuitter, there's a group of them there.
Speaker 2: Cleve [Cleveland] Bray--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --those guys, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, and so, so he developed these kids that, that came along in 1957?
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: And you're--
Speaker 2: --but they in the park district.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And these kids were, were bright enough where they actually were helping the coach the, the team.  They were helping the coach themselves and the rest of the team--I guess, you were saying.
Speaker 2: Well, what they did is, as I said, it--if you gave them an idea, they made it work.  And it could be a screwy idea, but they turned it right side up (laughter).
Story_ID: 512779
Speaker 1: Now, what do you mean by a screwy idea?  Now, as a, as a basketball coach, what kind of ideas did you have that, that people considered screwy in those days?
Speaker 2: Ohh, there were a lot of them.  One, I thought players shouldn't play any single position, that especially high school players should play any position because they went to college.  They would never know where he would have to try.  I thought that you should take time to get a shot that you wanted.  And that defense made more sense that offense 'cause you'd always do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so they kinda had a green light to shoot the ball whenever they thought they could make a shot or--
Speaker 2: Well, it's just who's gonna shoot.  It's just a matter of--the, the way we put it is, let's work to get the shot that we practice 'cause that's the one you're gonna make the most.  And that's what we did.  They understood things like picking and blocking and playing off the ball and, and screening.  We had one guy that could shoot well from outside, so we fool with the ball long enough for him to get in his spot and for people to forget about him, and throw him the ball.  And he'd pop it instead of--unfortunately, we didn't have people in place at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He'd been good at it.  But it was, it was that kind of, of approach to basketball that made sense to me that didn't make sense to a lot of other people, that these kids were able to take and adapt and adjust to their level of understanding.  So that if we found out where the team was weak, then we'd put where we were strong against that weak part--not just run up and down to see who wanted to enter the game.  And the strategy part was the hardest part to get them to look at.  Now, happily, they came to guys like [William] McQuitter and who came out of that that thing down at Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] where those guys would always strategize about how to get the, how to get the free man.  The objective was to get somebody stepping to the basket free with the ball.  Now how do you do that?  And that's, that's what they understood, and it was easy for them to take it when I started talking it, but generally, talking at the kids, they look at you as if you had three ears or something.
Story_ID: 512780
Speaker 1: Now, defense is something that a lot of youth don't.  It's the hardest thing to learn to do, I guess, in a sense 'cause every- everybody wants to shoot, but hardly anybody wants to play defense.  So, how did you, how, how were you able to teach them to how, how to play defense?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was a matter of making a defense as much fun as offense.  To, to figure how to distract the other teams is first thing.  To figure how to, to get the guys so intent on this one over here that somebody over here comes and take the ball from him, or to get the guys so wrapped up, and somebody else on the other team, that he forgets what the rest of the team is supposed to be doing.  And you end up with somebody on the other team getting mad at his own player and it--just the team breaks down--those, those kind of things.
Speaker 1: I mean, what techniques would you use to do that? I mean, to distract a player like what, what would--
Speaker 2: Well, there are a couple of things.  You could--I remember we played a team--had two good shooters once.  And so, they were bigger than we were.  So we needed--if we need to get their mind of what they were doing, they'd kill us.  So what we argued is, we will guard this one guy to death and let the other guy shoot.  And we did that.  And pretty soon, the guy that we were guarding, he was shooting it from mid-court (laughter) 'cause he wanted to get a shot up.  And, of course, it just took away the, you know, from the game enough, so that we got, we were able to get our edge on.  That kind of thing--
Speaker 1: That's kind of a psychological defense, isn't it, in some way?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What, really it's--
Speaker 1: See, the one guy was jealous, the other guy is shooting or he wanted to get some--
Speaker 2: You, you're trying to, and, and it's amazing how much it works.  And we'd always find one of the guys in the school that wanted to play, but wasn't a great player, but who didn't mind being tricked with the ball from time to time.  So we'd put the one guy on the, on the guard that was a good guard with the other team, and just have him annoy the guy.  And he would annoy him by guarding him sometime, then just following him up the court, trailing him up the court, to get his attention, to get him off of what he was thinking about.  And pretty soon, all the--his, his main goal was to be able to steal the ball from that good guard one time.  That's all he had to do.  Once he did that, the game changed because then that guy was gonna show him you can't do that again.  And his game was over, you know.  So that we had a lot of fun doing that.  And, and those guys were great at it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I enjoyed, I enjoyed working with those young men.
Story_ID: 512781
Speaker 1: And then, right after that, Cazzie [Russell] and his group came in [to Carver High School, later, Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And we had a good year.  And then, the next year we went downstate.  We went to the state championship.
Speaker 2: Now, before you get downstate now, Cazzie Russell is somebody we ought to think about for a minute.  Cazzie Russell became an All-Star at Michigan State College [sic, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: He was an All-American--
Speaker 2: All-, All-American.
Speaker 1: --in high school.
Speaker 2: The NBA [National Basketball Association] All-Star.
Speaker 1: Right.  He was just a terrific ball player.
Speaker 2: He's about 6'6".
Speaker 1: Cazzie is 6'6", and good hands, you know, he's a clear thinker.  And he could play with his back to the basket or facing the basket, either one--whatever he had to do to get it done.
Speaker 2: Now, when he played for you, did he, did he play center?
Speaker 1: His first year, he did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The second year, he was in school.  A guy named Joe Allen came in.  And let me try to get the numbers straight.  Peter and those guys left about 1959--I remember that.  And then, Cazzie was a freshman about then.  And the year after that, Joe Allen came in when he was a sophomore.  And Joe hadn't played before, but he just was a big guy.  He was 6'6" and really broad.  He didn't jump so much.  He just took up so much space--couldn't anybody else jump.  We had the two of them after--I guess, Cazzie's junior year, when Joe moved up to the varsity team.  We had the two of them playing and, and we'd pull Cazzie outside to--in the guard position, which was a little bit new, but didn't take him long and adjust to it.
Speaker 2: Now, he was a one of the first big guards, I guess--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --I, I think so.
Speaker 2: You'd think about--
Speaker 1: They were--most guards were smaller guys.  He was a big guy.
Speaker 2: In those days, yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: In those days, most guards are small.  I guess, Oscar Robertson was a big guard--
Speaker 1: Another big one.
Speaker 2: --about the same.  Well, a little earlier than Cazzie.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  He was a little earlier from, 'cause he came out of that Indiana group down there in Indianapolis.  But that, that was how you developed, though the interesting thing about Cazzie is--he was always talking about his baseball game.  He was a good baseball player, you know.  So he said he was gonna be a baseball player.  But it just turned out that, that basketball was what he just got to be very, very good at.  And--
Speaker 2: You said he would spend a lot of time practicing--you said on his own?
Speaker 1: He would spend a lot of time practicing.  He would help the janitors in the gym, so he could get a few extra shots any time he could.  He was serious about it.  I remember we were talking to him about, you gotta be able to play with both your left hand and your right hand.  You can't just do one thing.  And he worked hard--to working on dribbling with the left hand and doing, you know, to, to kinda--he had a work ethic that was, was just different.  And, of course, when you saw him later, that's what was paying off, 'cause if you let him see the basket, he'd put in there, but he'd shoot a thousand shots a day if he could, you know.
Speaker 2: And he went on to play with the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I believe--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or, or was it Michigan State?  I get them mixed up.
Speaker 1: No, Michigan, University of Michigan.
Speaker 2: Mich-, Michigan, and then the, the New York Knicks, I think, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I, I know there was, there was a lot of-- when he graduated, of course, he was an All-American.  And there was a lot of hoopla and stuff around and, you know, a lot of people coming back and forth.  And that's when I found out pretty much what the system was like.  And there was a lot of energy for him to go to--where was Bonsail?  You know, Cincinnati [Ohio], they wanted to go there.  But I'd watched the George Wilson, from Marshall [Metropolitan] High School [Chicago, Illinois], who was a good player, a fairly good player.  He went to Cincinnati.  And I--and mostly, they had him giving the ball to somebody, you know, they didn't make the game around him.  So my argument to Cazzie and his folks was, yeah, wherever you're going to go is fine, but go somewhere where they want you to come, where you're going to be the guy they put the game around.  I say, now think about all the people you've talked to.
Story_ID: 512782
Speaker 1: We're talking about Cazzie Russell and his recruitment and some of the advice you were giving him.  Is this the first player of yours that was heavily recruited by colleges?
Speaker 2: I think it was--well, [Darius "Pete"] Cunningham was recruited by Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois].  He went there for a while, but then finally went to--oh, this is a black school in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Central--
Speaker 1: Or Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], what, what--
Speaker 2: --but it was, it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was--no (unclear) just broken up.  I think it is Central State in Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had another kid that went to Northern Illinois [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] but he, he didn't play.  He went to school there.  What--I guess, I learned, and, and let me just backtrack a little bit.  What I, what I learned with those guys is 'cause I was telling you what a great time I had with them, but I let them all down because I did not prepare them properly for the next step.  And that, I have never gotten over that, that I was having a heck of a time.  And, of course, they enjoyed what they were doing, too, but we, we weren't into the--we weren't enough in preparation for where they were going to go next.
Speaker 1: In, in, in life or--
Speaker 2: Well, on into college or university or wherever it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I don't think I, you know, I talked about it, and I paid lip service to it.  But I wasn't, I wasn't argumentative [sic] about it, which--and, and they would have listened if I had the--and if not, they, they--of the guys, they all went to college and finished.  But it's after some bumping around.  I, I felt that I should have been a lot more help into that. And so, I came of there with the idea that I would never let that happen again.  I wouldn't do that to any more young people, so I've scared some away because I argue so much that you've got to go to school.  I don't care about how good you are, and you got to be a student. For Cazzie [Russell], they were coming in every direction, you know.  Cazzie is a pretty good student.  The, the decision, of course, is up to him and his family.  And my point to them is just think about where you're gonna go.  That was all.  And I'm glad he went to Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] because they, they used all of their resources to raise him up, you know.  And then he ended up with all of those guys coming up there-[Oliver] Darden and that crew.  They just had--it was heck of a go.  We--he went to Michigan.  One of the other guys that played for us named Gary Jones was a terrific guy.  Gary is about 6'4".  He's a good rebounder but he's a terrific outside shot.  Now, in my time, we call it a set shot, you know, where your boys--you sit down.  You stand there and shoot it.  Now he could shoot that thing forty feet.  He just didn't like to because it wasn't what everybody else did.  And I used to argue until I was out of breath.  He said, yeah, coach, he still wouldn't shoot it, but he could do that.
Speaker 1: So, he can shoot a great set shot, but wouldn't shot the shot?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, no, no.
Speaker 1: What did he want to shoot--a jump shot?
Speaker 2: He wanted to shoot a jump shot like everybody else.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But he went on to Iowa.  And when Iowa played Michigan, we, you know, loaded up the bus to go.  I remember one time we were going up there, and we had an old bus 'cause we didn't have a lot of money.  We had an old bus and it had a flat tire.  And the guy couldn't get a tire to fit it because an old bus, and the wheels were different than any tires they had.  So were sitting on a road and by the time we got it fixed, we got there just after the game ended, you know.  Man, it was heartbreaking.  But, next year when they played, the, the--some of the people in, in Ann Arbor sent a bus down, so that we could be sure to get up to see the game every time.  And I, and I think, Cazzie had, you know, from all outside views and from what I talked to him about, he had a good time there.  It was a good fit for him.
Story_ID: 512783
Speaker 1: Now, now what about--now, now, Cazzie Russell left [Carver High School, later Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '62 [1962], you said?  That was his senior year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '62 [1962].  He graduated in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: But did--
Speaker 2: That was the year we were in the championship.  And we had this guy, Joe Allen, that was playing so well, but Joe had a problem with his knee.  And the cartilage would--was loose, and would catch in his--he couldn't straighten his knee out.  They would lock.  And we knew about that.  We'd been to the doctor just before we left to go down state.  And he played well down there until the last game.  And in the first quarter, we were ahead pretty well because Joe is a big, rough guy.  I mean, he didn't--I, I don't mean he went at to hit anybody.  He was just hard.  And after you jump with him two or three times, you tend to get on the other side, and hope the ball came over there, you know, so that he, he went out--his knee locked.  And we took him out, then it kind of evened the game off.  So we played down to the wire, and we had the ball with one shot to go.  And one of my kids threw the ball into one of the other team.  And he went down there and we whacked him, and he made one of the free throws, so we lost by one point.  Aww, they were all heartbroken, we were all heartbroken about that.  But the next year, we won it by one point.
Story_ID: 512784
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, now what about the championship team [at Carver High School, later, Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Now, Cazzie Russell's gone and was Joe Allen gone, too?
Speaker 2: No, Joe was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Joe Allen; Gerry Jones; Ken Maxey was a sophomore; Anthony Smedley was a sophomore; Robert Cifax who's a junior; Charlie [Charles] Glenn who was a senior; and [Curtis] Kirk who was a senior.  Those were the guys that on their team.  They were, they were an interesting group.
Speaker 1: Now was this the first--I know the people always talk about the legendary DuSable Panther Team [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] of 1950--is it four [1954]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954].  They went downstate and almost won but they, they didn't win.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They're like a legendary team.  Was, was your team the first black team from the City of Chicago to go down and win?
Speaker 2: No, Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Marshall won.
Speaker 2: Marshall won with George Wilson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and those guys.  I, I think Spin Salario was the coach during that time.  That was '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we won in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, well, how did that--and tell us about this, this run.  Now you all--
Speaker 2: Well, it--
Speaker 1: --was it publicly easy to--for you all to win?
Speaker 2: Well, we were, we were expected to do well in a public league and we did well.  The one place where we got beat was at Gary Roosevelt [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana]. Bo Mallard [Louis "Bo" Mallard] was the coach over there and every year we would play them.  And it was--there was the old Gary when they had the--they played in the--what's the place downtown, their auditorium, the downtown auditorium.  Oh, it was five or 6,000 people and they'd fill it up.  They'd have them standing on the ceiling.  And it was just a heck of a game.  And Bo, of course, would always sit us in front of the band, or something else so we couldn't hear anything, but it was a great game.  But that year, we--
Speaker 1: It was a strategy, huh--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he would set you in front of the band?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, so we'd, we'd have to holler and scream.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That year, they were the ones, they were the only team that beat us, I think.  And the irony was, the year that he won the state championship, we were the only team that beat them.  That must have been some, something working.
Story_ID: 512785
Speaker 1: The team [basketball team at Carver High School, later Carver Military Academy High School in Chicago, Illinois]--my sense was we seldom played a lot of city games for practice.  We tried to see every kind of defense we could see and different offenses, and how people did things, so the kids had a--they had resources to fall back on.  But probably the guy was most responsible for us winning the state championship was a good friend of mine named Hennessy, Leo Hennessy.  Leo and I started working the board the same time.  I don't know what Leo is doing now but, but he was coaching at Fenger [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], yeah, he was at Fenger.  And our team was bigger and, you know, we were more experienced and rest of it, and Leo held the ball.  He wouldn't let us get it.  One shot, they'd get it, and they'd hold it.  And we chased them around that gym, we chased them around that gym.  And I'm trying to think, did we beat those guys or did they beat us?  That may, that may be the other game we lost because he, he just squeezed the air out of the ball.  When we got downstate, we played a team that held the ball like that, but we had a reflex for it.  The kids had a reflex for it.  They were patient.  We were impatient in Chicago [Illinois].  Pretty much, we were perceived (unclear) to be a good team and that we would do well.  And in that time, you had to play--win the City Championship, and then we had to win the Regional Championship in order to go downstate because they had the Sweet Sixteen.  Now it's a little bit different, I think only eight teams go down to state.  But you had to win in the region.  And we had a bumpy game in the region but got out of that, and then went down to Champaign [Illinois].  We--a couple of things that happened are probably worth mentioning.  In 1962, we played the very last game in Huff gym [Huff Hall, Champaign, Illinois].  It was the gym where they'd had the State Championship for years and years and years.  And they built this new mushroom-looking thing down in Champaign.  And we lost in a championship game in the old gym.  We won in a championship game in the new gym.  It was--and they always remind me that we should have won both of them.  Yeah, probably, but that's the way it worked out.  Our, our team went a lot of different places.  We went up to Rockford [Illinois] in the north, and went down south around Quincy [Illinois], and played a little team called Pittsfield [High School, Pittsfield, Illinois] near Quincy, so that our kids have seen a lot of different styles and types of play.  They've been around a lot of different kinds of officials so I, I think they were patient.  And that's what happened.  The game--the difference in our game, of course, was that Joe [Allen] was able to play guard.  And at his size, that, that kind of turned things on it's head because when the team wanted to press, there's nothing they could do with him unless they want to take a whipping, you know.
Story_ID: 512786
Speaker 1: How big was your team?  If Joe [Allen], now Joe was a pretty tall guy, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was 6'6".  [Robert] Cifax was 6'6".  Gerry [Jones] was 6'4".  [Charles] Glenn was 6'2".  [Curtis] Kirk was 6'3", and then [Ken] Maxey was 5'7", and [Anthony] Smedley was 5'7".
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Smedley, though, he, he's a guy that kinda--it's an unexpected kind of a hero, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we'd been having it all the time.  I'm sure he still thinks I'm a terrible guy but he just was contrary, I thought.  And it was really flipping the coin about whether I was going to take him to Champaign [Illinois] or not.
Speaker 1: So, he, he didn't even, he barely made the--I mean, the trip, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It wasn't that he wasn't a good player.  He was a good shooter and a terrific guard, but he just did so many other kinds of things, you know, that (unclear) go in to, but it was the kind of thing that coaches are unnerved by.  And so, I--it was a question in my mind.
Speaker 1: So he's kind of hard to coach in other words, huh?
Speaker 2: Right.  And it, it may have been how I was playing him.  I'm not sure, but that was the end result.  But when we got down there, he shot two times in the State Championship, serious.  He shot one and shot us into a tie and we went overtime and won it.  Then he shot that one in the championship and we won the state title.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that one--I think he came in and stole the ball and then shot it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm just assuming he stole it, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--
Speaker 1: A long shot, too, about twenty-foot shot?
Speaker 2: But that's where he went all the time.  That's all he ever did in the gym and run to the corner.
Speaker 1: Yeah, shoot it long?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, and he just run to the corner, shoot that twenty-five footer, and he could do it.  And at, at dinner that night after the game, and they were sitting there looking.  I said, "You're not gonna eat?" "Too excited to eat."  And he said, "Coach, should I have shot that?"  I said, "Yeah, I think you should have shot (laughter) that."  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he wasn't sure if he did the right thing now or not (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause we did control it from the bench a lot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: I read where he [Anthony Smedley] hasn't done much since.  He, he kinda says that once you, you achieve that, there's nothing else to do or something (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, he--it's, I think they've--I'd hoped that [Anthony] Smedley would do better, but I do think he was, he was a kid that was in a place at a time, you know.  Now, of those other guys, [Ken] Maxey an assistant principal out at Whittier [High] School in Los Angeles [California].  Joe [Allen] just passed but he worked in a social agency in Bradley [Illinois].  Gerry died in a car accident, Gerry Jones, but he--I think he finished Iowa.  Charlie Glenn, I'm not sure--I think he went to Northern [Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] for a while.  I'm not sure what he's, what he did, but I know he's working now and to see, I see him periodically.  And [Curtis] Kirk was killed in an airplane accident on an aircraft carrier.  And [Robert] Cifax went to school in Arizona.  And I think of Cifax, I think of another guy that was on the team in '62 [1962] named Malbert Pradd which is an unusual name for a guy.
Speaker 1: Malbert?
Speaker 2: Malbert Pradd.
Speaker 1: No, Cifax is an unusual name, too, and so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Robert Cifax.  But this guy has had a real English name.  But Malbert had long legs.  It looked like they come all the way up to this chest but he could shoot.  He went to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] and he set all kind of scoring records.
Speaker 1: The one in New Orleans [Louisiana], the black Xavier?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Xavier.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They retired his number.  They just built a new center so they may have shifted around, but I used to go down a lot to see that.
Story_ID: 512788
Speaker 1: It was a fascinating time with those guys [basketball team at Carver High School, later, Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  And I went down to see Joe [Allen].  You know, Joe's leg never did get well, but I went down to see him and play, when he was at Bradley [University, Peoria, Illinois].  And he was, for one leg at center, he was tough.  He was real tough.  Then we have a set of other guys that came through.  That was a kind of a high point.  And I remember one, one thing that, that was really attention grabbing.  In 1962, when we came back from Champaign [Illinois], I think a high percentage of the people that lived in Altgeld [Gardens, Chicago, Illinois], especially young people, were in front of the school.  And they were hollering and cheering, carrying on for the team and that kind of thing.  And the mayor [Mayor Richard J. Daley] came out and made a few speeches--old man Daley.  And then in 1963, where we won, it was even a larger group of people, you know.  And I talk to people now who, who were in Altgeld at that time, and they argue that nobody was doing anything during that time.  If they weren't down state, they were in, looking at somebody's television, listen to the radio to see what went on.  And, and I think--at least, I hope, a lot of people in Altgeld identified with that level of excellence.  I think, I think it did something to a lot of kids there because, you know, it was their team 'cause anybody say, it was anybody's team 'cause they all, they all, with one exception, one kid that moved away.  They all came out at Altgeld.
Speaker 2: There's a photo in the office that I saw of you sitting in a car next to Mayor Daley.  Mayor Daley's in the middle and George Ireland is on the right side.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he was a coach of the Loyola [University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] team that won the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --NCAA Championship in '63 [1963] with Jerry Harkness and Vic Rouse and all them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: The mayor was, 'cause he was funny and that, he said, you guys gonna make it unnecessary for me to campaign this year.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I said, okay, Mr. Mayor, I gotta, I gotta question for you.  He was--I think he, in '62 [1962], he came out to the school, and I gotta give him that.  And he told the student body, "Don't worry, you guys are gonna win this thing next year, and I'll be right back here making a speech."  And he was right back there--made this speech.  And then, the thing that I'd ask him to do, he did that I liked.  Gave out a lot of scholarships.  He had those mayoral scholarships they used to give out.  He did, he did a nice thing at that.
Story_ID: 512789
Speaker 1: Altgeld [Gardens, Chicago, Illinois], I think things kinda went a little different.  I didn't have that level of team again, but I had some terrific players, you know, guys who did real good things.  There was a young man who was a bishop down in Houston [Texas] who played for me.  Boy, he was a heck of a player--shoot it, strong, went through Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and finished.  And then I think he's got an MBA but then decided he was interested in teaching, taught, and then went into the ministry.  He's, he's doing a great job.  He has a school for young people that--are having a tough time making it in school.  And he's struggling with this school but it's just a, it's an uplifting thing he's doing.  I like doing (unclear).  His name is Bishop Robert Lewis [ph.] but he's a good guy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And where is he now again?
Speaker 1: He's in Galveston [Texas].
Speaker 2: Galveston? Okay.
Speaker 1: That's where he lives and his family, has his school.
Story_ID: 512790
Speaker 1: Now, 1963, this is a pivotal year, I guess, a big year for the City of Chicago [Illinois].  I think the [Chicago] Bears win the National Football League [NFL] Championship that year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had, we were--
Speaker 1: It's also--I mean, for, on the political scene, you got the March on Washington [1963] and, and the assassination of [President] John [Fitzgerald] Kennedy I've seen here [1963].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And it, it led into a curious set of circumstances, you know.  That, that's when the fabric became to come loose a little bit.  I don't know that I, of course, I continued to work at the school.  But I'm, I'm not sure that, that the kinds of things that were happening nationally were helpful to my own concerns about education for, for youth, particularly the black youth.  There were a whole set of arguments that at least in my mind didn't make sense that students shouldn't take school seriously, that only, only certain subjects were worth studying--those kinds of things.  I was, I was never really clear on the, on the thinking process about that.
Speaker 1: Where were these arguments coming from?
Speaker 2: Oh, they're coming from community activists in some cases.  College students and other cases were making the arguments because the whole business of the civil rights movement--the momentum was, was there.  It was happening.  And for a lot of people, they felt the need to just make finite arguments.  There's gotta be this or that, and that there's no in between at any of this.  And I think, for a lot of our youngsters, it was, it's hard for them to distinguish between it. And then our government was unusual, too, you know, what they were doing during that period of time 'cause that was--the Vietnam business was raging.  And, you know, we were trying to figure out how to, how to even get in or stay out of that--what to do 'cause I--they say, when are we going to get the French out of Vietnam?
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954].  Yeah, the French left in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were just getting hot in our engagement within the '60s [1960s].  And it just had everybody looking every kind of direction--not that everybody doesn't have a point of view, but it just seemed odd to me that education was the one thing that we didn't push as hard as we needed to, especially in our communities.  And I think we've seen--we're seeing another period of time where this is true.  And this time, we're not pushing as hard as it needs to be pushed.  And we're not using all the resources that are available to do something with it.  But that's just looking through one looking glass.
Speaker 1: Okay well, statistics seem to bear you out on that.  I mean, in terms of the, the percentage of black students attending colleges decreased.  The number of black youth that are incarcerated has increased.
Story_ID: 512791
Speaker 1: How, how long did you coach at, at Carver [High School, later Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Until it was 1973, I think '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: So it's ten more years after the championship years?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have another team that, that came close to achieving this, the--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.  Ironically, the other team I got down state was a girls' volleyball team when I was working at Hyde Park [Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  There's another little situation where somebody came and said, I got a group of girls that are gonna really make you great.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He was right (laughter), he was right.
Speaker 1: This--is this--in-, interesting that these two, the two teams that you talk about were the most affectionate.  Our, our teams are already--where the players already knew each other on some level, right, when they came.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, but I, I think that was, that was, that was what Altgeld [Gardens, Chicago, Illinois] did, because it was an established community.  It was like a small town.  The pecking order was already established, you know.  This guy knew who this guy was, and this guy from this block knew who these guys were on that block.  It--the good players had already come to the top because they'd been playing in the park district for a period of time.  And they had people like [William] McQuitter and this guy, Cridell [ph.] there, and Roscoe Smiley.  Those guys were--well, all guys that I played around with over at the Southside Boys Club, but they were all good players and they were all fundamentally sound.  So not only did they play basketball, but they had terrific softball groups out there.
Story_ID: 512792
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about how you got associated with the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Now, you said in 1968, you began--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the university--just a little background.  The university used to do a tournament every Christmas over in the field house and one year we won it.  And--
Speaker 1: You mean, at Carver [High School, later Carver Military Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Carver--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Carver won the tournament.  And I came to know the coach down here, Joe Stampf, and picked up a paper one day.  And the university was saying that they had a new program.  And right in the aftermath of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death, they had a new program.  They wanted to open--to start a program for African American students to help them prepare to get in college--not necessarily this one but any college.
Speaker 1: Was this an Upward Bound Program as such?
Speaker 2: It--no, it was a grant they got from one of the companies--I think that Olin-Mathieson gave them some money.  And they were looking for somebody to do this thing.  And I called Joe, the basketball coach, because I was interested to get my kids involved with it because, you know, we used to--and, and I missed that park because when at Altgeld [Gardens, Chicago, Illinois], we used to travel all kinds of places.  I remember we went to New York World's Fair in '63 [1963] in that same old bus that the tires were too big.  We went to--we, we visited anything that was, that we could get to, that we raise the money to get to that made sense to our kids.  And that was the other reason that we didn't play practice games in the city.  We went places up here on Route 80 near Little Norway, that area around--you would know where that, Morris [Illinois], that atomic reactor is.  Well, in that little area, there was a series of little towns and we went there to play.  And the guy said, look, we don't have a lot of money to pay you, but what we'll do is we'll let you stay with the players so that you save the, you know, the hotel fare.  And it turned out that there were a whole set of millionaire farmers down there that these kids got to meet.  In fact, one guy offered to pay for one of our kids to go to school, to one of the kids mentioned that he was interested in--animals for veterinary science.  But it was that kind of thing that we were very interested in, so anything that said we get to go somewhere.  Well, that's how I called Joe.  And Joe said, well, I saw it, but I don't know who's doing it.  Let me find out and I'll call you.  So he called me back and told me the guy who was running it.  There was a guy named Wayne Booth, who was the dean of the college, so I came down to talk to him.  And by the time we finished, Wayne was saying, well, maybe you've been doing this, maybe this is something that you can, you think about doing.  And I hadn't, but that's how it started.  It was--well, it was just a kind of a fluke that I fell into.  So, in the beginning, I had a lot of kids from Altgeld [Gardens, Chicago, Illinois] coming here and we did things and did things.  The board had to make an arrangement with the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] so I could get here in the afternoon.  They worked that out, and it came to be a, not a bad activity.  Now, I knew nothing about this university.  And as luck would have it, the dean's secretary, a woman named Ginger Fisch [Mary L. "Ginger" Fisch] and her husband, Gerry [Gerald M. Fisch], were sports enthusiasts.  So I think they guided us through the pitfalls of being here the first few years.  We talked to--there was a faculty committee and some number of black faculty.  And the black students had to talk to, and a number of other people that we had to chat and talk with.  And I mean I had no magic--just tell them what I knew we did and they asked me some things.  I said, I haven't the foggiest notion about that one, you know.  So I think we may have been political.  There were other people who were interested in the job and I may, may have been politically naive enough for them to say, well that guy is all right.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 512793
Speaker 1: Had you been less politically naive, you think they would have balked or something or--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It, it, it may have been that.  And this is just, again, looking through my eye, I don't really know.
Speaker 1: Do, do you really think you were politically naive early about (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I just think they didn't understand what my interest was in this place.  My interest was to open this place up to people because it's here in this community where we all live.  And we brought a lot of people to this place.
Speaker 1: Now, during the time that you came here, there's a lot of tension between Woodlawn [Chicago] and, and Hyde Park [Chicago], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and the Woodlawn community, part of which was--used to be known as Hyde Park.  You know, at one time it was funny (unclear).  Hyde Park High School now is considered Woodlawn High School instead of Hyde Park School.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: But, but that's the area of town where the Blackstone Rangers were.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Blackstone Rangers were around.  The, the sense of that was that they, they were a group and again, and then a political entity, I think.  And when they came a political entity, they operated in different ways, and that they did keep a tension between the two places.  There were a lot of people in, in Woodlawn who felt the university was going to take over the community.  You know, of course, they were right, it seems, you know, but they could have found that out simply by reading (unclear) Southeast Commission, that that was clearly spelled out.  The part that you, that I found is it pretty much there were--I don't think there were any incidents in central Hyde Park.  I don't remember anything happening, any kids that were coming and going from our program during that time.  One of the little girls that was in our program (unclear)--Jeff Ford [ph.], but I'm not sure that had a whole lot to do with it.  She's a nurse now.
Speaker 1: So, the, the--Hyde Park was kinda like an island of refuge, I guess, from some of the gang conflict--
Speaker 2: Right, right,
Speaker 1: --in some ways--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, because they, they also have their large police force--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in addition to the city police.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And while there are still incidents that occur, I don't, I don't think there's any--it's any different than anywhere else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the Woodlawn area was a little rougher, a little bit rougher.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any sense of some of the political and development intrigue?  And, and I've heard stories of all kind of plots and counterplots and stuff between the University of Chicago and the, and the Woodlawn community, and suspicions of all sorts of things.  What, what's your analysis of what, what this dynamic has been in terms of the development of the university versus the under-development of Woodlawn?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't have a knowledge, I have feelings as you asked.  And it seems that Woodlawn is, is a part of what the university sees as its area, that if they're going to have people come here to teach and to go to school and to live, then they have to have a reasonable community around it.  I think that's what I hear them say.  What the people in Woodlawn say is they're taking, you know, they're taking over our community.  And I'm not sure what the, you know, I don't think anybody is wrong.  It's just what's happening, but it's, it's the same thing that the people in Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] can say or any other place.  It's just that this university is here, and this is an attractive target so people get it.  It's not to say that the university doesn't do some things that you'd hope they wouldn't do, but I think it's becoming much more user friendly.
Story_ID: 512794
Speaker 1: You, basically, become more and more involved with the programs here at the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], right, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Right.  But the programs here really are a part of what I do in school, is I work in four high schools and about six elementary schools.  And we have a core group of about three hundred students that we see, along with additional parents.  And what we try to do is to get them to see the university as a resource for their development.  We're not necessarily, nor have we ever been asked to try to get kids to come here to school.  The students want to come.  I think it's fine that we can help that, but we try to encourage them to figure out what's the best for them.  You know, you know, if you ask me, I'll tell them what I think but, generally, I don't get into that.  The, the part of our program that reaches out into schools, I think, comes from teachers and counselors who've heard of this program that they, they call us and send kids.  It comes from parents who've been in it and who want to bring their children to it.  And it's pretty much an activity that I raise a lot of the money for through the federal government, the state, and the city, and then through private organizations.  The university puts in a share but, essentially, that's, that's how this program goes--it has gone for the last twenty or thirty years.  I think what we do is reasonable.  And I think it helps people.  I, I wish we could do it better but I, I think it helps people.  The fact that we argue so for sport sometime puts us in a, in an odd position with some people.  And the fact that we sometimes argue so hard for African American young people puts us in a position that seems anti-diversity, but it's not anti-anything.  It's pro-something and that fact that you were speaking about--numbers of kids that we're losing on a daily basis, you know.
Speaker 1: So as a social program, it's designed to help people--I mean our youth that are at risk.  I mean, you can't--I mean, it's hard to avoid trying to help-it's focused on African American youth, right, because of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think that.  And while I wouldn't turn any kid away, that's my interest.  And I've always stated that because I think that's where we have the biggest problems.  Now, at a point that problem may turn Hispanic, but that's--at this point, the problem that I see, and the one that we tried to solve over here.  I'm not sure that education is the only thing that will, will, would change people lives, people's lives, but I haven't come on anything else that does it as well.  The idea that it'll make them wealthy or any of these kinds of ideas are fine, but it just is you--that's a flip of the coin.  You can be educated.  You can learn to read and write, you know.  It's like we argued to people that because we've now reduced our students to a test score which is what they really are.  There is some folks who want to argue against the tests.  And I think the test is wrong, but that's, that's a given.  And the issue is what do you do about it?  And I'm convinced that if we see testing as a process and not an event, I think we can change it.  And anybody that spends any time looking at how people learn things knows that, but we just--it just doesn't happen.  Say, we're going to have a test in October.  The kids jump up and jump up and take the test, and they come out and say, ohh, I didn't get a good score.  Well, the issue is, the issue is they need to, they need to broaden it just a little bit, and do the testing in September and October and November, December, and January and February.  And then they can do something about those scores.  And then maybe they can make an argument that a kid is more than a score.  But for the folks who are in charge of schooling in these days that seems to be the issue.  And if there were a place where I feel, that I really want to be active, it's in that arena of education.
Story_ID: 512795
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how, how does your program work basically and who, who are the youth that you target?
Speaker 2: They come from, from public housing.  They come from particular public schools, but I'll take any kid that's having trouble, you know.  And they come for tutoring, like these guys keep popping in here looking for--they're going to be tutoring here soon.  They come for tutoring.  They come for guidance and counseling.  They come for college advisement.  They come for school on Saturday.  They come for school during the summer.  And, of course, we go into the schools and make certain kinds of presentations that the school argues that they would like us to make.
Speaker 1: So, you engage in tutoring and you also--this is also an, an alternative school, too, or--
Speaker 2: Not for credit--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, but what'll happen is if, if the student is interested, we can generally work with most, almost any high school to make an arrangement that student can do things here that they'll give him credit for that.  Simply having to take a test, we do that.  And we have a whole set of kids that are here from, from the public schools that are taking classes on the campus that come through our program.  It's a [Chicago] Board of Education program that we just administer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 512796
Speaker 1: Now, you also--I notice there's a map outside with, with--that, that delineates all the colleges that the, the students have been taken to, you know--
Speaker 2: Our trips.
Speaker 1: --that, that they tour.  I guess they, they, they tour on an annual basis so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--
Speaker 1: --black colleges?
Speaker 2: Yes--no, all kinds.
Speaker 1: All kinds, okay, yeah, right, there are, that's right.
Speaker 2: This, this weekend, we're going to a poetry reading and at Purdue [University, West Lafayette, Indiana].  During the spring break, we're going to be on the East Coast.  Now, the next map that'll be up would be where the kids are.  The woman just cleared the board for that.  And we have them all over the place, you know, in this, and in three or four years.  We do that traveling because we want students to hear other people tell them what they--going in their schools, and also so students don't say, well, I'm going to school X because they sent me a brochure and it's a good school and I want go there.  And you go there and what you saw as a good school is the only thing that looks good down there.  The rest of it is a mess, you know, 'cause you had seven kids ready to go to the school that's about to close down--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're having real trouble.  And then, because they're with these families, they do other things with them.  Just, one of the girl lost a family member and they were--nobody had any money, so we were able to get one of the companies to do the funeral for them, you know, for whatever the state gave.  We have other kids that need places--say, especially those in public housing.  As they knock those buildings down, they're looking for places to stay because, you know, sometimes they're are able to find them; sometimes not.
Speaker 1: It was there--they've given vouchers, right, Section 8 vouchers and the --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The housing may not be available for--to match the voucher, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that--and then, if you talked to a person who's been in public housing for twenty years, thirty years, and put them out here and say, okay, here's a voucher, that's a little rough.  You have to take them step by step by step.  And I think the, the people in housing do the best they can, but I just don't think they have the resources to do all that.  There needs to be some other help.  And I hope they're going to get it at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 512797
Speaker 1: What are some of the most rewarding experiences that you've had engaged in this, this activity with the young people--people here at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It, it's always nice when they write to you some years later and say, you know, I, I finally figured out what you were talking about.  That helps.  The other kind of thing is the, the kids who come here and who think they aren't capable and go away feeling they're pretty good.  I, I like that.  A little girl looked in the door just a minute ago was just so unsure of herself and all of that.  She's a terrific kid.  So we were trying to hold the mirror up in front of her and let her see it--say, you're all right, you know, let's, let's do something.  And I think it's been good to know some of, some of the faculty on this campus.  There's some real people on this campus--Paul Sally and Wayne Booth and Roger Hildebrand, Hank (unclear), and a guy named Duel Richardson that I worked with.  These are people that, that in their own way, they work as hard for young people as I do.  They just aren't as specific as I am.
Story_ID: 512798
Speaker 1: What, what are some of your hopes and concerns for, for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I've tried to argue and, and I would hope that we could make the argument that, that our young people are capable.  We just have to lead them, that leadership is a key element.  We have to lead them.  And I would hope that we get young people to, to dream because I talked to dozens of them that just--well, what are you going to be doing in ten years?  I don't know.  Have you ever thought about it?  No.  Well, think about it.  Well, I don't know, you know.  Well, something's wrong--we cut off dreams that bad.  If I could wish a Christmas present for every little kid, it would be that they, that they could get a dream, you know, something that they said they were going to do.  Whether they do it or not is not important.  You got to have it because everything else flows from that, I believe.

Speaker 1: Now, you went on--you went back to school, and to George Williams [George Williams College, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I went back to George Williams.  I'd done a little graduate work at George Williams.  I'd been--because when you're coaching, you don't have time to do it, but there was a--and a guy that came to be the head of the department at George Williams who dug out all the guys who'd been horsing around for years--invited us all out to, to dinner, and said, we're going to get you guys out of here.  We're going to get that degree.  And he did for a lot of us.  He helped us to get back on it and get to going.  We went on down to, to Champaign [Illinois].  I did.  At Champaign, I organized a training for coaches, but I also got interested in finishing my work.  And some good people down there, Fred Rogers and Raleigh Wright [ph.] helped me get involved, and I finished my work over two or three years.  This--
Speaker 1: Now, now this is a doctorate in education?
Speaker 2: Yes, early childhood.  And, and I'm--in, in doing that, I ran into some terrific guys down there.  Fred Rogers is one.  Raleigh is another, Raleigh Wright.  I don't know if they're either--both still down there.  And a Dr. Katz [ph.], I think, who taught me about reading things, you know, in a way that I hadn't learned before, you know.  I spent that time at school because it, it was then that I thought I wanted to write, and I figured if you had a credential, you could write.  At least people would read it.  And out of that, I came back to the idea that we needed to organize education.  And I did a whole set of things with, with education and sport and how they mixed.  I had three or four really interesting conferences here with all kinds of people hollering and screaming across the table but it's--
Speaker 1: Who are some of the people that attended?
Speaker 2: The, the first conference I had, I had my buddy, Casey Clarke [Dr. Kenneth "Casey" Clarke], who was in--I think working with the Olympic Committee.  [HM] Harry Edwards was here.  He was--I think working with the NBA.  Rich, what's his name, from-- Lapchick, Richard Lapchick was here.
Speaker 1: He was a--
Speaker 2: He was a terrific guy--done some real stuff in his time.
Speaker 1: Was [HM] Al-Tony Gilmore here, was Al-Tony Gilmore here?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think--
Speaker 1: (Unclear), all right.
Speaker 2: --I, I didn't have him in any that, in that lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I had the heads of sport in ten large cities here, and then the woman from the Women's Sports Association, and those kinds of groups.  And, and the whole issue was to talk about sport and how it needs to be expressed educationally.  And it was a lot of good conversation.  It went two or three days here, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't intend to be that long-winded.

Speaker 1: When you look back on the things that you've done over these--now, you've been here over thirty years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and your coaching days and all that, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, I think the argument that, that sport has its pure aspect that just you'd like to run, jump, and throw, whatever it is or dance or spin around, whatever you're doing.  It has its pure aspect, but in a time where we have the kinds of problems we have educationally, it has an educational aspect that we miss altogether.  And we miss it because you don't teach the people who are the most important in the cycle.  As a coach, we don't teach them what their job is.  Now, when I say coaches, I don't mean professional coaches or division one coaches 'cause that's a business.  They call it corporate sport.  I'm talking about the, the seventh or eighth grader who can't wait to get to the game tomorrow, so he can get there and let his friends and parents see what he can do.  There was a guy on this campus named James Coleman who wrote about that in a book called 'Adolescent Society.'  [James A.] Michener wrote about in one of his early books, "The Fires of Spring", where he described--and, and what he said, I thought, was interesting and maybe that's, that's, that's a point to make that, that there were few places where men can be at--where boys can be at one with men except around an activity like sport.  They were talking about the high school team and winning the game the night before and that kind of stuff, you know.  Yeah, it's a--I think the idea that sport has a value to it.  I think that's, that's what I'd like to have people think about.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  And that's one last question.
Speaker 2: As a person who liked young people.  That's about it.
