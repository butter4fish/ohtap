Story_ID: 19851
Speaker 1: Let's begin, Dr. Smith, talking about your mother.  Starting with your mother's name, and where your mother was born and where she grew up as a girl?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Flora Smith, like the flower, Flora.  She was born in Newnan, Georgia also, and has always lived there.  They still live there now, fortunately.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like in Georgia as a small girl?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  We talk about it extensively, and one story I remember quite well, is that in my first three or four years of schooling, I went to the St. John's Baptist Church School [Newnan, Georgia], which was a little school on the grounds of my church.  So by the time I started school, they built a separate building.  She told me that when she was going to school as a kid, that school was actually held inside the church itself.  They used the last three rows as the school.  They were not allowed to enter the sanctuary part of the church, but they used the back rows.  So, it's kind of nice to think about that as the evolution of the education process.  There was a close relationship between the school and the church at that time.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about the things that she enjoyed doing as a child?  Like what she liked to do in her spare time?
Speaker 2: I think that for my parents' generation, my mom in particular, I think they enjoyed weekends as--you know, people who grew up on a farm worked like you-know-what during the week, (laughter) (simultaneously)--yes, so Saturday and Sunday were big days for them.  Sunday particularly, because you get dressed up, and walk a mile or two to church and pick up your friends and relatives as you went along.  It was actually--she talked about it a lot as some joyous days of her childhood.
Speaker 1: And, what about life on the farm?
Speaker 2: They worked like you-know-what from sun-up to sun-down and because their father [Wade Smith] was a sharecropper they got paid at the end of the year.  So very often, the kids had very little to no money on a regular basis.  But they worked hard, they were a strong family and he was a good man, and she loved her father and mother [Emilou Smith] very much and passed that love onto me and my brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: And what kind of farm was it?  What kind of sharecropping did they do?
Speaker 2: It was cotton.
Speaker 1: Cotton.
Speaker 2: We were in the cotton part of Georgia.  And it's tough to make a living with cotton in Georgia because the soil is not very rich.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk about just the whole process of picking cotton and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, everybody talked about it being back breaking, tough work, and you know, work that everybody had to engage in.  Even as a small kid you had to go out when you were young and start the process so that by the time you got to be an adult--which probably explains who so many people got married so early because (laughter), one of the ways to get out of it was to get married and leave home (laughter), so kids got married early and left home in those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: She is a wonderful woman who was magic with her children and grandchildren, and God's been--blessed us with--for her to still be living actually.  She is eighty-six years old now, and she is still doing well down in Georgia.  We--I see her a lot.  She comes to visit me and I visit her all the time.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did your mother do when you were a boy?
Speaker 2: Actually, she did not work very much.
Speaker 1: She was a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Yes.  A homemaker.  There were eight of us, and when you have eight children (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Lots of work to do.
Speaker 2: Lots of work to do, but it's all around the house (laughter).  So she worked long hours taking care of all us and she was there when we left home in the morning.  She was there when we came back in the afternoon.  She made us some more sandwiches, she made us change clothes.  We could play a little while, then we had to come in and get ready for homework and dinner.  So, she had a tough job trying to manage all of us.  Believe me, it wasn't easy.
Story_ID: 19852
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your father.  Starting with your father's name, and where he was born and where he grew up as a boy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My name is Frank Smith, Jr., so his name is Frank Smith, Sr., as you would imagine.  He also grew up in Georgia, and as far as I know his family has always lived in this county.  In this county of Georgia.  His father was a minister and he grew up also on a farm.
Speaker 1: Did he ever share stories with you about what life was like for him as a boy?
Speaker 2: Yes, but everybody knew those childhood stories and they remember going back and forth to town on Saturday afternoons where they would meet up with their friends and hang around the little square where the kids played, and so we talked about that a lot as a kid.
Speaker 1: And how did he and your mother [Flora Smith] meet?
Speaker 2: There are conflicting stories about this.  My daddy got in some mischief as a kid, and he and my mother met while he was actually in trouble, and so he became a friend of the family, and later on they got married.  She was I think about nineteen, so they got married--actually nineteen was pretty old for those days.  Most kids, children, people got married earlier, but at nineteen they got married and I was the first child.  That's how I get to be junior.
Speaker 1: And did your father ever talk about the what he liked to do in his spare time?  And what kind of farming did your father's parents do?  Was that cotton?
Speaker 2: That was cotton also.  Yes, it was cotton also.  I think that in his spare time--my parents were very family-oriented people.  We went to my grandfather's house--her parents' [Wade and Emilou Smith] house every weekend.  We spent the weekend with them.  On Saturdays we would go visiting, and most of the time on Sundays we would go back over there for dinner.  So, we were all like a big family that grew up and shared big time with my parents--my grandparents.  So we all are a big part of that.  A lot of weekends were built around your family.  And, also I lived on this plantation where there were about ten or twelve families that lived there, and all of those families were related by blood or by marriage.  So, it was a community, and then we all went to the same church and the same schools.  So, there was a lot of community in my upbringing.
Speaker 1: How do you describe your father?
Speaker 2: You know, it's kind of interesting.  He was shorter than I am.  He weighed about 170 pounds and that's about as much as he ever weighed in his life, and he was very muscular.  So he looked like a small person all the time.  But he was--I would say that the quest that my brothers and sisters and I have for education, we got from him.  He never had much schooling of his own and with him--in our house going to school was a religion.  He went to work everyday, six days a week, sleepy, tired, lazy, (laughter), he went to work everyday and his rule was if he went to work, you went to school.  So, everybody was out of bed when he left home in the morning with their clothes on and we went out to school.  If we were sick you had to stay in the bed all day long.  There was no such thing as hanging around saying , "I don't feel good," so I could watch television and hang out with my buddies.  That didn't happen. If you were sick and you were on your feet, you had to go work, you had to go to school.  He considered school like work, and our job was to go to school  Our work was school and we had to go to school everyday.  He was the one who imposed that on our family.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did your father do?
Speaker 2: He worked on farm like many others, and then by the time I was a teenager he actually started driving a truck.  When I was in high school he was driving an eighteen-wheeler, by then he had started to discover some more of the world, and quite honestly I had some of the best days of my life riding around with him in that truck.
Speaker 1: When you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 19853
Speaker 1: Let's talk now about your grandparents.  You mentioned weekends at your grandparent's house.  Starting with your paternal grandparents.  Did you spend a lot of time with them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And their names?
Speaker 2: Well, his name was Wade Smith and her name was Emilou.  My mother's [Flora Smith] mother's name was Emilou Smith, and so they were the ones that we spent most of the time with.  By the time I was--my father's family had passed away.  So most of the family bonding was with my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so most of the weekends that you spent were with your mother's parents?  And their last name was Smith as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Oh, my.
Speaker 2: My mother was a Smith and she married a Smith (laughter), so yes, so I've got it in my blood  (simultaneous laughter).
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, you know he was a big guy, was like Burl Ives.  He weighed about 350 pounds and he had a beard, but he was like Gentle Ben.  I mean the all the grandkids loved him, but you know--it was like being with Santa Claus all year long.  We sat on his lap.  Every time he chuckled his stomach--(laughter) vibrated liked Santa Claus, and he was gentle.  He loved everybody.  We were always glad to be around him.  So we looked forward to going to see him.  My grandmother was a smaller person.  Really small.  They were like two contrasts, he was big, she was so small (laughter).  Weighed about 98 pounds or something  and--but he loved her very much and she sort of ruled the roost.  The house was her house, and she ran the place and set all the rules, and we all--it made a very warm place for all of us, because she would cook for us.  It looked like a multitude of people every weekend, and she had magic in that pot, because she could put on a pot of food and you could feed people endlessly.  Not only was the family there, but neighbors knew about this and they would drop by on Sunday afternoon and--cause they knew that we were all eating there and somebody had made a lot of food and everybody got to eat out of that same pot.  So somehow or another, they kept generating more food as the day went on.  I think that was more her magic than anything else and it was clearly quite a fun environment for us.
Story_ID: 19854
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I--obviously I'm interested in this since I run the African American Civil War Memorial here in [Washington] D.C. and I have--we make a big deal out of  tracing these Civil War soldiers, finding their descendents, and I am anxiously searching for my own, a descendant [sic, ancestor] of my own whose name would appear on the wall of African American Civil War Memorial.  I have not found one yet.  I am still anxiously searching , which means I have compiled quite a bit of information on my family.
Speaker 1: So how far back can you go, just like great-grandparents?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: Well, we're back to my [maternal] great-great-great-grandfather's case, for example we know he came from Virginia.  His family came from Virginia at some point during slavery and ended up in Georgia.  As far we know on my father's [Frank Smith Sr.] side, his family started out--were docked on a ship someplace in probably Charleston, South Carolina and then they were bought to Georgia as slaves and have always lived there in Georgia.
Story_ID: 19855
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well my earliest memory is probably that of school, when I was six and seven years old.  I have one other memory of my childhood which I remember probably when I was three or four years my father [Frank Smith Sr.] bought me a tricycle for Christmas.  I remember riding around the house with that, and then a few years later we moved to another house where I--just one house over actually (laughter), which was a little bit bigger because there were more kids, and it only had two rooms at the time, then my father, actually with his hands, built another room onto it.  So, I have a memory of that as a kid and so, I thought I was helping him, but I am sure I was more in the way than anything else.
Story_ID: 19856
Speaker 1: Can you give us your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  I have a sister named Gussie, who actually is older than I am and then I have, then there's me, and then I have another brother named Matthew.  I am sixty-two, so Matthew is sixty.  Then, next to him is a sister, name Wavonia, who lives in Georgia now with my--all of these people that I am going to name now all live in Georgia.  Then next to her is a bother named Willie, and then next to Willie is a sister named Theresa, who actually is one that is out of the place.  She lives in Dallas, Texas though--and she is the one that is out of place.  She and I are the only two that are out of place.  Everybody else is in Georgia, and then next to Theresa is a brother named Roy and then next to Roy is a big sister  whose name is Patty.  And these--of the eight of us, six people live in Georgia now.  Although we have lived all over the world, my brother Roy, whose name I mentioned actually retired from the Air Force.  He has lived all over the world.  He managed to make his way back to Georgia.  So (laughter) everybody has that that homing pigeon concept.  So everybody makes it back home eventually.  Maybe I will make it back one day.
Story_ID: 19857
Speaker 1: Describe for us a little about what holidays were like in your house growing up?  Were they very special occasions, Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving?  What were those holidays like?
Speaker 2: Well I told you my favorite time of the year was, and still is Christmas, I still believe in Santa Claus.  So, I am one of those people who never gave up on (laughs) Santa Claus.  It is an exciting time of the year for me and it goes back to my childhood to parents [Flora and Frank Smith Sr.] who really wanted to make it a special time of the year for their children.  Although there was a very large number of us--there were eight kids, so you know any time you got to buy eight of anything, that's a lot.  So they created all of these additional things to go with whatever toy you had.  You got candy and fruits and nuts and whatever and you got the excitement of Santa Claus, the magic of Santa Claus coming down the chimney.  So, yes it was an important time of the year for me.  I think for Easter, the other center of our life was the church, and I have described earlier that the church and the school were in the same location for the first several years.  Not only did we go to church on Sundays, and sometime Sunday afternoon BTU [Baptist Training Union] and on  Saturday occasionally we would go back for some kind of gathering.  But, on Monday, you were right on the church grounds for school.  So the church was a big deal for us, and a chance on weekends for people from--family members and friends from distant parts of the county to come together and check on each other and talk about how everybody was doing and if somebody's house got burned down they would bring a little collection for them, and then food and whatever and if somebody's cotton wasn't in and if ours was in and yours wasn't, people would gang up to go out and help you get yours in so you could try to eke some kind of a living out of that terrible cotton system that was set up down there so, it was an important part of the year, and it was an important part of our life and so a lot of my memories are memories that are associated with that too.
Story_ID: 19858
Speaker 1: The whole process of picking the cotton and that kind of thing, do you remember what that was like or what you were told so you--the cotton was picked and then what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, now I lived on this plantation which was owned by a man who not only owned the cotton fields, but he owned the fertilizer company, and he owned the cotton gin, and he owned thousands of acres of land, so he had a number of people who lived on his place, and then in addition to that at the crucial times when the crops were being harvested, cotton and peaches, there were hundreds of other migrant workers who were brought on to work those crops.  So, it was a big deal and for us it created a chance for us as kids to work a little bit, to contribute to our own upkeep, and to help--but I think again the important thing is for us was that my father [Frank Smith Sr.]--we had to go to school.  It was important to him.  He never got much education himself but he was determined to get all of his kids out of the house and to get them into school.  I would say that of the eight of us, six went to college.  One of them, the seventh [Roy Smith], who didn't go to college, went to the Air force and retired as an Air Force officer, and then it was one who did not go.  He started his own business, and still operates his own business there in the county, but schooling for us was a big deal, and it was something that he saw as a way to uplift his family, and to get them out of poverty and to offer something to them that he never had, and he drove it home to us and I drive it home to my kids (laughter).
Story_ID: 19859
Speaker 1: What were your families' experiences like in church, and can you tell us the name of your church again?
Speaker 2: Well, we were members of--my mother [Flora Smith] and her side of the family were members of a Smith's Chapel Baptist Church [Newnan, Georgia], which has its own story because the Smiths--it gets his name from my great-great-grandfather who donated the land that the church was built on.  So, that's the name of that church, but I remember we lived closer to the St. John Baptist Church which was about a mile and a half from my house, and that was where we, the children, and my father [Frank Smith Sr.] were members, because that was our church and we could walk there from home every day.  My mother's church was far away.  It was about five miles, a little longer walk (laughter) so we did not do that on a regular basis.  We grew up in St. John Baptist Church in Newnan, Georgia which was, not only in the rural areas of this country, and in some places now in the city, a church is not just a place where you get the spiritual awakening that is so necessary in our lives.  It is also a place of social gathering, and as I talked about it earlier, where people decide on how they were going to give charity, perform charitable works to help their neighbors.  They figured out how to help people who were in dire economic straits pull out their crops.  They were also--it was just someplace where we would exchange information.  You didn't have telephones and computers, and all those various other things, so you had to talk all this stuff through.  You did not get to talk but once a week or once every two weeks, so it was an important social institution.  It was a place where people shared experiences and shared  their lives.
Speaker 1: In the Smith Chapel Church that you mentioned, your great-grandfather donated land?  How was it that he came about owning his own land at that particular time?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, he was obviously an industrious man.  I mean he had--his name was--well my grandfather--his name was Jim and obviously was an industrious man--I am sorry Phillip [Smith].  He obviously was an industrious man, he had a great reputation around there for doing things.  He had figured out, I guess how to--the only way I can say this he had endeared himself with the white community to the point where he not only worked hard, but he also performed at some of the--he was a musician.  He played a harp, and so he performed at some of the functions that people had.  So, he was obviously able to make a little extra money and it might have been through that process that he was able to accumulate some land.  But, yes, he was obviously an industrious guy who knew a little bit how to get along and was clever in his doing.
Story_ID: 19860
Speaker 1: You talked a little bit about the plantation that you grew up on in your community.  Can you kind of describe it for us a little bit, and did you have the name of a street or was it a rural route?
Speaker 2: It was a rural route.  It was Route 4, Box 50, Newnan, Georgia, and it was literally a plantation.  It was owned by a man named Roy--when I was born on this place, it was owned by a man named Roy Brown.  Brown eventually sold it when I was about six or seven years to man named Millert Farmer (ph.).  So it became known and--those of  us who grew up on plantations, and also this goes back to slavery.  You know when you live on a place like this, you become known as "Frank, who lives on Farmer's place," and so you have a first name and the last thing that dignifies you is the place where you were born.  It was the very last plantation, over a thousand acres of land.  It looked like it was typical of what I saw in Mississippi as a civil rights worker, and actually saw it in South Africa when I was there looking at some of the places there.  It had a main road that was paved by the time I grew up, and had--then off that road we had a big road which was about a mile long, and then the houses were located along this dirt road, and of course, when it rained it got muddy and you went up and down the bumps, and slid around all over the place.  So you walked through this mud on your way out of there, but, there were probably twelve houses on there and everybody in those houses or by the time I was born were related.  They had, and this is so typical of the way these places developed too.  A kid grows up and marries somebody, and then they get a house down there and if somebody dies, somebody moves into the other house, and so it was always sort of a natural process of not only people, these communities developing where people knew each other and had--you know their children knew each other and associated together, in school, as well as in church and in this little community.  It was a community.  I often contrast it with what I see here in [Washington] D.C. in these communities here where you have almost no relationship between children and their parents and grandparents, and there is no social community out here which is putting pressure on people to stay married, and to raise their children and try to do well and where if some kind of disaster happens like a fire, people gather around and try to help you get going.  We've lost a lot of that in the city, and I think that is something we got to figure out how to recreate here.
Speaker 1: And did your parents own the land or did they pay rent for the house and--.?
Speaker 2: None of the above (laughter).  They actually did not own the land.  It was owned by the farmer, whose name I mentioned to you before.  We lived in a house where actually the arrangement was that we did not have to pay any rent.  We had a loan.  Everybody worked for this man.  So they didn't--then they got paid the minimum wage and they--part of their payment was that they did not have to pay any rent.  Now, the other side of that, was that you were in these little houses that had no running water.  When I finished high school to go to college, I graduated high school from my house with no running water and outdoor toilet, and we had got electric lights.  I was probably--with no telephone and--for a kid now they would die because (laughter) they don't know what to do without their cell phones, but trust me we did not even have a telephone in our house.  We had one house on the place that had a telephone for emergency purposes, obviously, so, if there was a disaster, you needed an ambulance or you needed a fire engine or something or the police, you had to go to this house and they would make a call for you.  Now, when I was growing up, that house, the overseer for this plantation lived in that house, and that house by the way had running water, but none of the others did.  So, it was pretty bad living conditions in terms of--and we are talking about--I finished high school in 1959.  So, I am not talking about slavery time you all, (laughter), I'm talking about the 1950s and 1960s, and in some cases this is probably still going on in some of these places now.  But, yes, that's where I grew up, where I got my start, that's where my lessons--and you know I think for people who are watching it is important to understand that, these are the circumstances that people were born into.  These things are not new to us, first of all, and secondly, people look at this a lot of different ways.  But it's important for parents and for the community to want to see kids do well, and to tell them that from the time that they are small.  That they are good and honorable, and you care about them, and then to reinforce that.  You know, rewarding them when they do well and push them along, and tell them you expect them to do well.  People told me that all of my life.  They said, "Look, you know we are counting on you.  You've got to do something to make this a better place."  Everybody heard that when I was coming up.  That is what they heard in school, that's what they heard in church, that's what they heard from their families, and that's what they heard from their neighbors.
Speaker 1: 'Cause your circumstances don't define you?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 19861
Speaker 1: What was the name of the elementary school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Okay, I told you I started out at the St. John Baptist Church School [Newnan, Georgia].  That was the name of my elementary school.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was prior to elementary school.
Speaker 2: No, no this was my elementary school.  Now, I gotta tell you, the reason I was at the St. John Baptist Church School because in Coweta County when I was coming up, there was no public school for black people.  There were public schools for white kids, but there were no public schools for blacks.  Black people went to the church school on the church ground.  We walked to school everyday.  There were public schools for whites, and there were school buses for white kids to ride to school.  Those kids rode to school, passed us every day, and every once in a while they would slow that bus down, and let kids spit out of the window at you, so they could humiliate you even further.  Now, let me just say that my father [Frank Smith Sr.] was paying the same taxes everybody else paid.  He worked like the dickens for whatever money he made.  If he bought something at a store or any place, he had to pay for it the same as everybody else.  He paid the taxes.  He paid whatever the state and county tax, city tax that everyone paid.  They were taking money from his paycheck and providing schools for other people, but they did not provide schools for blacks.  Now this went on throughout the South up until the middle 1960s [1960s].  So, this is--yes, I went to the St. John Baptist Church, and by the time I had got to the fourth grade, they had built a public school for black people.  At that point I went to the Northside Junior High School [Newnan, Georgia].
Speaker 1: In the fourth grade?
Speaker 2: In the fourth grade, which was made out of--and by the way at the St. John Baptist Church School we had seven grades and one teacher.  All of us were in the same classroom with one teacher, and later I would learn about something in [Washington] D.C. called "open space" teaching, where you have all these kids in an open area--well that's how I started out, out of necessity, and the way that works is when the teacher does long division everybody in the room that can do long division comes to the front.  It had nothing to do with your age.  It had to do with ability grouping.  And so, when she taught reading--the second-level reading everybody who could do second-level reading, and as you could imagine some people stayed in the front all day long and some people stayed in the back all day long (laughter), but as soon as I learned that if I did well in school, I did not have to work on that plantation picking cotton, I became a very good student.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your teacher's name?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) for the first grade?
Speaker 1: That teacher's name, yes.
Speaker 2: Taylor, Ms. Taylor.
Speaker 1: And so in the fourth grade you went to Junior High School.
Speaker 2: I went to--well, I went to what is called the Northside Junior High School, yes.
Speaker 1: But, was it an elementary school when you attended in fourth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was--(unclear), yes, because it had all the grades there. They had first through seventh grade.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: There were a lot more people there, obviously (laughter).  Now we were out of my little cocoon of community sort of school and community church to a place now where they consolidated several of  these church schools into one school, to the Northside Junior High School, and so you had more people obviously, being bused on these hand-me-down buses, to these hand-me-down books at this hand-me-down school.  Well, it was actually--it's very interesting.  This building was made out of used wood.  Why would you construct a building, a new school out of that, and they used this tar-paper looking stuff for outside.  There was no inside.  There was no paneling or anything on the inside walls, and so it was interesting how this whole system worked.  How, they--even when they decided they had to do what is called--they were finally trying to implement "separate but equal" by the way.  At this point, this is 1949 or '50 [1950] or so, they are now trying to implement "separate but equal."  Ever since Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 they are now (laughter) trying to implement "separate but equal" because they knew that us having to provide our own schools on the church ground wasn't separate and equal.  They knew that.  Taking our tax dollars, providing all the white kids with buses.  That wasn't equal, so they said, "We better try to get these kids some school buses and get them a building," and that's what they came up with.

Speaker 1: Could you please tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of your childhood, that remind you of growing up in Georgia?
Speaker 2: What sights?  I have a distinct memory of sitting on my front porch as a kid in this little shot-gun house we used to live in.  On Sunday mornings, getting ready--actually for church, shining my shoes, but actually looking out over the landscape and seeing the tree lines in the sky, and actually I looked towards downtown.  So, I moved--I know the exact direction I was looking at, and I remember thinking how peaceful and beautiful it was.  All this was, and how it could--it was a way of really reminding us of God's greatness and nature and all that.  So, that's a memory that I have and occasionally I look out over the sunrise or sunset, or I'm in an airplane or something and I look out and see something that reminds me--takes me back to those days.
Speaker 1: And what sounds and smells remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, for the sound part of it, there is a very close relationship with the music between the church music and the blues and the songs that we sang, and I grew up in a little church that did not have a piano when I was a kid.  So people actually sang.  You know, you could just--and those same songs they would sing in the fields at times and stuff, so, the songs--some of the songs--that later, by the way, became songs that were converted by the Civil Rights Movement into marching songs and picketing songs and songs of protest.  Yeah, I have some memories of the songs that were--go back to my childhood.
Speaker 1: And what smells?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd guess you'd have to say my grandmother's [Emilou Smith] pot cooking on the stove.  Well more than that, my grandfather [Wade Smith]--I got to tell you this, he used to drink coffee that was so strong, that in order to get this coffee strong enough for him, my grandmother would leave coffee grinds in the pot all week long, so long about Friday or Saturday, you could smell it all around there (laughs).  It was a great smell, and created such a nice environment.  So, yeah, coffee smells.
Speaker 1: So Starbucks had nothing on your grandmother.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) No, no.  My father [Frank Smith Sr.]--you could put a spoon in my grandfather's coffee.  It wouldn't even go to the bottom (laughs)

Speaker 1: During the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was before television, it was before the--the only real contact we had with the outside world on any kind of consistent basis was the newspaper.  My family didn't get the newspaper, but my aunt, whose house had the telephone in it took the newspaper.  She, by the way, also got the first television for the area.  So, her house was a big deal for all of us because she had a television, a telephone and she also took the newspapers.
Speaker 1: What newspaper do you remember?
Speaker 2: The Atlanta '[Journal-] Constitution', the Atlanta newspapers, because we lived--Newnan [Georgia] was only 30 miles from Atlanta [Georgia], so we got television, we got the Atlanta stations, we got--and I remember reading it as a kid, I would read the newspapers, and I guess I have to say the sounds of baseball.  My father [Frank Smith Sr.] was a big baseball fan.  We had one of those radios that did not play all the time.  You had to bang on it sometimes to make it play, right, and get the sound back up.  And I'd be right there with him.  We'd try to figure out what the score is in the baseball game.  So, he--I think--you know I started out dreaming like most kids in the country that one day I'd be a Jackie Robinson, and I'd be able to swing that bat and run those bases and figure out how to get out of there and be famous and do something great and wonderful.  Then I met another guy one day, he had a curve ball, and you know--on the baseball field and I agree with those guys who say a curve ball is an optical illusion.  So, what I figured out, I wasn't going to be able to hit no curve ball, I figured I'd better find another way to make a living.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects during elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always liked to read, and I still do.  I love reading.  I tell kids this all the time.  When reading you can take yourself to another place.  You can lift yourself above your circumstances.  You can go some place else with a book.
Speaker 1: And did you escape a lot through reading?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I still do.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite authors or books when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I had any favorite authors or any favorite books.  But I will tell you that I remember reading a book called 'Rebel Without A Cause,' which was the first story that I read about the Civil War, and I must have been in the eighth grade or something.  So I must have been fourteen or fifteen years old.  At that point, I had moved to reading more series type of books, and it was one of the first stories that I read about the Civil War itself.  I don't remember much about the book now, but I remember reading it from cover-to-cover, and I remember one of the characters in the book was a guy who had actually had a toothache that eventually drove him crazy, because they did not have any medical treatment for it, except to pull it out and he did not want them to pull it without any anesthesia, so he just suffered through the whole--you know, it's kind of a crazy scene.  But, yeah, it--I have always read a lot.  I still do.  I have books all around me, all around my bed.  I read more than one book at a time (laughter).  I have been known to do that (laughter).  I start reading, I don't like it, put it down, pick up another one, and don't like that one, pick up another one, so I am reading three or four books at one time.  I enjoy it.

Speaker 1: And during the elementary school years, what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I told you as soon as I found out that if I did well in school, I did not have to go out there on that plantation and pick that cotton.  I became a good student.  I was always a very good student at school and I was active in the various associations, you know, the president of the student body, the public speaker with the New Farmers of America state competition in public speaking, and won one year the state competition, and came in second another year in high school, and then went to college at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I was still--I think the only freshman that ever made the Morehouse College debating team.  I got interested in that primarily--and then started out by the way in my childhood in church with people asking me to do this and this and this, and eventually being pushed forward to do the--to read things at Easter, Christmas and then being pushed forward to read the announcements in the church and all that.  These things are very important to children.  I think that it is important for parents to know, and to believe that those little things count, and if they do them, that one day they are going to pay off with a young person being able to use that to keep themselves going.
Speaker 1: And what type of child were you during the elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Well, if you talked to my mom [Flora Smith] she will tell you that I was a model kid who never gave her any trouble and all that.  So, I asked her one day, "If that is true, why did you all use to beat my butt so much?"  (Laughter).  Maybe they had to do it for exercise or something (laughter), so, depending upon who you ask (laughter), you ask her she says I was a model kid.  I was probably--I am sure I have always had a certain amount of--I've always been strong-willed, to a certain extent, and that will get you in trouble, even as a child.  So, and I remember one time I did something that was absolutely--I would look back on it now as being stupid.  But, it was so typical of me.  We were--I told you I lived on this farm, and my cousins all lived--and, you know when it rained a lot you couldn't really work around there.  So, one of those days we decided we were going to go into town to the movies, and so I asked my father [Frank Smith Sr.] about it and he said "No, you can't go."  So, I said, so, you know I started thinking.  I said, "What is wrong with this?  This is nothing wrong, I'm just talking about it and I'll be back before he gets home from work anyway."  So I went out, and so we went downtown.  We had to walk back and my father passed me on this truck.  You know as fate would have it, he was going out somewhere to pick up something, and he saw me and he screeched on his brakes and backed up.  "So, I thought I told you not to do"--(laughter)--he wouldn't even give me a ride home (laughter).  He said, "I'll get you when I get off". So he went off.  So not only did I have to walk home, I took a pretty good butt whipping when (laughter) he finally showed up.
Speaker 1: He gave you plenty of time to think about that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter), that was one mistake I made.  I don't know why I would have ever done that, because I should have known that he would find out sooner or later, but, yes, I think I was pretty strong willed.  We were probably all mischievous when we were young, tested the limits, pushed to see how far we could go and, you know the rules were pretty strict at my house.  If you violated the rules you were punished (laughter).  I knew that and I should have known better.
Story_ID: 19865
Speaker 1: During the junior high school years, like that pre-teen, "tween" years, what are some of the things that you enjoyed doing with your time and who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Well you know, I grew up on a farm so I had one advantage of growing up on a farm, you learn responsibility early.  I know that because my grandchildren were born in [Washington] D.C.  My children and my grandchildren were born here in D.C. and at an early age you had a pet that you had to take care of.  When you got to be big enough, your parents would take you to the field with them because they did not want to pay a babysitter.  So you had to carry water, you had to do--and you had responsibilities.  You had to cut wood and bring the wood in at night and wash the dishes and everybody had jobs and duties and chores and responsibilities, because it took all of this to make the household work, and if you did not do your little part, if you didn't bring in the wood, there was no wood to cook with and there was no wood to make a fire with.  So you had to do your job, and I was taught responsibility early.  Most people who grew up in the rural areas are taught responsibility early.  They are taught that they can do things, and that they have to do things to make the whole system work.  So everybody I think learns that, and I learned that too as a kid.  I also learned, I think I knew at an early age that this--I knew the family and the community and all this was important to me, and that they were part of my life.  They protected us.  They set a fence around us in a sense in a way of thinking, in a way of speaking.  So that was important and I knew that important, and also these teachers, my schools, I think these teachers knew pretty early that not everybody was going to do well, but the advantage of that classroom where the kids who did well came to the front of the class all of the time, I am sure by the end of the school year they knew who the students were that were going to do well.  Also, by then they were also pairing us up with other students.  So they had you helping some other kid who wasn't doing well. Because there was no way you could manage all those classrooms with all those grades in there.  So, again it reinforces that sense of responsibility.  It was an environment that actually produced a lot of people who did well and who--now it's kind of interesting, a lot of those people ended up leaving the South to go north to better themselves.  I wound up in Washington, my brother [Roy Smith] in the Air Force, there's two other sisters back in Georgia, now they went to Texas, they stayed in Dallas after college.  They eventually came back to Georgia, but you had a sort of brain-drain going on down there and my guess is that it's going on in the white community too.  That progressive mind that white, ambitious white people who don't want to be brought up in the system of racial segregation and bigotry leave the South too.  So they end up going away, and living in the cities where they can live in a more a more humane and a more worthwhile environment and you know my family left there, particularly my father's side of the family and went to Chicago [Illinois] in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and my father [Frank Smith Sr.] even went to Chicago, and then my mother's side of the family all went to Dayton, Ohio to work in the steel mills.  So people had to leave to look for jobs, and the people who were leaving were the brightest and the best and the most ambitious ones that were leaving and so the South was deprived of all of this.  I think still is, deprived of this kind of talent and leadership.  I think they aren't happy about it, but the fact is that it hasn't developed very much and it's probably not going to develop very much until it reverses trend.  Some of it is starting to happen now.
Story_ID: 19866
Speaker 1: How old were you when your father [Frank Smith Sr.] went to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was a baby.  Right after I was born he decided he was going to go to Chicago with his brothers to find a job.  My mother [Flora Smith] had told him before he left that she wasn't going to go.  So he went up there and actually found a job and a little place, and she had said, "No".  So he eventually came back.  He was only there for a little while and came back to Georgia because he was not going to be able to stay with his family and he decided that he was going to go back.  His brothers all stayed and in the end he and two sisters were the only ones out of eight of them, I think eight or nine, were the only ones that ended up on Georgia and actually the brother who ended up there went to Chicago and stayed twenty years before he came back and lived out his life there in Georgia.  So most of his family members went off to Chicago in the migration process to work hard.  Another feature of all of those families was that they--this whole migration process was almost the exact same for every family.  You know, one guy goes up and gets a job working in the slaughter house.  He is a good worker, and these guys who grew up in these farms are used to working hard.  They work long hours.  They did not mind the work, so you now you got a guy here and you ask him if he has any brothers and recruits his brothers all the time and says, "Hey, look man when you finish high school and get old enough, I am going to find you a job."  He is already talking to the men that, so then you got two brothers now working in the slaughter house and then they are living in the same house, they were all rooming in the same rooming house, with the same landlady.  So you know they all got part-time jobs in the service station, and eventually they even moved their families up there.  They also would occasionally send money back home to Georgia to help take care of people down there.  So, this whole process I think worked for them to better themselves and also to move their families along.  But, again we had people leaving who would made good citizens wherever they were and would have made good leaders wherever they were and good workers wherever they were.
Story_ID: 19867
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?  What was the name of our high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Central High School in Newnan, Georgia.  I was in one of the first classes--now you have to remember what I started out with.  I was walking to school in a segregated school facility.  By the time I got to high school, they had opened a high school for blacks.  So, we were working--I went to Central High School, which was called Central because it was the high school that all of the county and city schools fed into the one high school.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in high school, like what organizations--you said you were part of the Future Farmers of America.
Speaker 2: Yes, the Future Farmers was the white organization  The New Farmers [of America] was the black organization in effect.  The New Farmers of America was the black organization.  Remember, now we are talking about apartheid here now.  We are not talking about no--we are talking about apartheid now, so, yeah I went to Central High School.  By then, I went from this little one-room school [St. John Baptist Church School, Newnan, Georgia] with one teacher to the--when I got to the Northside Junior High School, this was the first time I ever got into a situation where the students were actually graded.  In order to grade people they had to test people and put them in these grades.  So I went from the fifth to the sixth grade in one year.  I graduated from high school at 16.  (Simultaneous).  So being in the front of that little two-room class (laughter) all that time (laughter)--.
Speaker 1: What other activities were you involved in during high school?
Speaker 2: I was on the debating team.  I was in the dramatics club.  I sang in the choir.  I don't know why they let me in the choir. I never could sing, but I guess they needed bodies.  I thought I was going to play basketball.  That did not work out.  So I became the announcer for the basketball team, for the athletic teams there.
Speaker 1: And, what kind of social life did you have in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, like most high school students a lot of the social life revolved around the school and also the church, but mostly around the school, because by the time we get--again, church is a lot of mostly relatives (laughter), people you've been with most of your life and so, a lot of it revolved around school, and around your school activities, and for me this was difficult for me because I lived on this farm.  I lived three miles from downtown Newnan.  So, for me to negotiate all of this after school, you know you stay behind and practice and then you have to get home, my father [Frank Smith Sr.] got off from work at five o'clock, so if I got finished in time I could walk over and catch a ride home with him, but if that did not work out, I was--sometimes you had to walk or you had to find another way to get home.  So, even being in after school activities was a more difficult task because there was no convenient public transportation and no parent with a station wagon to pick you up.
Speaker 1: And I think people forget about that sometimes when we talk about African Americans in rural communities, because it's very different than in the city.
Speaker 2: It makes a big difference where you live, and when you have public transportation or you live close enough to walk.  It makes a big difference, but we managed to negotiate it and to make it work.  My father and uncles and cousins would give me a ride sometimes, and then there was a bus that ran out there at 8:00 p.m. so I could catch the bus for about $.50, a Greyhound Bus, and you would pull the thing and the bus would slow down and you could stop and get off there. Then I had to walk three-quarters of a mile from the main road, up the dirt road to get to my house.  So, it all worked out, but you know again, I enjoyed it.  For me it was a part of life, it was a part of growing up.  It was something that gave me the spirit and the toughness and the ability really to survive in life and to make a good life for myself and my family.
Speaker 1: Did you date in high school?
Speaker 2: Of course (laughter), I had a good time.
Speaker 1: And like how did you manage dating in a rural area?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) it wasn't easy, but love will find a way (simultaneous laughter).
Speaker 1: If there's a will, there's a way.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) If there's a will, there's a way.  Well, I had friends who had cars and I had one cousin, Ronald Carter, who had a car and on Sundays we would team up.  If I had a couple of bucks for gasoline, he had a car with no money, I had money and no car, and we'd team up and put a couple of bucks in his car and then he'd drop me and pick me up and all that stuff, and then some other buddies, Eugene Elder, William Elder, we ran around together.  So, yeah, we managed to make it work out.
Story_ID: 19868
Speaker 1: Who is influencing you at this particular time in your life during the high school years?  Who are you being most influenced by?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I think my parents [Flora and Frank Smith Sr.] who really believed in education in us and we lived on this plantation which was just, no where to live, and I think my parents had decided that they were getting their kids out of there, and that they were--you know school was the way to do it.  And so, they didn't have any formal education themselves--you have to imagine a parent, who themselves who can't read or write or can't help their kids do their work but they really wanted them to do well.  So, first of all it was my parents, and then I think secondly, the community.  The church and the people surrounding who in their own way wanted us to do well, and then thirdly, teachers.  If you get lucky enough to get one good teacher in your life, you can make it.  That's more important.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any teachers who were influencing you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I think that I had a couple of teachers in high school.  A man named Webb (ph.) was a biology teacher in my high school who took a lot of time with me as a student, and with--taught me an awful lot of things there with him and he was probably a main influence in my life, and then another man named Rosser, R-O-S-S-E-R who was the--now what was he doing?  He was the New Farmers of America--.
Speaker 1: Like the sponsor?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was like the vocational person for the school.  That's what he was.  He was the vocational teacher, and he was the one that got me into public speaking.  He was the one that talked to me about--he'd seen me on stage doing other theme plays and things and he came to me and said, "Look, you know there is this state contest that ends up every year in a trip someplace and you can do this.  I'll go with you on it."  The first year we got into this thing and I got turned on by it and--but he was the one that would pick me up at home and drive me these hundreds of miles to where we needed to go and make sure I got back home in the evening and work with me on the presentations, along with the some of the English teachers, and partly, I would say he did a lot to open up my eyes to what was possible.  It's kind of ironic, because by now I am downtown at the school, Central High School is downtown Newnan, Georgia, where--in the city limits itself there is no farming going on.  Although all these feeder schools coming in there are bringing in people like myself from the rural areas.  So, Mr. Rosser is there sort of as the person who is working--I am sure they created a job for him as a vocational teacher.  There isn't that much vocational training going on in there, and what he and I were doing was figuring out how to give our school a name by entering these contests and making something happen.
Speaker 1: And the year that you won, where was the trip to?
Speaker 2: It was someplace in Georgia, some little town, I can't remember where it was now, but it was some little town in Georgia I never been--Americus or something, some place where I've never been before and wherever it was inside the State of Georgia.  It wasn't Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 19869
Speaker 1: When you were in high school, what were some of your thoughts about college?  What were you thinking about college?
Speaker 2: Well, my thought about college ran two ways.  One was that I had to go to school to get out of there.  There was no way to--it was either college or the military, and the military just didn't have the--I never got interested in the military.  So, and no recruiters ever came to me and asked me about the great possibilities.  I might have been recruited if somebody had come to talk to me about it, but no recruiters ever came to talk to me.  I had a cousin who had--by the time I was in tenth grade, my cousin Willie Horsely (ph.) graduated from high school, and he had been working at the Swinton Hotel (ph.), which is a little hotel in downtown Newnan [Georgia] for working-class white people.  He was the bellman and whatever, and he actually bought me in and introduced me to these people--I got his job there at this hotel.  So, I started work--I guess I was in tenth grade then so--I started--I had a new job now where I could stay in town after school and earn a little bit of money and then catch a ride home, or hook a ride on the bus to get home.  So I had a way now of sort of working to save a little money outside of this whole farm thing, and also there was a man there named Heflin (ph.) who actually managed the place.  A white man named Heflin--actually he was very nice to me.  I don't know very many white people in the South who were nice to me, but Mr. Heflin was nice to me.  He managed the hotel and he--actually, went out--and it was really not much to do around there, quite honestly, so they paid me a little bit of money, like five dollars a week or something, and of the tips I could make, but he also was very instrumental and everyday he'd say to me, "You got homework to do, you can go in my room and do it.  Just if I need you, I'll ring the bell and you can come out."  He had all these magazines and books and things in there, 'Time' magazine and 'Newsweek,' all the things you see around hotel lobbies.  So I was in there when I finished my homework, I read--just read all the stuff so it was--I that think was sort of an unexpected opportunity that sort of fell upon my--that gave me a chance, not only to work and save a little bit of money, but also to read some other things that were not my radar screen and to get interested in--further my interest in going to school.
Speaker 1: And so, where were you thinking you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a cousin, I told you Willie Horsely, who graduated.  You know, up until recently, I thought Willie went to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  It turns out he applied to go to Morehouse, he didn't get in, he went to Tuskegee Institute [sic, University, Tuskegee, Alabama], but for all those years he never came back home (laughter), he never came back--well, at least I never talked to him.  He came back, I'm sure periodically to visit his mother and father, but Willie, I told--really until I was an adult I thought Willie went off to Morehouse College, so that's one of the reasons why I got interested in it.  I knew some guys in Newnan [Georgia] who had gone to Morehouse and who were--had talked to me about the school, and they were recruiters coming there every year to our high school.  There was a time--until really about the mid '80s [1980s] most of the students at Morehouse College were recruited from Georgia schools, and I might add that the test scores were higher too (laughter).  The--but--yes, I got interested in it then, probably because I thought Willie had gone, turned out later he didn't go, but then I knew other people who did.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I finished high school in 1959.
Speaker 1: And you were sixteen years old?
Speaker 2: I was sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: Were there any--were you mature enough for college?  Were you ready for college at (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I told you I grew up on a farm, so I had been, you know, plowing the fields, picking cotton and working and earning money.  I had--yes, I think I was.  You know, I had probably a little bit of what most people have when they leave home.  You know for a little while, you've thought about going back, but--then you just say, "I slept on a rollaway bed with two brothers, my brother Matt and Willie (ph.)", and by then they were both getting big.  When I left they rolled over in my spot, so I didn't have a place to sleep anymore (laughter).  From that point on, when I went home I slept on the sofa.  So, my wife, she is somebody now who still has a room in, at her own house back in South Carolina and still got a telephone in there and all that stuff.  I know that.  I never had any of that when I was a kid (laughter).  So it was up and out and there was no place to come back to.  So, yes, I was always determined that I was going to go away to school and that, you know I was--I was the oldest boy, I had a older sister, but I was definitely the oldest boy, and I always saw myself as having some responsibility to help my younger brothers and sisters and I helped them to get up and out of there.
Speaker 1: And how were you going to pay for college?  Was your father [Frank Smith Sr.] able to afford it?
Speaker 2: My folks? No, they had no money for school.
Speaker 1: So, did you get a scholarship?
Speaker 2: No.  My parents never, ever, ever put a dime into my schooling.  They did not have any money.  They did what they could do for me.  They gave me the spirit and the toughness and whatever I needed to do it.  My father, I tell you he used to--when we went shopping on Saturdays, he would buy groceries for me and canned goods and stuff, and he kept them right there and--so when I came home, I'd come home periodically, about once a month and pick up my canned goods and take them back with me.  So they supported me in that sense.  In the best way that they could.  They had no money.
Speaker 1: So how did you pay for school?
Speaker 2: I went with loans and grants and then I worked.  I did what good old hardworking--I'd been taught to work so I always had a job.  I worked at a department store for a short period of time.  I worked in a little carry-out place where you bellhopped carrying stuff to cars.  I've worked--the summer before I worked there after high school, I worked for the Southern Natural Gas Company.  I ran a power saw.  Cut into a power line right away through the woods so they could build a power line.  My job was to cut the trees down so they could come behind me and put the power line in.  So, yeah, I had a good healthy respect for work and I had a good healthy ability to work and I knew that I had to work to get where I wanted to go and so I worked all the time, and I always had a job while I was in school.
Speaker 1: So you went to Morehouse in 1959?
Speaker 2: Yeah in 1960, and in the spring I got arrested for the first time as member of the Civil Rights Movement there in Atlanta [Georgia].

Speaker 1: When you were at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] what kinds of activities did you become involved in?
Speaker 2: Well in my freshman year at Morehouse I joined the Morehouse College debating team and then--and also in January of that year, I--well not January, in June of that year which would have been--my freshman year would have been in the spring of 1960.  I was arrested for the first time in a civil rights demonstration in Atlanta.  By then the Civil Rights Movement had gotten started.  I had heard obviously about Emmett Till as a junior high school kid in Newnan, Georgia and had read, by the way, from reading the papers about the Montgomery [Alabama] bus boycott that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was leading over there and Rosa Parks and stuff.  So, there was something simmering and brewing, and then by my freshman year we started a big serious demonstration there in Atlanta and went on three years and eventually ended up in Mississippi with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].
Speaker 1: So you were at Morehouse from '59 [1959] to '62 [1962]--
Speaker 2: And then I went off to Mississippi and I came back in '65 [1965] so--.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then did you pledge any fraternities at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Sigma [Pi Phi].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what other activities--so you were on the debate team, civil rights, SNCC and--.
Speaker 2: Let me just say that after my freshman year my timing was, my spare time was consumed in the Civil Rights Movement and about--for a couple of years I was chairman of the Atlanta Student Movement.  So I was--that consumed all of my extracurricular time and activity and so you could imagine by then we were picketing and boycotting and organizing and going to meetings and demonstrations and doing all kinds of things and it was my generation that actually desegregated the City of Atlanta.  So, let me just say this.  When I left Newnan, Georgia in 1959 to go to Morehouse, I took the back of the Greyhound Bus from Newnan to Atlanta.  Now, people might say well, they never rode the back of the bus before--They must have walked wherever they went.  Because if you rode the bus and did not want to get put in jail like Rosa Parks, you rode the back of the bus like everybody else (laughter).  Got to downtown Atlanta, took the Fair Street bus, really the downtown buses--our buses were segregated in the City of Atlanta.  Got to Morehouse College and the first time I was arrested in a civil rights demonstration in Atlanta in the spring of 1960.  We went to the Southern Bell Telephone [and Telegraph] Company to their employment office to apply for a job climbing telephone poles.  Now, by now let me just say I got one year of education at arguably one of the best colleges in the United States.  I ain't about to go out and climb no telephone poles.  For the fact of the matter is, is that they would not even give us a job application.  They did not hire black people and they wouldn't even give you a job application climbing telephone poles.  And when people ask me why we were so involved in the Civil Rights Movement, the reality was that those of us who went to college, even if you finished college there was no place for you to work.  The way segregation worked, you could shop at Richard's Department Store, but you couldn't work there except as domestics.  You couldn't even try on clothes.  You could buy a mink coat at Richard's Department Store in downtown Atlanta, but you could not try it on in the store.  So, you know even if you had money and could afford to buy that mink coat, you suffered the indignity of having to take it off and try it on and bring if it didn't work and try to talk somebody into it.  So at the point that we at the Civil Rights Movement really knowing, even the middle-class people that knew.  They were caught up in this nonsense also.  So they were a part of the Civil Rights Movement along with the rest of us.  But the--our generation was the one that picketed and sat in and one of the reasons that we did it was because we knew that we had to open up these opportunities so at least--so that we ourselves and others would have a chance to function better in this society.  And up until that point, black people in the South who were educated were confined to preaching and teaching and in many of these states--I told you I didn't have the school for blacks in our--but if you--in most of these states in the South, if you graduated from a state school like Fort Valley State [University, Fort Valley, Georgia] and you wanted to go to graduate school, they wouldn't let you into the white schools and there were no graduate schools for blacks, because in many cases they paid for you to go out of state to go to school, and if you went out of state to go to school, why would you come back?  You know, so they were sending their own people out of the state in this crazy system that they had set up down there.  So there was no question about the fact that somebody, someday had to stand up to this system and somebody, someday had to take some time and make some sacrifices to straighten this thing out and I am fortunate to say that our generation was the one that did it.
Speaker 1: So the first time you were arrested you were seventeen years old?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What was that like for a seventeen year old?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all there was a lot of us and my parents [Flora and Frank Smith Sr.] would probably say I was always mature for my age.  I often say to people I really never had a childhood, because when you grow up with responsibilities, and particularly if you are the oldest person in the family--remember there are eight of us now, so by then I'm kid number two and there are six people under me, and so by now I'm helping not only taking care of children in the domestic way, you know changing diapers and spanking butts whenever I had to and telling them how to go straight and do the right thing and I actually have been responsible for them.  I mean your parents, if one of them got hurt and you were outside with them, if they got hurt--your parents held you responsible for them.  So, we had responsibilities not only to take care of animals on the farm, but to take care of your little patch in the field, to cut the wood and all this stuff, but you also had--so children matured faster because they had more responsibilities.  So, I mean I might have been young, but yeah I think as far as my ability to adjust and to handle the situation, and certainly to handle myself I was probably just as well off as everybody else.  I don't think it was ever a problem (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you become involved in SNCC?
Speaker 2: The--my first memory, like many people I have heard talked to from SNCC or any kind of racial thing was this business with Emmett Till.  I remember I was at Northside Junior High School [Newnan, Georgia] and a girl named Jessie Smith brought a 'Jet' magazine to school with her one day, and at lunchtime we were sitting out on the side of the building and she was thumbing through this magazine, and then she  started showing it around to people, and I remember thinking to myself, this was about the time of--this was--I remember thinking to myself, you know at 14 years old that was about my age at the time.  I'm saying to myself, you know anybody could have done this and they could have accused anybody of--and it was a consciousness-raising moment for me and I don't know that I said to myself then that somebody, maybe me, was going to have to do something about this, but I remember thinking that it was not right, that it was horrible that this could happen.  I didn't--you know growing up in the South, we had all had moments--I had two when you've either seen your parents come in these conflicts with white people or you had personally come into conflict with them, and it was tense all the time because some people said, well as long as black people stay in their place they were okay.  We didn't have no place, really.  Cause if you got on the bus and you had to sit in the back of the bus, but what was the back of a bus?  If you got on a bus and sat down and somebody told you to move, and you didn't move, (laughter) they would have told you to get up because they needed a seat, and you had to get up.  So, what might have been the back of the bus then became the--you know, became them telling you to get up.  So you had to move back.  So, we didn't have any place and if you stopped for the traffic light, and I remember one time I was at a gas pump when I was in high school and at a little place called Greentop.  I am pumping, we pull up with my cousin in his car and I am getting ready to put my little $2.00 worth of gas in this thing and some guy pulls up next to me and says, "Wait a minute.  I need this pump.  I got to get out of here," and I said "Well, I was already getting ready to pump (unclear), I paid the folks and I'm getting ready to pump my gas."  He said, "you just got to wait."  I said, "naw, I got to put my gas in here".  So I pumped gas and moved on.  We got in the car and drove off and by the time I got home, somebody had called over here and told my dad that I had a fight with a white man at a service station.  All that had happened between us was that, and they were scared these guys would go off some where and get some kind of a mob and try to (unclear).  So I got home, and my old man was mad, he was scared, sweating and stuff, you know, had his--heard he got his shot gun out see, cause he wasn't going to let nobody--that Emmett Till situation would never have happened to me.  But, it (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause he wasn't gonna let 'em take you.
Speaker 2: That's right, there would have been some cutting and shooting up in there before he let them take his son out of there in the middle of the night.  I can tell you that right now, but, yeah, everybody had these moments and everybody was--lived their life, a fighting life where you had rights and no real security and so we were all caught up in it and it wasn't--didn't take much of a push to get us started there in the movement in Atlanta.  I was a part of it and I am glad I was.
Speaker 1: And, tell us a little bit about how SNCC was established.
Speaker 2: Well you know SNCC was an organization.  It's just was it says it is, "the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee".  So, you hear all these words: 'Student' has its own--we were all mostly college students. Our process, it was 'non-violent'--we didn't believe in violence.  And we were a 'coordinating committee' because it was sort of meant to be voluntary.  You had a bunch of people on each campus who formed their committee on these college campuses and then we worked together--we mostly worked on our own different communities, and then we would meet periodically and just talk about things and at that point in the first year we did not do a lot of traveling back and forth from--to some other place for a demonstration.
Speaker 1: So, did you just meet with folks on Morehouse's campus or did you meet with Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Every school had its own committee.  Clark had one, Morehouse, Spelman, and then we met together and some called the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights.  We formed a committee of committees, and this is actually a (unclear) notion because it contrasts quite differently with SCLC, with Dr. King's organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which was built around him as a leader, a national symbol and then these ministers who represented their own churches.  So you had one organization that was supposed to be more egalitarian young or students making up their minds what they wanted to do and another organization sort of built on the hierarchy with Martin Luther King at the top and then these other ministers and then their congregations forming the masses that they saw.  So, (unclear) you, you can see a contrast there and you can see why we would have been interested in having our own organization as students because we, first of all, had made up our own minds about what we were doing and we had our own special circumstances because we were all students.
Story_ID: 19871
Speaker 1: And so in 1962 you graduated from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  What was your degree in?
Speaker 2: I left school in the middle of my senior year and went to Mississippi, along with a number of other people. That's when SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] decided that we were going to try to go--we were going put together groups of people to go into other areas to work and we were asking students then to leave their college campuses to go into these other areas to work, and I was one of those students.  There were several others.  So there was probably a couple of hundred of us altogether from various campuses who went off to work, and I was one of those people who chose to go to Mississippi as a part of--in the summer--the spring of '62 [1962] in June.  Actually, I went just for the summer.  I decided to take my summer to go over there and I planned at that point to come back to school in July--I mean September to finish my last year of school and I went over there, and I got involved like other people trying to, started looking around and then when I got back to school in September, somebody sent me a news clipping about a man who had been lynched actually.  Who had tried to register to vote the summer that I was there, and they had dismembered his body and dropped him in the river or something and--so, you know this was like--I mean SNCC always knew that one of the methods that the terrorists, racists used was that they would lynch people in these gruesome ways in public.  In public, gruesome ways are a way to scare people like us, and make local people stay in line.  And, so we decided then that we had to go back and continue our work and that was when I decided to leave school actually and took a year off.  I started out taking a year off to leave school and to go back over there because I felt like we had to keep up what we had started, because we had actually put local people in danger.  It was pretty obvious then that we had put all these local people in danger, and it looked like we put them in danger and run off and left them at the mercy of the terrorists who were trying to terrorize them.  So, at that point I decided to go back and stay.
Speaker 1: So you were in Mississippi from '62 [1962] to '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I ended up staying there until '68 [1968].  I was there for a long time.  I did go back in '65 [1965] back to Morehouse for one semester.  But I was there for most of the time.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little about Freedom Summer in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Well, by the time we got to Freedom Summer in 1964, SNCC had decided that--you might remember that, I've been in Mississippi now since 1962.  In 1963, in the spring, Jimmy Travis got shot over in these--these racists used a machine gun to shoot him and two other people in the car in Itta Bena, Mississippi and we had, SNCC had a simple, but a powerful message for people, and that is that if you shoot one of our people, or you hurt, or you arrest one of our people, we bring two or three others to go in his place.  So we were reversing the psychology where you terrorize somebody, you lynch somebody and run everybody off, and scare off, scare all the people in line and scare the civil rights workers off to make them leave.  So, we decided to pull everybody into Greenwood [Mississippi] because that's where Jimmy Travis had been shot.  So I went over to Greenwood, and then over in Greenwood--Greenwood turned out to be the most violent place that in my years in Mississippi, it was the worse place I could have stayed, and it was.  I was only there for about eight months, but it was a terrible eight months.
Speaker 1: What were some examples of the violence?
Speaker 2: Well, not only did they bomb our offices, they shot up cars that we had people in, they dragged some girl behind a car in the city with a--then they lynched some guy on the road that they called us out to see, but this was also the time when they bombed the school [sic, church] in Birmingham [Alabama] with those three little girls in it and Medgar Evers got shot before that.  So, you know it was all just a pattern of excruciating violence that we saw and in the fall of that year SNCC started planning two things.  One of them was a program to challenge the Regular Democratic Party at the Democratic Convention in 1964 by running our own elections.  We were smart people.
Speaker 1: This is the Mississippi Freedom--  (Simultaneously) --Freedom Democratic Party.  We decided to organize our own party in the State of Mississippi and register our own voters, because they would not let us pass the test that they had set up for over there--they wouldn't let us pass that test.  So, we said, okay, we'll set up--do our own tests, and we will register our own voters.  We organized by congressional districts and sent people out to those districts to organize voter registration campaigns and then to choose to organize delegates to come to a state-wide convention and then the state-wide convention to select delegates to go to Atlantic City [New Jersey].  So, SNCC started us in the fall of 1963, and so by the time '64 [1964] rolled around, we had not only a backdrop of all this violence but now we've got this situation where we are thinking about trying to challenge the way the Democratic Party--but at that point the people in Mississippi just figured out, the SNCC people figured out that these people were, they were knocking us off so fast and the violence had reached a point where we had to bring in large numbers of people to help us, not only with that final push for Mississippi for the Democratic Convention, but also to help us shed some outside light on all this violence.  Because I remember quite honestly as I think back on it, I think we probably--I know I did.  I know at that point I had decided that--cause I can remember writing my mother [Flora Smith] a letter about that.  I don't think I ever thought I was going to get out of Greenwood alive.  This is was almost hand-to-hand combat in a very, very violent situation and we were convinced, it turned out later to be verified, that the local police department was involved in this.  That you had the Ku Klux Klan and the police department working together, and you know with them providing intelligence to the Klan about where we were and then sort of turning their backs until the deed was done, and I remember that time they shot up our offices--the offices would get shot up and fire bombed and then fifteen minutes later the police would show up.  We didn't even call them, they showed up.  Well, why did they show up?  Because they knew these people called them in the first place.  You know, by then we knew that the police was involved in all this and that they were aiding and abetting and cooperating and shielding and in some cases even shielding people, so--and we had talked to the Justice Department about this and I want to say one more thing about this.  Even when you get to the Justice Department.  That's why we didn't ever like them.  Never trusted them, never liked them (laughter), still don't.  Even with the Justice Department, you call them up, talk about the pattern of violence and how these people are violating our civil rights and all this stuff.  So the Justice Department showed up in Greenwood and what do they do?  They go to the sheriff and say, "We're in Greenwood because the SNCC staff people here called us to tell us about this pattern of violence."
Speaker 2: And what happened?
Speaker 1: So, now what do they do?  Nothing.  They just--and when they get done, what do they tell this guy?  They are going to come back and interview us.  So these people, I am sure they asked them "Well, when you get through interviewing them, can you see what you got?"  They probably didn't show it to them but--at that point we look at these people and say you know what, their reason for doing this was is that they were white people in Mississippi talking to black people and they probably was scared that they would be targets themselves, if they didn't go and identify themselves beforehand.  So they weren't trying to protect us, they were trying to protect themselves.
Story_ID: 19872
Speaker 1: And so you stayed in Mississippi until 1968.  What did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I moved to Washington, D.C.  In January of--.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go back to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and finish?
Speaker 2: I went back for a semester.  I actually never did finish.  I stayed there for--I had enough of that.  I stayed there for a semester and I never did finish at Morehouse.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you moved to Washington, D.C. in 1968?
Speaker 2: In January '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 1: And what brought you to Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: came here in '64 [1964] as a part of that summer of, SNCC's [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] summer project to lobby for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.  My job was to travel throughout the North to try to convince state delegations in Massachusetts, New York and others to support us when we got to the [Democratic National] convention.  Obviously, when we--you know, our whole purpose was to get there and try to get our delegation seated and get the regular racist Mississippi delegation kicked out.  To do that we had to travel all around the country.  My job was to organize and travel around the country doing that.  I was--actually it was--when I look back at it was actually a great opportunity for me.  It was the first time I had ever been really around the country and in any kind of significant way, and to be traveling to all these various jurisdictions with a purpose where I was meeting with important people and by now I was probably twenty-one years old.  So, you know, I said, "For somebody who started out in a plantation in Georgia with no running water and outdoor toilet, I'm doing pretty good now," so-- (laughter).  So, yeah, it was a widening experience for me and we met with a lot of support.  By then, the public I think, was swinging, the public opinion outside the South was swinging.  People knew what we were up against down there and of course, after [Michael] Schwerner, [Andrew] Goodman and [James] Cheney [civil rights workers] were killed in Philadelphia, Mississippi and the word went out all over the world that you know, that this is not only violence that was happening to black people.  Now, they had killed some white people from--they lynched some white people from the North and so, I think that was when the public just finally got disgusted with this whole thing and by the time we got to the summer of '64 [1964] I think there was a lot of public sentiment around the country.  We didn't get to see the Democratic Convention and it was really disappointing in the end.  I think it disappointed everybody because our cause was just, we had set this thing up properly, we had these people where there was no justifiable reason to seat them, except the politics of people thinking if we kick them out we are not going to carry the South [in the 1964 presidential election], except for the politics which always come into play before the day is done.  I think we knew we had made a great and justifiable case.  We should have been seated.  They should have been kicked out.  It did not happen but I think it really changed--I think the country in a significant way by the summer--by 1965 we were able to get a Voting Rights Act.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  And, eventually the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party did get seated--?
Speaker 2: Well they moved up to a compromise to seat four people from the delegation and Fanny Lou Hamer turned that down, as she should have.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, they agreed to some kind of a compromise but it set the stage for the next phase which was the Voting Rights Act of '65 [1965], and the Voting Rights Act really outlawed the poll tax and the literacy test, provided for the registers to register people in these areas because they were never gonna--if they had left it up to Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia they never would have registered any black people, and thirdly, it provided some criminal provisions for people who violated--who conspired to violate our human rights, and so the combination of those things helped to change the South significantly.
Speaker 1: And so what did you do in Washington, D.C. in 1968?
Speaker 2: Well, I moved here.  Actually what happened when I came in '64 [1964] was I actually was affiliated with the Institute for Policy Studies [Washington, D.C.], which was a left-wing think tank here in D.C. that actually helped us with a strategy for locating our friends in these state delegations around the country.  The guys who ran that had been in the United States Congress, they were part of the [John F.] Kennedy administration, when Kennedy was president.  So they knew their way around the left-wing of this country, you know and all the labor unions and various other things. They were able to sit with us and help us get the strategy and a list of people to contact and so they had actually asked me if I was interested to come back and spend a year or two with them doing research and policy planning, and so at that point I wanted to go back to Mississippi, but trust me, my wife at the time--she was a Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] grad and wanted to get to Howard to a medical school and so, she never let me stop thinking about, "Yeah, you've got a job, I want to go to medical school.  We need to get out of here."  So eventually in January of '68 [1968] I came back to Washington to work at the Institute for Policy Studies where I stayed for several years.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay?
Speaker 2: Well, I was there for at least ten years.  When I finally left there in '68 [1968] to join another small research institute and then by, I'm sorry by '78 [1978] to joint a small research institute and then by '79 [1979] and '80 [1980] I was running for political office.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about some of the work that you did at the Institute for Policies Studies in the late '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] and also what was the climate in Washington, D.C. like?  What was D.C. like?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you know I moved there.  I said I moved to Washington in January of 1968.  Yeah, I remember 19--in April of '68 [1968] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed, and that set off a whole dynamic of political unrest and riots and burning, and looting and all kinds of things.  So you know, it was a terrible day for us here in D.C. and--.
Speaker 1: Were you concerned about that at all?  Like what Washington, D.C. would have to offer so close to after the riots and Dr. King's death?
Speaker 2: Well, you know it--my first thought I have to tell you was that I had--well first let me say, I saw Dr. King the day before he was killed.  I was--I--I--part of my work at the Institute for Policy Studies is that I traveled back and forth to the South a lot.  It was in my contract.  I traveled back and forth to Mississippi a lot.  I--was at an airport in Memphis [Tennessee] when he was coming in from Atlanta [Georgia] and we had--he came across the lobby and asked me about coming back to Memphis to help him organize these young people that he said were causing his movement to turn violent and stuff, and I had a conversation with him in the lobby and I was actually in Mississippi, 'cause I was going--on my--he was on his way to Memphis, I was changing planes to go down to Greenville [Mississippi], and so I was there the day he was killed.  I was in Mississippi the day when he was killed.  So the first day of the riots I was not even here.  I could not even get back into the city because they shut down the airport.  By the second day I was back here in Washington, D.C. so I was able to walk around and see some the devastation and the anger, and the sporadic violence was still going on.  It went on for several days, so, yeah, it was a tough time for me.  I have to say that you know I've always had--it know it might sound--I know my life might sound somewhat chaotic because I've spent so much time in Mississippi.  You might say, "Well, this guy--what was he thinking about?"  I have thought of myself as being somewhat orderly and the one thing that struck me about a riot is when its chaos.  Just absolute chaos.  In all of our demonstrations, in all our organizations we had people who were in charge.  We had--we knew we had our own people there who were sort of negotiating, who were facilitating it, and who were--even in jail.  We had organizations that were in charge of conduct and behavior and how people were gonna act and negotiations and things like that.  In a riot it's just complete chaos.  Just absolutely, complete chaos, and I remember thinking to myself, "You know nothing good can come out of this.  It's just not--there is no point here to what people are doing.  It's frightening.  I did consider leaving at that time, but I think that I also knew that there were an awful lot of people living here who were good hardworking people.  People who were really heartbroken by what they were watching and what they were really frustrated about was the fact that--and that I had shared some of this feeling that it was because King had become such a dominant image in the Civil Rights Movement.  I think part of the frustration was people just not knowing what was going to happen next.  That this was the end of the road, so to speak.  Now, you've seen [John F.] Kennedy get killed, now you've seen King get killed, our enemies have decided they declared war on us and they are knocking off our leaders and you know, what are we going to do next?  So I felt that was--I could see that, I could feel it, I felt some of it with myself quite honestly, and so it was a moment of crisis intellectually and emotionally and politically.
Story_ID: 19873
Speaker 1: What were some of your parents' thoughts about your civil rights activities?  I didn't ask you about that earlier.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you.  My father [Frank Smith Sr.], I told you he lived on this plantation and when the, the first time I was arrested in Atlanta [Georgia] they put all of our names in the newspaper.  Of all these students who had been arrested in this civil rights demonstration and they put, you know, where we were from.  So they put my name and they had my picture in there.  "Frank Smith from Newnan, Georgia".  (Laughter), and of course I told you my father's name was Frank, so it was pretty easy to pick me out (laughter).  My dad said that the man who owned his place called him in and of course--you know, he said, "Look."  So my dad said--I asked him, "So what did you say?"  He said, "Well I told them that you had grown, you left home, you were living on your own.  I didn't have no more control over you, than he had over his children."  (Laughter).  I said, "Oh, in other words you just denied me, the first chance you got."  (Laughter).  He said, "I had six other kids here I had to take of, boy. You was just one of them.  I couldn't afford to get put out of here and get fired so what you talking about?"  Yeah, I mean that one little story right there--because our parents--and people had to learn how to cope too.  Part of living in this crazy situation was that you had to learn how to cope.  Now, I know that he had thought about this.  It didn't sound to me like he had thought about it in a minute before it ever came up.  He was probably surprised, but, you know he never once told me to stop, never, ever, not once, neither he nor my mom [Flora Smith], and whether they agreed with me or not, and they were always glad to see me.  They always asked me where I was.  I always stayed in touch with them, but I can tell you right now they not once told me to stop, and even when I dropped out of school, they did not like it.  They thought I was a little nutty to do it.  You know, I was in--but, on the other hand they knew somebody had to do this and eventually somebody had to belly up to this and they probably figured I was as good as anybody else, maybe better (laughter).  So, yeah, they never said anything about it.  My mother told me she prayed a lot.  Got on her knees cried it out, but she never did tell me that I had to stop.

Speaker 1: You were at the Institute for Policy Studies [Washington, D.C.] for about ten years from '68 [1968] to '78 [1978] and in 1979 you decided to run for the Board of Education?
Speaker 2: Actually, before that I sort of gradually got into--politics--I was a late bloomer--by the way of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people who were here who were in politics.  I mean they were--.
Speaker 1: So was that kind of how it was happening, there were a lot of former SNCC people who were here in Washington, D.C. who were starting to become involved in the whole political scene?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, first of all, many of us had been here from time to time, to meetings and that, various assemblies, several of, of the people were Howard University [Washington, D.C.] students, and so they had lived here and gone to school here and ended up in the South with us and eventually came back here to live.  Probably today, I would say the largest group of SNCC people lives here in D.C.  right now.  And also this is the place where black people are the majority in the population and where they are more educated than--you know blacks than any place else, and so I know it's an attractive place to live.  If you want to go someplace where blacks have some say about what is going on in the politics, this is an attractive place to live.
Speaker 1: So how did you make the transition into politics?
Speaker 2: Well, I started here as a researcher at the Institute of Policy Studies, and I would do policy and planning for them, writing papers, reading books, going to conferences, and I got into a PhD program there and eventually earned a PhD while I was there at the Institute.  So I was doing a number of different things.  Locally, I also lived in an apartment building where there was a--we had a landlord that was not--that was an unscrupulous landlord.  So we eventually ended up with a tenants' association.  I organized it, so I became the chairman of it and started out actually presenting our interests and demands to the political people in the local community and civic associations and then eventually to the city council and the mayor, and so, by then I am getting a taste of this thing and I just eventually decided, "Look if I gotta do this job, I might as well be the official person to do it."  I ran for city council and the first time lost, and ran again--school board.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you ran for city council before you ran for the school board.  What year did you run for city council?
Speaker 2: I think it must have been '78 [1978].  I ran for council against a guy named David Clark;  he beat me and then I think in '79 [1979] there was a school board election, and then I ran for the school board.
Speaker 1: So, when you served on the D.C. Board of Education, what were some of your accomplishments?
Speaker 2: Well, the school system has always been somewhat in disarray here in D.C., now let me just say this--
Speaker 1: What was the school system like in the late '70s [1970s] early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Well, well first of all it was much larger than it is now.  When I was elected to the school board there were probably twice the students as there are now--in the school system now.  That says something to you about the demographics of Washington too, by the way.  It says to you that there are fewer families here and also that the people who are here are having fewer children.  So, I mean people don't just--these children just don't disappear.  The population of the city went down somewhat because the number of families who lived here went down and the average size of the family went down.
Speaker 1: And also--some people may have been sending their children to a private school as well.  Do you think that contributed at all?
Speaker 2: No, not to a great extent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean not--to the--this is--in the last thirty years we have had significant demographic changes in the city.  And among those the most dramatic among those is that you have fewer families with children and the sizes of the families have gone down.
Speaker 1: And so, what were some of the challenges with the school system in the late '70s [1970s] early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Well, some of what we have now.  At that time it was overcrowding and poor facilities, and we had not enough teachers, obviously, because the student-teacher ratio was much higher than it needed to be in the city.  So, we worked hard at these issues.  The--for the first time we started to put together a--the series of schools.  They were specialized schools.  For example, we put the Banneker School of the--the [Benjamin] Banneker Academic High School together and one of my--you asked me about my accomplishments.  That's one of my accomplishments.  I chaired the committee on the school board that actually brought this thing into being, and although we, when were talking about it, we wanted to locate in a more central location than Hine Junior High School over on Capitol Hill.  There was a subway stop there so people who lived in southeast Washington and other sections of the city would have greater access to it, as well as the northwest section of the city.  In the end the political people over there did not want it for reasons which I won't talk about.  So, I said, "Okay you guys don't want it, we'll put it over where we want it, you know we--.  So we ended up at Banneker High School across from Howard University.  It turned out to be a great location for it, because it was right across the street from Howard University, but it was our first academic high school, and it has turned out a great number of students who have gone onto colleges and universities who have come back to become leaders here in our city.
Speaker 1: So when you say it was your first academic high school, what do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: It was the first time we actually had a high school that was--whose purpose and mission was to bring in the students--the top ten or fifteen percent of their junior high school classes into one location, so that those students--and to have their students take a curriculum that was geared to college and higher education.  The other curriculums are more varied and--that's not to say that students from schools don't go to college, many of them do.  So, more than fifty percent of them do.  But, this one was geared to that, and so it was a school we set up here for that purpose.  So, that was one of my--.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  And how do you think Banneker compared to, I believe it was Armstrong [Technical] High School in Washington, D.C.--you know many years before?
Speaker 2: Well, the academic high school you're talking about, is that the one you are trying to get--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --was Dunbar [High School].
Speaker 1: Right, Armstrong--right, Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Dunbar was the academic high school in the old days.
Speaker 1: So, how did Banneker compare to Dunbar?
Speaker 2: Well, Dunbar High School--the reputation of Dunbar High School was that it was built to serve, what they call the elite class of students here in D.C.
Speaker 1: Of African Americans?
Speaker 2: Of African Americans.  Yeah, the people who were the children of the children--you know, the pedigreed class of people who were doctors and lawyers and Indian chiefs, who sent their kids off to a school where doctors and lawyers and Indian chiefs sent their children.  So, it a--it was that kind of a school.  Now, the difference with the Banneker Academic High School was--that--is that any student in the top fifteen percent of their class could come to school over there.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter what your pedigree is.  What matters is that you do well, and you do--at every junior high school throughout the city those students are admitted, and so what you are doing is providing for them the same opportunity that students might have--and I actually thought you were going to ask me about a private school, because basically what--one of the things we were trying to do was to stop this great migration of students to private schools.  Of our good students, we wanted to keep our good students in the public school system.  As much as we could.
Speaker 1: Were you successful at that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: From the Board of Education, you set your sights a little higher, and ran for city council again in 1982, and you were successful, and can you tell us a little bit about some of the challenges facing the city in the early '80s [1980s] when you first sat on the council?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said to you earlier, the population of Washington was beginning to decline, and the people who were moving out of here were not only--not only was this sort of low income family beginning to decline in the city, but also the middle class was moving out, and--to the suburbs, to our--what we call Ward Nine, to Prince George's County [Maryland], and you see Prince George's County is sort of like--it was a waterfall chart, where water is coming out of this side and going some place else.  Where is it going?  It's going to Prince George's County.  So you get these--the Washington, D.C. sort of declining as the mecca of black middle class professionals, Prince George's County developing as that same mecca, and now it turns into the most affluent and--black county in the United States.  So, most of them  still work here in D.C.  So, you saw that happening here, and the tax base was eroding and it wasn't just happening here in D.C.  It was happening all around the country, New York [New York], Chicago [Illinois], Atlanta [Georgia], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  All these cities were losing their professional and middle-class populations, the tax base was moving out and you were stuck--as I said to you about the public school system, were this very large group of people who owned--had a lot of children, were parents of a lot of children and so you had this great critical need for public school education and resources for that at the same time--the base--the tax base was dwindling.  So the city was facing a really tough situation and disinvestment on the part of the federal government was--you know the United States--in most countries, cities are considered the great repositories of wealth and literature, knowledge and you know museum space, and whatever--the United States, that culture never developed.  People think of cities is a group of derelicts who are just, you know,  freeloading who don't really produce very much, and it's just sort of an ironic misconception of the way this country--the way--the education and civilization of this country is kept and passed on to the next generation.  So, America  has never developed a real support for cities and this one, like all the other cities in the country has declined.  You seeing a reversal in that here now, and not just in Washington, but everywhere else too, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit [Michigan].  But, we went through that here in D.C. too, and so we've put together an array of housing programs and educational programs and various other things to try to help uplift this population and to stop this landslide and to stabilize the city again.
Story_ID: 19875
Speaker 1: When did you start become--becoming interested in African Americans and the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Well, you know my background--my whole life has been shaped by the Civil Rights Movement about my interest in equality and while I was in Mississippi--by the way I met a man up in Marshall County--Holly Springs, Mississippi who was a descendent of a Civil War soldier.  He had his grandfather's uniform and his rifle and he talked to me about this man, and so here I am standing here now in Mississippi--with--in a county where there aren't any black people registered to vote, and where the sheriff is arresting civil rights workers like crazy, and where--almost a hundred years ago, there was a black sheriff and a black mayor.  There was a black [U.S.] senator, Hiram Revels is buried here in this county, at a place called MCI College [sic, MIC, Mississippi Industrial College] there in Holly Springs, and yet, yet, a hundred years later when I get here, black people aren't registered to vote.  They have no rights that white people are bound to respect, and who is this man showing me his rifle and his uniform that belonged to his grandfather, who had been a Civil War soldier.  I never heard of this before, and I am not even sure I believed all of it when I heard it.  I did get interested and I started reading about them and then many years later I was a council member here in [Washington] D.C. when this city had been devastated by the riots of '68 [1968], when we were now talking about how are we going to rebuild this area, and turn it into a place where people want to come to.  I convinced the city, and by now, I was on the city council, so I convinced the city that--first of all--we started out saying we wanted to build something here that would be a national monument, but would rival, compete with the mall, that would be good enough so people would say, "I want take a trip up there to see that."  So you start out with that, then the next question is, what are you going to build, and then how are you going to get the information you need, the money, whatever, that--you know.  So at that point I, you know, people would say, "Well, whatever it is you got to raise the money for it."  So I said, "If I got to raise the money for it, I think we should build a monument for these soldiers who fought in the Civil War."  Nobody has ever done it before, they've been neglected for a long time.  By then, I had read every book I could find.  I knew where the information was, and we had talked about it among ourselves, and so we finally put together a group and the rest of it is history.
Story_ID: 19876
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit more about your tenure on the city council during that time.  You were a city council member when Marion Barry was Mayor of Washington, D.C., and can you talk a little bit about what impact you think his legal troubles had on the city?
Speaker 2: Well, let me back up a minute before we go back there.  When, in 1976 I had looked at all this demographic data on the city of Washington, D.C.  In 1976, D.C. had about 23,000 employees.  Of those 23,000 employees, probably eighty percent of them were white.  Washington, D.C., because it was run by a committee of Southerners.  This guy named [James] Jim McMillan, from South Carolina was the chairman of the D.C. committee.  D.C.'s city hall looked like the city hall in Columbia, South Carolina.  That's right. Washington D.C.'s city hall, you could fill out a job application to be a police officer in D.C. in South Carolina.  So, now, we had this crazy situation where you had a city of seventy something percent black with the largest black middle class in the country being administered by racist white people from the South, who had no interest in us ever having a job, or ever having any political or economic position here.  So, we had this great contrast developing.  Now you got this influx of civil rights workers coming in here from, you know, Marion Barry, myself, Ivanhoe Donaldson, people who are now veteran civil rights workers.  You know, we started out in college, five years in Mississippi.  So you know, hey, something's got to give.  So you get this almost from the beginning, this sort of activist interest in trying to turn this into a better place.  The same rights to vote and to be a participant in our process, and to be a citizen in our own town, that we had carried with us, that desire that we carried with us through the South, we now brought to Washington, D.C.  So, yeah, there was, yeah there was--I mean we met here some of the same people we met down there, except now they are calling themselves congressmen and senators.  They had titles next to their names, but that didn't mean anything to us (laughter), so, now and at a point--there was a point when Marion Barry left office about 1990. The District of Columbia had almost 40,000 employees, and of those 40,000 employees, seventy percent of them were black.  Now, it is a fact that minority groups throughout this county have used civil service and public service to move into the middle class.  The Jews have done it, the Irish used the police department.  You go up to Boston [Massachusetts] and all these other places, the labor unions, the firemen's union, they all used and actually bring their kids in their as volunteer firemen, and when a job opens up, just like I was talking about my cousin back there in Chicago [Illinois], they do the same thing.  So, what you saw happening here in D.C. was something similar to that.  It was probably the reason why you see this very large black middle class out in Prince George's County [Maryland] I talked about, and up in the Gold Coast of northwest Washington.  In many of those cases you had two family members, husband and wife, both working in the government.  Combined income, 120-, $130,000 a year, they could buy a house and could send their kid to a good school.  They can do whatever.  So, when it's all said and done about what happened here during that twenty-year span of time, one of the things that happened here was that D.C. developed the largest black middle class in the country.  So, and Marion Barry and myself and others were the architects of that.  So, let's just put that out there first (laughter). That's a fact, you can go back and look at the demographic figures.  You see it, as it changes and it never would have happened--actually, it happened without displacing a lot of whites, because--and this by the way is an issue that they are facing in South Africa right now.  You know, and other places as blacks begin to take over and demand their fair share of the jobs and of the housing and of the economy, the equity in these investments, contracts in government offices, blah, blah, blah.  As they begin to demand their fair share, as they should, which is the only way they ever are going to be equal, then this issue arises of, well, you know with affirmative action, he's taken a job, Frank Smith is taking the place, a job, he's taking the contract some place, where a white person would have been able to get it.  So now, you got this competition between the two of them, and so you get these guys going to court saying that affirmative action is reverse discrimination.  That they are using this now to block out people who would have been able to get--so this issue still dogs us today.  But, in the City of Washington, D.C. you saw that, and it happened during the time that we were--that I was in the government, and you saw the city develop a lot of different programs, a rent-control program so that people couldn't be put out of their properties, with escalating rents in some controlled environment that was being approved by a rental agency.  We had a housing program, the first right-of-purchase housing programs, which I got my start here in D.C. and my real start in politics when a developer bought up the whole street, called Seaton Street, S-E-A-T-O-N Street over near 18th and U Street.  The--he brought up the whole street.  Twenty-six families and he sent all these families eviction notices at one time.  These people had been living there forever.  Sent around eviction notices and told them they had to get out, and so we organized.  I was a community organizer.  I wasn't even in political office.  I was a community organizer by then.  So I organized these families and went back to the owner and said, "If you got to--the law says now, that in order for you to sell this property, you have to offer to these tenants."  So, he knew the tenants didn't have any money, and he didn't bother to do.  He violated the law.  So I made him back up and apply the law to them, and by then I had raised enough money so these people could buy their houses, and that was almost thirty years ago, and I will tell you that most of those families are still living there today, and properties have appreciated in value tremendously, and would not have been living there if we hadn't organized them and got them together and then to--.  So that law really enabled us now to not only expand it across the city so others could buy properties when they were offered for sale, but we later, in my tenure in the council, we added now multi-family buildings.  So, that if you lived in an apartment building and the owner wanted to sell the apartment building, today in this town, the tenant's getting the first right to purchase it.  We set up an office to assist the tenants, so that they would be able to buy.  So, one of the roles the government has to play--the government gains its moral right to be, from its responsibility to collect, to protect the poor against the rich.  You know, it gains its moral right to be, by its responsibility to defend and protect its senior citizens who can't or are too old to protect themselves, and children too young to protect themselves.  And when it doesn't do that, then it doesn't have a moral right to exist.  You know, we should find some other, something good in its place (laughter), so, and I think you saw us developing programs like that here in the District of Columbia leading the country in developing these programs, and it's as it should be, because you had people who were running the government, with people who were grounded in the Civil Rights Movement, who had really come to power here and come to attention of the public because they trusted us to try to implement those things.
Story_ID: 19877
Speaker 1: Do you think that Marion Barry's arrest was a setback for all of these accomplishments that you talked about, or do you view it as, this was you know, the individual actions of one man and didn't impact on a whole group or race of people.
Speaker 2: Well, his arrest set back some people to an extent, because it gave the opposition an example that they could point to, as somebody who was violating the law himself, who sat in high office when he was violating the law.  Anytime that happens, with anybody, whether it's a congressman or a senator, or a president even.  You know, we had a vice president here, Spiro [Theodore] Agnew, who was taking money in the White House. You know, you had--Richard [Milhous] Nixon resigned because he was trying to cover up a crime over there, where they were breaking and entering and stealing and carrying on.  That's why he had to leave office, so anytime something like that happens to a high official, people use that to say, there is something wrong with the system, there is something wrong with this democracy.  There is something wrong with this community.  In this case they said there is something wrong with these people.  They made it racial with Marion Barry, but the fact is that nobody made it racial with Spiro Agnew.  They just said Spiro Agnew was a thief.  But, yeah, it was an important symbol because there are so few black people that will achieve this level, so it made a significant difference to people.  And, also there were a number of poor folk over here that were depending on him.  There were people who were counting on him, whose sole hope in the success of this system rests in what they thought was his ability to manipulate it and influence it and to make it work for them, and so when he was brought down by his, you know his extravagant drug habits and things, their hopes and ambitions were brought down with him, yes.
Speaker 1: What do you think of his political comeback, second political comeback?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he's got a message, and I think you know, with me the glass is always half full.  I think that, first of all, I think the people deserved the right to elect him.  It was an open, a fair election.  The lady he defeated, I saw a quote from her in the paper, she said that there are people who voted when Barry runs, who never voted any other time.  I think everybody ought to vote.  If it takes somebody like him to get them out to vote, then I say, more power to him.  I think it is important that their vote counts.  It is important that the system work.  It is important that democracy has a way to represent everybody.  So, I think that to some extent, it is important for him to be like that.  And secondly, let me just say that this government has become so downtown oriented, so pro-developer that it needed a little stirring up.  It needed stirring up like that commercial where that guy with this chocolate milk, you know, he goes through all these elaborate things to stir it up.  This thing needed stirring up.  Barry stirred up, and I just hope his health holds up.  I am praying for him, I hope he keeps not just his physical health, but his mental health holds up too, and that he understands that he cannot violate himself, and the public trust that we put in him, that he's got to now do better at this and that we will be watching him, and that we hope that he will keep it straight, but he will stir things up, and it needs stirring up.
Story_ID: 19878
Speaker 1: In 1998 you left [Washington] D.C. city council and tell us a little bit about the Civil War memorial project that you began working on.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I told you I met this man who told me about his--and then we decided to build this African American Civil War memorial--that we knew when we started this that first of all, it was going to be controversial because there must be two thousand history books out here that are written about the Civil War that have no mention of African American Civil War soldiers (laughter). So, you know--
Speaker 1: And in fact hundreds of thousands of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that people--they made no mention, and so now here we are saying, wait a minute, you guys gotta back up and redo all this, reevaluate all this because now we are getting ready to tell the story from the point of view of the slaves.  Slaves who became soldiers.  These guys went from soldiers--slave to soldier to citizen.  [Pinckney Benton Stewart] Pinchback was the governor of Louisiana, was a Civil War soldier who later became the governor of Louisiana, and went on to become a higher official here in the District government.  These guys have these amazing stories, and so--they--why did they get left out of the history books?  Well, we know how--one of the ways racism works.  You know, the Civil War sells in the South, people who write books or writing books or people who are going to buy them, they figure if they will put something in there about black people, white people buying these books weren't going to buy them.  So, they just didn't put it in there.  So they just overlooked all of this history.  Well now, we've come back here with a new day, but we now--we have built a monument with all of these names up there.  It's on a national monument here in D.C., it is now in the part of the National Park Service that is being protected and defended by the United States Army.  Now, people are going to have to go back and re-write all of this and, include material about black people in there.  Now, why is that important?  It's important because our kids ride the streets just like everybody else's kids do.  They see statues and monuments all over this town to people who have done something heroic.  If they ride around here and don't see anything about black people, they start thinking, "Well, maybe we can't do anything worthwhile that's worthy of somebody building an monument to us?  Maybe we can't do anything that's worthy of having somebody naming a bridge, or a road or a street after us.  Maybe we can't do anything," and therefore it just reinforces itself.  But also it has a negative effect on white people too.  They go around thinking, "You know these people are worthless and trifling.  You know, they've been here all this time, and at a time when they could have done something to help themselves in the Civil War, they didn't do anything.  All they did was sit under the shade tree and eat watermelon and you know, dance the jig, and look like happy buffoons."  Well, that's the lie and we've laid that issue to rest here now, and we are getting ready to tell a million stories about these (laughter) people who, who not only helped to get the Civil War started, who they helped, they and their friends, not just them, but also the abolitionist movement and the Quakers and people, other people, but they also at a time when [Abraham] Lincoln was losing this war, and could not have won it without them, they started--they left these plantations, joined the Union Army, went back to fight, in some cases captured their masters as Union soldiers and then later lived in these same communities, they didn't run out there and leave these communities, they stayed in there, my family stayed in Georgia.  Fifty percent of the black population today still lives in the South, fifty-five percent of it.  They went back to their communities and built homes, schools and walked to school like I did, when they couldn't ride, and used the wishes and the great thoughts and prayers of their parents and their grandparents to elevate themselves and to fight and push to the point where they have developed in the United States now the most affluent black community anywhere in the world.  This is a great story that has to be told, because this is--because black people actually have really made America live up to what America said it was going to be in the first place.  You know, the guys had the right thing when they said, "All men are created equal."  We always believed that.  You believed it, I believed it, all people always, black people always believed we were equal to white people.  White people just never believed we were equal to them.  They just had it wrong.  Now, we may have been in a position where we had to prove ourselves, not in our own eyes.  We weren't proving to ourselves that we were equal to whites, we had to prove to them, so we had to walk the extra mile to school while people rode and then endure the inhumanity of them spitting out of the window, and then you had to do all these other things.
Story_ID: 19879
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the Foundation.  The African American Civil War Memorial Freedom Foundation.  What can people find at the Foundation?
Speaker 2: Well, when they come to Washington, D.C. to visit the African American Civil War Memorial, they are going to see a bronze statue that is about fourteen feet tall that sits on a granite base and is surrounded by semicircular walls that have the names of 209,145 black soldiers who fought in the Civil War, and this is a fantastic story in two parts.  First of all, of these 200,000 names, 150,000 of them were slaves when the war started.  They literally fought their way from slavery to freedom.  The government issued them uniforms and rifles as, Frederick Douglass said, they had bullets in their pockets, and rifles on their shoulders and U.S. on their lapel.  So they became citizens, and then following the Civil War the Congress passed the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution, and this is a radical change in American democracy.  Now, for the first time you see the franchise, the vote extended beyond the white male population, to who?  To the black male population for the first time, and the arguments on the floor of the Congress is these guys have earned the right to vote, they earned it on the battlefield.  When this country needs them, they stood up for us, when they, they went out and sacrificed and they were killed in these battles, they did what we asked them to do, and they deserve the right to vote.  They went on after that to become congressmen and senators in the Southern states.  So, it's an important story that has been left out of the history books, and it's important for America because this democracy that we know in the United States is an evolving process.  When I say--it was first--the right to vote was first extended to black men, let me just hasten to add, that women do not get the right to vote in the United States until the 1920s.  Nobody would argue that the extension of the vote to women was a significant, an important advance for American democracy.  It was first extended to black men, and so, why did they do that?  Because these guys were involved in battle on the battlefield in the Civil War.  So, it's a great story about this democracy expanding, and if we go and take this into today what you see today is that the United States government is all over the world doing business and providing security and in some cases, doing things that it shouldn't be doing. The fact that the United States has tried to resolve this racial thing in the United States makes it a bit of a more powerful country because most the world is not white.  When you get outside of Mississippi, you might forget about that. But the fact of the matter is that most of the world is not white.  If you look at Asia, Africa, India and all these countries, China, you know, these are black and colored people.  They are not white people, and if you go sell goods to them and buy goods from them, and if you are going to trade with them and if you are going to try to police them when they have troubles within their borders, they are going to want to know that your hands are clean in these racial things, that you are there just trying to oppress them and beat up on them just because they are not your same color, and so, until you take care of your problem at home, they are always going to be suspicious of you.  So, America resolving its issues is important to the future of the country, and I think we made some great strides at it, we still have a long way to go, it's been done with, you know, the blood and sweat of black people, a lot of lynching and lot of jailing, a lot of marching, a lot of crying, and a lot of praying and preaching, but the fact of the matter is that it has made some progress here in the United States.  It's a story that we've gotta tell, and I am happy that we tell a part of it here, you will see some exciting things when you come here to this monument, if you don't, you know, it's an important story.

Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about your family?
Speaker 2: Well, I am married.
Speaker 1: When did you marry your wife?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm on my third marriage, and Wendy and I, we don't have any children together.  I have children by my first marriage.  I have two boys and a girl, and they are all adults now.  My oldest son is forty, so these kids are all adults.  My youngest, he lives in Mississippi.  My daughter is the middle kid.  She lives here in [Washington] D.C.  She is a lawyer here in our city.  She has three of my grandchildren, and then my baby boy is a teacher.  He is a professor at--well, teaches both at Middle Tennessee State College [sic, University, Murfreesboro, Tennessee] in Tennessee and at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  So he has got a couple of kids.  So, I've got seven grandchildren.

Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you, and why?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as I've said before, I think I have a really, a remarkable life.  I've lived most of it in the public and so, I've taken my beatings (laughter) and occasionally had a reward from time to time.  But I have always--I think this is the result of having been the oldest of my mother's [Flora Smith] and father's [Frank Smith Sr.] kids and the oldest boy.  They say older kids always have--because they always seem to take more responsibility.  I have always felt some responsibility to try to do well, and to try to make a difference.  And, so I've--that's been the story of my life.  History will judge whether I've done anything in my life worth noting or not, but if I am noted for anything that I've done in life, I would probably be noted for this African American Civil War Memorial [Washington, D.C.], because this is a story that went untold for so many years.  There was--and the fact that historians and politicians and moviemakers and book writers and artists and all of the various entities who are responsible for chronicling the history of a people and of a nation and of a society, has systemically overlooked them, and their great deeds and great accomplishments.  It's a telling story about the society on the one hand, and on the other hand uplifting the story, and putting it out there so people can get a fresh new look at this, and a fresh new look at a people carrying out the American ideal of freedom and democracy, fighting your way to freedom and justice, expanding this county, making it the ideal place it said it was going to be.  That story is an exciting story and a great story, so I am  happy to be associated with it.  I know it's going to do some good and I know, we just started it.  We just broke the ground on this.  There are 200,000 names here, there must be ten million descendants living today of these soldiers.  There are 7,800 white officers who commanded these soldiers, and most of them came from abolitionist families.  We know little or nothing about them and their families.  We are going to hear from all of their descendants one day. They will come through these doors and come to this monument, and we will hear from them and as they bring us their love letters and their discharge papers and their photographs, we will build our archives and our files and we will know more and more about them, and more and more about what happened there, and what motivated them to join, and why did they step out from among their peers and say, "Send me, I'll go, and I'll do this job and I'll work hard and I'll make this happen."  Then afterwards stand up and bring themselves in the public office and to these various institutions.  So, we want to know why they did it, and what motivated them and what happened to them afterwards, and what are their children doing now?  And what is this country doing to carry out the freedom legacy of these people?  And so, that story they will find when they come here, and they will find it long after I am gone, because there will be people here to tell it.
Speaker 1: And is there anything else you want to add, Dr. Smith, that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think that the--that the message I would like to send is probably what I have said before.  That is, that I think it's important for people to dedicate themselves to something that is worthwhile, and to stay with it.  This is a country where you can realize your dreams, and if you have a dream and you work at it, something good is bound to happen.  So, don't give up.
