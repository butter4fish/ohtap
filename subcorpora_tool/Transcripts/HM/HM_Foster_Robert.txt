Story_ID: 534836
Speaker 1: We're gonna start, Mr. Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], with your family history because it's important that people who will use your interview and use your interview over time will have some understanding of your roots and your antecedents and how you got to be the person you are today and the position that you have.  So, we're gonna start with your mother.  Would you give me your mother's full name, the year that she was born, and where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Bernice Greene Foster.  And I believe she was born August--this, oh, I got this written down.  I should've had--should've had it reminded, right.  Was it August 29, 1926, yeah, I believe I'm pretty close there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pretty close there.
Speaker 1: Where did she grow up?  Where did your mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother grew up in Woodruff, South Carolina, before she married my father [Rusher Foster], and that was Cashville [South Carolina], but that was always her home, Carolina.  South Carolina was her home.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her growing up years as a child and teenager?  Has she shared stories with you about her early life?
Speaker 2: In some ways.  I mean, I know she would tell me about her mother which is Rachel Greene.  But as you know, my mother had, what, ten children, and I believe there was an eighth grade education, you know, after she married my father and pretty much my mother was a sharecropper wife all her life.  And what I know about my mother was just hard work, you know, just raising ten kids.  You know, between one in the arm and going to the cotton field, then coming home at a certain time of the day to cook you lunch or whatever and making sure that you had, you know, your clothes was washed and then taking your laundry down by the creek and scrubbing them on one of these scrubbing boards and bringing them back.  And, you know, you watch your--you know, as I was coming up as a kid, I watched my mother just pretty much work.  You know, the--I mean, and we got to church when we got to church.  But when she interacted with other folks, it was more at like a fish fry on a Friday night because, you know, pretty much that was the only outlet you had in the country.  There's not a lot of movie theaters, things like that, so you always ended up at your neighbors' home, you know, doing those type of things.  But, you know, I think my--I looked at the value of my mother and I believe that's where I got a lot of my hard work from, just observing her, how--in her daily activity, you know.
Speaker 1: And this was in Cashville?
Speaker 2: This was in Cashville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was in Cashville, yep.
Speaker 1: You made a brief reference to her mother, your maternal grandmother.  Her name was?
Speaker 2: Rachel Greene.  And my maternal grandmother was born in Laurens, South Carolina, and I believe my--off the record, she was what, 1891 or 1895 when she was born, yeah, 'cause she died during 1981, '82 [1982] I think.  But my mother's mother was a gardener.
Speaker 1: She was a gardener.
Speaker 2: That's what she--somehow that's where I probably--you know, the apple don't fall too far from the tree (laughter).  But--
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother--did your mother's mother ever tell you about her early life?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Not really.  I--you know, my mother's mother had fourteen children and as you know, by the time I got to know my grandmother, my grandmother was probably sixty-five or seventy years old, you know, based on my age right now.  But, you know, family didn't tell about their kids' childhood life because I think it was just more about work, you know, and they didn't say, well your mother played soccer or back in them days there wasn't no soccer I guess, but your mother was a cheerleader or did this or you did that.  You know, it was--you know, the conversation never related to that that much.  You know, all I know is like, make sure your mother bring me my snuff when she come down for the weekend or when she come to visit because my grandmother loved that, you know, that little snuff that was in the can.  She'd put it in her lips and, you know, if she didn't have that, she would--I watched my grandmother walk across the road and she'll dig into this red mud, she'll get her some of that red mud from the bank and that would be substitute for the snuff until (laughter) somebody gets it.  But, you know, we all tried it, you know, and, you know, you watch your grandmother do these things and then you watch your mother.  You know, but as I said, just observing my mother, it was just work.  It was just pretty much work.  And, you know, as you grow older, you look back.
Story_ID: 534837
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In what other ways do you remember your mother [Bernice Greene Foster]?  You remember the hard work and the daily work, but what other things do you remember about her personality?  What was she like as a person (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, mother had a wonderful, wonderful personality.  I mean, she was straight forward.  If she didn't like you, she didn't like you.  You know, if you step on her flower garden, you're in trouble, that's the one thing.  Don't cross my flower garden, bottom line.  You know, that's just the way it was.  But she was a good cook.  Mother cooked some great fried chicken, great pork chop, you know.  But, you know, and when she put on her nice little white dress or whatever, was a very beautiful woman, very beautiful woman, very strong woman.  You know, and could sing.  You know, all my brothers and sisters have their own little church choir.  My mother could really sing.
Speaker 1: Did she sing at home?
Speaker 2: Well she--on the porch.
Speaker 1: On the porch.
Speaker 2: You could sit there all day long, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, you--she could really blow.  I mean--
Speaker 1: What do you remember her singing, any special songs or--
Speaker 2: Oh, she loved that Mahalia Jackson song, you know, 'Amazing Grace,' and, you know--but back in them days, you know, you listen to them old songs, you know, where they just pat their feet and they'd just be moaning, but they'd be songs (laughter), no words, but she'll just be moaning these songs just like her grandfather, like her father.  My grandfather [Richard Greene] was a deacon at the church, you know, as well as a great singer.  And my mother would sit out there on a Saturday night or Sunday morning, she would just, you know, I--to me, looking back, that was like a relief because you done worked all week, you know, you had ten kids.  I mean, you know, you're cooking, and you're picking cotton and, you know, it was--have some time to sit.  And I get a little teary-eyed sometime because it was amazing how she did it.
Story_ID: 534838
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  Give me his full name, when he was born, and where he was born.
Speaker 2: Rush Allen Foster [Rusher Foster], and when you see my father, you're looking at me.  That's what they always say.  But Rush Allen Foster, born January 19, 1919, and he was born to--what was my grandmother's name, Cindy Foster [Lucinda Foster], and they was all born--they was all born in Cashville, South Carolina.  And I would imagine he was born in that old house where my grandmother lived until she passed away.  But my father as I said was a sharecropper all his life, a third grade education, good looking man, you know, wonderful looking man, you know.  I mean, that's what people always tell me about my father, they said, "Gee, your father was such a good looking man," and then, you know--and he had this thing about him no matter where he went, especially on church, he got to have his white shirt, he's got to have his shoes shined.  You know, now you done worked all week in the cotton field, you know, but when Sunday come, he'll shave and mustache, slick his hair back, you know, the good days, you know.  But he put on his white shirt and he put on his little blue suit, one suit, and he would walk to church or walk by his mother's to visit his mother and, and we'd all be behind him when we didn't have a car.
Story_ID: 534839
Speaker 1: What church did your mother [Bernice Greene Foster] and father [Rusher Foster] and you attend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  My father went to Shady Grove Baptist Church [Lower Shady Grove Baptist Church, Woodruff, South Carolina] and my mother was a member of, I think it was New Bethel Baptist Church, which was in Woodruff, South Carolina, then.  And Shady Grove Baptist Church was a little church maybe five or six miles away from us that sits back off in a little hole, wooden church, wooden fireplace, wooden benches.  And at the time, I think it was the Reverend George Bennett [ph.] was our pastor is what I can remember as an early stage, you know.  And because I remember us getting baptized in a creek with our little white sheets on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are you saying they went to different Baptist churches?
Speaker 2: Yeah, went to different Baptist churches, yeah.
Speaker 1: On Sunday?
Speaker 2: On Sunday.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: My mother would go to her mother's [Rachel Greene] church--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because that's where my mother goes to church and my father would go to his mother's [Lucinda Foster] church.  Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: So which one did you go--
Speaker 2: Don't ask me why.
Speaker 1: So which one did you go to?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to both (laughter), you know.  If--you know, I went to both.  I went to my mother's mother's church and I would go to my father's father.
Speaker 1: Would you--did you alternate every week or how--
Speaker 2: Well, we just alternate and whenever we could go, we would alternate.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, the one thing we was encouraged to do is you go to church.  Now, you may not learn anything there, but you're going to church.
Speaker 1: How were they different or were they different?
Speaker 2: Church?  Church wasn't that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, the two churches, how were they different?
Speaker 2: Not, not much at all.  You know, down home, gospel preaching, not much at all.  I just--I just believe that my father who was a deacon at the church that my mother went to, this was support.  You support your father's church.  My mother was a great supporter of her church, so my father supported my mother's church.  I mean, that's where my father's brother and my father's sister and his family would all--the Grays [ph.], the Duncans [ph.], the Johnsons [ph.], the Fosters, you know, that's Cashville [South Carolina].  That was Cashville.  Now, where my mother came from was Woodruff, where she was born, that was the Greenes, that was the Jeters [ph.], that was the Rice [ph.], that's their church.
Speaker 1: How many people living in Cashville at this time?
Speaker 2: Probably three or four hundred or less.  I mean, I was a small kid, it could've been less.  You know, when you're smaller, your eyes see a lot of big things, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, you know, I can remember everybody was a mile apart.  I mean, you would--there was no such thing as where I live now, you just walk up the street and, yeah, you was a mile apart.  Everything was a mile apart.  I mean, if you couldn't walk there, you know, you would ride your bicycle.  If you had a car, you would drive, but--
Story_ID: 534840
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father's [Rusher Foster] personality, what was he like as a person?  He was certainly very religious.  What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, very religious.
Speaker 1: How would you--how do you remember him?
Speaker 2: Oh, as I said, you know, the apple don't fall too far from the tree.  I look at myself, I look at my father.  He was very outgoing, very energetic, very strong man, wonderful personality, very humble, very humble because what he did as a sharecropper and the things that he had to accept every day in his life from six to six in the morning.  You know, and one thing my father--we never went hungry.  His priority was his family.  Well, I do whatever it takes to feed my family.  You know, whether I have to work eight hours, ten hours or twelve hours.  Every Saturday, you got to go to the grocery store and buy your grocery, but when he didn't have it, he didn't have it.  But, you know, there were times when we needed sugar or bacons or eggs, you know, and my mother [Bernice Greene Foster] would have this like we need to get some sugar, we don't have no bacon.  You know, my father would get out and walk up the road and pick up Coca-Cola bottles, and I remember doing that very well.  You know, by the time you get to the little county store, you got thirty bottles.  You turn in, you know, you buy yourself ten cents' worth of bacons, and if you didn't, you would stop by one of your families or your friends, you borrow your cup of sugar or some, you know, what they call back in them days lard, right, which was not that thick stuff.  But you would do that.  And you find a way to make sure that your family was fed.  And as I said, my father, he was a wonderful singer too.  He liked to hum, smoke his cigars, chew his tobacco, you know, and that was his greatest wish.  And every now and then he liked a little bit of that little moonshine, you know, that was the country.  That's what it was all about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who--
Story_ID: 534841
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who owned the land and the property where they sharecropped?
Speaker 2: Oh, never forget the names, Mr. Guy Phillips, Mr. Guy Phillips.  The Phillips owned all that land, about three or four hundred acres right there below Cashville [South Carolina], the Phillips, and the Cox [ph.], probably over a thousand acres of land there.  And, you know, our home sit right in the middle of a cotton field, three bedrooms, and there was ten of us (laughter).  You know, you didn't cut grass, you take limbs from trees to sweep the yard to keep it clean.
Speaker 1: Did you mother [Bernice Greene Foster] and father [Rusher Foster] receive a cash salary for their work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --or did they get--they got--in lieu of that, what did they--
Speaker 2: Well, the way sharecropping work is, you know, Mr. Guy Phillips who lends your parents X amount of dollars at the beginning of the year.  Let's say he lends my father a couple hundred dollars in January, you know, for food, clothing, you know, whatever expense that my father had we were still paying for.  My father would end up working over a hundred acres of cotton, and you find yourself picking cotton plant.  People--and, you know, like I said, there was ten of us.  We learned how to plow a mule when I was probably eight to nine years old and my mule's name was Pete [ph.], my brother's mule's name Allen [ph.], and my father's name such and such, so you started early.  And the more children my mother had, the more cotton Mr. Guy Phillips would plant (laughter) because you can pick more.  But you would work this crop throughout the year and you would take cotton to the gin every Saturday morning and it was one of our happiest moments being on the back of a mule wagon going to the cotton gin with our father.  That was like a trip.  It was only about two miles up the road (laughter).  But to see how this cotton is done and baled and sold.  You have a man there that writes Mr. Guy Phillips a check, couple thousand dollars, might be less than that.
Speaker 1: And this was a year round (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was--oh, yeah, this is year round sharecropping.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because you had oats and barley and corn and wheat and soybeans, and you're feeding the cows and, you know, whatever it takes.  And he had cows and pigs and mules, this was year round, bottom line.  This just wasn't through the summer, you know.  And as I said, you know, you come back on the weekend after you done sold all this cotton with a two or three thousand dollar check and Mr. Guy Phillips would bring my father into the back door and say "Well, Rush, this is a--this is what you borrowed, two hundred dollars, but I got to charge you for the fertilizer, I got to charge you for the seeds, I got to charge you for the mule time," you even got charged for mule time, the number of days you used the mule, you know, so it look you got a total here of five or six hundred dollars, you owe me two hundred dollars, so, you know, you get about two hundred fifty, three hundred dollars.  Well, you know, you got ten kids, where you going with two hundred dollars?  So your father finds himself borrowing another two or three hundred dollars in the middle of the year and that's how they kept you in debt and that's how they kept you on farm.  And the whole key, if I keep you in debt, you're not going anywhere, and in Cashville, if you was in debt, you didn't go anywhere because the law would make sure you stay there until you paid that debt.  The law was always on that side.
Speaker 1: Did your mother and father ever think about leaving?
Speaker 2: We was always in debt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know, but I mean--
Speaker 2: --and the law stopped you (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know that, but I mean, did they ever--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I would imagine many nights--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --many days.  I would imagine they thought about packing us up and moving us, but with what?  We didn't have a car, didn't have a truck, so I mean, what were we going to do, just pack our little brown bags up and start walking up the street, you know, walking up the 101 Highway [South Carolina Highway 101]?  I would imagine there are many days, many nights, many months that my father would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And there were other sharecropping families--
Speaker 2: All of them lived--
Speaker 1: --in the immediate area--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --around you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Most of everybody that lived in that area were sharecroppers from the Greys [ph.] to the Duncans [ph.].  You know, some of them made it up and got out, some of them didn't.  I mean, like I said, when you got ten children, you're borrowing every year.  You're borrowing every year.
Story_ID: 534842
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Getting to your brothers and sisters, would you give me their names from the oldest to the youngest and where they are today, what they're doing?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it's important to get the whole family--
Speaker 2: The whole family, yeah.
Speaker 1: --kind of laid out, yeah.  So if you could tell me.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would start with, if we can go back in a little time here, my mother [Bernice Greene Foster] had two children before she married my father [Rusher Foster].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we still considered them as our brothers because we were family and that's the way it was.  Now, my--if I go back to this part, it's Wilbur Greene, Jr., lives in La Plata, Maryland, I think, and today, he's retired.  And he worked for the government for over like 37, 38 years.  Now, the one thing I say about my family if I can go with you, every one of us who have had a job in anything have been on it for thirty or more years (laughter).  We've never jumped job to jobs.  And I guess that's coming from a foundation, you did what you did.  And my other brother which is Willie Greene lives in Woodruff, he's still in Woodruff, South Carolina, great, great gospel singer, and he opens up for like the Mighty Clouds of Joy, The Williams Brothers, the Five Blind Boys.  When he comes to Washington [D.C.], oh, man, you should hear him sing, oh, beautiful, man.  I mean, makes tears come out of our eyes.  And my, my sister, Shirley Berry [Shirley Foster Berry]--well, I forgot to tell you, when Will was born, I think Will was born, what in August 1960, '61 [1961], somewhere in there, and when you come on down to my sister, Shirley Berry, who lives in Virginia Beach [Virginia], I believe Shirley was born in 1947, '48 [1948], somewhere in there, she's a nurse, heart specialist nurse now in Virginia Beach.  Then my next brother which is Alvin Foster born 1949, yeah 1949.  I think Al was born in 1949 'cause he's retired now, and he was a manager at this company for over thirty-six years, and he retired from that company there in Mauldin, South Carolina.  Then, there's me, born March 27, 1950, and which is still today employed by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce and Transportation [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation].  Then, my next brother is Rusher T. Foster, born March 2, 1951.  He's still on his job after thirty-five years as a manager there at a company in Carolina as well.  And then there's my brother, Larry Foster, born February 28, 1952, yeah, and he's been in that company over thirty years as well, so he's thinking about retiring as well.  And then there was one I think in between, yeah, David Foster, born 1954, November 14th--November 13th or 14th.  I get him and my sister's birthday mixed up, but I know they're both in November, but he's with Tyco [Tyco Integrated Security], done real well, real well, Tyco in Charlotte, North Carolina.  And there was a sister, Georgia Marie [Georgia Foster] that passed away at a very young age, around seven, seven, eight years old.  I think she was born in 1955, so.  My memories of her was little.  I remember how she passed away because we was all in a barn, cotton barn playing one afternoon, and Georgia Marie was six or seven, you know, was probably seven.  Let's see, I was probably seven at the time and she was probably four or five and--the little age might've been a little different in there.  And I remember we was all in the barn just playing, and all of the sudden we decided to come from the barn, come back around and go up the steps at the old house and Georgia Marie went inside and laid down and that was it.  That was it.  And that was a--that just devastated my mother, though.  That just--for two or three years, that just knocked my mother down.  'Cause at that time, that was the baby girl.  That was the baby girl before San came along next.  And then, you know, my last sister was Sandra Foster [Sandra Foster Norman].  I think she was 1957, '58 [1958], born November 14th, somewhere in there.  It's hard keeping up with all these kids (laughter).
Speaker 1: You're close.
Speaker 2: I mean, it's hard keeping up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're close.  You're, you're--
Speaker 2: It's very hard.  I mean, when you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --think about twelve, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --ten or twelve kids and you try to remember the months, the date--
Speaker 1: You're very close.
Speaker 2: --what they do, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, the one thing they know Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster] does, they know I would call them when they birthday, you know, that they know that.  I know when their birthday--it may not be on the right day, but they know I'm calling in the right month (laughter), you know, so that's my family.  Like I said, they've all been--we all came up on that farm, we all came up sharecropping, we all got our high school diplomas, tough getting our high school diploma, though 'cause you know how that was.  We missed a lot of days from school picking cotton.  And, but we all stayed in there and strived to do the best we can and, you know.
Story_ID: 534843
Speaker 1: Tell me about the house now and the home in which you, mother [Bernice Greene Foster], father [Rusher Foster], and brothers and sisters lived in.  Tell me about the house and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: --what was it like and--
Speaker 2: Oh, the little house?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Reminded me of the 1800s (laughter).  The little house was probably three and a half rooms that sits in the middle of a cotton field, middle of a farm.
Speaker 1: Three and a half?
Speaker 2: Three and a half rooms.  You know, you had like a tin roof, wood floors, no running water, no indoor toilet.  Everything was, as I said, 1800.  That's just the way it was.  Couple fireplaces, you know, the big old wood stoves where you put your wood in there and the pipe gets so hot, you stand beside there.  I always look back and say, gee, it's a wonder that the house didn't burn down 'cause the house was made out of cedar wood.  And, you know, you had the type of windows, you just patch them up when you patch them up.  I mean, you know, if a window--you know, if a window gets broken out, you do what you have to do.  And, as I said, you had a wood porch, and my sisters would stay in one room, and there was three or four brothers like me, R.T. [Rusher T. Foster]--myself, R.T., Dave [David Foster], and Larry [Larry Foster] would be in one room, and Alvin [Alvin Foster] would be in the back room, hardest person to sleep with was Alvin (laughter).  You know, there's got to be (laughter) one to sleep with.  But that was all ten--that was all seven or ten of us would be.  And, you know, your mother and father would get up early in the morning to make a fire because that's what--especially in the wintertime.  In the summer, you was okay.  You know, you didn't know whether a mosquito was biting you or not.  All you know, you just, the window was up.  You know, wasn't no such thing as a fan or air conditioning.  But we all lived in that house up until we started, you know, one leaving at a time.  It was a great home, great home, great home.  I wouldn't go back and do anything different because there was a lot of love, and I believe that's why we're all so close today, you know.  I mean, my brothers and sister, we're very close family.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Oh, very close family.
Story_ID: 534844
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Bernice Greene Foster] and father [Rusher Foster] meet?  Did they ever tell you how they first met?
Speaker 2: I think my grandmother told me that my mother--no, my aunt, my--the only living aunt on mother's side told me that they met at a cookout in Woodruff [South Carolina].  That's (laughter) as far as I know.  Your mother met your father at a cookout in Woodruff, and this was it.  And the next thing you know, your father was hauling her off to Cashville, South Carolina.  That was it.  I would imagine they met when they was--I don't know, I think my mother was no more than 17, 18 years old at the time, maybe younger than that, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were born and you're--and the siblings were all living together--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where were your grandparents at this point and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: When I was born, my grandparents were still living in Woodruff, South Carolina, and my grandfather was still farming wheat.  It was wheat, sugarcane for a family, I think they called them the Woodruffs.  They named the town after this family, Woodruff, South Carolina, because the Woodruffs owned everything in that little town, which was the Civil War town at the time when they came up through the Civil War from Enoree [South Carolina], Duncan [South Carolina], Union [South Carolina], Chester [South Carolina], Beaufort [South Carolina], all that area--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was Civil War stuff.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so the Woodruffs was a very big family.  You know, like plantation home that sits on hills and things like that.  So my--that's why my grandfather was doing, was still working for them at the time, living off in--back off in like a swamp, really.
Speaker 1: Which grandfather?
Speaker 2: My mother's grandfather [sic. Foster's maternal grandfather, Richard Greene].  My mother's grandfather and my mo- you know, my mother's grandmother [sic. Foster's maternal grandmother, Rachel Greene] and it was back off a long dark road, no lights, no nothing.  And, you know, as I was coming along, I do remember they had electricity, but I remember they had to always hook it up somehow when the man comes along and cuts it off.  My grandfather found a way to plug it right back up (laughter).  Don't ask me how they do it.  But, you know, if you can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --afford it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you do what you got to do, right?  But, anyway, yeah, and my grandfather had like beagle dogs and I remember my living aunt, Aunt Martha Greene, was living with my grandmother and grandfather at the time and her kids was there, and my mother, two siblings, and two kids from her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were the grandparents sharecroppers also?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They were all sharecroppers?
Speaker 2: All share- both sides of the family.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Both sides of the family, both sides of the family, on my mother's side, which is Maw and Pa.  That's all I knew for all the year.  I--it took me a long time to realize it was Rich and Rachel Greene.  All we know is Maw and Pa.  That was it.  As a kid, Maw, Pa, that's--that was it.  And I only met my grandfather on my father's side once and I believe he was a Rice [ph.].  They lived in, I think it was Roebuck, South Carolina, very slight memory of them, very slight, just saw the face.
Speaker 1: In addition to the work that you and your brothers and sisters did as a result of your parents' work, what else did you and your siblings do besides work?  What--how did you spend your time together with each other?  What kind of things did you do?
Speaker 2: When we weren't fighting (laughter), weren't fighting, we was fishing, playing marbles, just normal kid life, you know.  You, you learn how to make a basketball net, played a lot of baseball, lot of baseball, lot of baseball, went hiking, you know.
Speaker 1: You had a full team right there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, no doubt, had a full team right there, but, you know, we spent a lot of days just sitting out in the field watching cars go by, deciding whether it's gonna be a Chevrolet, whether it's gonna be a Ford, if it was just gonna be a truck, you know, climbing trees.  You know, you, you play a lot of games, you know, the Tarzan, the Jane.  You're playing the cowboys, you know.  We had wonderful--we had a wonderful life, wonder--wonderful life coming--when you look back at it, you know, the things that we did, it was great because it kept us connected.  And we sit around now when we all get together and we talk about, man, R.T. [Rusher T. Foster], you remember when you did this or Dave [David Foster], you remember when you did (laughter) this or, you know.  I was always the adventure one, you know.
Story_ID: 534845
Speaker 1: Well, this leads me to my next question very nicely.  What is your earliest memory of growing up?  How far back can you remember?  What stands out in your mind as a very early memory as a child.
Speaker 2: Oh, I go back almost five, six years old, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I remember just getting up and trying to make a fire and almost burning the house down (laughter).  Because watching my father [Rusher Foster] do these things, watching my father get up every morning and go feed, just man cows, and learned how to pick cotton at a very early age, stands out very well.  Got to be eight years old walking behind my father with a mule and a plow.  By the time I was nine, I was plowing by mule.  I mean, this, this was very early.  Remembering, you know, how on Saturday where my father and mother [Bernice Greene Foster] would have to leave us there at the house and go downtown to buy grocery and we would all be sitting under that little tree out there by the well, and everybody would just be wondering okay, is this them coming 'cause my sister [Shirley Foster Berry] at the time, you know, she was like the mother.  So we would all get together, all of us, just sit under that tree and we would all say, okay, here they come, here they come, here they come.  You know, which car is going to be?  That was--that was--you know, my father would get off like about four, five o'clock on a Saturday evening.  He would probably go downtown, but we would sit there to six or seven o'clock and watch the sun go down, we--you know, hey, we just--I mean, it was--it was a great childhood life.  I said, marbles, basketball, fishing, hiking, you know, going down to the creek, dig and swimming holes, and, you know, we, we had our little, little battles and like, you know--as they say, I was always the adventure one.  I would always be picking at somebody in the family, yeah, I was the little naughty one, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: You mentioned sitting by the well.  Did all of your water come from the well?
Speaker 2: All the water come from the well.  Yeah, you know, you made a well, you know, down this big hole and you have a--and if it didn't come by the well, you, you learned to find fresh spring water.  You go down in the woods where this water be running off the rocks, so you put your--you know, your bucket under there and get some nice, fresh spring water, nice, tastes good too.  You know, I remember those things very well.  But mostly our well--water came from the well.  You know, you draw your bath water, your cooking water, you know, everything from that well.  As I said, there was no indoor--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --facility at the time.
Story_ID: 534846
Speaker 1: Any other early childhood memories that stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: We tell the story, my brothers and I, we was fishing one day, one of my neighbors, Cleveland Duncan, we was all little young kids.  We decide to go and dig our swimming pool down by the creek, you know, dig it about four or five feet I guess, we small, young kids.  And it's a very true story because we all back each other up on it.  And so we're all just digging and all of the sudden, this little man jumps up out of the water like a leprechaun with a little green suit on and started waving his cane at us.  This is a very true story.  And we all are like seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven years old, every one of my brothers, every one of my neighbors have verified this story.  I tell my wife [Nancy Carter-Foster], I tell my friends, like they start laughing, like you.  They're like, wait a minute.  And my brothers and I we're just--we raise our right hand. It was a little lepre- I ain't never forget that story.  And so we all got a little frightened 'cause he started coming across us waving a cane.  I mean, you know, you young, we all took off running back to Cleveland Duncan's house, and Miss Josie Duncan [ph.], Cleveland's mother, Butch Duncan [ph.], we start telling them about the story, please come see, please come see, you know, there's a little man waving a cane at us.  So we all take off and go back through the woods with shovels.  We decide to go in Miss Duncan's shed and get the shovels and say, look, you know what, we going back down here and do this little man in, right (laughter)?  So we all get a little shovel, me, Cleve, Larry [Larry Foster], Dave [David Foster], R.T. [Rusher T. Foster], you know, we all go back down through these woods looking for him.  We got there, he was gone.  But we tell that story.  And, you know, everybody says, you guys sure you didn't see something like a crab or something (laughter).  You know, it's like, unh-uh.  This was a little man with a cane and a green outfit, little suit and bow tie on, it was there.  And we--I never--and this when I was like eight to nine years old, I have never forgotten that, never for--and that's one of the stories in, in, in my childhood life that--coming up that stands out very clearly, very clearly.  And I know a lot of folks get a great laugh off of it, but I have to tell it because, you know, this is what I--this is what I saw.  You know, this is what I experienced.
Speaker 1: You mentioned Cleveland.  Tell me about the other families in your immediate area.  I know--
Speaker 2: Oh, they--
Speaker 1: --you were in the center of a lot of acreage.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But who were some of the other families around you?  What was the--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was the, the Greys [ph.], Charles Grey which were friends of mines and there was the Rices [ph.], Jimmy Rice and all of his family.
Speaker 1: How far away were their homes?  Were the--
Speaker 2: Probably a mile apart.  And like I said, we was all--you know, the Scotts [ph.], the Greys, the Jeters [ph.], everybody pretty much, you know, at least a mile apart, the Johnsons [ph.], all big families.
Speaker 1: And the roads or the paths connecting these homes were what?
Speaker 2: Dirt roads.
Speaker 1: Dirt roads, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, either you walked through the woods--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to get to that road, you walk through the woods to get to that side of the road.  I mean, your main highway which was Route 1 [U.S. Route 1], which is the only paved road, which is a two-lane road.  But, you know, once you get off that, everything else was dirt roads and pot holes, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Bernice Greene Foster and Rusher Foster] ever at one point in time or any point in time own an automobile?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was 19--God, that old gray Pontiac.  The first car my father ever had was a 1949 or 19--1959 maybe, it's like a big (unclear) whatever it was.  All I know, it was big (laughter).  But, you know, it was a used car.  Father never had a new car, always.
Speaker 1: So, did you and your family have a chance to take trips places then or did you do any traveling?
Speaker 2: Well, to the grocery store and home.  There was never such a thing as a nice travel trip, never a vacation, no more than six to eight miles to my mother's mother's [Rachel Greene] which was in Woodruff [South Carolina], seven miles, back through Woodruff to Cashville [South Carolina], to my father's mother's [Lucinda Foster] which is about three miles, maybe--I don't even remember taking a trip to Spartanburg [South Carolina] in my father's car and that was seventeen miles away.  Vacations, trips, nah.  I mean, look, we had cotton to pick, man.  We had soybeans and stuff.  I mean, you know, I mean what was a vacation?  I mean, I didn't know what vacation was until I came to Washington, D.C. (laughter), and they give you two weeks off--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as annually.  You know, that's when you experience all this stuff.  But, no, no.  When you get out of school during the summer, you went to picking peaches or--you pick peaches.  You know, you, you deal with planting corn, wheat, soybean, oats, and stuff like that as kids.
Story_ID: 534847
Speaker 1: Talk about your beginning of your formal schooling.  When did you first start school?  What school did you attend?  Tell me about the first days of school for you.
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember first starting school I guess, what six, which was the, the school that my mother [Bernice Greene Foster] attended, New Bethel High School [Woodruff, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: New Bethel.
Speaker 1: New Bethel?
Speaker 2: New Bethel High, B-E-T-H-E-L, New Bethel High School which is located in Woodruff, South Carolina, which was the only black school.
Speaker 1: This is elementary now?
Speaker 2: This is elementary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Elementary, yeah, this was elementary.  So New Bethel was just one--well, you call it, what, elementary, high--I mean, you only had one school, so you went through elementary, junior high, and high.  And this is where we all started.  My whole family started school there.  You know, my, my mother went to school there 'til the sixth or seventh grade as it was the local school.  It was the community--you know, and my mother and father [Rusher Foster] used to tell me how they used to walk to the school.  You know, we came along, thank God, they had a bus to get us there, you know, a little yellow bus.  But we would have to walk from our house up this long dirt road and stand in the cold to catch that yellow bus.  And, yeah, I remember going into the first grade and the first thing they did was give you that nice little shot, that long needle, remember that?  I cried my heart out, man (laughter).  And I guess I was a very quiet kid in school.  I mean, I--first two or three years, I guess, but other than that, trying to remember, I did okay in grades.  I wasn't a very good listener.  All my teachers would always say, "Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], you don't ever listen."  I was a--like a worm.  But, you know, as you got older in school, you got in the sixth, seventh, eighth grade, you know, your parents would take you out of school for two or three days because, you know, if the weather's gonna be bad, you find yourself having to pick cotton.  And--
Speaker 1: What was the school like?  How many rooms did it have?  How big was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was--the school was, New Bethel was, was a pretty average school because I would think maybe three or four hundred students at that time, you know.  If I start when I was seven, in the seven, eighth grade, yeah, it was, was a very small gym, you know, not the biggest gym.  We didn't have the quality of the things that other schools had, which was a mile away from us, but I'll get into that later on.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the teachers.  Who do you remember in the teaching staff there?  What were--who--where did the teachers come from?  Where--
Speaker 2: Where they come?  From miles away.  None of them came from the local Cashville [South Carolina], Woodruff.  I think there was Mr. Scipio [ph.], Mr. Thompson [ph.], there was a Miss Rivers [ph.], there was a Miss Garvin [ph.].  The one teacher who was the principal there, Mr. Allen [ph.], his wife, is the most well-known, Mr. Allen and his wife.  I can't think of Mrs. Allen's name, but she did the first grade, second grade, whatever.  Because you had one teacher for the like the first grade, second grade, third grade.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: It wasn't different teachers.  I mean, you know, you think you get a different teacher next year, but you still got Mrs. Allen, so Mrs. Allen would teach you all the way up until like the fifth grade, yeah.  So--I mean, because New Bethel, you couldn't afford teachers to pay.  Looking back, you know, from what I'm looking at, I'm like, well, okay, you only had like four or five teachers here.  You had three or four hundred students, and these teacher was teaching all different classes.  So--
Speaker 1: Any particular teacher that you remember the most that stands out in your mind that was influential in your early schooling?
Speaker 2: Well, I would have to say Mr. Harold Washington [ph.] because he was a--he lived there in Woodruff as well.  And he would--I think he was teaching social studies or economics back in them days.  You know, New Bethel is hard for me to remember.  I remember some about New Bethel.
Speaker 1: How many years were you there?  How many grades (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was there eight years.
Story_ID: 534848
Speaker 1: Okay, elementary and then what we call middle school right through--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well middle school--well, in the ninth grade, when I was getting ready to go into the ninth grade, I decided to end up one of the first six blacks to be integrated into an all-white school.
Speaker 1: This was what year now?  This would've been--
Speaker 2: This was '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you get selected to--
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Speaker 1: Huh?  Oh, you--
Speaker 2: If that's the question.  I--remember, I told you, I was a risk taker.  I was an adventurist.  So, me and six other guys, we just signed up to go.  We just signed our parents' name (laughter).
Speaker 1: This was the Woodruff High School [Woodruff, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: This is the Woodruff High School.
Speaker 1: So, had there been a school desegregation order (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --at that point?
Speaker 2: At that point, no.
Speaker 1: There hadn't been?
Speaker 2: Hadn't been, not, not in Woodruff, South Carolina, unh-uh, not in Woodruff, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: So, what was the reaction when you and your friends, classmates, signed up and just said you were going to--wanted to go to Woodruff?  What was the reaction?
Speaker 2: Well, we had like a--we had like--that night before--I guess how it all started is where someone comes around and asks different classes, and at the time, I'm in the eighth grade, me, Milford Johnson [ph.], Lewis Scott [ph.], Willie Norman [ph.], and Jane Ferguson [ph.], you know, would anybody like to attend Woodruff High School?  Well, you know, most blacks say, you got to be kidding.  Ain't going to Woodruff High School, there's five hundred white kids over there, are you kidding me?  So, you know, I'm the little ring leader.  I'm like, "Lewis, Milford, let's do it."  They're like, "Well, you're going to need your parents' consent to do all this."  And they're like, "Well, we can get ours and I know--." I'm saying, like, you know what?  I know my mother [Bernice Greene Foster] and father's [Rusher Foster] not gonna do this, so I'm gonna have to take a risk and do it on my--on my--put Mr. Rush Foster down (laughter), bottom line.  Father had no idea, mother had no idea.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what motivated you to do this at the time?
Speaker 2: I don't even know what my--I really don't.  It was just--let's do it, let's do it.  I mean, and--
Speaker 1: Well, was there opposition?  I mean, did--
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, nobody said--you know, nobody said no.  All I know is the principal at the time said, "Well, we got like a session maybe in a week or so.  You know, you bring here and you get your classes, your study, make sure you bring your parents to meet, you know, your teachers."  Well, you know, what?  I didn't go.  All I know is, the next day, two weeks later, I got up when I was supposed to go in, my mother said, "Where you think you're going?"  I said, "I'm going to school."  "Well, you're not catching the bus with your other brothers and sisters, why you leaving here at 7:10 in the morning?"  I said, "Well, mama, I'm going to Woodruff High now."  "You what?  Rush, this boy going to Woodruff High School."  My father said, "You doing what?"  So, like, went on over there, caught the bus, only black that was on the bus.  Bus driver name was--what was his name?  Everett, Gerald Everett [ph.], remember him well, and go to the back, first thing he said, go to the back.  And every seat I went to sit on, somebody would slide left or right.  So I found myself going all the way to the back.  But later on down the road, we picked up another black student which was, I think, James T. Ferguson [ph.] at the time.  So--
Speaker 1: How far away was the high school from the pickup?
Speaker 2: Like, six miles.
Speaker 1: Six miles.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, how does--
Speaker 2: One mile apart from New Bethel [New Bethel High School, Woodruff, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: How did the white students react when you got on the bus?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: What did they--
Speaker 2: Some of the white students I know because they lived in the neighborhood, you know, in the surrounding area, but, oh, it was totally shock.  You know, I mean, I got the coon, I got the N word, I got the spitballs, I got the bubble gum, I got it all.  I got it all.  Oh, that first couple weeks on that bus, I got it all.  And, you know, we get to the school, I get off the bus and I notice, you know, other--you know, the--like I said, Lewis Scott and all them was there, say, "Well Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], why didn't you come to rehearsal last night?"  I'm like look, man, you're--I don't know.  So I go to the principal's office, he give me my schedule of classes and--
Speaker 1: You know, the black college students in the South had the sit-ins in the 1960--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-one [1961], '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: Right.  That was in the--
Speaker 1: We had the boycotts.  We had the Freedom Rides.  Did any of that influence you?  I mean, you're a teenager now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're thirteen, fourteen.  Did any of the civil rights activism of college students--
Speaker 2: At that time, I didn't think about that.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of it, though?
Speaker 2: I was aware of--oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Very much aware of it.  Very much aware of it because it was happening right down the road in Charleston [South Carolina], all that area (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know, but that--I mean, that--
Speaker 2: Very--that--
Speaker 1: --didn't influence you in any way?
Speaker 2: That didn't influence me.  That didn't say, you know what, I wanna go to this school, I wanna take this plunge, I want this challenge, you know.  And I'm sitting here trying to, you know, get this flashback, why did I do this?  I've asked myself many a time, why did I do this?  Many times I've asked myself that question.  Because everything was like--I mean, I had no research, no knowledge.  Remember, I'm coming out of the eighth grade.  I mean, period.
Speaker 1: Now, what were the--what was the other choice?  Did you have another choice?  If you hadn't gone to Woodruff, where would you have gone?
Speaker 2: I would've stayed there at New Bethel, yeah.
Speaker 1: You would--beyond grade--
Speaker 2: I would've stayed there in New Bethel High School.
Speaker 1: Beyond grade eight?
Speaker 2: Yeah, beyond--yeah, I would've went on to the ninth grade and, you know, ninth grade at New Bethel High School.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, so that--oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, you know, New Bethel High School is one school, so you start from the first grade, you go through the twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, it wasn't like where you went across the street here where you go to an elementary school, then you go to Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] or whatever.  You know, no, it was like straight to the twelfth.  There was only one school in the whole community--
Story_ID: 534849
Speaker 1: So you come as a freshman now to Woodruff High [Woodruff High School, Woodruff, South Carolina].  What courses did you take that first year?  Do you remember your courses?
Speaker 2: Unbelievable.  That's when reality set in because the books that they threw at me I had never seen in my life.  I had never studied anything, the biology, the geometry, the math.  The books I had at New Bethel High School [Woodruff, South Carolina] was hand-me-down books.  I mean, you could find your mother name in the books or whoever, nothing like this in my life, nothing like it in my life at all.  And, first class I went to was Miss Phillips [ph.] which is a biology class.  And first person she called, Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], not Robert, Foster.  I remember her very well, all the white kids just laughing, bam, ball hit me on the side of the head, you know, start talking about dissecting a frog.  I'm like, what (laughter), dissecting a frog?  You kidding me.  I'm used to catching frogs and taking them home and eating them, you know as meals.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, we--you know, that's what my father [Rusher Foster]--that was one of our meals.  You know, my father would go frog hunting.
Speaker 1: This is very special to me 'cause I majored in biology.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So you know.  So, you like, you know anything about cutting?  I'm like--I said, "Miss Phillips, I never seen any question like this in my life for the school I come from."  She said, "What?"  I said, "My book is nothing like this."  She said, "You're kidding?"  I said, "Books are nothing like this."  Next class, geometry, nothing like this.  All this was completely--now, these are two schools that are one mile apart, and reflect--once I got to that school, I mean, I thought I died and went to heaven because you had clean waxed floors, lockers, showers, lush football fields, everything, clean, beautiful landscape, unbelievable, nice blackboard, bulletin boards, no writings on the desk, one mile apart.  New Bethel, you played football during the day 'cause you didn't have any lights, you had one shower, no locker room for ladies 'cause, you know, that was it.  It was--you know, for the ladies at the black school didn't have all that.  It was only men that was getting the funding, the little bit of funding that you now realize that they were getting.  You had hand-me-down football suit, but this school was like, unbelievable.  I mean, you get nice lunch, cafeteria, the whole shebang.  But, but being there that, that first couple of weeks was something else.  Now, you gotta realize, this is only six of us in five hundred, only six, and, you know, it--
Speaker 1: Where you in the same classes or--
Speaker 2: No, we never--
Speaker 1: --did they have you kind of spread around?
Speaker 2: Spread around.  None of us ever took classes together.  That was just--that was the thing I remember the most.  Every class, there was--
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there that really took an interest in you right off the bat when you got there?
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember.  It was all a challenge, let's see what he know.  This, this is like one of those guinea pig things, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What subject did you like the most at that point?  What did you enjoy?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: History.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, I got into a little bit of history, you know.  I mean, because you start writing and, you know, about the things that you read about and discover 'cause, you know, there wasn't no such thing as black history.
Speaker 1: Were you a good reader at that point?  Do you--
Speaker 2: At, at that good time, yeah.  I was a good--I was a good reader at that time.  That was--that surprised them because what they try to do is throw me back on a level of reading of fourth and fifth grade.  But then when they put a couple of books out there about [President] Abraham Lincoln, said they were surprised that, okay, I may not--can say the words as--you know, but I can read.  I was on that level and that's the key.  Math?  You know, things like that, but it was, as I say, quite an experience.
Story_ID: 534850
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you survive--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Woodruff High [Woodruff High School, Woodruff, South Carolina] for four years.
Speaker 2: I survived it for one year--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'cause here's the story.  Here's the story.  That one year was a tough year.  You know, I learned to be humble.  I learned what it takes to be a man.  I learned what it takes to be called an N word, a coon, and how I became that, that leader of that school.  You call bullies, right?  Every school had bullies.  Now, they done called me everything.  They done pushed me everywhere.  So one day, I stepped off the bus, the big boy they call Jennings [ph.], spat in my face, straight to my face.  I mean, he just--right in it.  It was all over.  Now, this boy probably weighed a hundred pounds more than I did, but coming off a farm, I don't really think they know how strong I was.  I lit into this kid and I lit into this kid (laughter).  I mean, from the nose to the eyes, this kid was bleeding all over the face.  He don't even know what hit him.  He don't even know how he got on his back.  Matter of fact, I don't even know how I got him that quick.  But when they came out there and everybody just pulled me off of him and boom, boom, boom, the next day, everybody was backing up from me.  "How you doing, Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster]?  How you doing, Foster?"  I had white kids coming up to me, "Can I walk with you?  Can I walk with you?"  Oh, yeah.  Look, I've, I've put the big bully on his back.  I've taken over Woodruff High School.  Think about it (laughter).  So, we go up to the office the next day, Mr. Jerrick [ph.] who was the principal at the time, "Well, I understand you all had a little fight, and we're not gonna have that at this school," and bam, bam, bam, "and I could suspend you for two days or you can take five licks on the butt."  So we both looked at each other, he's sitting there with scars on him and we're sitting just like you and I, and I said, "Well, I can't--I mean, my father's [Rusher Foster] going to whoop my butt to death if I get a suspension."  I could feel that whooping my father gonna put on me, so I got to take these five licks.  And, you know, he's sitting there, "Well, I'll take my five, too."  So, he took the boy Jennings back into his office and he left the door open.  He left the door cracked, the principal.  Well, you know, one of those ping pong paddles that you got your whooping back--and, you know, so I told you I was always adventurous, right?  So, he left the door cracked, so I'm sitting there and I hear something go, pow, one, pow, two.  So I get up, I look through the crack.  Mr. Jerrick was in there hitting the sofa with the ping pong paddle.  So, Jennings come out just holding his butt as he'd been smacked.  "Foster, bend over."  So I bend over, I knew it would happen.  I just--one, two--he gave me five licks on my butt.  I turned around and I said, "That's the best you can do?  Because that sofa didn't cry and neither am I."  The man turned completely red in the face and I walked out the door.
Story_ID: 534851
Speaker 1: So, what happened after this, after you embarrassed Principal Jerrick [ph.]?
Speaker 2: He must--he was embarrassed.  You know, he respected me.  He respected me, yeah.  I mean, you know, when I walked out of that office and walked down the hall, and every day I went back to that school that year, "Good morning, Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], good morning, Foster."  I mean, I had the teachers say, good morning, Foster.  I felt like I was like a little king over here.  I would become--it was like I had become the most likeable person in that school [Woodruff High School, Woodruff, South Carolina], it's like the most likeable person in that school.
Speaker 1: And you said there were four hundred plus?
Speaker 2: About five hundred plus.
Speaker 1: That's large.
Speaker 2: Yeah, five hundred plus whites.  Yeah, five hundred plus whites.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I went to a high school of 425 and that was pretty big.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: When you're at that age--
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: --that's big.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, that's pretty big.  And one of the guys that took me under his wings that, that year was Terry Simmons.  Terry and I stay in close contact with each other.  We hadn't seen each other in over twenty years 'til maybe like four or five years ago.
Speaker 1: He was a teacher?
Speaker 2: No, he was a student.
Speaker 1: Oh, a student.
Speaker 2: He--actually, he was a senior at the time I was a freshman and we had this coach which is Coach Varner [W.L. "Willie" Varner], they called him.  That was another one of my mistakes that first year.  Nobody called him Varner, had to be Coach.  And so all the kids sitting around lunch hour, you know, Terry and all of them, you know, they've gotten pretty much used to me, whatever, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, you go through the first year, what came next?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, that first year when I was saying, New Bethel High School [Woodruff, South Carolina] burned completely to the ground, completely to the ground.  Well, guess what?  The students had nowhere to go, and at that time, I think there was Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings] from the State of South Carolina was just leaving as the governorship.  I believe we was all looking for funding to rebuild New Bethel High School I think.  And obvious, I guess the Spartanburg County [South Carolina] commissioner felt like instead of building this new New Bethel High School, what we'll do is just integrate all the schools.  So instead of taking money and rebuilding the only historically black high school in Woodruff [South Carolina], they'd rather shift that funding to all the white schools and integrate all the kids.  So that's how--'cause I would say, that one year, the next three years it was blacks being integrated in all the schools in that Woodruff area.  Never a racial problem, never protests, never.
Speaker 1: Why?  I mean, how come there weren't--
Speaker 2: Because.
Speaker 1: --protests.  You would expect it at--I mean, I would (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You would've expected it, yes.
Speaker 1: If I had heard this and living in the North, I would've--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Why?  What, what--
Speaker 2: Because it was a close knit city.  It was a close knit community.  Everybody knew everybody.  Now, your parents may've worked at the cotton mill, your parents may've been sharecroppers, your parents may've worked in the steel mill, but that community was very close.  Everybody was related to somebody (laughter).  And you had what they called during that time, you had your poor whites that were sharecroppers that went to Woodruff High.  I mean, it was one big bowl.  But there was never no sit-out, no protest, no marching, no whatever.  That second year, schools came in, sports, football, baseball, basketball, the relationship, unbelievable, unbelievable.
Story_ID: 534852
Speaker 1: What sports, athletic teams did you participate in?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did a little--tried to play golf 'til I realized blacks weren't allowed on the golf team, played a little tennis, blacks weren't allowed on the tennis team.  I mean, you know, you go out, you try, but you know you could've made it, right?  Unh-uh.  Ain't ready to be traveling throughout the South on no black tennis team, no golf course, not at that time, no.  But I made the baseball team.  I made the football team.  Took me a while, but I got there.  We had some great athletes, great black athletes.  They could never let--they never let them shine, never let them shine.  We could--I mean, that school could have turned out some of the best athletes in the South if they had let them shine.  The coach would not let them.  I mean, we had guys running 10.4, 10.5, hundred-yard dash.  You're talking '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  You're talking about a guy named Donald Young [Donald "Monk" Young] could average forty-five points a night, one of the smoothest jump shooters you ever seen in your life.  You talking about a guy named Larry Fryer, one of the best running backs in the State of Carolina.  I mean, had it all, the package, but you didn't let them shine.  I mean, you know, on a Friday night, you play the white family boy, right?  That's just the way it was (laughter).  But, you know, that last year that I participated in football, we won another state championship, beat a team from Columbia, South Carolina.  And wonderful relationship.  I mean, there was white and black--
Speaker 1: What position did you play on the football field?
Speaker 2: Played cornerback and fullback.  Yeah.  I mean, I was 180 pounds.  I was a big little kid.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, and the best year of my life was room making, first time having a roommate with white kids, you know, and we went to camp.  We roommate with white kids and it worked out well.  I mean, you know, as I said, not that you would expect it, but we--it was a very close-knitted community.  I mean, like I said, peoples knew peoples and if you played football, you supported each other.
Speaker 1: In addition to participating on these teams, were there other school activities that you participated in outside the classroom?  Any other--
Speaker 2: Outside, no, not that many, no, no.  I mean, when I got out of school, I had to go home--you know, I'd go to the farm, man.  I got to pick cotton.  You know, I got to do what I got to do.  I mean, your father [Rusher Foster] was still working.  You know, you didn't have time to be in these social programs.  I mean, you know, where we lived, you catch a bus and you do what you got to do.  And when you did miss school, like I said, you was out there in the cotton field trying to catch up.
Speaker 1: When were the times that you missed school, high school?  Would--
Speaker 2: High school was--that was like during the cotton picking season because you got that--like that middle of July, August is when the cotton comes in.  You'd be so embarrassing.
Speaker 1: But the school was closed in the summer, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: No, sometimes went to school year round as kids.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, if you--if you didn't do that, you was picking--
Speaker 1: So if you missed school during July or August--
Speaker 2: You went to summer school.  You--I mean, you had to catch up.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had to catch--I mean, most folks knew that peoples who were sharecropping, you know, there was always gonna be summer school.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?  As you moved to your sophomore, junior, senior, what kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was just--I was an average (laughter) student.  I got out of there with a D average, man.  Look, I got out of there with a D average.  I could've probably got out of there with a C plus or B average if I would've concentrated on my studies and did what I was supposed to do, but--
Speaker 1: Did they give a lot of what we call homework, home study as I like to call it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, homework.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: They did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they get--I mean, you know, you had your homework.  As a matter of fact, if you did it fine, if you didn't, you get an F, right?  Yeah, well (laughter), some of us did, some of us didn't.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was one of those kids that I did some time, I didn't do some time.  Look, I had friends, too, if I didn't do my homework, you know, they would make sure I have it the next day when I get to school 'cause you had to maintain a certain average to play football.
Speaker 1: But you liked school?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  I liked school.  I mean, it was the relationship of students, teachers, and peoples, you know, it was wonderful years of my life.  The first year was a growing year, you know, but the other years there at Woodruff High [Woodruff High School, Woodruff, South Carolina] was some wonderful times.  I mean, you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You establish your personality, your relationship, friendships that last forever (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As you moved toward--
Story_ID: 534853
Speaker 1: Did you have any notions or any feelings or clues about what you might wanna do as a career, as an occupation?  Did you have any thoughts about what you were gonna do once you left high school [Woodruff High School, Woodruff, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Left high school.  I wanted to go to San Francisco [California].  That was my dream, my dream.  If ever got out of high school and saved enough money, I'm going to San Francisco.
Speaker 1: Why San Francisco?
Speaker 2: Well, I happened to see this movie one night.  It was a black and white TV, Cary Grant dressed in his double-breasted suit, just fascinating.  I can't remember the movie, but I'm like, gee, if I ever get out of high school and save me some money, it's a beautiful city.  You know, they showed--you know, the backdrop of it, this Cary Grant, you know, smooth, hair, you know.  Remember, I'm twenty years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm looking at this, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm like, boy, I'd love to go to San Francisco.
Speaker 1: But in terms of occupation or career?
Speaker 2: Careers, didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You didn't--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: You hadn't thought about anything special?
Speaker 2: Hadn't thought about, hadn't even thought about it.  Thought about the Marine--
Speaker 1: The [U.S.] Marine Corps?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, thought about the Marine Corps because I had some friends the year before that that just went into the Marine Corps, just went into the [U.S.] Army as well.  You know, you have recruiters that come around during that time, you know, promise you the world, you get to go to Hawaii (laughter), you know, you join the Marines.  So the Marines was high on my list.  The Marines was high on my list.  And, but also, just watching my father [Rusher Foster] come up on that farm and do what he wanted to do, I wanted to get into some business, too.  I wanted to find a way to get them off that farm and I knew that you had to have some type of business to get out of there, so that's why I ended up going to business school for a while, you know.
Story_ID: 534854
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good, before we leave the formal schooling from Bethel [New Bethel High School, Woodruff, South Carolina] through Woodruff [Woodruff High School, Woodruff, South Carolina], let me just come back to your entire growing up years that span.  What sights, sounds, and smells remind you now of your growing up years in Cashville [South Carolina] and going through New Bethel and Woodruff?
Speaker 2: Well, the smells would probably be just my gardening around here, you know, the smell.  Because, you know, you come up on a farm and that's why I got a lot of flowers and plants.  That always keeps me humble, keeps me natural.  Everything I plant reminds me of my childhood, you know.  When I plant certain plants, when you say smell, it's like hydrangeas, honeysuckles, things like that.  Those are my childhood smells.  That's the plants I plant out here.  When I walk out there, I still have that, you know.  The sights (laughter), you know, I didn't come up with skyscrapers and buildings and stuff, so, you know, if I just think of anything sight, I just--you know, just looking at what the world is, you know, just a larger vision of it, you know.  But, how beautiful the sky, you know, the moon.  When you're sitting out there on your porch and smacking mosquitoes and you see the stars.  You know, being here gives me that opportunity to see that sight 'cause, you know, you don't have lights in the city.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You didn't have lights in the country (laughter).  So this--that sight.  You know, as you can see, the trees, the changing of the fall and the color.  But as I refer back and I was saying like the smell, it's the plants that I plant--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that reminds me (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 534855
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did your brothers and sisters also attend Woodruff?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: They did.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you were--
Speaker 2: Except my older sister.  Now, my older sister, Shirley [Shirley Foster Berry], had just graduated from New Bethel High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's the only one that graduated from New Bethel High.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On graduation day or graduation year from Woodruff High School, was mother [Bernice Greene Foster] and father [Rusher Foster] there for your graduation?  Did they attend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, that--they were there.  Yeah, they was there.  I mean--
Speaker 1: What did they say?  Do you remember how they felt or?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they saw me graduate.  I mean, you know it's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You put your overalls on, your white shirt, you come to--come to graduation, that's it.
Speaker 1: Have they ever visited the school--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Woodruff, while you were--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --there?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  My father came to one football game.  I remember seeing my father stand in the corner, one football game, probably one football game, never visited the school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Well, in those days for me, too, parents just never went to high school.
Speaker 2: They never went, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: They never came, and, and parents weren't welcome.  Now, this is the North.  They didn't come to high school for anything.  There wasn't even a PTA [Parent Teacher Association] as we know it today.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: There wasn't--
Speaker 2: My--you know, my sister, Shirley, was my biggest influence in trying to get my homework and stuff, you know.  You know, your mother had an eighth grade education, your father had an eighth grade education.  Father wasn't a good writer, wasn't a good reader, not the stuff he would understand.  So you, you relied on your older sisters or the kids you went to school with, you know, because you know everything else wasn't there.
Story_ID: 534856
Speaker 1: So, you graduated in May, June of 1969--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I believe from Woodruff--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --High School [Woodruff High School, Woodruff, South Carolina].  What came next that summer and the following year?
Speaker 2: That, that--let's see, it was '69 [1969], '70 [1970], it was going to Greenville Business College [Greenville, South Carolina] for a few--try to get into business school, you know, which was just a local school.  And also there was a job I thought I was gonna do, trying out for Phillips Fire [ph.].  It was me and this guy named Grover Todd [ph.], we worked there for a couple of months (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the business?
Speaker 2: It was like driving a forklift.  Never was good at that forklift (laughter).  You know, I'm like--I've done enough peaches, I've done enough cotton, I've done enough hay, I've done enough soybeans, so I'm sitting around there in September, 1970, 'cause I--'cause I came out, yeah, so I did all that for four or five months and then it's the following year, 1970.  So I'm sitting there on the porch one afternoon and my mother [Bernice Greene Foster] and my brother were sitting there, two brothers, Larry [Larry Foster] and Dave [David Foster], and San [Sandra Foster Norman], which was almost a little bit younger than me.  And Willie James, who was my first cousin had just came home from Washington [D.C.].  He had moved here maybe six or seven years 'cause Willie James--yeah, 'cause he was in his sixties.
Speaker 1: James?  Willie James?
Speaker 2: Willie James Greene, called him Black Boy (laughter).  Don't ask me why, but that's what it was.  Came home that September, which probably if you flash back probably was for that Labor Day weekend or that Labor Day week.  And, anyway, his old '68 [1968] Skylark Buick [Buick Skylark], black--gray with a black top.  So, he came by to visit my mother before he was getting ready to hit 85 North [Interstate 85], 95 [Interstate 95].  So, we all sitting there on the porch, you know, still living in the same old country house, you know, whatever.  So, he pulls up and we're sitting there chatting, and I'm sitting there.  Once again, don't ask me why I got in that car (laughter).  So he said, "Well, what do you think?"  And I said, "Look, I have sixty-eight dollars, a couple pair of slacks, shirts."  He said, "Well, you know, you still got your half-brother that just moved to Washington, Wilbur [Wilbur Greene, Jr.]."
Speaker 1: Wilbur?
Speaker 2: Wilbur Greene, had been in Washington maybe two or three years, half-brother.  I didn't have a close relationship with my brother, oldest brother, didn't have that close.  I said, "Well, Willie James, where do you think I'm gonna stay?"  He said, "Well, maybe your brother will let you stay with him."  I said, "You gotta be kidding."  Man, as crabby as that man is (laughter).  I said, "What am I gonna do?  What kind of work am I gonna do?"  He's like, "Well, you'll figure it out."  I said, "You want me to get in the backseat of this car, me and you, we gonna drive to Washington, D.C.?"  He said, "Yeah."  And you know Willie James chewing his Doublemint spearmint gum, little bit older than I was, you know, had his cool cigarette.  So, guess what?  Went in the little back room, got me two pair of slacks, got me a couple white shirts, sock, little brown and black shoes, sixty-eight dollars in my pocket, told my mother I'm going.  "Boy, where you think you're going?  You can't be going to no Washington, D.C.  You don't have no money, you don't know where you gonna live?  What you think you gonna do?"  I said, "Well, I'm gonna deal with it."  "You wait 'til your father [Rusher Foster] gets home.  You know he's gonna have a fit."  So there's Dave and Larry and San sitting on the porch, "Robert Lee [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], you really gonna leave?"  You really--got in the car, four o'clock that evening.  Eight o'clock that next morning, was over at 707 Congress Street.  So Willie James said, "Well, Greene, I brought your brother back with me."  "Well, what do you think he gonna do?  Where do you think he gonna live?"  And he was living in a one-bedroom apartment.  I never seen nothing like this in my life, man.
Speaker 1: Where was he living?
Speaker 2: 707 Congress Street.
Speaker 1: Congress?
Speaker 2: Congress, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: C-O-N-G-R-E-S-S.
Speaker 1: Northwest?
Speaker 2: Yeah, southeast.
Speaker 1: Northeast?
Speaker 2: Southeast.
Speaker 1: Southeast, yeah.
Speaker 2: Southeast right off Alabama Avenue--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that area over there now, you know.  So he said, well, you just got out of high school, you got no education, I don't know what you gonna do, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: Education, you had gone to the business school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, going to the business school.
Speaker 1: Had, had you completed a course--
Speaker 2: Had not completed.
Speaker 1: --of study?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did some studying, but didn't complete the degree in anything.
Speaker 1: What courses did you take?
Speaker 2: It was just like a--it was a course in economics whatever and deferred, I just left there, too.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Just left there, too (laughter).  I mean, I guess they was expecting me to come back to school.  I just, just left there, too.  So we was right into accounting and finance about business and stuff, so I'm just, just left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, my brother said, "Well, you can't stay here free."  I said, "Well, you know, my intention is not to stay here free.  My intention is to go on to San Francisco [California]."  That was still there.  "Well, until the meantime, you gotta have a job," 'cause you--I mean, he was only paying ninety-two dollars a month at the most, you know.
Story_ID: 534857
Speaker 1: What was he doing, your brother [Wilbur Greene, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Actually, my brother was working for the architect of the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: For the architect of the--
Speaker 2: Architect of the Capitol.  He was an iceman.  He delivered ice to all the senators' offices before they come to work in the morning.  So, he referred me to GPO.  He said, "Well, I'm gonna take you to GPO."
Speaker 1: Which is General--
Speaker 2: General Printing Office [U.S. Government Publishing Office], you know.  But I got off at Union Station [Washington, D.C.], right.  And he said, well, you go down South Capitol Street, I guess, to GPO at the time.  So I'm like, I walked out of Union Station, I looked straight up 1st Street and I see these three buildings, you know, the Capitol, the Russell [Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.], and the Dirksen Senate Office Building [Washington, D.C.].  So I decide to walk up that way, once again, adventurous.  You know, I done left home, got to Union Station, they tell me go here to find a job.  I turn and go this way.  So, that's when I walk into the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and, you know, looked at the directory.  You know, it had banking, judiciary, commerce, labor.  I'm like, commerce.  I've heard of that word somewhere before, commerce committee, fifth floor, 5202, that was the room number at the time.  So I just got on the elevator.  During that time, they had an elevator operator.  I said, number five please, southern talk (laughter), had to master all these northern words.
Speaker 1: So you just walked right in, nobody stopped or--
Speaker 2: Nobody.  There wasn't security at that time.
Speaker 1: --you didn't have to sign anything?
Speaker 2: No, not at that--
Speaker 1: Didn't check you out?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  You just walked through the ground floor to--there was no police officer, there was nothing.  You just open the door and you walk in.  I mean, you know, you just walk in.  You just read the board and that was it.  That's the way it was.  So I just got on the elevator and went up to the fifth floor and walked down the hall.  And, you know, and once again, walked into the commerce committee, and a little lady sitting at the front desk named Isabel Peterson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Isabel?
Speaker 2: Isabel Peterson.  And at the time, she was the public information director for the commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] under the chairmanship of Senator Warren G. Magnuson from Washington State.  And when I walked in there and she said, "Can I help you?"  You know, I said, "Well, I'm looking for a job," just like that.  She said, "You're looking for a job?  You got a res- ."  No resume, no nothing.  All I have is my white shirt, gray slacks, you know, got my little Afro comb, you know.  That was it.  That was it.  And she started asking me, "Well, you know anything about filing bills?"  "Yes, ma'am."  "You know anything about resolutions?"  "Yes, ma'am."  But in here, I had no idea what she was talking about, no idea.  So she said, "Well, you know, we're looking for somebody and the chairman needs somebody to do some clerical work and also be a runner."  I'm like, a runner (laughter), you know, so it was like that.  So she said, "I'll tell you what, here's this envelope.  I want you to take it over to SR-124 in the Senate Russell Office Building."  Where?  Russell Senate Office Building.  She didn't tell me how to get there, she didn't tell me where it was.  So I get on the elevator, go back down on the first floor to ground floor, walks up by the [U.S.] Supreme Court, walk across the street, I'm looking, I'm trying to find the name Russell Building, you know, like I did Dirksen Building, you know.  So I finally ask one of the guardsman that was standing there on the street.  I said, "Sir, where is the Russell Senate Office Building?"  The guy said, "You can't see that big building right here, boy?"  I said, "Oh, I didn't know."  So I went in on the second floor of the Russell Senate Office Building, went down to the first floor, walked around, finally found 124.  And when I walked in, nice office, nice, luxury office, good furniture back in them days.  So, these two ladies, I remember very well, it was Alma [ph.] and Rita [ph.], who was the personal secretary for Senator Warren G. Magnuson.  So, I tell them I'm over here to deliver an envelope and Ms. Peterson wanted me to make sure that Senator Magnuson get this envelope.  They said, "Well, you won't be able to see the senator.  We'll take the envelope and make sure that the senator gets it."  I said, "No, Ms. Peterson told me to make sure I give this envelope to Senator Magnuson," you know.  I mean, I had good instruction, you know.  So, they said, "Well, we can't do that.  Well, you just--."  I said, "Well, I'm just gonna take the envelope back to Ms. Peterson and I'll just tell her why I couldn't deliver this envelope to Senator Warren G. Magnuson."  So I found my way back to the Dirksen, 5202, and I said, "Ms. Peterson, the ladies wouldn't let me deliver this envelope to Senator Magnuson."  She said, "Good, you're hired."  And I've been there ever since.  I've been there ever since.  So, she said, "Now you just take the envelope and put it back there on the table."  So, I got the envelope and looked, "I'm like, Ms. Peterson, there's nothing in the envelope (laughter).  There's nothing in this envelope."
Speaker 1: What'd she say?
Speaker 2: "You know, I know that.  Just wanted to see, could you follow instruction."  I said, "Well, I'll be doggone."  Once again, you've been adventurous, but I fooled you too, didn't I?  We had a wonderful--that wonderful relationship.
Story_ID: 534858
Speaker 1: She called this one lady over, Joan Bowers, who was the financial clerk for the commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] at the time.  And Ms. Peterson [Isabel Peterson (ph.)] said, "Well, put Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster] on the payroll, clerical assistant plus runner."
Speaker 2: This is the same day?
Speaker 1: Same day, almost the same day, yeah.  This is what I'm saying (laughter), almost in--and, you know, Joan said, "Well, I can't do that today, Ms. Peterson.  We'll have to wait 'til Featherstone Reid [Warren Featherstone Reid] and Fred Lordan come in tomorrow so Robert can meet," these--you know, the staff director and the chief council.  So, you know, Ms. Peterson, well, that's, okay, no problem.  So, Ms. Peterson had me doing this, doing this, and doing this (laughter).  I mean, I worked all day.  I feel like I didn't get paid for this.
Speaker 2: Doing what?
Speaker 1: Just running errands, finding my way around, the whole shebang, pulling out file cabinets, learning to do this.  One lady named Ethel Stahl, helping Ethel, you know, the whole shebang.  I mean, you know, now I haven't filled out no paperwork, no nothing yet.  And then, you know, Ms. Peterson, the conversation was, now do you wanna be a police officer?  I can get a patron job as a police officer or I can get you into the White House [Washington, D.C.].  You know, she started telling me how much connection she had with Lyndon B. Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and the Kennedys.  Oh, she, she was connected, the whole shebang.  She was very connected, and little short lady.
Speaker 2: And there was no, what we call human resources office today or a personnel office--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --that you had to go to?
Speaker 1: I didn't do any of this (laughter).  So, you know, I go back home the next day, catch--brother [Wilbur Greene, Jr.] tell me what bus to catch, the 98 whatever bus I got on, but I'll tell you--I was all--look, I was adventure--I was all over the place, finally got to Congress Street.  "Brother, I told you to wait for me up there on that corner.  Don't be walking through this neighborhood.  It's dangerous."  You know, this is 1970.  I'm like, "Well, you know what?  I walked through this neighborhood and I spoke to everybody, you know, got along just fine.  I made it."  Then, I told him, I said, "You know I got a job for the commerce committee."  "You what?"  I said, "Yeah, I got a job for the commerce committee."  And at the time, he was working over in the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.].  "How you get a job for the commerce committee and all these guys around here been trying to get into these offices?"  You know, 'cause there wasn't no black working in any of those offices at the time.  I said, "Look," I just went (laughter) up there and told the lady I needed a job and I just--Ms. Peterson, and they all knew Ms. Peterson.  They all knew her.  So I went back the next day and they put me on the payroll for $3992 a year.  That's a lot of money coming from making fifty cents an hour, you know, working on the farm or whatever.  So, the next year, you know, a little salary increase, you know.  But--
Speaker 2: And so your title at that time?
Speaker 1: My title was clerical assistant and runner and I did all the messenger work, and the runner thing got me, though.
Speaker 2: The what?
Speaker 1: The runner.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I mean, it was like, what's a runner?  So they would call me over to the chairman's office, look, okay, you need to make a run, so I would run to (unclear), the little liquor store to pick up this Smirnoff, the rum.  I took care of their personal stuff.  They trusted me for that, wonderful.  The chairman respected me for that because what went on with the chairman stayed chair, became credibility, it became loyalty.
Speaker 2: Now, who was the chairperson again?
Speaker 1: The chairperson at that time was Senator Warren G. Magnuson--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: From the State of Washington, Washington State, and wonderful man, little short man, cigar, very powerful, appropriations [U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations] chairman, very powerful, very powerful man, very consumer.  When you look at product safety, labeling, and OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration], that was his legacy.  This is the man that put all that together.  This is the chairman who put it all together, very smart.  Some folks don't--you know, we don't think of those little things where you reach across the aisle and you see the--you know, even on, like I said all the labeling, food labeling and all this stuff, consumer laws, this is some--this is the chairman, this is the senator who made a lot of this happen, you know, with, you know cross partisan working relationship with Senator Norris Cotton [Norris H. Cotton] and Young [Milton R. Young] and Senator Pearson [James B. Pearson] and Senator Cook [Marlow W. Cook] and Senator Hartke [R. Vance Hartke] and Senator Hart [Philip Hart], and Senator Hartke, Senator Pastore [John O. Pastore] and Senator Muskie [Edmund S. Muskie] and Senator Baker [Howard H. Baker, Jr.], Senator Cannon [Howard W. Cannon] and Senator Proxmire [William Proxmire].  You know, this is going way back (laughter).  This is where you had that partisan working relationship.
Story_ID: 534859
Speaker 1: Mr. Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], since we're gonna be talking about your long tenure with the committee, Senate Committee on Commerce [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] and your moving up in, in various positions there, would you tell us as background what is the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and, and Transportation, what's its goal, its mission, its purpose?  What does it do?  Just give us kind of a background on the committee.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, the commerce committee if you go back in history was established probably back in 1937, '38 [1938].  I'm not exactly, so I have to go back into my book, but by that time, it only had like nine to ten members on the commerce committee, and over the years it growed up from 9, 10, 11, 12, depending on how [U.S.] Congress swung in different eras--
Story_ID: 534860
Speaker 1: You were giving us a history of the Senate--
Speaker 2: Commerce committee.
Speaker 1: --commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The, the committee on commerce is one of the, I think there's like twelve standing committees and commerce is probably third most powerful committee there is on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.].  We have jurisdiction over telecommunication, OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration], fishery, [U.S.] Coast Guard, science, aviation, surface transportation, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], major, major impact on how people's lives--live during the day.  When you go back and you look at 1996, the Telecom Communication Act [Telecommunications Act of 1996] that passed through the commerce committee, affected everybody's life, you know, from the Internet to your telephones to your--you know, that was our major legislation. But if you go back into Chairman Warren G. Magnuson, as I said earlier, you go back to truth in advertising, the labeling because we had jurisdiction over agencies like the FTC [Federal Trade Commission], the FCC [Federal Communications Commission].  We make sure they carry out their jurisdiction and protecting consumers' interest when fraud, you know, identity theft, we deal with all that now as well.  So, you know, different nominations of all these departments and agencies from the commerce department to the [U.S.] Department of Commerce to the FCC.  We appoint all the FCC commissioners, all the FTC commissioners, all the maritime commissioners, all the Coast Guard appointees come through commerce committee, a lot of the NASA, which is--you know, comes through commerce as well, directors, so we get into a lot of things on the commerce committee and it's a wonderful committee.  And if you ever study it, you'll realize that everything we do affects your everyday life.
Speaker 1: How many members on that committee today?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twenty-one.  Get it right, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], because that's my job.  There's twenty-one members today.  Twenty-one members today.
Speaker 1: And how do they get that position on the committee?
Speaker 2: Seniority.  You come through the rank of a senator or you get selected by the caucus to be on the commerce committee.  You know, so that's very privileged--a lot of folks, a lot of senators would love to be on commerce committee.  I've had the opportunity to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They're all senators now?
Speaker 2: They're all senators.  Oh, yeah, you got to--
Speaker 1: From both--
Speaker 2: --be a senator--
Speaker 1: From both sides, all right.
Speaker 2: From both sides.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, as I said, I've had the privilege of being on commerce committee for, what, close to thirty-seven years and I had--Senator Warren G. Magnuson was my chairman from Washington State, Senator Howard Cannon [Howard W. Cannon] from Nevada was a commerce committee chairman, Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings] from the State of South Carolina, Senator Danforth [John Danforth] from Missouri, Senator Pressler [Larry Pressler] from South Dakota, Senator McCain [John McCain] from Arizona, and now I'm working with my best friend, Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska.
Story_ID: 534861
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell me about your relationship with Senator Stevenson [sic. Ted Stevens].
Speaker 1: I was with Commerce [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] when Senator Stevens came over in 1972, '73 [1973] and Senator Magnuson [Warren G. Magnuson] took Stevens under his arm and he'll tell you today, Senator Magnuson was his man.  Because during that time, the [U.S.] Senate ratio was like almost, what, 70/30, seventy Democrats and thirty Republicans, so you needed a friend.  But the State of Alaska and Senator Magnuson, which was from the State of Washington, had something in common.  It's called ocean, fishery, stuff like that, so that was connected there.  So Senator Magnuson was glad to have Senator Stevens on the commerce committee, and it took Senator Stevens over thirty years to become chairman, but today he's chairman.  But, you know--and he would've been chairman I think a long time ago, but I think Chairman Magnuson at the time asked Stevens to set up the amateur committee for athletes, and that had to do with establish some type of role where amateurs can get the same type of funding, Title IX, and all that stuff.
Speaker 2: How much time do you spend with the chairperson?
Speaker 1: Oh, not much at all, not much at all.  I mean, I see the chairman at all the hearings because I make sure that the chairman hearing room and all like that is set up, me and another person on the staff, so if we have hearings five days a week, I'll see the chairman five days a week.  But when it get into the policy side, I don't have that much connection with him at all.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: But, you know--
Speaker 2: You mentioned Senator John McCain.  Tell me about your relationship with him.  What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I knew Senator John McCain before he even became a senator (laughter).
Speaker 2: How was that?
Speaker 1: Well, because he worked--he was working for the Senate Navy liaison office [U.S. Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs] there in the Senate Office Building [Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.].  Yeah, so I had a nice little chat conversation, not intimate, but there was a cordial little, good morning, my friend.  How you doing, sir?  Whatever, whatever, and I think the way if I'm not mistaking, and I may be wrong and I quote unquote where there was Senator Goldwater [Barry Goldwater]--no, was it Morris Udall [Morris K. Udall], and I think Senator McCain took his place as a congressman for a while, and then, I believe it was Barry Goldwater who passed away, and I think that's where McCain came in to Arizona.  So, you know, there are times you have to go back and look at the history of this stuff, but I know there was some Goldwater and Morris Udall connection there of how he got to be a senator, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, wonderful, wonderful chairman, as commerce committee chairman, wonderful person.
Story_ID: 534862
Speaker 1: When you became the staff assistant [on the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation], it was 1970, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a clerical assistant in 19--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, clerical assistant, okay.
Speaker 2: Clerical assistant, you know, just like being a messenger, still rolling, baby (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  Who was the president?
Speaker 2: Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].  President--yeah, Richard M. Nixon.  Yeah, was it Richard M. Nixon?  Yeah, President Richard M. Nixon, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have any contact with him at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean, that's the White House [Washington, D.C.].  I was only--(laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  I know, but--
Speaker 2: No contact at all.  But the only contact I had with, with President Nixon at that time is through Fred Thompson, and I say Fred Thompson because Fred Thompson was the special counsel for the Watergate committee of the Senate [Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities] and became Senator Thompson, well became actor, then Senator Fred Thompson from the State of Tennessee.  So, you know, and we had a wonderful little friendship.
Speaker 1: Did the Watergate incident affect your work in any way?  Did it--
Speaker 2: No.  Well, it just--
Speaker 1: Did it impact--
Speaker 2: --took up a lot of [U.S.] Senate time, you know, where they could've been focusing on some other major pieces of legislation, like any investigation, you know, like the Clarence Thomas, like the 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  You know, it affects what the Senate needs to be done on its daily basis, you know, more important issue, but that is an important issue, so, yeah.  We--if my chairman is part of that commission or that committee, then normally we won't have hearings, so our work becomes a little slower in those areas, so--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But it doesn't affect us from coming to work every day and doing what we're supposed to do, so we still have to come to work.  But it not only--it slows the whole Senate down--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when you have investigations and things like that.  Because as you know--
Speaker 1: Now, you moved from the clerical work to higher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Staffs--
Speaker 1: --higher responsibility.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that transition.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the next move for you in the--
Speaker 2: Well, it took a while, passed over quite a few times, passed over, so, you know, it's like any other job.  It wasn't about your knowledge, but somewhere I moved up under Senator Howard- no, Senator Danforth [John Danforth], Packwood [Bob Packwood], he changed that title to staff, you know, in some ways, you know.  So they give you a little bit more lead to do some things for the staff, a little bit more responsibility such as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, how did those responsibilities change?
Speaker 2: Well, you become--it didn't change that much because I enjoyed doing what I was doing as a clerical assistant.  I still controlled the Public Information Office, all the mail, all the furniture, all those things didn't really change that much.  You know, actually the job pretty much stayed the same because I enjoyed doing it.  And they always like, "Well, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster] do you wanna do this or you wanna try this?"  But I enjoyed doing that because it kept me connected with all the peoples that I needed to be with.  So, you know, when they needed X, X, X, they knew who to call.  You know, Robert can take care of it.  You know, when they wanted to find X, X, X, give Robert a call.  Robert will know where to find that for you.  It became--I became somebody they depended on to do things, you know.  Now, there's a policy side, there's a legislative side, but there's a middle where somebody has to make that committee function on another level, and that's where I came in in the Public Information Office.  What we do is we keep the history of the committee.  We file reports.  We file bills.  Now, if you call the committee tomorrow and you wanted a report from 1970, I can get it for you.  I have that information and it happened every day because it's called research.  It's something you won't find on the Internet, but I will have it for you.  And if I don't have it in the office, I know where you can find it.
Speaker 1: So you would get calls, requests from whom?  Who were the people--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --that call you from--
Speaker 2: You get from other senators' office, governors, state, secretaries, yeah, from all over, all over, all over.  I mean, matter of fact, I got a call not too long ago concerning record labeling and I'm like, gee, that was back in the '80s [1980s], record labeling.  So, you know, that issue is still out there where with the new hip hop music and stuff and folks want to see who testified and, you know, what did Jack Valenti have to say during those times?  A lot of that stuff still exists.  So, you know, we still get calls on that.  And like I said, we have a history which is located in the Public Information Office.  We keep that stuff.  We keep records of it.  And, you know, if you ever need it, it's there.  It's there.
Story_ID: 534863
Speaker 1: During these early years, what special connections or friendships, so to speak, collegialities, did you develop with various senators?  Are there any persons that--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --you had--
Speaker 2: --yeah, in my early years, I developed a wonderful relationship with Senator Pearson [James B. Pearson] from the State of Kansas.  Senator Pearson used to come down the hall every day, and I used to kind of wear my hair kind of bald back then.  Senator Pearson used to rub my head every day, always.  We was--we'd come off farm country, and we'd talk about farming, and it was a wonderful relationship with Senator Pearson.  And there was Senator Proxmire [William Proxmire] from the State of Wisconsin who would always, you know, the best dressed man on the fifth floor, you know, wonderful relationship there and--
Speaker 1: When you got your first job as a runner, clerical aide, who was the senator from South Carolina?
Speaker 2: It was still Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings].
Speaker 1: It was Hollings?
Speaker 2: I mean, Thurmond [Strom Thurmond], Senator Thurmond and Senator Hollings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember, they just left a couple years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I mean, they had the State of South Carolina locked up for, what, over a hundred years.  I mean, you know, they just got senator, what, Lindsey Graham and Senator DeMint [Jim DeMint], both been in what, this is their first term.  So--
Speaker 1: So, did you have interactions with Senator Strom Thurmond?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his staff especially, yeah, um-hm.  Duke Short, had a lot of interactions with him because when I needed some personal stuff taken care of, the one senator who was there was Senator Thurmond.  Thurmond would take care of home for you.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so you interacted with the staffs of all the--
Speaker 2: Oh, of all--
Speaker 1: --all the members of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, see I was--
Speaker 1: --committee.
Speaker 2: Remember, I'm non-partisan.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm non-partisan.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'm right in the middle.  I have to have a relationship with both sides of the aisle, but my loyalty has always been to my chairmen, but I had relationships with both side of the--I mean, from Senator Thurmond, from Senator Hollings, from Senator McCain [John McCain] to, to Senator Cotton [Norris H. Cotton] to Senator Jesse Helms to Senator Santorum [Rick Santorum] to--oh, I've--you know--
Speaker 1: Did Senator Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] ever serve on this committee?
Speaker 2: No, Senator Kennedy never served on commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation].  He's always been on judiciary [U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary] and labor [U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions], um-hm.  That was his bread and butter.  If you notice--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was Senator Kennedy's bread and butter, health, labor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, commerce wouldn't have served his purpose.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have any interaction with him?
Speaker 2: Oh, I--oh, I saw him every day in the hall.  I went to all his Christmas parties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, remember, Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] is a very small place.  You get to know everybody.  I mean, I've had the chance to sit down with Senator Kennedy and have coffee, chat with his son [Edward M. Kennedy, Jr.] who lost his leg, got to know his kids very well.
Speaker 1: What did you and Ted Kennedy used to talk about?
Speaker 2: You know, that's family--that's history.
Speaker 1: 'Cause every time I saw him, he would say to me, "Oh, we got a lot to talk about.  We've got a lot to talk about."  And then he'd keep on going.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we just--everyday life.  "How you doing, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster]?  What's been going on?  How's everything?"  Just life.  You know, politics wasn't there, just life in general.  Life in gen- that's, that's the type of relationship that I've established with all the senators that I work with on the Hill.  I mean, there are times we get into little issues, but mostly it's been about just everyday life.  How you doing?  How was your weekend?  How's your family?  You know, football, baseball, you know, like right now Senator Coleman [Norm Coleman] and Senator Sununu [John E. Sununu], I'm a Yankee [New York Yankees] fan, they're Red Sox [Boston Red Sox] fans.  We go after it all the time.  We see each other in the hall (laughter).  I mean, when the Yankees lost the playoffs, you know, the first time I see Senator Sununu, you know, all that money and no championship.  I'm like, "Well, we beat you guys five straight times," so that was all I wanted to do, you know, when they beat the Red Sox.  When the Yankees--I'm like, that made my year right there (laughter).  So, I mean, this is the conversation that we have, you know, walking up and down the hall every day in relationship.  I mean, you know, it doesn't get technical, it doesn't get personal, you know, because it's--the one thing you learn about Capitol Hill, this--it becomes family.  We take care of each other.  It's family.
Story_ID: 534864
Speaker 1: --I wanna come back to people, but I wanna talk a little bit about the legislative process.  Can you take me through the process of how a bill (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Becomes a--
Speaker 1: --gets a hearing and becomes, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, you have to have a great interest.  Let's take an example.  Let's use an example where we had, you know, telecommunication.  Okay, so you get all your telecom industries, peoples together.  Obviously, the public is crying out saying, you know, cable bills are too high, service is not getting right, you know.  So what you do is, the way a bill becomes a law is, you start doing your research on all this because it's at the public interest.  And what you do, most chairman will schedule a hearing and they will get testimonies from different witnesses of that sector, whatever that subject that, you know, may be of interest to the public at the time, and we'll go through that cycle.  We'll go through that cycle, you know.  If--well, first of all, they have to introduce a certain type of bill.  The chairman will put a bill on the calendar, say S.1921, S.19-2, whatever he lists you put that, that's the--he's gonna name this bill.  And you back up and you get testimonies from different, you know, as I say, witnesses from that sector, you know, to testify to bring some attention.  Then, you get the other members on the committee to kind of go along with you that, you know, we need legislation on this issue.  We need to protect our consumer from false advertising, identity theft, things like that, you know.  So you start drafting up this bill, bam, bam, bam.  Obvious, you gonna have some different senators who gonna diff- disagree because they got to protect their interest as well, you know, their bread and butter, so they gonna have amendments and substitute amendments and things like that that they wanna put into the bill.  And once you get that bill, you know, adopted and dressed and you get all the little fine things worked out, you know, then what we have is what they call a markup, like an executive session, where we'll go over the bill and report it out of the commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation].  Let's say we report out S.1991, we reported that bill out twenty-one to nothing because everybody agreed that, you know, something needed to be done about truth, labeling, advertise, different subjects.  By that time, the bill will be placed on the [U.S.] Senate calendar on the floor, and somehow the chairman will work his way with the majority leader to get the bill to be placed on the calendar to be debated by the full Senate.  Once the full Senate debates it, it may pass, it may not.  If it doesn't pass, you in trouble, you know, just like a dead bill.  But, and then once, once that passes, sometime it may go to conference such as we just did to the maritime security bill.  They worked--on commerce committee, we worked very, very hard having different hearings, different agencies to come and testify on the maritime security bill and the Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Inouye [Daniel Inouye] and--who's the chairman and ranking chairman and the staff, you know, did a wonderful job in working out the different issues of this bill in trying to make sure that it was a bill that was going to protect you and I, port security, safety, and also, you know, the country as a whole against terrorism.  So there was long nights, long days, amendments and substitute amendments and word changes, and--
Speaker 1: Now, all through this process--
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: --although it may be more, but all through this process, what is your specific role?
Speaker 2: Well, my specific role during that process is making sure that everybody has what they need to work with.  If they need to research, if they need their certain office equipment, fax machine, telephones, everything's got to be functioning.  My job is to make sure you got what you need to do your job, period.  You know, that's my job.  You know, I make you comfortable.  I make you wanna come to work every day.
Story_ID: 534865
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there a bill on the table this very moment that you're working on?
Speaker 2: The telecommunication, H.R. 5252 [Advanced Telecommunications and Opportunities Reform Act].  We don't know whether we're gonna get it up in the next week or not.  We don't know.  The [U.S.] Senate may come back and they may adjourn for the year.  But that--Senator Stevens [Ted Stevens], that's his baby, that's his bill.  A lot of lobbyers wanted to write the bill, but the chairman wrote the bill.  He worked very hard.  I mean, there's something in there for everybody.  I think it's--you know, you see where you got your video and you call different cable rates, cable bills, video connection.  You know, I don't know whether you had a chance to look at the telecom bill.  I don't know whether you have--even know it exists.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: But it affects your life.  It's gonna affect what you pay, how you pay, when you pay because if you look around, I mean, you only got, what, three or four big telephone companies.  You know, there used to be a time you didn't have any cable competition.  Well, we got a little cable competition now because, you know, your telephone companies can do videos and show you movies over your TVs and everything.  So you go back in '96 [1996] when we passed--when we passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and that was on the Senator Pressler [Larry Pressler] from South Dakota and Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings] and Senator McCain [John McCain] was on the committee, Senator Stevens, nobody mentioned the word Internet.  If you look in that bill and if you look in that public law, there's not one word on the Internet.  Everything was focusing on cable, telephone, video, not the Internet (laughter), nothing.  So this is where you're going back in this bill focusing more on the Internet, trying to get it right.  Because everybody wants a piece of the Internet.  Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.] wants to be able to have a package, your telephone, your Internet, you know, your TVs, right, Cox Cable [Cox Communications] like we have here, we have our Internet, our telephone service, and what else do we have?  Something that's through, your cable bill, all three in one package.  So this is where this bill--there's a difference between ten years ago and ten years today.  I mean, nobody even thought about the Internet would be this--and we drafted this piece of legislation without putting the word Internet in there, no protection, no nothing, absolute--I mean, nobody knew.  Nobody thought about it.  So now, the chairman is trying to go back and do it right, you know, which I think is going to be a good bill once they get all the kinks out of it and once they agree, it's gonna be a good bill.  It's gonna be a good bill.  But, like I said, my responsibility there now is making sure that my staff director from both sides of the aisle have what they need to work with, their staff has what they need to work with, you know, I'm gonna make this job a little bit easier for them, so--
Speaker 1: In your present position, do you have any real power or influence, and if so, what is it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: You don't.
Speaker 2: There's only one chairman of the commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] (laughter).  You know, there's only one chairman of the commerce committee, that's it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 534866
Speaker 1: You grew up in a culture, in Cashville [South Carolina], Spartanburg, South Carolina, you come to Washington [D.C.], and so you have to make a transition to a different culture, Washington, D.C. culture, the black community and so on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No doubt.
Speaker 1: --and of course to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  Would you say a little bit about the culture conflicts or changes in transitions that you had to experience and what was it like leaving Cashville at that young age of nineteen and, and coming to this Washington, D.C., culture and then to Capitol Hill?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as I said, I had always been an adventure person, always been a risk taker, so it, it was very easy for me because I've been through those things and going to Woodruff High School [Woodruff, South Carolina] and the other things in life, but coming here was--the time that I came here, you found that--and that was right after what, the civil rights, big burning stuff in '68 [1968], '69 [1969], you know, folks wasn't as friendly.  You know, down south, you know, you had a lot more friendly attitude with individuals, and, you know, getting used to dealing with the noise, the sirens, you know, all that stuff at night, it's pretty tough, you know, and then also putting bars and stuff on your windows (laughter) so, you know, lay down and go to sleep.  I mean, where I come from, your window's up, you know, your car's down.  I mean, you, you had to get adjusted to all this stuff, you know, watching over your shoulder and who you talk to and how you talk to, you know.  It was all an adjustment.  You know, but when you was on the Hill, you felt a comfort zone, you know, because around there, it was like going in Woodruff High School, it was all white, few blacks, so that I was used to.  That I could relate to.  You know, that I knew where it was coming.  But when you step out of there, it was a whole different world, and that was my world, my peoples that I had to adapt to, you know, compared to the African Americans I came up with down south, you know.  And also, wondering who to trust because everybody was trying to take something.  I mean, they--if you were from the South, a lot of folks who lived in Washington knew it.  They knew they could get you.  They could sell anything.  They know they can take you down, but they got to realize the folks from the South are very smart, too.  We was pretty good hustlers, too.  We worked hard for our money so it wasn't gonna get away from us that easily (laughter).  When you work hard for your money--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it don't go that easy.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they--I mean, a lot of folks learned, but then you start realizing that the longer you're here, you starting running into a lot of folks, where you from?  North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, you all have the same connection.  You know, you all got on that train or got on that plane or got in that car for that same reason, you know, for a better opportunity, more money, to be something more in life.  And, you know, that's pretty much where the difference was.  Discrimination?  I mean, I really didn't face discrimination 'til I got to Washington.  Down south, you knew where you stood.  This is your railroad track, this is mine.  Here, it was like so subtle how they play the game or how they did it, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Unbelievable.
Story_ID: 534867
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the other [U.S.] Senate committees in addition to the one [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] that you've been with for a long time, were there any other black individuals working on any of these committees when you first came here--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s], there was Bob Bates [Robert Bates].  I believe Bob Bates was--I believe Bob was with the foreign relations committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations].  And I think there was Bertie Bowman who still is with the foreign relations committee.  There was Ron Brown who was the staff director of the judiciary committee [U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary] 'cause Clarence Thomas didn't come until the mid-'80s [1980s], but in the '70s [1970s], it had to be Ron and Bob Bates and I think but--there was Sheila Bates [ph.], but, God, I felt like when I'm in the cafeteria eating, during that time I felt like I was the only person sitting in there, the only black person sitting in there because I can't think of nobody else that was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --working on one of the major committees except Bertie Bowman, Ron Brown, there was Bob Bates, oh boy.  Yeah, that was--that was about it.
Speaker 1: Tell me, Ron Brown was with which committee?  The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Judiciary committee.
Speaker 1: --judiciary, yeah.  When did you first meet him?  'Cause you--
Speaker 2: I met Ron, what '72 [1972], '73 [1973], walking down the hallway, just like I meet them all 'cause my job kept me in the hall, so it was establishing--
Speaker 1: You two had a very special relationship?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ron, Ron and I had a very special--I mean, you know--very few black men was working on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] at that time and Ron was just--there was just something special, just something about Ron.  I mean, he's smart, intelligent black man, you know, carried himself well, expressed himself well, conversation with senators and professional staff, and you sit back and you observe this, you know, and it's like, whoa, this man's very good at what he does.  So, I mean, we would see each other every morning, sit and have a little coffee.
Speaker 1: So he had a position comparable to yours then.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm here, Ron is here.
Speaker 1: But he still--as a staff person, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, he was a staff director.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's a major difference, major difference between staff assistant--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --staff director.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I mean, there's a lot of things in between.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You got the ear of the senator as a staff direct (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he was a role model for you in a sense?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was a wonderful role model.
Story_ID: 534868
Speaker 1: You were saying certainly that Ron Brown was a mentor and a model for you.  Would you say more about your relationship with Ron Brown?
Speaker 2: Well, during my time with Ron Brown, as I said, we'd always meet each other in the hallway, and wonderful conversation during coffee and donuts, me, Ron Brown, also Max Cleland that went on and became a senator, you know, Senator Max Cleland before he went to the [U.S.] Senate.  But it was just interesting, black man, well dressed, well groomed, well put together.  And, you know, you could see this man was going places because there was this, you know, relationship he had with Senator Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] and Senator Biden [Joe Biden] and peoples like that, how he expressed his self.  And so, you know, I sit back and I observe, you know, and when we talk, he said, "Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], no matter," Ron used to tell me, "no matter what you do, how you push that cart around the hall, how you deliver mail, you're somebody special in here.  Always keep yourself looking neat and clean, always, always keep your head up."  Ron--I mean, and always--I mean, you--when you see Ron, Ron was always in a blue suit or gray suit, nothing fancy, shirt, tie, everything, but just--and you know he said, "You'll go a long ways just being a neat person more so than just having a lot of degrees in your life.  Always have some respect for yourself."  And so that's--that was a great influence working in the city [Washington, D.C.] at that time, man.  I mean--I mean that was--I mean, you know, that was like when white peoples ask you, you know Ron Brown?  I'm like, yeah, I know Ron Brown.  I had coffee with Ron Brown, you know.  He's like, what?  Yeah, Ron Brown and I sat down and had coffee together.  That wasn't--I mean, you know, not many individuals had that opportunity to do that in an early stage of his life with Ron Brown.  I mean, even with the Clarence Thomas, even with the Senator Max Cleland, I mean, even with the Senator Fred Thompson.  All these boys came through as staffers.  We all had a relationship there before they went on to become secretaries and, you know, senators and governors, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, tell me--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --about Ron Brown becoming the secretary of commerce.  He left the government service for a while.
Speaker 2: He left the government service for a while and I believe Ron went into what, the Urban League [National Urban League], I'm not sure, but probably practiced for a long, long time.  And I believe when President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was elected president in '92 [1992], obvious Ron must've been somewhere in trade and business because he wouldn't have been selected as secretary of commerce, you know.  But I remember we prepared his statements, his biography and all that stuff and got his questions out to him that the senators wanna ask and, you know, when the boy came before the commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] to testify, sitting at that witness table, man.  You know, his white shirt on with his cuff links and stuff.  The questions they asked him about trade, stuff like that were just so smooth.  Man had it all.  He just--it just rolled off.  They were so impressed.  I mean, it's like, confirmed just like that.  And, and you can see, I mean, once he became secretary of commerce how he was traveling, how he was bringing business in from domestic as well as international together.  It was unbelievable, unbelievable.  I mean, the man was--this man was good at what he did, you know.  I mean, he would--like you say, I think he even went to--before, they went to China, Japan, all the trade talk.  Hey, man he was going places other secretary of commerce committee--commerce people hadn't been before.  But like I said, my greatest moment was to see him walk in on that day with his family, his son [Michael Brown], Alma [HistoryMaker Alma Arrington Brown] and what was his son's name?  I see his son every now and then, Brown, young kid, sitting at that witness table, and I'm standing there at the door and Ron turned to the right, "Hey man," and everybody sitting in the audience.  I mean, I guess they were saying like, what is this?  But, you know, we always had this thing when we walked, "It's okay, bro, I've arrived (laughter)."  I mean, you know, many folks didn't know that but that was his--that was his thumb mark.  I mean, you ever--I don't know whether you knew Ron that much or not, but--
Speaker 1: I knew about his years at Boston [Massachusetts] as a student--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for a--briefly.
Speaker 2: When you see Ron walking, (thumbs-up), he would do that (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about his tragic death?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: How did that--
Speaker 2: That, that, that, that hurt.
Speaker 1: How did it hit you?
Speaker 2: Oh, very hard.  Felt like I lost a brother, you know, felt like I lost a brother.
Speaker 1: The circumstances--
Speaker 2: Tight.
Speaker 1: --around that very briefly were what?  He was on a mission--
Speaker 2: He was on a mission, a trade mission.  I believe they was flying--at this moment I can't think from what country but I think it was fog or something like that that the plane went down.  You've heard rumors of all other things, but, you know, God loved Ron Brown, and whatever happened, it happened because God loved him.  And all these other rumors about this and that and this and that--you know.
Story_ID: 534869
Speaker 1: You mentioned Clarence Thomas who now sits on the [U.S.] Supreme Court.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was your first meeting with Clarence Thomas?  How did you come to know him?
Speaker 2: Oh, because Clarence was working for Senator John Danforth from Missouri at the time as a staffer, and we just got to know each other.  Once again, I'm in the hallway shaking and baking, always moving.  So, you know, and Clarence and I had a wonderful relationship because we're both from the South.  We both had sharecropper parents.  We both took different roads.  I mean, he's college, whatever, whatever, but we both ended up there working.  When I lived in Springfield [Virginia], come to find out, Clarence and, and his wife lived right across the street from me, so there was a relationship there as well, Virginia [Virginia Lamp Thomas], with his wife and son, wonderful peoples.  And, you know, it just developed.  You know, you had breakfast together, we had grits together.  Most all the ladies who worked in the cafeteria, you know, they see me and Clarence coming through first thing, y'all want your grits today?  We sit down and have some grits.  I mean, and Clarence was very smart, you know, very smart black man.  It's a wonderful relationship with Senator Danforth and from there, he was appointed to different, I think the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and there was other things he was appointed to as well.  And during that time, we stayed in contact with each other and during his confirmation hearing, I was always there for him.  We had wonderful chats.  I was one of the first persons on the first day of his hearing to walk down the hallway from Senator Danforth's office, you know, and Senator Danforth who did a book on, you know, the resurrection of Clarence Thomas ['Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas,' John Danforth], if you go to page six and seven, you'll see where he, you know, made a few quotes about me and Clarence and how I decided to get into the press room one day (laughter).  I mean, this was real funny because Senator Biden [Joe Biden] from Delaware who was the chairman of judiciary [U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary] at the time, you know, you have this protocol thing where the person have to come to your office and take pictures and, you know, do interviews and so, you know, all these cameras and everything was following Clarence and Senator Biden to his office and, you know, I'm walking behind them, you know.  But, you know, normally, nobody's allowed in the office but the reporters and the senators because there was some personal questions.  So, you know, as you look in Senator Danforth's book, Clarence's sitting in there all scared and, you know, it's the biggest moment of his life, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's sitting in there, like a little child that just left Georgia.  So, you know, all these reporters in there and the cameras, so I walk in and ain't nobody know how I got in, I just walked in and Clarence sitting over there.  All of a sudden Clarence just jumped up, "Hey, there's Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], there's Robert."  All the senators and people just start looking and like, you know.  So I said, be cool.  I just stayed in Senator Biden's office and listened to him ask all these questions and stuff.  And like I said, if you read the book by Senator John D. Danforth from Missouri, you'll find, look at page six and seven, he put all that in his books.  And he noticed it.  I mean, I didn't really know it, but he's like, Robert, everybody just kind of like--we--you know, don't pay us no mind, we're the senators.  Clarence was focusing on you.  You made him so comfortable when you walked in there.  I mean, it was a complete relaxation.  And so like I said, during his confirmation hearings, even going through the Anita Hill stuff and whatever, you know, I would always pat Clarence on the back and, you know, tell him keep your head up and, you know, I mean, this is your time.  If it's meant to be, it's going to be.  And, you know, I would always be there from my job on commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation], I'll run over to Danforth's office, you know, and I'll be trying to make sure Clarence is okay with his wife, Virginia, and, you know--yeah, he appreciated all that, so, so when he got confirmed as Supreme Court--you know, as a supreme--as a justice, you know, of course I was at the White House [Washington, D.C.].  Me, Clarence Thomas, and Senator Thurmond [Strom Thurmond] on the stage (laughter).  Can you imagine?  You know, can you imagine?  Senator Thurmond, Clarence Thomas, and Robert Foster on the stage in the Rose Garden at the White House.  So as soon as I get back to the office, "Robert, Robert, saw you on CNN."
Speaker 1: What was the occasion?
Speaker 2: His swearing in, yeah, to be sworn in.
Speaker 1: Oh, his swearing--his swearing in.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, 'cause I got invited at--yeah.  Bush, Sr. [President George Herbert Walker Bush] invited me, really nice which was--you know, hey, I was there for the man, so it was wonderful.  So, I mean, I've had the opportunity, like I said, to be at the White House several times for swearing in ceremonies, civil rights.
Story_ID: 534870
Speaker 1: What are some of the other swearing ins (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there was a voting rights act and there was the Jackie Robinson Congressional Gold Medal award and there was the [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height ceremony.  There was, you know, many Christmas invite parties, you know--you know, through the years, you know, through special friends who worked at the White House [Washington, D.C.] and things like that.  And, oh, yeah, I--White House used to be like a little second home to me in some way (laughter).  But, you know, it was--you didn't have the terrorism and all the things that we have now, I mean, during the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s], you know.  I mean, you had different things at the White House that you was able to attend.  And like I said, the Christmas decorations and things was so nice to go through.  And you could bring your family, get reservations to walk through the White House, beautiful scenery and everything, take a tour.  But now, you know, your waiting list's six months and you may not ever get in there.  So much have changed since 9/11 [September 11, 2001] security.  So much have changed.  But, I'm just glad I came through a period during the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s] where I got an opportunity to have my family come here and go through there and to see it all.  That was good.  Now, my mother [Bernice Greene Foster] and father [Rusher Foster] didn't, but all my brothers and sisters.  That made me feel so proud, you know, and to have my family gospel group to come here and sing in the [U.S.] Capitol Rotunda, the first black gospel group to sing in the Capitol Rotunda.
Speaker 1: When was this?
Speaker 2: This was in 1996 with Thurm- Senator Thurmond [Strom Thurmond] and Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings].  On (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You must have a lot of nieces and nephews, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, brothers--
Speaker 1: Were they--
Speaker 2: --sisters--
Speaker 1: Were they--
Speaker 2: --they all in this choir.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we packed the house over there.  Actually, it was in the Russell [Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.], Russell rotunda where they normally have mostly white groups come, but I went to Senator Thurmond's office manager and I went to Senator Hollings' office manager at the time, Robin [ph.].  They all wrote me a letter to the rules committee requesting, you know, my family could come and perform there.  And I got in touch with my sisters and their peoples there in Carolina, and they put their funds together and they got on this big old bus and they brought a big caravan right behind them, the whole church, unbelievable.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: So, we went to church that day.  We went to church that day.  And they sung, they--I mean, they--everybody in the [U.S.] Senate--you know, my thing was to be marketing, PR [public relations].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, obviously I had to make up my little flyers and go around to all the offices and make sure I got a good crowd there.  I don't want them coming in and the place gonna be naked (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I invited everybody, full house.  I mean, everybody wanted to see this gospel choir that [HistoryMaker] Robert Foster had invited to the Russell Senate rotunda.  And what they didn't realize, most all of them was my brothers and sisters from the church.  So that's--that was a big, big moment for me there to see them, to--and then--
Speaker 1: It's a great--
Speaker 2: --to go back and be the, the--to visit with Senator Thurmond and to visit with Senator Hollings and get their pictures taken with them, get a nice plaque, and get treated to a nice lunch in the senate buffet.  It was a wonderful experience for them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what are your--
Story_ID: 534871
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are your memories and perceptions of Senator Thurmond [Strom Thurmond]?  You were in his presence.  How--what was he like as a person?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: How do you remember him?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Apart from his politics.
Speaker 2: Apart from his pol--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As a great man, fantastic.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Working on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] with Thurmond was unbelievable.  What are you doing boy?  How you doing?  I mean (laughter) he was like--I mean, his staff, Thad [Thaddeus Strom], Duke [Duke Short], Mary [Mary Chapman Webster], all of them, oh, fantastic.  Now, you know, his voting records on issues and whatever, you know, I didn't get into that.  You know, like I said, I worked there in the [U.S.] Senate, so I kind of--I'm in the middle, so I had had this working relationship.  But, there are times if I needed something personal done for my family in Carolina, it got taken care of, just like that.  If somebody in my family passed away, trust me, Senator Thurmond would know.  It'd be in the newspaper.  He would send them a note, a letter, oh yeah.  And walk up and down the hall with him, he'd catch me by my arm, typical conversation that I had with Ron Brown, Clarence Thomas, Senator Danforth [John Danforth], Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings], same thing.
Story_ID: 534872
Speaker 1: You know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the other senators and cabinet people and staff people that you had a special relationship with?
Speaker 1: Oh, we can go back to Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], used to walk the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], smooth, black man, wonderful man.  If you go back to Michael Pertschuk after he's--
Speaker 2: Who was he?
Speaker 1: Well, he was a Federal Trade Commission chairman.  You can go back to Kennard, Bill Kennard [William E. Kennard], FCC [Federal Communications Commission] commissioner, [HistoryMaker] Michael Powell, FCC commissioner.
Speaker 2: Recently.
Speaker 1: Recently, yeah and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, Kennard was in the '80s [1980s]--well, Kennard, '90s [1990s], you know, Powell was in the ninety--yeah.  Weren't too many African Americans appointed to any of the commissions.

Speaker 1: Benjamin Hooks, yeah, Benjamin Hooks at the FCC, and Secretary William Coleman [HistoryMaker Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.], wonderful relationship with him as well.  I'm just trying to flash back now from commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]--yeah.  Because we did, like--there was nobody from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] that I can remember, nobody from NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], and looking at all the other stuff, surface transportation, like I said, we go back to--aviation, I can't remember any black American being appointed to those.  But, over the years--
Speaker 2: What was Vernon Jordan's role where you say that--
Speaker 1: Well, Vernon Jordan was a--I don't know, but he was the Urban League [National Urban League], but he lobbied the Hill, the senators, the congressman, I guess for fundings, bills, right.  The thing what what's his name does today, like Wayne Henderson.  Is it--I think it's Wayne Henderson--Earl Henderson [sic. Clarence Henderson], the big civil rights guy that comes on the Hill today.  You know, Vernon was Urban League, I guess, president back in those days.  I used to see Vernon walk up and down the hall or whatever, very smooth, very--and, you know--and you would see him some time walking with Ron [Ron Brown] or whatever, so you know what was--you know, what was going on.  But if you eliminate race of the individuals that have come through my committee that went on to become great commissioners and chairman, there's quite a few, you know, like Debbie Hersman [Deborah Hersman] and Ralph Albrecht who became one of the ma- he was a staff director, now is at one of the biggest major law firms there is in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: His name again?
Speaker 1: Ralph Albrecht, Ralph (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I was just going to ask you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --who Ralph was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Tell us a little bit more--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --about Ralph.
Speaker 1: He was the staff director under Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings].  And, as I said, he was a case worker on Senator Hollings' personal staff when he first came from South Carolina; he's from Carolina.  Then, he worked his way up to staff director and now he's at one of the biggest major law firms (laughter) in Washington.  Oh, he's a big boy, but wonderful, down to earth.  And then there's my good friend, Toni Cook Bush [Antoinette Cook Bush] who I remembered came on the committee, worked on the--on the telecom, telecommunication issues and my good friend Moses Boyd and, you know, I've had the privilege of knowing whether it's white or black, great staffers who come through the commerce committee and went on to do wonderful things such as like Lynn Sutcliffe [S. Lynn Sutcliffe], Ed Merlis [Edward Merlis], I mean, Walter McCormick, you know, Dan O'Neill, Bob Gunther, I mean, Calvin Curry [ph.], and I mean, just, you know, a list of individuals from the '70s [1970s] up until now that--that's why we call it Capitol Hill University (laughter), you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You got to keep a professor behind, though, but I call it Capitol Hill University--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because we've graduated so many great individuals from Capitol Hill that's doing wonderful things for this country and have served this country very well.  You know, even some of the, Bill, President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], had an opportunity to work with him on foreign relations committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations], played softball before he even became governor.  I mean, you know, all this stuff happened to me, you know, in the late '70s [1970s], you know.  Can you imagine walking up and down the hall with Bill, and all the sudden Bill is the governor and all of the sudden it's President Bill Clinton?  I mean, you know, you see all these things and that's why I say, you know, I love my job because it gave me an opportunity to connect with all these wonderful individuals and to establish a relationship with them as well, so it was fantastic, fantastic stuff.

Speaker 1: In this committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation], were there ever any fractures or conflicts or issues that split the committee membership and--on issues that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, probably so, but it never split the committee because, like I said, over the years I've been on the commerce, we had wonderful chairmen that could reach across and work with each other.  You may have your difference on a certain amendment, but never something that just totally split the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That blew up and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that you had to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: In the middle of.
Speaker 2: In the middle, no, no.  I mean, in our toughest legislation and whatever, longest nights, when you've had chairmen like Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Senator Ted Stevens, Senator McCain [John McCain], Senator Hollings [Ernest "Fritz" Hollings], Senator Danforth [John Danforth], Senator Bob Packwood, Senator Howard [Howard W. Cannon], these, these folks knew how to--I mean, you know, they was workers.  They worked together and they had--what was important I think more than anything else was the staffers, was having a staff that can work with each other, that's what's important.  And most of these chairmen had staff that could work with the Dems [Democrats] and the Republicans on different issues such as now, my--the ranking member, Senator Inouye [Daniel Inouye], and the chairman, Senator Stevens, you know, they're like brothers.  They will tell you they are brothers.  What you do for Senator Stevens, you do for Senator Inouye.  Our first lesson was, you know--
Speaker 1: In your present position at this very moment, what is your weekly schedule like?  What is your weekly work like, a typical week--
Speaker 2: Typical week--
Speaker 1: --when you go in?
Speaker 2: --you know, popping out of here, let's say, get up in the morning, walking two dogs and getting out of here by 7:15, you know, being on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] by 7:45, making sure that my staff director and my press peoples have their weekly newspapers and things like that before they even come into the office, open their office, flicking them lights.  You know, if there's any problem that I need to cover, make sure, you know, they need--ifs, ands, buts or whatever, making sure that's taken care of before they get there.  You know, getting back as being a director of the Public Information Office, making sure that everything is functioning there as well.  You know, making sure we're going to have coverage in that office, making sure that the witness list, press release, or whether there's a markup or whether there's a report and making sure that we have necessary all the stuff been presented to the public, making sure they aware of it, making sure we got the right information.  If you call, I wanna say, you know, hey, yeah, this hearing is on at ten a.m., it's gonna be in room SR-253, all this have to be verified through our communication director, through our staff director, so we got to be right.  We can't be wrong.  We have to be right.  When you (laughter)--that's bottom line.  So you prepare yourself for this stuff every day.  And then, you know, you may get the request from my staff director, I need you to handle this for me, make sure my office gets this, make sure this is moved in our office.  You know, because we're always moving around, switching around, telephones, desks, computers, BlackBerrys, all these things.  You know, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], I need you to take care of this, I need to get some business cards.  How do I do this, Robert?  How do I do this, Robert?  Can you do me red lines on this, Robert?  You know, can--I mean, can you make sure this office gets their Xerox paper?  Can we order this?  Can we go to--I mean, you know, it's like--so it's like constantly from doing a little bit of policy, a little bit of messenger, a little bit of running, a little bit of everything, and still having time to say, how you doing, Senator Alex [ph.]?  You know, and having my relationship, you know, with them as well, so--but I do get my coffee break and I get my lunch break.  But and then just having conversation with different peoples every day on a different subject, so it's--but the thing that I guess I got that early from working on commerce is being at work early.  My pet peeve, be on time.  If you be on time, your day will be productive.  You know, that's just me.  I--that's just me.  I could--I--you know, and I tell folks who works in my office, I don't care what you do when you get here, be on time, that's it.  Because if you're not on time, your day is completely off because everything revolves around what the chairman wants at the time.  And, you know, the issues may just--and you need that support when that happens.  You need that.  And, and, and, you know, the other thing, you wanna make sure that the office that you work in, you keep it looking professional.  That's me.  There's folks that say, "Robert, you so particular, you know, about this or about that."  You know, look, this is the office that the public have to walk in.  It represent the chairman.  It represent us, so, you know, I beat my brains out some time trying to make that happen, but you learn to just--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --give up (laughter).  But, as I said, my thing is going to work, Nancy [Nancy Carter-Foster], you know, my wife will tell you, is be on time and if you're on time, your day is productive.
Story_ID: 534874
Speaker 1: Tell me about your wife, her name, and when and how you met her, and when you were married, and what she does today.
Speaker 2: What she does today, oh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's go back to your--
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: --to your first meeting her.
Speaker 2: First meeting my wife was--
Speaker 1: Give us her name first.
Speaker 2: Oh, the wife is Nancy O'Neil Carter [Nancy Carter-Foster].  Sound kind of Irish, huh?  O'Neil (laughter).  But, met my wife in 1990, Pentagon City [Virginia], Macy's Christmas shop, one Saturday afternoon.  And I hadn't been fully dating, God, in--I'm forty-two years old at that time, so marriage was not an option (laughter), you know, because relationships you went through in the past, you know, you just got burned off and you leave them alone.  So I'm in the Christmas shop, shopping at Macy's, for who, I have no idea, just pulling around.  And this woman come walking down the hall and I stopped, looked, and she kept walking towards me, right.  So by the time she walked up close to me, I just--once again, here comes this adventurous [HistoryMaker] Robert Foster.  I walked up to this lady, which is Nancy O'Neil Carter.  I said, "You know what?"  She's like, "Excuse me?"  I said, "I'm gonna marry you some day."  She said, "What?"  I said, "I'm gonna marry you someday."  She said, "Look man, you crazy.  I don't know who you are but you better get away from me."  I said, "Look, excuse me, miss, I don't mean to put you on the spot," I said, "but the name is Robert Foster and I am going to marry you one day."  And so we got into a little conversation, you know, and kind of eased back, you know, and we got to talking about this and that and, you know, just little different stuff.  I said, "Look," I said, "I would like to invite you out to lunch or dinner some time, you know."  And she said, "Well, give me your number and maybe I'll call you."  I'm like, oh, man, maybe.  You know, here's a lady that I'm telling I'm gonna marry and she tells me maybe.  Because she said at the time, she was on her way to Hong Kong, and during that time she was at the state department [U.S. Department of State] doing--developing population.  So I'm like, well, this lady's out of your league, you know, lady getting ready to go to Hong Kong, state department, you know, way--you know, you're probably never gonna hear from her again, right.  So, you know, maybe a couple a weeks or a week--maybe a couple of weeks went by, and Nancy did call because she got sick in Hong Kong and she had to come back home early.  She's, "Well, I was just running, you know, through my notes and I found your number so I thought about giving you a call," I'm like, yeah, so, you know, like, let me invite this woman out to dinner.  Let me do it quick.  So the first night we were supposed to went to dinner, I had to cancel because I ended up working.  Oh, she was ticked.  Yeah, it's one of them ladies like, you know what?  You don't call me up at five o'clock canceling dinner.  I got a (laughter)--you know, so I'm like, okay.  How do I get this second chance, right?  So, you know, about two days later, I called her up and apologized and, you know, just a natural fellow, so we ended up going to dinner at The Ritz-Carlton [Washington, D.C.] and I said, well, the only way, Robert, you're gonna impress this lady is go to a nice restaurant, you know, so let me try to get my little dollars in line, you know, to go to The Ritz-Carlton, you know.  So we met there at Ritz-Carlton and we had a wonderful, wonderful dinner, wonderful conversation and, you know, we talked about, you know, different things in life and come to find out, she used to lobby my committee, commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation], had no idea, had never seen the lady before.  And she said, "Oh, yeah, I lobbied Steve Palmer [Steven O. Palmer] when I was with NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] doing all this stuff."  I'm like, "You've been to SR-428, you lobby my committee, and I've never seen you on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] before?"  And she started naming Marty Kress [Martin P. Kress] and Steve Palmer, these are all the guys who was my council.  These are--you know, so she goes to Marty Kress and checks me out, a little investigation time.  So Marty and I, you know, worked together for years.  Marty says, "Nancy, probably one of the nicest guys that you would ever wanna meet."  You know, I came with great credentials like, yeah, I'm in the house now, right.  So we dated for a year, year and a half, and, you know, that following year, what '92 [1992], August 15th--I should back up because I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to meet her father and we just hit it off well.  I think that's what did it.  Her and her father, boy, we just--we chatted about farming, the things I talked about coming up, whole shebang.  They liked that.  And Nancy's mother at the time was a little sick as well, and I think Nancy looked at the way I handled her mother, you know, during those times as well as respected, but that year, '92 [1992] August 15th, we got married and then (laughter), you know, hey, I mean, as I say, you know, folks said, well, you know, what about your life?  I'm like, yeah I was living back then, you know, when I got married, life began because, um-hm, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Her position today in government?
Speaker 2: Is senior advisor on AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].  She's still at the state department.  She's been there almost, what twenty-nine years, six or seven months, and I think she's about four or five months away from retirement.
Story_ID: 534875
Speaker 1: You have some organizational interests related to your work with the commerce committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation] but perhaps even beyond that.  You were telling me earlier about the--this black rep golf association and you shared--
Speaker 2: Black Republican Golf Association?
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell me about your--you're a golfer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I love the game.  You play once, you love it, you fall in love.  So, you know, what me and some other friends decided to do was put together the Black Republican Golf Association.  Don't get me wrong, we do the Democratic one too as well, so I--like I said, I'm always in the middle of the road.  I do the black Republican one in the--in the fall and I try to do the Democrat one in the spring.  And it's all about networking and it's all about getting young blacks out there on the golf course to network with different major companies and things like that, and there's another life after the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], and also to introduce you to the game of golf.  It's fun.  Because when I'm out there playing, I mean, there's very few of us out there, you know, (laughter) very few of us out--so, you know, and I was surprised that this year we got over 150--last year, I got like sixty, this year I got 150, and this has only been going on for two years.  So--and, you know, it was Democrats, white, black, and a lot of folks, "Well, do I have to be black, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], to play in the Black Rep--."  I said, "Look, do I look like I gotta be, you know, British to play in the British Open [The Open Championship] (laughter) you know?"  It's a name of an organization to bring you more into contact with the Republican Party such as the Democratic Party.  We need things on both sides of the aisle to connect.
Speaker 1: I hear you.
Speaker 2: We--you know, we need a balance here.  We need a balance.
Speaker 1: Well, I can appreciate your golf activity 'cause I play literally almost every day I can, even if it's just nine holes.
Speaker 2: See, I need to move where you are (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we even try to play through the winter.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: I was out there telling your wife, Nancy [Nancy Carter-Foster], earlier (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that two winters we couldn't play, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --I play just--if the weather permits, I play.
Speaker 2: Weather permits--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you play.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, weather permits.
Story_ID: 534876
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The U.S. Senate Softball League, another activity outside of the building.
Speaker 2: Well, that's inside the building.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's in--well, tell me about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the U.S. Senate--
Speaker 1: --the U.S. Senate--
Speaker 2: We started that, me and my friend Tim Dirks, under the--when we were with Senator Magnuson [Warren G. Magnuson], softball wasn't a very big thing, so we--yeah, we put together nine teams, all senator staff, nine teams, and it continued to grow, so we had to end up putting rules and regulations, and I became the commissioner for twenty-five years of 150 softball teams throughout the Washington [D.C.] area, and it was the U.S. Senate Softball League.  I'm the--that's why there's some--
Speaker 1: When did this start?
Speaker 2: This started in '74 [1974], '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: And it ran for twenty years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's still in existence.
Speaker 1: Oh, it is?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It's just that I was the commissioner for twenty-five years (laughter).
Speaker 1: No longer commissioner, huh?
Speaker 2: But you get a certain name--well, the game of softball changed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The game of players changed.  You know, we had rock bottom, hard core softball players back in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].  I mean, like I said with Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and, you know, McCain [John McCain], all these boys played, yeah.  I mean, this--before they were senators and presidents.  These were staffers.
Speaker 1: Where'd you play?  Where--where'd they play these games?
Speaker 2: Oh, we played at Gallaudet College [Gallaudet University, Washington, D.C.], Anacostia Park [Washington, D.C.], on the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.], I mean, American University [Washington, D.C.], Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.].  We'd book fields, Catholic University [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.].  We had like eight or nine different divisions, maybe ten or twenty teams in each division.  You play fifteen games, you book your--you know, you schedule your own games with the teams, and then we had to come with rules and regulations and, you know, all this stuff, and we come up with a big playoff format that we have like at Bolling Air Force Base [Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C.].  I mean, this was huge.  And you--sometimes you got sixty to eighty senator staff, staffers.  I mean, you know, that's the senator's team.  You know, and then you have committee teams and then you have outside teams like [U.S.] Department of Education or the Veteran Affairs [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], they wanted to get into our league.  So they, they heard that, you know, we had this wonderful softball league and everybody wanted to be a part of it, so guess who was the top of the--Commissioner Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster] (laughter).  I mean, you know, it's like getting involved with that and also getting involved with the U.S. Senate Staff Club where--which was made up of all senators' staffers where we had wonderful parties and things at the botanical garden [U.S. Botanic Garden, Washington, D.C.], receptions and things like that, you know, Thanksgiving dinners and Christmas parties, and it was members of the Senate.  There was a connection there.  So, I've been involved in quite a few things (laughter) as I've been on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], and they've all been very successful.  They've all been very successful, yeah.
Story_ID: 534877
Speaker 1: Looking at some of your photographs of your life and your experiences, you had one with Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with Muhammad Ali and how it connects with your work as--
Speaker 2: Well, it all started with Senator John McCain from Arizona and, you know, Senator McCain is a wonderful boxing fan, loved boxing.  And he was looking at--as I say how a law or a bill becomes a law, looking at where boxers did not have--formal boxers, no protection, no retirement, and how a lot of them was being cheated by promoters and things like that.  So McCain has a wonderful interest in that, and he wanted to do something about that.  He wanted to establish a boxing commission, some kind of rules and regulation, some type of retirement, pension plan for guys like Corn [Corn Griffin] and all these great boxers, Archie Moore, and all of them who died penniless and made a lot of money, and McCain was all over that issue, all over that issue.  So what he wanted to do was bring in former boxers like Floyd--not Floyd Patterson, but Sugar Ray Leonard, Hagler [Marvin Hagler], Hearns [Thomas Hearns], you know, to testify to the experience--you know, Joe Frazier.  And so, the one hearing we had, we brought in Muhammad Ali and Ken Higgins [ph.] who was the senior counselor at the time said, "Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster], we need somebody to take care of Muhammad Ali and his crew."  So I'm like, not a problem.  So I get a car, go to National Airport [Washington National Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.], pick up the champ, stepping off the plane, walking through the airport, everybody just looking.  Hey, I'm in my world now, right (laughter).  You know, and he picking at my ear.  You know, how Muhammad Ali pick at your ear and saying jokes and stuff.  And at the time, had a '92 [1992] Mazda, '92 [1992] Mazda, got him in there and brought him back to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] to Senator McCain's office and chatted with him before the hearing started.  He went in there and testified.  You know, at the time, he was slow in talking, so someone was talking with him and--concerning boxing and stuff like that.  And after that hearing, my job was to get him back to the hotel, get him lunch, but instead of doing that, I said, you know what, while I got Muhammad Ali here in the [U.S.] Senate, I might well take him the long way around through the Senate cafeteria 'cause I figured that's where everybody was eating lunch and whatever, right.  So we went that way and everybody started coming up to Muhammad Ali for autograph, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Muhammad Ali, you know, loved people.  He reminded me of me.  He sat down at the table in the cafeteria and he said, "Well, just get me a grilled cheese sandwich.  I'm just gonna sit here and sign autographs."  Look, we had lines of folks coming through the cafeteria (laughter), signing autographs.
Speaker 1: Signing napkins or whatever.
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Peoples running upstairs to get the books, to get this, the whole shebang, you know what I'm saying?  You know, I'm already--knew the following day he's gonna be there, so I'm prepared for myself, right.  So I'm like, yeah, get my glove, get my Wheaties box, get my--you know.  So we got through with that and I got him back in the car and we went down to--they was living at the Phoenix Hotel [Phoenix Park Hotel, Washington, D.C.], sat there and chatted with him, and came back through that evening to check on him, had a little dinner there, you know.  And--but the day we spent together was incredible, just to know him from another side, unbelievable, unbelievable.  And that was wonderful--you know, you talking almost fifteen hours--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of personal time with Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 1: What'd he say to you?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: What was his conversation?
Speaker 2: You know, where I'm from and all this good stuff, and I look like Joe Frazier, and all this (laughter), what was it like working on Capitol Hill?  I mean, the whole shebang.  You know, and I was telling him how much I admired him and, you know, the boxing, the skills and things like that, and it was just complimenting, basically complimenting each other.  'Cause he said, I love that neck tie you got on and boom, boom, boom, and stuff like--oh, it was like just talking, just really talking.  So, you know, I told him, I said, look, I got my Wheaties box, you know, which is there and I got my glove, he said not a problem.  I said, well, what about my GQ magazine and your fifty anniv- he said, look, just--stood there and signed everything.  I had pictures taken with him, you know, and believe it or not, every time Muhammad Ali comes to town, I get a phone call.  No matter where I am, he recognizes me, you know, even at the NABOB dinner, the National Association of Black Broadcasters dinner where they honored him, pioneer of America, you know, in boxing and stuff.  First person he hugged was me.  "Yeah, you the--you the man with that old Mazda picked me up and drove," (laughter) I mean, it was like, you know, the memory was there.  So Nancy [Nancy Carter-Foster] and I had a chance to, you know, chat with him and his wife [Yolanda Williams Ali] as well.  So, you know, it was a wonderful time that day.
Story_ID: 534878
Speaker 1: You know, like I said, that was just the first of many individuals that I had an opportunity to meet and my--you know, when you go back in the, what, '80s [1980s] with Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to come to Nelson Mandela (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, so--
Speaker 2: So let's move to him.  Tell me about your--
Speaker 1: You know?
Speaker 2: --experiences with Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  And, and that was--I believe Nelson had just been released from South African prison maybe a year before that and Senator Heflin [Howell Heflin], Hugh Heflin [sic.], Senator Heflin from the State of Alabama, what, they call him Judge Heflin, very nice senator during the time, was gonna have a reception for him welcoming him to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  If I'm not mistaking, they also had one at the White House [Washington, D.C.], but Senator Heflin wanted to have one there in the caucus room which is SR-325 [Kennedy Caucus Room] which is a very historic room, and I knew quite a few peoples on Senator Heflin's staff.  And, once again, in the right place at the right time, you guys need help, I'm adventurous, pitching right in, right?  Well, we don't know how to get ice here.  We don't know how to get the type of tablecloth.  We don't know how to get chairs here.  Can you help us?  Once again, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster] picks up the phone, "Look, we need some ice here, we need some tablecloth."  Once again, Robert knows all these folks in the right places to get things done.  Everything got taken care of.  Then, all of the sudden Heflin said, well, you had just (unclear).  All of a sudden, here come this motor--pulled up from the White House, all the security.  They send me out to greet Nelson Mandela.  He gets out of the car, "My brother," you know, I shake his hand, get him on the elevator, ride up to the third floor, go into the caucus room, you know, the music playing, whatever, sit down at the table with him and have dinner.  You know, very quiet, very personal man, lot of different speeches from different senators, Congressman John Lewis [HistoryMaker John Lewis], and all of them going on, but I'm just sitting there trying to tell myself, what do I say?  But, you know, I was just so fascinated at what this man had went through, 29, 30 years of his life in prison.  I mean, I just got--I was just in a zone of just, you know, just trying to figure it all out.  I mean, this was about justice.  You get locked up for that many years for justice?  I mean, you know, here I am where you make all these laws, you dictate all these laws and I think that's when everything started clicking with me.  That's when everything started--started seeing things a little bit different.  You been on the Hill for twenty years, but all the sudden things begin to be a little bit different, you know.  The rules of the game, you know, how the laws and the words and different public laws, everything started seeming a little bit different, you know.  And, and, and you have to--I mean, you think--this is a--this is a growth period.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is like a wakeup call.  You had your fun.  You run up and down the hall.  You deliver your mail.  You--so many things--you know, you don't--you wasn't looking at some of these things.  But all of a sudden, it's like, spent this much time in jail, was just about justice.  Then, you start reflecting back to the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] years.  It wasn't about being violent and wasn't about being a militant.  It was about justice.  Started thinking, gee, if I wanted to go to a certain university, [U.S.] Congress got to pass a law.  If I wanna live in a certain neighborhood, Congress got to pass a law.  If I wanna have certain credit, certain this, Con- I mean, why we have to have all these laws passed for us to be a part of this country?  A law to vote.  A law to walk on the same side of the street.  You know, you sitting there that night, all this stuff is beginning to hit you in the face.  You take notice of what politics is really about and you take notice about what the legislative process is all about.  And so, you know, that night, a lot about how I felt about my community, my life, my country, you know, my rights, a lot of things changed that night.  A lot of things changed that night.  And it's like, you know--I mean, I'm still there on the Hill, but I look at the bills and the laws and the public laws and I look at who's speaking and saying certain things, I look at it differently.  I may not like it, I may not agree but, you know, I respect it 'cause I'm in the middle.  I'm in the middle.  And there's--some senators do some wonderful things there, but there's some senators that do some crazy things (laughter), but you have to respect.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have to respect, you know.  They have a--you have a base to protect.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, it's like a--you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --offense, defense, yeah, you know.

Speaker 1: We're coming down to--towards the end of this HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview and I don't wanna leave it without coming back to Willie James Greene.  Is he still living?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He brought you here [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would you reflect back on him bringing you here and how you remember that trip and--because he got you here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you might not be here this moment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well.
Speaker 1: Just say a little bit more about Willie James Greene if you would?
Speaker 2: That was my--Willie James was my sister, sister's third child, Aunt Cat [ph.], was her child, Willie James.  Willie James spent a lot of time with my mother [Bernice Greene Foster], parents in Woodruff [South Carolina] until--'cause I think Willie James' mother had already moved to Washington, D.C., Aunt Cat, and Willie James and Wilbur Greene [Wilbur Greene, Jr.], one of my brothers and Willie Greene all came up with my mother's grandparents, and they pretty much all--especially Willie James, but I think he was the first one that left and went to Washington.  And we all love Willie James, family loved Willie James.  The nickname, Black Boy, I don't know how it came about (laughter).  But everybody would say, "Black Boy's coming home, Black Boy coming home," you know.  And he would always come home with these Stacy Adams shoes, chewing his spearmint gum, always neat and clean with a goatee.  And, it's a wonderful relationship.  And like I said, that September the 14th when he came by to visit my mother and that opportunity existed to get in that 1968 Skylark Buick [Buick Skylark] to come to Washington, D.C., changed my whole life.
Speaker 1: So he did experience part of your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --career?
Speaker 2: Career, yeah.
Speaker 1: He did experience part of your--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --work here.
Speaker 2: He exp- yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause he died--Willie James died about two--I think two years ago, two years ago.  And I had a big family gathering here at the house, all my brothers and sisters, his wife and kids, and he was suffering with prostate cancer at the time, many years, and we was all sitting here just chatting and talking, all of us.  You know, he was pretty hefty and it hit me.  I got up, once again, this adventurous person, I made this speech to my family and to his family about if it wasn't for this man who came home that day, all this around you, all this you see, and all the wonderful things I did, it wouldn't been possible had it not been for this man, and we both started crying.  And when I talk about it, I get a little emotional because it was a good friendship while I was here in Washington, wonderful relationship in Washington, go visit him, his Margaret [ph.], his kids, little Willie, and I'm so glad I got to give his flowers to him while he was living in front of his families.  'Cause they always looked at, you know, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert Foster] works on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], Robert in the White House [Washington, D.C.], Robert this.  I'm like, no, your father played a major role in me being where I am and doing what I'm doing because if he hadn't came along that day, I don't know, I could've stayed there and continued farming, I could've went to the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps], I don't know.  I don't know how life would've turned out.  But by him being there, getting in that car, and giving me a free ride to Washington, D.C., (laughter), I mean, you know, it was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, here you are.
Speaker 2: --that, that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, and like I said, I'm so glad that when they was all here during that reunion that, you know, I thanked him because something told me do it now 'cause I felt something 'cause I saw him losing weight.  That's what--and, you know, so I'm thinking, you got to do this, Robert.  You got to do this--his mother, his sisters, all these folks here.  Let them know how you feel about this man.  Let them know that what they see around here, you know, let them know about all this stuff, so that was a--that was Willie James, and the hardest speech I made was at his funeral, and it's hard to say--you know the song, it's so hard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to say goodbye.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was very hard to say goodbye.
Story_ID: 534880
Speaker 1: Few wrap-up questions, Bob Foster [HistoryMaker Robert Foster].  Is there anything you'd like to add to this interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: I could probably--could add a lot of, two or three hours of things to it, but I think if I add anything to this interview, I want folks to realize that no matter what small town you come from, no matter what your background may be, keep your eyes focused, enlarge your vision.  Always remember to do something greater than yourself, make a difference in life, give back to your community, and more important than anything, love your family and stay humble.  Stay humble.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, 99 percent I feel good.  I feel good that--I mean, I wouldn't--I wouldn't wanna go back and do a lot of cotton picking and stuff (laughter), but I wouldn't wanna go back and experience, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --how I've lived my life, how I've tried to live my life, I think I've done okay.  I've done okay.  I didn't get caught up in--I thank God if add something to my other family history, none of us got caught up in drugs, none of us ever went to jail, so, you know, that's a plus from coming out of ten families.  I mean, today--I mean, we--like I said, we all own our own homes, we all got our diploma, we didn't get all degrees, but each step that we've taken in our lives, we raised the bars for our kids because our kids are getting the degrees that we didn't get.  And hopefully as that step go up, their kids will get even higher degrees, so--I mean, I got to be thankful how I lived my life, that I didn't get caught up in all that stuff, so, you know.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd still like to do that you have not already done?  Any--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the one thing that bugs me a lot, I need to get my degree.
Story_ID: 534881
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns about the African American communities here in Washington, D.C., today?  I could say the country, but let me bring you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just stay in Washington?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community of Washington?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In our communities I should say.
Speaker 2: The comm- just at the, the City of Washington?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, it's to someday to get the right to vote, that's one.  You know, as, as, as Washington, D.C., the right to have full representation.  And when you get full representation, then everything else falls in place because right now, nothing can fall in place without that.  You need that.  That is--that is my one, one hope there because you got more residents living in this city than live in an hour in a couple other cities, but you don't have a congressman and you don't have a senator.  But I think if you get that, then a lot of the dreams that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] told us about in this city will come true.  I mean, you know--I mean, Washington--I've been around the world, seen a lot of things, visited a lot of cities, and Washington.  There's no place like Washington, the culture, the diversity, the museums, the things you do, the places you can go and see.  There is no place in this world like Washington, D.C., absolutely nothing.  Now, we may not have the best food.  They always say Chicago [Illinois] got the best food, but I still say South Carolina got the best food because if you've never been to Charleston [South Carolina] and had the food, you haven't eaten 'til you go to Charleston, you know.  So--but when you--when you wanna look at a city that has everything to offer every American from culture to education to history to knowledge, Washington, D.C., has it.  And like I said, my hope is that they get the full representation that they need as two senators, two congressmen, and if that happen, I believe that this city and everything else will fall in place, economics wise, racial-wise, wise, yeah, everything.  I mean, you know, because you're gonna have--you're gonna go--you're gonna be wanting to get reelected--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so you got a job to do now.  You just don't have a position anymore, you got a job.  You got to make things happen for southeast, for northeast, for the distressed area.  You got a job.  You got to make sure--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --like every other state, you got to bring the bacon home unless you don't go back (laughter).  So, you know, that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --community-wise, I hope that will happen to D.C.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  One last question.  How do you wanna be remembered?
Speaker 2: How do I wanna be remembered?  As somebody--I wanna be remembered as [HistoryMaker] Robert Foster.  I wanna be remembered as Robert Lee Foster.
