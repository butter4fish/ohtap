Story_ID: 641871
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history now.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  And then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2:  	My mother's name is Margaret Davis.  M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, Davis, D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2:  	She was born July 14th, 1935.
Speaker 1: All right and where?
Speaker 2:  	And she was born in Montgomery, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where is Montgomery--I guess--
Speaker 2:  	In relation to Charleston [West Virginia]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	It's probably northeast, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so closer to Virginia itself?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, it's close, close to Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2:  	We could probably go back three generations.  Her grandfather was named Varnard Davis [ph.].  He was originally from Ohio and had located to West Virginia and then from there he was married, his, his wife was deceased.  My mother barely remembers her grandmother, okay.  Her mother was one of eight siblings, and--
Speaker 1: This is your grandmother's mother?
Speaker 2:  	My, huh?
Speaker 1: Or your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) My mother's mother, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And her name was Thelma Davis [Thelma Davis Mosley].  She just passed away last year at the age of ninety-five.  She was born in 1917.  She was the last surviving sibling, last surviving child of Varnard Davis, and she had eight kids.  My mother has four sisters and had three brothers.  Two of her sisters are deceased, two are still living, and two of her brothers are deceased, and one is still living, okay and my mother was the oldest of the siblings.  And then my mother married Charles Essex [Charles Essex, Sr.] right out of high school [Garnet High School, Charleston, West Virginia] and--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2:  	That is my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to interrupt for a second here.  Did your mother grow up in West Virginia?
Speaker 2:  	My mother grew up in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	My mother was one of the few siblings to leave West Virginia, thank God, you know.  West Virginia is a hard place to grow up and because of the quality of life, which is largely coal mining, there is not a lot of industry there, and it's, it's, it's a hard life.  And my mother and father left right out of high school.  My father joined the [U.S.] Navy.  They moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where he was stationed.
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about him in a minute.
Speaker 2:  	Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get them together, but I just wanted, you said it's a hard life.  Are there any stories from your mother about how hard it was?
Speaker 2:  	Well yeah, the family was broken up.  My mother ended up staying with my grandfather [William Mosley], and my grandfather ran a restaurant-bar kind of situation and boarding house and she didn't go live with her mother until she was fourteen and she help raise her siblings, you know, and when she graduated from high school then, you know, she got married because that's what you were told you were supposed to do at that time in your life is you know graduate from high school, start a family, get a job, you know.  So, neither of my parents went to college.  You know they immediately went to work.  My mother was an electronic assembler.  She worked in the aerospace industry for forty years, and she retired from Hughes Aircraft [Hughes Aircraft Company] some twenty years ago.
Story_ID: 641872
Speaker 1: Well let me go to your father's side.
Speaker 2:  	Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2:  	My father's name is Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Edward, E-D-W-A-R-D, Essex, E-S-S-E-X, Sr. [Charles Essex, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2:  	His date of birth is- was May 11th, 1934.
Speaker 1: Okay he was born in the same--
Speaker 2:  	He was born in Charleston, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Charleston okay.  All right now what can you tell us about your father's side in terms of how back you can trace them and what they were doing?
Speaker 2:  	I can go back three generations on my father's side, at least as it relates to my father's mother.  My father's mother was named Ida McGee [Ida McGee Essex].  Her mother's name was Annie Mae McGee [Annie McGee].  So, I remember my great-great-grandmother.  My great-great-grandmother lived to 102.  She died when I was in college [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: So, she would have been born what in the 1880s or 1870s?
Speaker 2:  	Well, yeah she would have been born in the 1870s.  She would have been born almost in the Reconstruction era.  Her husband was named John [John McGee], and my father's grandfather was named John Essex [John Essex, Sr.].  He was a preacher, and so I remember them when I was a little boy.  My father's father was named John Essex, Jr.  He died at the age of fifty-seven.  He died in 1965.  My father passed away in 2011 at the age of seventy-seven.  That's what I remember about my father's family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember what denomination your, your grandfather I guess was?
Speaker 2:  	He was a Protestant preacher, Baptist preacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 641873
Speaker 1: So, what did you father [Charles Essex, Sr.] say about growing up, I mean what (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) My father was an only child.  Well, he was an only child for his childhood.  He didn't realize that he had a brother until after his father [John Essex, Jr.] had passed.  His brother was some twenty-five years younger than him.  He's still living in West Virginia.  His name is William Essex [ph.], I believe, and he basically remembered my father was an athlete, so he would talk about playing basketball in high school.  He came through around the same era as Hal Greer, Jerry West. My parents went to segregated schools in West Virginia.  So Garnet High School [Charleston, West Virginia] was the black high school.
Speaker 1: Okay for your father?
Speaker 2:  	For my father and my mother [Margaret Davis]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--they both went to Garnet.  When my mother went to live with her mother [Thelma Davis Mosley] she left Montgomery [West Virginia], and her mother was in Charleston [West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is Garnet?
Speaker 2:  	Garnet.  I believe it's spelled, G-A-R-N-E-T.
Speaker 1: Right.  Probably named after Henry Highland Garnet I would guess.
Speaker 2:  	Pro- probably yes.
Speaker 1: Yes and some okay.  All right so did, I know Jerry West is from West Virginia--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Earl Lloyd [HistoryMaker Earl Francis Lloyd] played at West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], the first black player in the NBA [National Basketball Association] and was Hal Greer from West Virginia?
Speaker 2:  	Hal Greer was from West Virginia too.  He played high school ball in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he play at Garnet?
Speaker 2:  	He didn't play at Garnet.  He played at another high school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so but your father was a high school basketball player?
Speaker 2:  	A high school basketball player; and then from high school he went into the [U.S.] Navy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--and he was in the Korean War.
Story_ID: 641874
Speaker 1: So they, your parents met in high school [Garnet High School, Charleston, West Virginia] then?
Speaker 2:  	In high school, that's correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there a story about how they met or how they fell in love or?
Speaker 2:  	Well it depends which one you talk to, but my mother [Margaret Davis] was a very beautiful woman, and she was a quiet woman and basically my father [Charles Essex, Sr.] was very gregarious as athletes tend to be very popular.  And so he asked her out to the high school prom and she, you know, thought that he already had a date and you know she said something to the effect of that you know one of your other dates don't want to go.  He said no I asked you first, you know, and that's how they ended up meeting and then she told him that she wanted to be married and he said he was going to the [U.S.] Navy and she said well I don't think I want to wait until you get out of the Navy to get married.  And so he married her before he went to the Navy and she became a Navy wife, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so to be sure--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, (unclear) so.  So, he goes into the Navy, and this is during the Korean War?
Speaker 2:  	Right, my parents graduated from high school in 1951 and '52 [1952] I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay so now how did they end up in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2:  	Well, my father was relocated from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to Brooklyn [New York], and we lived in Brooklyn for about six years and after he got out of the Navy--
Speaker 1: You were born there right (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	I was born in Brooklyn that's correct.  Me, my sister, Shawn [Shawn Essex Smith], and my middle brother, Charles [Charles Essex, Jr.], were born in Brooklyn.  My younger siblings were born out here.  My father was a postal worker, and he had an opportunity to transfer to California, so he came out first you know to make sure that this was the job that he wanted and then we came out in 1964 and we came out by train.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And then my mother and father stayed together for about another seven years and they divorced in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so, so you would be what about thirteen I guess or?
Speaker 2:  	When my parents divorced, or?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	I was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Fifteen okay, all right.
Story_ID: 641875
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, what they look like, what they walk like, what they talk like and their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2:  	In terms of my personality, I think I take after my father [Charles Essex, Sr.].  I have my father's height.  I have my father's looks.  I have my mother's face, my mother's eyes.  We call them Margaret Davis eyes, 'cause my children have them, my grandchildren have them.  In terms of my sensitivity and compassion, I believe I get that from my mother.  My mother has always been one to care after others, and she had a conscience.  My mother was the first to talk to me about race, me and my sister, and ironically enough it happened after the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing [in Birmingham, Alabama], September 15th, 1963, and when we came home from school my mother was crying because it hit the news on a Monday.  And she said, "I, I need to sit down and talk to you guys about the ways of the world," and she was like, "Some people may not like you because of the color of your skin, but you are just as good as anyone else and you're not better than anyone else, but no one's better than you," and that was one of the early life lessons she taught us.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now, all right so several, the events of '63 [1963] have been talk about a lot this year being, as being the fiftieth anniversary of 1963.  I know the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination was another, was a month away from the bombing of the church.  The March on Washington was a month ahead of--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --the bombing of the church.  Do you, do you remember those as, that time as a period where, where you, your consciousness was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well I believe '63 [1963] was the time that pricked my consciousness and, and the thing that I remember most about '63 [1963] outside of the assassination of the president, which I can recall you know like it happened yesterday, was probably the Birmingham [Alabama] protests and for the first time seeing children marching and having hoses and dogs turned on them.  I think that that was my first real life experience about racial Americana and the politics of race in America.  And I remember asking my mother why the firemen were shooting students with hoses, and my mother just couldn't find the words to explain that.  I think that that was the first time that the nation really got to see the voracity of the South, and I think that was the impetus for President Kennedy going on television and proposing, urging [U.S.] Congress to introduce the civil rights act and I think that that was the turning point of the movement.
Story_ID: 641876
Speaker 1: Just one more question about that, then I'll go back to the regular line--
Speaker 2:  	Okay, that's--
Speaker 1: --the regular chronology.  But in 1963, what was, what was your environment like in terms of school?  Were you going to an integrated school or all black school or?
Speaker 2:  	We were going to a public school.  It was a public school in Brooklyn [New York].  I believe it was P.S. 124 [P.S. 124, Silas B. Dutcher School, Brooklyn, New York], and we lived in the housing projects.  We lived in the Park, Park Avenue projects [Marcy Houses] in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], and it was a normal childhood.  We went outside and played every day.  We didn't have any real exposure to violence.  I'm sure that there were violence, you know, as I look back and you know moving twenty years forward from 1963 by 1983 it was probably one of the roughest sections of Brooklyn.  But, in 1963, there was, there was a degree of normality to our life.  We didn't really have any real rough stories to tell.  We had a better quality of life than our relatives in West Virginia most certainly.  And while I'm sure that we weren't quite middle class, we didn't know we were poor 'cause we ate every day, we had clothes.  You know our mother [Margaret Davis] kept us neat, kept us dressed, and it was, it was something for us to be proud of.
Speaker 1: Okay was school primarily black now?
Speaker 2:  	The school was primarily black, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I, I probably remember one or two of my students that may have been white or Puerto Rican.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 641877
Speaker 1: This is 1963, but, so, well, okay so going back to the earliest, the earliest part of your life, well do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2:  	My earliest childhood memory would probably be the birth of my sister [Shawn Essex Smith].  I remember, my sister is only sixteen months younger than me, but I do remember when my mother [Margaret Davis] brought the new baby home.  I do remember looking in the crib and you know I like to tease my sister in saying I've known her all her life, you know.  That's my earliest childhood memory is my mother bringing the new baby home.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now, so you described the neighborhood you lived in basically.  What did you like to do growing up?  What was your--?
Speaker 2:  	We basically went out and played, rode bikes, you know tricycles and you know bikes with training wheels.  You know in the summertime they would turn the fire hydrants on and basically you know the whole projects became a swimming pool as the summers got hot.  You know I remember those summers.  I remember my friends sitting on the stoops being called in at dark.  You know my mom was real strict about us being out at night you know.  So, that kind of gives me an indication that the life in the projects [Marcy Houses, Brooklyn, New York] took a turn at sundown.  You know we used to get visits from my mother's siblings who would come stay with us during the summer, so those were kind of the memories that I have.
Story_ID: 641878
Speaker 1: Any particular sights, sounds, or smells associated with growing up?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.  My mother [Margaret Davis] she loved to cook salmon croquettes and fried chicken.  Those, those are my favorite foods that my mother cooks.  Motown sounds.  I think Motown [Motown Records] was just jumping off in 1962, '63 [1963], and so certainly those are the soundtracks of my life.  My, my father [Charles Essex, Sr.] was a jazz buff, and so I remember, it seems like I've heard Miles Davis 'Kind of Blue' all my life because I believe it came out in 1959 and you know it was always being played; it was a standard.  You know my, my father and my mother they liked to socialize, so you know I would say they would have company over on Friday nights quite frequently and generally there would be a mix of music between jazz and the new emerging sound of urban America, which was Motown.  So, those were the earliest memories I have in terms of sounds and smells.
Story_ID: 641879
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2:  	Where did I start school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2:  	I believe it was P.S. 124 [P.S. 124. Silas B. Dutcher School, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay and did you like school?
Speaker 2:  	I liked school.  I liked school.  The, the earliest school that I can remember, remember is 24th Street School [24th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] when we got to California.  But, I always loved to learn.  I believe, you know, school was easy for me because I had a great memory, a great ability to recall, so I never really had to study hard until I got to college [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  You know so school was kind of a breeze for me.
Speaker 1: So, at P.S. 124 is that kindergarten?
Speaker 2:  	That was kindergarten, first grade.  I believe I came to California in second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so do you remember much about the trip, the train trip to California?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, in fact I do.  We were excited about the trip.  Again we had a racial experience coming through Texas.  It was about a two a half day trip and--
Speaker 1: Well what happened coming through Texas?  We have to hear that story.
Speaker 2:  	Oh well I'll, I'll, the story was, is you know we were, we were moving around the train.  It was me, my sister [Shawn Essex Smith], and my brother [Charles Essex, Jr.], my brother was one year old, and when we hit Texas it seemed like we were in Texas forever.  A family got on and we were sitting on one side of the train and they were sitting on the other side of the train and they had three kids and we were, you know, about the same age and one of the little boys said, "Look grandma there's some niggers."  And they looked at us and we looked at them and we looked at our mother [Margaret Davis] and I looked at my mom and said, "What's a nigger?" You know, 'cause we had never heard that word.  And so my mom said, "It's something that you are not, and you're not supposed to say."  And that was the end of it, and we ended up playing with those kids the rest of the trip to California, but they didn't have any problem.  I guess that was their point of reference for black people, and that was a new indoctrination for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So, that's what I remember about the trip.
Speaker 1: But they didn't try to move you to another car or anything like that?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	They didn't try to, to do that, but it was Amtrak [National Railroad Passenger Corporation], and it was the reality of the times.  We were, you know we didn't really go through the South, through the South.  I believe the deepest south we went outside of Texas was probably through Oklahoma, you know, and then it took a turn into Texas and through Arizona, Nevada, you know that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 641880
Speaker 1: So were you excited about go- I mean I know you were young, but were you, were you excited about Los Angeles [California]?  Did you have a sense of you know the whole Disneyland [Anaheim, California] thing and all, you know, all the aura of Hollywood?
Speaker 2:  	Well no we, we, we didn't get into the Disneyland thing probably for a couple of years because within our first year here there was the '65 [1965] riots.  We came out in August of '64 [1964], and so basically we were just glad to see our father [Charles Essex, Sr.] and you know settling in.  And once we settled in, you know, you know we really kind of liked California because New York [New York] is more vertical.  You know we came to California and we saw grass and we saw, you know, palm trees.  You know we saw beaches even though you know New York has a beach.  We didn't go to Coney Island [New York, New York] that often, and we certainly didn't see greenery.  You know New York was a concrete city, at least according to my recollection.  And so we were able to spread out in a way that we hadn't been able to do in New York, and it allowed us a new experience.  It was, it was fresher to us.  We really weren't aware of Hollywood.  We didn't really have a Hollywood co- conversation until my [maternal] grandmother [Thelma Davis Mosley] moved out here with us for a year in nineteen sixty--late 1964, early '65 [1965], and she ended up becoming a cook for Nat King Cole over in Hancock Park [Los Angeles, California] and Nat King Cole of course he was the first African American to move into Hancock Park, so we thought that was a big deal and that was our first exposure to the Hollywood scene.  I think we didn't take our first trip to Disneyland probably until maybe '67 [1967], '68 [1968], so we were out here a little while before we made the Disneyland tr- trip.
Story_ID: 641881
Speaker 1: Yeah as I was saying off camera that Pluria Marshall [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.] yesterday mentioned Nat King Cole in his family history story, too--so I don't know, it's interesting two days in a row.  So, Nat King Cole he was superstar, yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did, did you get a chance to meet him you know through your grandmother's association?
Speaker 2:  	I didn't, my mother [Margaret Davis] did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--in, in picking up my grandmother from work one day she got a chance to meet him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story about how she got that job?
Speaker 2:  	She just basically looked in the paper you know and saw a position for a cook and you know she went and interviewed and they loved her.  My, everybody who met my grandmother loved her.  You know she was the classic grandmother, you know very warm, soft spoken, don't spank that baby.  You know that kind of thing, you know, and I think at the time his children were young, you know, and he had two daughters and they took to her immediately and so they said, you're the one Thelma (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay so her name was Thelma?
Speaker 2:  	Thelma Davis [Thelma Davis Mosley].
Speaker 1: Thelma Davis okay, all right.  Okay so, so, all right so the second, the second year you're here the Watts rebellion or the so called Watts riots takes place.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: So what was it, did you have any personal recollection of those (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Oh I do because we watched National Guard roll down the streets in tanks.  You know we, we saw buildings burning, the local grocery store that we shopped at was burning and being looted.
Speaker 1: Now you lived in South Central, L.A. [Los Angeles, California], right?
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: And did you live in Watts [Los Angeles, California], you know I'm not a geo- geographer, so I'm not sure.
Speaker 2:  	No, no.  No, we lived off of Adams [Boulevard] and Western [Avenue], and Adams and Western, the corner of Adams and Western has the most probably iconic and significant building in the black community, which was the Golden State insurance building [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building, Los Angeles, California].  And so while that building didn't burn, the Don Ray Market [ph.] on the corner burned.  A couple of the liquor stores one block away burned.  The furniture store behind our house burned.  You know so we were able to see the National Guard rolling up the street, and so we were, we were some seven to ten miles away from Watts.  You know the Watts riots often, called the Watts riots because it was the flashpoint, but it was a citywide riot.  And the thing that I remember most about it was the curfews, having to be off the street by sundown and watching the news and seeing the fires and seeing the police.
Speaker 1: So did your parents basically keep you inside during the whole thing?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, basically we were, we were inside the house.  We were able to come out for a few hours in the daytime, and that's where we observed the National Guard presence.  And we were able to basically see the destruction that had occurred the night before.
Speaker 1: Yeah, six, six days.
Speaker 2:  	Yep.
Speaker 1: I have a note here that there were thirty-four deaths, $40 million in property damage.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Almost well 3,500 arrests, you know.  We know who got arrested.
Speaker 2:  	Right, it was us.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah absolutely.
Speaker 1: So this is, yeah this is really a big moment.  Did, were there, what were the physical consequences afterwards in terms of the community.  Was there a tremendous area that was burnt up or?
Speaker 2:  	Well yeah there was, there was damage.  It wasn't as bad as what we would see in '92 [1992], but certainly there were businesses that were burnt out that never returned.  In fact, you could still go into South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] today and see vacant lots of buildings that were burned down in '65 [1965] that just were never rebuilt.
Story_ID: 641882
Speaker 1: So this--what you're saying too also is that it wasn't advisable or it wasn't attractive for developers to build in those communities after the riot because they, I guess for the lack of I mean (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	Well, a lot of those buildings that never were rebuilt were by absentee landowners who basically just was leasing properties and collecting rents anyway.  I think that the development of Watts [Los Angeles, California] did occur, because after that the King Hospital [Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center; Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center, Los Angeles, California] went up, Charles Drew University [Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, California] came into Watts, and so we did see a rebuilding around the immediate area, but we did, it didn't spread, you know, as far as what was considered to be South Central [Los Angeles, California], which was anywhere we were and that could have been as far north as the Santa Monica Freeway [Interstate 10] and as far as Crenshaw [Los Angeles, California] at that time.
Speaker 1: I heard what you just said that South Central is a term that is used to describe black people.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: That's what, I mean and I come from Dayton [Ohio].  A west side man always means a black man.
Speaker 2:  	Ri- right.
Speaker 1: So, I mean is that the same?
Speaker 2:  	Well, ironically enough that became the moniker in the 1980s, 1990s.  Generally if you were from the Eastside, 'cause blacks in the mid-20th century in Los Angeles [California], blacks lived east of Main Street and then Central Boulevard was, I mean Central Avenue was the, the Crenshaw of then.  That's where all the jazz clubs were.  That's where the Dunbar Hotel was, you know and so Central Avenue was where black culture was.  Main Street was considered the divide line and then in the 1960s blacks began to move westward, but you still had what was called Eastside blacks and Westside blacks, so if you a Westside that means you lived west of Main Street.  The South Central moniker did not occur until the early '70s [1970s] okay, and it almost became a code word, almost became synonymous with the African American community as the African American community expanded you know it would be called South Central.
Story_ID: 641883
Speaker 1: All right, so you went to, you're going to school; and did you have a particular interest in school, a subject matter or, or?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I loved to write early, and history was always very interesting to me and I, I would have teachers tell me at a very early age that I was quite expressive in my writings.  And so I would say that my interest was social.  They called it social studies at the time.  I was pretty good at math too, but I, I liked social studies.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers at the (clears throat), excuse me, at the grade school level that, that resonate today you know that--?
Speaker 2:  	I had a teacher named Mr. Adams [ph.] when I was in the fourth grade.  That was the male teacher I had, and he was a disciplinarian, and I remember him quite well.  I had a teacher named Mrs. Ford [ph.].  She was also a fourth grade teacher.  You, then you had you know grades divided 4A, 4B, you know, kind of thing, and then, then I had a teacher named Ms. Cutler [ph.].  And these were the teachers that really kind of shaped my interest in school.  They were all disciplinarians, very nice.  In fact, Mrs. Ford followed me all the way through my career with NAACP [NAACP Los Angeles Branch, Los Angeles, California].  You know she used to come to my NAACP meetings.  So, she was probably the one that had the biggest impact, but Mr. Adams basically fashioned my interest in possibly becoming a teacher.  You know teaching is a second career for me, but I've always been someone who used life experience to teach others, and I think the importance of modeling, role models, are important for young black men; to see authority figures in classrooms are important.  And I think he made that impact on me.
Speaker 1: Okay now he was in 24th Street School [24th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2:  	He was at 24th Street School.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what about in, you went to middle school at--
Speaker 2:  	John Adams [John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: John Adams.  Now, so by this time you're in middle school now you're, this is what 1960--?
Speaker 2:  	I went to middle school in 1969.
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 2:  	And I was in middle school from 1969 to 1972.
Story_ID: 641884
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit to the assassinations of Malcolm X and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: And I have a note here that both of those assassinations affected you when you were young.  So, well tell us about--what did you know about Malcolm X when you were growing up?
Speaker 2:  	I had heard of Malcolm X, but I have no recollection of hearing about his assassination at the time that it happened.  I remember talking about it and hearing about it maybe a year or two later as the pro black radical movement began to take hold in Los Angeles [California] and the Panther [Black Panther Party] movement became significant in Los Angeles.  Then I would hear references to Malcolm X and they killed Malcolm that kind of thing.  However, the two most significant generational effects of my life happened November 22nd, 1963, and April 4th, 1968.  I remember both of those days like they happened yesterday.  It was like the world stopped.  I remember them letting out school.  I was still in New York [New York] when President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed.  I remember the principal coming over the loud speaker and saying, telling the teachers that school is being dismissed, that the children's parents will pick them up outside [of P.S. 124, Silas B. Dutcher School, Brooklyn, New York].  I remember going outside and seeing our parents lined up on the curb and mothers crying and that kind of thing and then the teachers whispering to one another and then the teachers started crying.  And then when I got home, that's when my mother [Margaret Davis] told me that the president had been killed.  On the day that Martin Luther King was killed, I remember a very, very loud reaction.  It was like the whole community came out on their lawns.  Everybody ran out of their house screaming, "They killed him."  At that point, we lived on Hobart [Boulevard], and it was like the neighborhood mourned together and it was something that I had never experienced, not even with the Kennedy death.  I'd been blessed in my family not to have a lot of death.  The first death that I was exposed to was the passing of my grandfather on my father's side [John Essex, Jr.], and he died around 1965, '66 [1966], and it, it was, you know, he seemed old so it seemed like just a natural course of life, but you know to see someone in the prime of their lives cut down as Kennedy and King were that brought a different social reality to me that people who do good assume some risks and those risks include death.  And this is where you begin now to have conversations with your peers.  Generally anytime death is mentioned in your family, it's usually by an older person trying to sit down and console or explain that grandma went to heaven, grandpa went to heaven, that kind of thing.  But, to be indoctrinated to political assassinations, you know, I was twelve years old, thirteen years old when King was killed.  So before you have reached pub- puberty, you have this political reality as a child that in America death can come upon you for speaking truth to power or for trying to do the right thing or just for being African American in some parts of the country was a sobering reality.  It was one that really kind of shaped my worldview.
Story_ID: 641885
Speaker 1: I, I read also that Thurgood Marshall was a tremendous influence on you growing up.  I mean can you tell us about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --connection.
Speaker 2:  	Thurgood Marshall was probably my hero growing up and largely because of some of the early papers I did in school was on the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  In fact, my doctoral dissertation was on the policy implementation challenges of Brown.  So, I've always been fascinated as to how segregation ended, and in my second book, '50 Years After Brown: The State of Black Equality in America' [Anthony Asadullah Samad] I dedicated a chapter to Charles Hamilton Houston.  Charles Hamilton Houston was basically the architect of the deconstruction of Jim Crow, and he was the one who recruited Thurgood Marshall out of dental school to become a lawyer.  And so because Thurgood Marshall was the lead attorney in the Brown decision and then he was the first African American to be appointed to the [U.S.] Supreme Court in 1967 and I believe 1967, '68 [1968] was around the first time I began to write papers, you know, as school assignments, he was someone that I, I always followed, even more than King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I didn't really get into the lessons of King and Malcolm [Malcolm X] until high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California] and college [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], but Thurgood Marshall was a real life living example of overcoming adversity by trying to do good, and trying to do right.
Story_ID: 641886
Speaker 1: Now was your father [Charles Essex, Sr.] or mother [Margaret Davis] or both members of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2:  	They both were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, my, my parents were activists and they, they weren't what I call street activists, but my mother was a church person.  You know she kept us in the church all our lives.  If, if you couldn't go to church, you couldn't go out and play.
Speaker 1: Now what church did you attend?
Speaker 2:  	Well, early on we were Baptist and then my mother converted to Jehovah Witness [Jehovah's Witnesses] and then from Jehovah Witness we became A.M.E.'s [African Methodist Episcopal] and I was, I would say I was A.M.E. longest and our church home was First A.M.E [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay known as FAME.
Speaker 2:  	FAME right and then after my A.M.E. experience I left A.M.E. and became a, a Muslim.
Speaker 1: Okay, that, that's much later after, after graduation.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah I converted at the age of twenty-eight, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and we gotta visit that at some point, but--
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: --I just wanted to make sure of that.  All right so did you have, so did you go to any youth activities at the NAACP?
Speaker 2:  	I remember going to a couple of NAACP rallies membership drives you know at our church, going to hear different people speak.  My mom always liked to go hear people speak, you know, so she would take us.
Speaker 1: So who would have been coming around to speak from the NAACP?
Speaker 2:  	I remember hearing Thurgood Marshall speak.  I remember hearing Roy Wilkins speak.  I can't say that I never ever heard King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] speak in person.  I know she went to hear King speak when he came out to Second Baptist Church [Los Angeles, California] one time, but she didn't take us for that one, 'cause King came out after the riots and was, he was kind of shouted down when he went to Watts [Los Angeles, California], him and Bayard Rustin.  But, you know I remember hearing Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] speak.  I remember hearing Elijah Muhammad speak.  I, so she would always--I remember hearing James Baldwin speak.  She would take us out to hear different people.
Story_ID: 641887
Speaker 1: Now, that sounds like a rich cultural kind of way to come up.  Did, now did you, did you frequent the bookstores?  Now that was a feature of the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  It really wasn't a big factor for other black folks in the previous generation, but thee bookstore became like a--
Speaker 2:  	Right.  The bookstores really started jumping up after '68 [1968], and in that phase of my life I was an athlete I was playing basketball, you know, four or five nights a week.  I really didn't get into collecting books until college.  I had a college professor named Dr. Anyim Palmer who was the founder of the Marcus Garvey School [Los Angeles, California] where I ended up sending my children.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his first name?
Speaker 2:  	Anyim is spelled A-N-Y-I-M Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R.
Speaker 1: So he was the found of the noted Marcus Garvey School.  This is an independent black school--
Speaker 2:  	This is an independent black school.
Speaker 1: --here in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2:  	Right, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And he was my college professor at Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And he said a person that doesn't read is not a complete person, and he encouraged us to read a book a month and I think from that point on I would at least try to read a book a month.  That's, that's how I built my library is reading literature and particularly independent literature--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--you know not just what the students assigned or the teachers assigned, but you know what the street activists and the griots were reading, you know, and I think that that helped develop my love of both reading and writing.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you, did you, did you visit the Aquarian book center [Aquarian Book Shop, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah Aquarian, I, I bought all of my early books from the Aquarian bookstore; and then from there Eso Won bookstore [Eso Won Books, Los Angeles, California], to this day I go in Eso Won once a month and buy books.
Story_ID: 641888
Speaker 1: We were talking about middle school [John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles, California].  Now, any significant teachers in middle school that--?
Speaker 2:  	The most significant teachers in middle school were my gym teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And my gym teachers, one was named Mr. Green [ph.] and the other one was named Mr. Biheller [ph.]; one was black and one was Jewish.  And they both nurtured my athletic skills, but they were the first to say that if you didn't get the grades you couldn't play.
Speaker 1: Now you were, were your grades good?
Speaker 2:  	All my grades was good.  I was an A student and in middle school.
Speaker 1: And you are tall, now my point is that, no, nobody can see it on camera 'cause--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --it's nothing to compare you with, but you are what around 6'3", 6'4"?
Speaker 2:  	No, not in, not in middle school.
Speaker 1: Not in middle school, but now how tall are you?
Speaker 2:  	Oh now I'm 6'3" and a half yeah.
Speaker 1: 6'3" okay.
Speaker 2:  	But in middle school I was about 5'7".  By the time I left middle school, I was about 6'1" and I thought I would grow and I grew another two inches and stopped (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good size--
Speaker 2:  	Right, right.
Speaker 1: --for eighth grade or ninth grade--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --6'1" is a good, you know pretty tall.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 2:  	But they were the ones that kept us out of trouble.  So, after the playgrounds closed, they were the ones that put us in the police league [Police Athletic League], basketball leagues, the division leagues, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] leagues.  So, they made sure that after we left school that we had some constructive things to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, this is what 1970?
Speaker 2:  	Now, now, now we're in 1970, '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970], '71 [1971], okay.
Speaker 2:  	Seventy [1970] and I graduated June of '72 [1972].
Story_ID: 641889
Speaker 1: This is--were you a big Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers] fan at that point?
Speaker 2:  	I was a huge Lakers fan.  Well baseball was my first love, you know.  My earliest and best memories of my father [Charles Essex, Sr.] is him taking us to baseball games.  I still to this day take my children to baseball games as a family tradition--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	--and that's what my father, my father was a hardworking man.  He was a postal worker, and then he did twenty years as a bus driver after he retired from the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  And the only thing that he could really find time to do is take us to baseball games, because they were at night and, after he got off and so you know to this day I still do that with my children.  And I was a big Dodger fan [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] until they played the Giants 'cause I was a huge Willie Mays fan because we were--the first baseball game he took me to was to see the New York Giants.  And the first person he pointed out to me was, "That's Willie Mays, that's the greatest player that ever played the game," you know, and I followed Willie Mays my whole life.  And so you know but the Dodgers were in Brooklyn [New York] and so you know when they moved to Los Angeles [California], you know, I was a Dodger fan because quite frankly they had the most African Americans on their team, you know and, you know when you see yourself in certain venues, you know, and so I would root for the Dodgers and the Dodgers won the championship in '63 [1963], you know so they were world champions when we got out here and then they lost it in '64 [1964], then they won it in '65 [1965] and '66 [sic.].  You know so I was a huge Dodger fan until they played the Giants.
Speaker 1: Okay, well you know your father had been part of the generation where the Dodgers were black America's team because of Jackie Robinson, so.
Speaker 2:  	And then you know as I grew taller and began to play basketball, then yes the Lakers were my team.  My favorite player was Elgin Baylor, you know.  I know Elgin personally to this day, and he is someone who really is not appreciated for what he did for the game.  He was really the first major draw.  He was the one who could feel stadiums that other people came to see in terms of road teams.  When you hear Bill Russell tell the story of early NBA [National Basketball Association], he was the first player that wasn't put on a team just to rebound or just to do the dirty work.  He was a marquee player before there were marquee players, and he was the first player to use his athleticism.  You know he was Jordan [Michael Jordan] before Jordan.  He was Dr. J [Julius Erving] before Dr. J, and, they just don't have enough archival film on him to really show some of the incredible things he did.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2:  	And so then when Wilt Chamberlain comes to the Lakers in that period, I think Wilt comes to the Lakers in '69 [1969] after the '69 [1969] season [sic. 1968].  So, they have Elgin, Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, you know.  It took 'em a couple of years to win, but they eventually did win and yeah, Laker fan for life now.
Story_ID: 641890
Speaker 1: So what position did you play in basketball?
Speaker 2:  	I was a forward and a center; and then when I got to college [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] I played a little guard.
Speaker 1: Okay now the dimensions are changing here now--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause you go, 'cause at that, so at one time you were, you were taller proportionately to the rest of the players and (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I was taller than everybody else in middle school [John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles, California] and probably most of high school 'cause I, I actually played forward center on my high school basketball team.  But then when I got to college, you know everybody was taller than me and I had to play guard.  I didn't play point guard I played a shooting guard.  I was a two guard, you know, I could play some small forward, but even the small forwards were, were bigger than me, you know so.
Speaker 1: Yeah the change in dimensions of basketball, so.
Speaker 2:  	Yep.
Speaker 1: At any rate, so, so did you play on the team in high school, did you?
Speaker 2:  	I did play on the team at L.A. High.
Speaker 1: All right and you were at, what high school were you at?
Speaker 2:  	Los Angeles High School [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Los Angeles High School.  Now, okay--with a name like Los Angeles High School I mean was that the first high school in Los Angeles [California] or what?
Speaker 2:  	I don't know if it was the first, but it was probably one of the more prominent.  It was close to 100 years old when I went.
Speaker 1: So, it may have been the oldest one then or one of the oldest.
Speaker 2:  	I, I think it's one of the oldest.  I don't think it's the oldest.  There's a couple that are older.  It was featured on the television show 'Room 222' coming up, so that's when you see the high school, that's, that's L.A. High.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't know that.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 641891
Speaker 1: So did you continue your, your interest in history and your writing?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I did.  In high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California] is, is--more than any period in my life high school was probably a blur to me largely because I was so entrenched in basketball that I really didn't recall much upon my academics.  I had one teacher there who was a history teacher.  Her name was Ms. Feldman [ph.], and she said you know you really should write more.  And I didn't really pay attention to that, you know, 'cause athletes they kind of halfway do their work anyway.  But my grades really never suffered, you know.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't say I was an A student in high school, but I was a B student.  And so when I would do work I guess it would be notable work enough for the teacher to comment.  But, she was probably the one who planted the seed about me being a writer.  Now I didn't write in college or probably for the first ten years of my adulthood.  I didn't really begin writing again until I was in my early thirties.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's, well back at high school when you, now were you a noted basketball player in high school?
Speaker 2:  	I would say I was noted.  I was the best on my team, and I was one of the best in the city.  Our high school team wasn't very good because we were in this southern league, and the southern league had all of the best high school players.  You know we lived on a side of town where, you know, we were probably one of the most diverse schools because Olympic Boulevard was bordering Wilshire [Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, California] and moving out into the Westside [Los Angeles, California], but we did, you know I did well in high school.  I'm, I'm proud of, even though we didn't win many games, I'm proud of my high school efforts.  It got me a scholarship to Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And you know through the help of our principal, Mr. McLaughlin [ph.] you know they took a look at me and they gave me two years and I used it to get my college degree.
Story_ID: 641892
Speaker 1: Were you, now, in high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], now after all the political events and these are like you know, these are events that go on you know in any chronology, you know some of the things that you witnessed growing up.  You know you took note of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination and riots out here [in Watts, Los Angeles, California], the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] rising, and all different things.  Did, did you consider yourself like politically, you know, attuned you know in your high school days?
Speaker 2:  	No, I wasn't very political in high school.  Between sports and girls I kind of lost that focus.  Probably the most political thing that I was aware of was the shooting out at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  I think it was 1970 or '71 [1971] whenever that happened, the conflict between US organization [The Organization Us] and the Panthers.  My uncle had come out here and joined the Panthers, and my mother [Margaret Davis] sent him back to West Virginia 'cause you know he was going to get in some trouble; and I believe that--
Story_ID: 641893
Speaker 1: This is--oh high school graduation [from Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], was, is there anything significant about high school graduation, any special honors or anything before we--
Speaker 2:  	No, I, I didn't graduate summa cum laude.  I graduated well enough to, to get a few college offers.  The one that I probably should have taken was to the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio], but it was cold weather, the proximity to West Virginia I was comfortable with that, but the cold weather and then I had an opportunity to go to UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] and I chose to stay home.  I chose to stay at Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and so the thing that I remember most about my high school graduation, one was that my father [Charles Essex, Sr.] attended it and that my Uncle Buddy, my Uncle Buddy was the patriarch of our family, okay.
Speaker 1: This is your uncle--
Speaker 2:  	This is my grandmother's brother.
Speaker 1: This is your, your--
Speaker 2:  	So, he's actually my, my great uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay on your mother's side?
Speaker 2:  	On my mother's side, right and his name was Henry Davis, but we called him Uncle Buddy.  And Uncle Buddy retired from the postal service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] at fifty-five and spent the last thirty years of his life traveling the world going to China several times, so everybody wanted to be like Uncle Buddy in our family, retire early and travel the world you know, and he died about six years ago at the age of ninety-two.  But, I think that that's what I remember most about my high school graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2:  	Excuse me (cough).
Speaker 1: --but you had the scholarship to the University of California and--
Speaker 2:  	Cal State, Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Cal State, Los Angeles.
Speaker 2:  	Cal State University at Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Right, right and so, all right so you played basketball there--
Speaker 2:  	For two years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Two years and this is where you meet Dr. Anyim--
Speaker 2:  	Anyim Palmer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) Palmer, right.
Story_ID: 641894
Speaker 1: And would you say, was it meeting him [Anyim Palmer] that kind of turned your, I mean, that that focused you more on reading and politics and that sort of thing tha- or?
Speaker 2:  	I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I think he reengaged my political consciousness.  We took him as a freshman, African American studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And from that point on I was very political.  That was probably, excuse me (clears throat), the reason I didn't play basketball my junior and senior year because I had become so politically active on campus as being part of student government, as being the president of my fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity].  The basketball coach said, "You, you need to give us some of these.  You can't play basketball and do both."  And I looked at him and said, "Well I believe there are some things that I need to do that are more important than basketball."  And I loved basketball, but I wanted to do more to help my community at that point in time, and you know I had become quite active in student government and quite active in the Sigmas and, and basically the coach made me choose and I chose my activism over basketball.
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the basketball did you, were you, did, had you projected yourself--well okay do it like this, at the time of high school graduation [from Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California] did you project, project yourself as being in the NBA [National Basketball Association] or something or?
Speaker 2:  	Ironically enough, excuse me, I had basketball dreams like every high school player does, but I think that I was a political realist in my freshmen and sophomore years.  You know I played, but I didn't play enough.  I began to understand that there were some real politics to college athletics.  For instance, excuse me (clears throat), for instance many of the black athletes when you get a scholarship that pays tuition and that pays for your books and some food during the season.  However, off season you know you have to find a job or something to eat.  Many of my white teammates you know they had very convenient jobs, you know, in the library, pushing a broom in the gym.  Most of the black athletes had to find a job off campus, catch a bus back to campus for two a day practices, and you can't hold, really hold a job with two a day practices.  And so some of those issues began to come up around the time that I was at Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  We had a coaching transition.  The coach that brought me to Cal State, L.A. was not the coach in my junior year, and I had a different connection with him.  And when I say different, I had a more racialized connection with him, whereas I didn't have that racialized connection with the coach that brought me there [Bob Miller] and, and he was a white coach, but he knew how to relate to African American players better than this coach that inherited the team.
Story_ID: 641895
Speaker 1: Can you give us a specific example of the second guy?
Speaker 2:  	Well, the coach that recruited me to Cal State, Los Angeles [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] his name was Bob Miller, and he had kind of a laid back style.  He basically recruited two of the most famous basketball players probably in L.A. basketball history in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], and that was Raymond Lewis who led the nation in scoring.  Raymond Lewis was famous for being drafted in the same year that Doug Collins was drafted, 1976.  They gave Doug Collins a million dollars, and they gave Raymond Lewis the minimum.  Raymond Lewis, you know, in the training camp ends up embarrassing Doug Collins, and they cut him from the team and he was never the same, you know he ended up dying on the streets of Los Angeles [California].  And the other guy was named Billy Mallory.  Billy Mallory was a huge player in South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  He's right now a college referee.  And so I wanted to go to the schools that they wanted to go, that they went to, and that's how Bob Miller got me over there.  You know everybody at that time wanted to go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], but UCLA had recruited five of the top freshmen in the Southland, so I knew I wasn't gonna play over there.  That was the year that David Greenwood and Roy Hamilton came out.  They went over there.  Kiki Vandeweghe went over there.  Brad Holland went over there.  So, they had a grip of freshmen, you know, that, you know you were gonna be at the back of the line to go over to UCLA, so I went to Cal State L.A., 'cause I knew I would be able to play over there and I did.  And then when Bob Miller turned the team over, I, I don't, to his assistant coach, I don't even remember his name, because I didn't play for him, he, he had a very subtle racism to him.  And some of his actions towards some players were not so subtle, and I have always operated, you know, from a social justice center.  You know I believe fair is fair, as just is just.  And I think that in the end I just didn't have a desire to play for him.  If he had not given me the choice or an ultimatum, I probably would have continued to play basketball, and I probably would have at least gotten a tryout with an NBA team [National Basketball Association].  But in this period of highly racialized movement, this is in the midst of the pro-black radical movement, everybody's 'fros was out to here, you know, and you know then you had the white man telling you to drop your consciousness or else, you know.  I think I made the right decision.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right the irony of it.
Speaker 2:  	The irony of that whole situation was the coach that ended up giving me the ultimatum only coached there a year (laughter) because a new college president came in.  His name was Dr. James Rosser [James M. Rosser], and I have a relationship with him to this day.  He, he's been the president of Cal State L.A. for thirty years.  He just retired earlier this year, and he required both the football coach and the basketball coach to fundraise and if you refused to fundraise you were out of there, and this coach I think he didn't take too kindly to an African American president giving him an ultimatum (laughter), fundraise or else you know; and so that's how that played out.
Story_ID: 641896
Speaker 1: Now did you, was your--I suppose you had an alternative way to stay in school 'cause you were on scholarship right, so?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah well, at that time you could apply for BEOG grants [Basic Educational Opportunity Grant] and they give you a grip of money.  In the '70s [1970s] is where affirmative action was launched and so the whole first affirmative action movement was essentially getting African Americans in college.  And so I was part of that first huge wave of African Americans that was the first in their families to go to college.  And I was the first in my family to graduate from college.  And so they gave huge grants, both the federal government and the state, and so thousands, even hundreds of thousands of African Americans went to college in the '70s [1970s] for nearly free because college was affordable and they were opening the doors.  And then in California the first real test to affirmative action was the Bakke case [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978], and it was a graduate school case.  It was filed in the state in '76 [1976] and tried in the cour- the federal courts, the [U.S.] Supreme Court in '78 [1978].  But outside of the Bakke case basically they were letting blacks go to college.
Story_ID: 641897
Speaker 1: Tell us about, before we get out of college [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], tell us about the Sigmas?
Speaker 2:  	Well the biggest influence of my college years was me becoming a member of a black fraternity, and it was a confliction initially because as an athlete you're already popular on campus.  You really don't need any real associations to attract to your popularity.  You're able to socialize basically based on your athletic notoriety.  One day me and my best friend, we went to college together, his name is Greg Brandon [ph.], we saw a guy sitting at a table during rush week, which is usually the second or third week of school in 1976, which was the beginning of our sophomore year, and he was in a wheelchair and he had a trophy on the table and he had the table covered in plastic and had photo books and stuff and it was raining and he was the only one, all of the other frats had went into the student union and he sat out in the rain.  And we said this guy must love his fraternity, let's go see what this is about, and it was Phi Beta Sigma.  And two weeks earlier we had went to, Greg and I had went to a Kappa rush, and they called them smokers back in the days, and these guys proceeded to tell us how great Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] was and anybody who pledged Kappa Alpha Psi was gonna have to be the best of the best and they were gonna have to take a whipping.  They were gonna be hazed in other words.  You know they were talking about how they was gonna beat our ass you know.  We was like no you're not, and we walked up out of the meeting.  Well little did we know the same thing would happen in Sigma, but at least they didn't tell us on the front end (laughter), and so we ended up pledging twelve weeks and I became a member December 12th, 1976, and I would say that being a member of the fraternity really focused me on community service.  Yeah, we did the parties and everything else, but it really added a level, a layer to my college life that I'm glad I didn't miss.  I often time say that my only regret was not attending an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities], you know.  My sister attended Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], my youngest daughter [DeShawn Samad] is currently at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], but Phi Beta Sigma added the HBCU element that made college fun for us, that I am very happy that I didn't miss.
Speaker 1: And you subsequently went on to become the historian of the Sigmas and so.
Speaker 2:  	Well, I was commissioned the write the 100 year history of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity last year.  It's the centennial history book, 2014 is our century anniversary and so being a writer and having written and published books, I wasn't given the title of hi- historian.  I was given the title of editor of the history book.  I was commissioned to write the book and ended up authoring the whole book ['March On, March on Ye Might Host: The Comprehensive History of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. (1914-2013),' Anthony Asadullah Samad].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay all right so, and that was in two, that was just this past year or when was this?
Speaker 2:  	Well the book took the better part of three years to write.  So, I was commissioned to write the book in 2010, okay.  The book was released in July of this year, July 2013.
Story_ID: 641898
Speaker 1: So what was your major, in--?
Speaker 2:  	My major at Cal State, Los Angeles [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] was television broadcasting, television and radio broadcasting, and so if I had a career ambition in college it was gonna be tied to sports in some kind of way to be a broadcaster, and that's what I went to school to day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you saw that as a natural extension of sports success become a broadcaster afterwards like a lot of (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Or a political broadcaster because at that time 'Tony Brown's Journal' began to come on television and I started watching 'Tony Brown's Journal' in college and so I knew that you could be a broadcaster outside of sports and not a lot of people were talking about being broadcasters outside of sports, but I understood that that was a reality just by watching Tony Brown on television.
Speaker 1: Now this is an era, I don't think it's been called any kind of golden age, but it probably should of blacks in broadcasting hosting their own shows.
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: We don't see that today.
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: We don't see very much of it today.
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: In those days you had 'Tony Brown's Journal,' it was called 'Black Journal.'
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: Then 'Tony Brown's Journal.'
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: You had 'Soul!' with Ellis Haizlip.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: You had local shows all over the country with (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah everybody had a local show, but Tony Brown was probably the first one to be nationally syndicated you know and then you began to see black commentators on television.  Bryant Gumbel started out as a sportscaster, but you saw him make the transition to serious news and serious investigative journalism.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that era when FCC [Federal Communications Commission] rules required stations to have public ser- service shows and a lot of shows for the black community.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: We actually had a black host of a black show--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --you know in every major city and area in the United States where there were black pe- people, 'Harambee,' 'Say Brother' in Boston [Massachusetts] and all these different shows.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: It makes--
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --it's kind of a different image of black people in charge of a show about black people.
Story_ID: 641899
Speaker 1: Right, well, it was interesting during that period because you would always see both sides of black America.  You would always see a show with a brother in a suit and tie who was basically trying to represent mainstream America and then there was always a show where you saw a brother in a dashiki trying to represent cultural Afrocentrism, Afrocentrism in a way that allowed us to see the history that wasn't being taught in the public schools and that we were just beginning to be exposed to in the colleges because the first black studies department was created at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] in 1968, [HistoryMaker] Nathan Hare, you know, so all of the, all this, this was a period in which African Americans were learning more about themselves or still trying to, to maintain a foothold in mainstream America.  So, it's interesting when you go back and look at archival footage of black America in the 1970s and you, you even see mainstream blacks with Afros, longer hair, you know.  Of course, those who were not mainstream had huge 'fros, you know.  You, you even see Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] with a 'fro (clears throat) excuse me, you see Jesse Jackson with a 'fro, but that was an interesting time you know.  I would, I would call it black people's lost period because we were looking to find ourselves after the assassination of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and we had kind of been put in a mindset of well who's the next black leader.  And you saw people trying to (unclear) and maneuver to be the next king when it took us probably a decade to find out that there was only one King and that there would be no next King and that we would have to find a way to develop leadership in our community in a way that wasn't monolithic.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so you majored in television and communications and you, you, you graduate from high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California] in '75 [1975] is that it?
Speaker 1:  	Graduated in 1975 that is correct.
Speaker 2: Yeah and, and you graduated from college in 1980, is that it?  Eighty [1980] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) That is correct, March of 1980.
Story_ID: 641900
Speaker 1: Now before we leave school was there any other mentors other than Dr. Palmer [Anyim Palmer]?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah I've had several mentors early on in my early years.  My fraternity mentor was a gentleman by the name of Oscar Morgan who basically saw in me a leadership potential, and he mentored me.  I became national second vice president of the fraternity [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] while I was still at Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and it was largely because he and a gentleman by the name of Charles Wright who was out of Baltimore [Maryland], who's deceased now, saw me and said you need to be a youth leader in our fraternity and you know be an example for the undergraduates, and I was and I ended up becoming the youngest regional director in the history of the fraternity as a result of the membership, the mentorship of Oscar Morgan, okay.  So, I would say that he was my primary mentor in terms of the fraternity.  Dr. Palmer was my primary mentor as a scholar.  In terms of a businessman, my primary mentor was a gentleman by the name of Fred Calloway, and Fred Calloway is still living.  And he is the person who mentored me in my, my twenties and thirties.  He's still mentoring me today.
Story_ID: 641901
Speaker 1: Now when you graduated [from California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in 1980 were there, did you have some prospects in the media in terms of jobs?
Speaker 2:  	No, I was actually working at Beneficial finance [Beneficial Corporation] at the time and I had a girlfriend and so we were talking about getting married and I wanted to go to graduate school, so I immediately enrolled in USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  Well, I missed the fall admittance deadline, so I ended up enrolling in SC in February of 2001 [sic.].  I caught the, I was a spring admission.  And being a spring admission, you know--
Speaker 1: Now this is 1980, '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2:  	Eighty-one [1981], right.
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 2:  	So, I worked for most of the remaining of 1980 and immediately went back to school.  And then--
Speaker 1: So, so you were going to USC for a master's [degree] in?
Speaker 2:  	Public finance.  I actually enrolled in dual degree.  It was a master's in public administration, but it had a dual degree program.  I could have gotten an M.P.A. and a D.P.A., a doctorate in public administration, had I been able to push all the way through it.  But during that period I had more things happen to me, you know.  Later that year my girlfriend got pregnant, we made a decision to get married.  So, I got married in December of 1981.  My first daughter [Kellie Essex] was born in May of 1982.  So, here I was working full time, recently married with a new baby.  So, I really never had an opportunity in my early years to even give my broadcasting aspirations a chance.  And then my second daughter [Gabrielle Essex Fulse] was born in July of 1983, and so I finished USC in, in 1983, around June of 1983 I believe, and at that point I had to keep working and so that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Was it, well there's a switch here it seems to be between you know communications and finance and so what, what caused you to seek a master's degree in finance and public administration?
Speaker 2:  	Well, two reasons.  One, the job that I had was in finance, okay, and they had a management program that allowed, they paid for school if you were majoring in finance.  So, they would pay for a M.B.A. or M.P.A., meaning and Beneficial was beginning to do more commercial stuff that was joint venturing with governments and those types of things.  The second reason that the focus in finance came about is because I began to develop an interest in ultimately starting my own business, and I had always said that I would start my own business by the age of thirty and I did.
Story_ID: 641902
Speaker 1: What was the name of your business?
Speaker 2:  	My business was Liberty Finance Company [ph.], and it was a mortgage company and then eventually it evolved to Liberty Finance Management Group [Los Angeles, California] because in order to help get people loans you had to help them develop business plans and strategic plans and it was actually more people needed business plans than need loans.  And that's where really I got back into writing again is because I became a technical writer, you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) actually give them a manual for how to do--
Speaker 2:  	A manual on how to?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd create like manuals, is that what you're saying? A (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) (Shakes head) I would create business plans in order for people to get business loans or to get commercial loans for commercial buildings to run their businesses out of.  Generally, banks and finance companies wanted to see strategic plans.  They wanted to see how you were gonna launch your business, what was your staffing plan, what was your inventory plan, how you were going to repay the debt, how you were gonna grow your business, what is your marketing plan.  What is your, you know your contingency plans and so you just kind of had to--I, I put that master's degree to work immediately because all of that I had learned in, in graduate school [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay so you found, before you found Liberty you were like the vice president of Founders Savings [Founders Federal Savings and Loan Association] for one year, right, is that correct?
Speaker 2:  	For about a year and a half. That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, for about a year.  And then you felt like you should go and found your own business?
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so were there any co-founders or were you the sole?
Speaker 2:  	Of Liberty Finance Company?  Yeah, my partner's name was Richard Fareed [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 641903
Speaker 1: Now I notice his last name was Fareed [Richard Fareed (ph.)].  Had you started investigating Islam at this point?
Speaker 2:  	Not at that point.  My first exposure, my first exposure to Islam was when my sister [Shawn Essex Smith] joined the Nation of Islam at seventeen years old, and then she married.  So, when she was seventeen, I was eighteen, so that was in 1975 and that was also around the time the, the last year that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was living.  I believe the Honorable Elijah Muhammad died in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was '74 [1974], but that---
Speaker 2:  	Seventy-four [1974], yeah arou- around that time and so then you know I used to go to the mosque with her and you know just try, of course she was gonna try to recruit me and it didn't work at that time because I was really kind of very centered in my spirituality in A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal]. There's a whole African American history around the founding of the A.M.E. church, you know.  So, I was fine where I was, but I got great exposure to Islam and, and Islam was a religion that I, I felt that I could at some point in time embrace.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was checking 'cause it's not until I guess around 1990 that you really, you know, make a commitment.
Speaker 2:  	Right, I think when we get into that period I think my frustrations with Christianity and some of the politics of the church, and, and I discuss that in my first book.  I discussed my religious conversion in 'Souls for Sale' ['Souls for Sale: The Diary of an Ex-Colored Man,' Anthony Asadullah Samad].
Story_ID: 641904
Speaker 1: How were the first few years of Liberty Finance Management [Liberty Finance Management Group, Los Angeles, California]?  How--?
Speaker 2:  	It was, it was actually good.  It allowed me to sustain myself.  I will say that I probably never really gave it my full attention because it was at that time I also took a position, an officer's position, in the Los Angeles NAACP [NAACP Los Angeles Branch, Los Angeles, California] in 1986.  So, it allowed me to take care of my family and while I pursued my community activism.  That was the beginning of my real community activism.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was the Los Angeles NAACP like when you joined?  Who was in it and what were the issues?
Speaker 2:  	I became a part of a new wave of leaders.  The branch had pretty much died.  I mean they had very, very few members, and there was a gentleman by the name of John McDonald who was responsible for revitalizing the NAACP.  And the revitalization of the NAACP was phenomenal 'cause he brought a lot of young people including myself to the branch, and he grew the branch from nearly eight hundred members to almost fifteen thousand members.  John McDonald passed away in December of 1986 [sic. 1985] at the age of thirty-five.  He died of a heart attack at Christmastime.
Speaker 1: This is in 19--?
Speaker 2:  	Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], okay so this is shortly after he brought you in.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, after he pulled me in.  So, all of us basically took an oath to stay engaged and try to, you know, keep John's dream alive.  And this was also the period of time in which you began to see a significant shift in Los Angeles [California] in terms of the way police were treating people.  Police abuse and misconduct was on the rise.  We had a police chief by the name of Daryl Gates who essentially took a paramilitary stand against the black community.  You know he created this thing called the battering ram.  You began to see the vestiges of the cocaine and the crack movement began to come into the African American community and so, and then you began to see the rise of the black gang movement in the black community.
Speaker 1: Now this is, this is an era when out on the East Coast crack cocaine was coming into Washington, D.C., you know some of the East Coast cities.  It hadn't reached Chicago [Illinois] yet, but was it doing the same thing on the West Coast?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, it was just beginning to creep in.  It, it probably took five years to take hold, so by the early '90s [1990s] it was here, but you, you could see the vestiges of it in '86 [1986], '87 [1987], '88 [1988] and so you began to see LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] take a more aggressive position.  So, as vice president of the NAACP, I took on major issues with respect to economic discrimination and police abuse.
Speaker 1: Okay, LAPD has a long history of antagonism--
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --with people of color in Los Angeles.
Speaker 2:  	Oh going back to the 1920s you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	In almost every riot whether it was the black community or Latino community, because remember the zoot suit riots occurred in the 1930s [sic. 1943], and I think that you know even though the Watts riots of '65 [1965] were oftentimes seen as the flashpoint of police misconduct, there had been many, many riots in Los Angeles and when I say many riots you know small conflicts with the police that didn't blow up into full scale riots.
Speaker 1: Yeah, not the, you know--
Speaker 2:  	Earlier than 1965, way earlier.
Speaker 1: There's the photo of Malcolm X with a picture of a brother that was shot.
Speaker 2:  	Well when the, the, when the police attacked the mosque [Mosque No. 27; Temple No. 27, Los Angeles, California] in 1962 and then of course they attacked the Panthers [Black Panther Party] in 1970 on, on 41st [Street] and Central [Avenue].  They shot out the, the Panther office, you know so, you know they, they have been very aggressive.  In the 1980s, they, they had become paramilitary, you know, because Daryl Gates is the police chief responsible for creating SWAT [Special Weapons and Tactics], you know which is, you know the marksmen teams that you know take out snipers and those kinds of things, but that whole set up was perfected on the black community; you know it was perfected on the black community.
Story_ID: 641905
Speaker 1: I don't think I can think of another parallel of a police department actually attacking the headquarters of an organization that hasn't committed a crime, you know.  That's not, they hadn't just robbed a bank or anything, or--
Speaker 2:  	Well, ironically enough the focus of the police department weren't on bank robberies.  You know Los Angeles [California] probably for two decades led the nation in bank robberies.  You know they made their emphasis, the protection of the community in the areas of drugs and gangs.  But, this was the era of Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], so this is where the mandatory sentencing came in.  This is where the federal sentencing guidelines kicked in.  So, you see that they were putting the mechanisms for the prison industrial complex in place.  You know in the mid-1980s you know we had less than seven hundred thousand prisoners in the United States you know.  By the turn of the century, less than fifteen years we had 2 million people in prison and largely because of the tougher stance that the federal government and the states were taking on criminalizing things like marijuana and other nonviolent offenses.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so now what were the--okay so police misconduct was that in the sights of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here?  They were investigating.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, we were very aggressive.  We probably got, between the time that I was vice president and president, we probably got five hundred complaints a year about LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], and LAPD didn't have a mechanism to take complaints.  You go down there and complain to the office, and they would, or to the precinct, and they would throw your complaint in the trash, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now these are, yeah--okay so there's a long, there's a mountain ahead of you in terms of that struggle (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah it is (laughter).
Speaker 1: --stage which is gonna reveal itself--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --as we move through this.  But, okay so in--you become the president, the branch president of the Los Angeles NAACP [NAACP Los Angeles Branch, Los Angeles, California] in 1988.  Now this seems to be, you seem to be very young to be (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	I was, I was the youngest branch president, you know.  I was thirty-one, and when I had become vice president I was, you know, twenty-seven, so I was in the midst of everything.  And there was a generational divide in the branch.  There were a lot of the older members that really had a problem with having a young president.  [HistoryMaker] Willis Edwards and I we had a conversation about Willis Edwards.  We were presidents together.  He was president of Hollywood, Beverly Hills [Beverly Hills Hollywood NAACP Branch, Los Angeles, California] at the same time I was president of L.A., and he guided me through a lot of the internal politics. However, the national office was glad to see the revitalization.  The president that su- succeeded John McDonald was a gentleman by the name of Ray Johnson [Raymond L. Johnson, Jr.], and he had basically taken a subtler approach to much of the advocacy that had been started by John, and as a result a lot of the people had went away and the branch had whittled down to fifteen hundred.  When I became president, within my year I got the membership back up to eight thousand, so we were able to be able to successfully make that happen.
Story_ID: 641906
Speaker 1: Now how did you pitch the NAACP [NAACP Los Angeles Branch, Los Angeles, California] to young people?
Speaker 2:  	Well--
Speaker 1: 'Cause they did have a reputation of being a Negro organization.  That's what we called them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, essentially that was true and for the first time I had Pan-Africanists.  I had radicals.  I had you know folk who were gang members and reformed gang members.  You know I basically said, who do we have out here that is going to help us call out many of the injustices that were taking place, because it wasn't just about drugs and gangs.  Los Angeles [California] also had extremely high unemployment in the '80s [1980s].  Remember under Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] unemployment doubled.  So, Los Angeles probably had a 13, 14 percent unemployment rate and black unemployment in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s was probably close to 25 percent.  And so I said, who are we gonna have out here that is going to call out the injustices of economic discrimination as well as police abuse.  I said we need to take the vehicles that have been left to us, and we don't have to reinvent the wheel we could use the NAACP for a modern day civil rights fight.  And a lot of people said yeah you're right, and we began to have new generations come, okay.  The churches were still by and large the major recruiting vehicles for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  The two largest black members that I had were Second Baptist Church [Los Angeles, California] and First A.M.E. [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California].  Those two churches alone represented almost two thousand members okay, and then you had other churches (unclear) and Methodist and other, Trinity Baptist [Trinity Baptist Church, Los Angeles, California] that had you know probably two or three hundred members of their congregation.  So, you had still a real base of senior members that would say were over sixty, okay, and these folk, and I love them death to this day, those that are still living, they kind of would talk about the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] like it was yesterday almost the way we do now.  We still talk about the 1960s like it was yesterday, and it was a half a century ago.  Well, at that time you know they were talking about the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] and it was twenty-five years earlier, you know, and they were talking about marching and stuff like that and we were talking about economic boycotts.  In fact, one of the threats--you know Ben Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] was a big supporter of mine until I started talking about boycotting the Southland Corporation, and the Southland Corporation was the owner of 7-Eleven [7-Eleven, Inc.].  Southland Corporation was one of the biggest funders of the NAACP, and so the NAACP was not gonna let us boycott 7-Eleven, even though 7-Eleven was discriminating against African American franchisee owners.  I call them Slurpee slaves in, in my book, 'Souls for Sale' ['Souls for Sale: The Diary of an Ex-Colored Man,' Anthony Asadullah Samad] okay, I mean 'cause you really had to work the store 24/7, 365 days a year.  You couldn't even close it on Christmas, and Southland Corporation would take 52 percent of your gross revenues, the franchisee would take 48 percent, and then you would have to pay all of the bills out of your 48 percent.  So, they just, just take half of your money off the top and you pay the bills out of your portion, and it was an unjust system.
Story_ID: 641907
Speaker 1: So even an entrepreneur wa- you know in that system was not making out very well.
Speaker 2:  	That's right unless you just made a grip of money and you, you know and then they would put the black franchisees--you could make a lot of money in a 7-Eleven depending on where you were, 'cause remember they were the original convenience store and the whole purpose of a convenience store was that you didn't have to go to a full service market.  Well, they would put the black franchisees across the street from a grocery store.  Well, if, if you gonna go, you might as well go to the grocery store, you know.  It was a real political piece.  So, they thought we were just trying to be rebellious.  You know this was in the midst of the NAACP's Fair Share movement.  In fact in addition to [HistoryMaker] Willis Edwards my mentor in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was a gentleman by the name of Fred Rasheed who was the creator of the NAACP Fair Share movement you know and he came out and negotiated a fair share agreement with Southland Corporation [7-Eleven, Inc.] where we didn't have to boycott them, but it was touch and go there for a second, you know and--
Speaker 1: Now that's the same Fred Rasheed you mentioned early I guess in relationship to--
Speaker 2:  	Huh?
Speaker 1: You mentioned him earlier too I believe right, Fred Rasheed.
Speaker 2:  	I don't believe I mentioned Fred Rasheed.  I believe Anyim Palmer is who I mentioned.
Speaker 1: No, it was, 'cause I asked you about Islam.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, well.
Speaker 1: No, it was Richard Fareed [ph.] I'm sorry.
Speaker 2:  	Richard Fareed, right.
Speaker 1: That's different yeah, yeah, from Fred Rasheed okay.
Story_ID: 641908
Speaker 1: As we get towards 1990 now, now you get in trouble and, and--
Speaker 2:  	Well, I wouldn't say I get in trouble I would say trouble finds me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--and you know there's a story behind it that certainly has been written about and well documented.  So you want me to, you, you want me to just respond or are you gonna ask me the question?
Speaker 1: Well, I wanna get your version of what, what will happen, you know.
Speaker 2:  	Well, what happens is this we have a, a divide in the branch.  I used to stay at the NAACP offices [NAACP Los Angeles Branch, Los Angeles, California] late.  Huge files, so I buy a briefcase in the NAACP.  The guy who wanted the pres- to be president and in fact succeeded me makes a big deal about me using my administrative expense to buy a briefcase.  It somehow ends up in the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], so you know NAACP president mis-expends, you know.  Briefcase was about two hundred dollars you know.  So, anyway it becomes a campaign issue, but it really was an issue to keep me from being reelected.  Then he introduces that I had had a civil suit with Founder Savings over my home loan, okay.  Now the civil suit in Founder Savings [Founders Federal Savings and Loan Association] was not over my home loan, the civil suit at Founder Savings was that the president of the bank was trying to essentially do things that I wouldn't agree to do.  And then so I go out on a stress leave, he can't fire me, so they say well okay you know he didn't tell the bank president that he had gotten a home loan.  Well I did, it went before the committee and all of that.  So, at the same time that we were in the midst of this election we were trying to bring about a federal investigation of the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department].  The LAPD was violating people's civil rights.  I was getting calls at night.  They were making people lay face down, prone down in the streets, you know, and they were searching women, which now is against the law, but then wasn't against the law and they were using the justification that, well you know we didn't know if you were a gang member and a lot of the gang members used to let the women hold the guns.  But, if you were coming home from a dinner in a tuxedo and an evening dress what would be the reason for you to have a woman searched.  And a lot of this came out in the movie, 'Crash' that was done that won the Academy Awards [Oscars].  The period that they document was the period in which I was NAACP president and that LAPD was abusive and violating people's rights and violating people's dignity.  So, we had begun the process of getting the federal government to step in.  The next thing I know I'm being indicted for submitting a false tax return on my home loan.  I had been away from the bank for five years.  I was in the process of separating in my first marriage, so I left that home to my first wife and my children.  My first wife defaulted on the home.  The moment she defaulted they came in and said you know that the bank had been defrauded.  The bank didn't lose a cent on the house, you know.  She ended up giving the house back, and they sold the house for profit.  The tax return that was submitted was a prior year's tax return because I couldn't find my 1983 tax return, so I had someone just, I estimated my income and so it turns out that they had put in the tax return that I had made a couple of thousand dollars more than I actually made.  Anyway, they asked me was I aware of it, I said I'm aware of it, you know, and I acknowledged it and I accepted responsibility.  It was basically seen as an attempt on the part of Daryl Gates to make sure that I didn't become president so I couldn't continue to press the federal investigation.  The feds did end up coming in three years later when the riots broke, and we had been saying as early as 1988 that the streets were hot and that the police were gonna cause a riot and Tom Bradley didn't believe us until it happened in eighty of--'92 [1992]--April of '92 [1992] and, and we document all of that conversation in my first book ['Souls for Sale: The Diary of an Ex-Colored Man,' Anthony Asadullah Samad].
Story_ID: 641909
Speaker 1: So anyway, people understood that this was a political prosecution.  They said, "Okay Samad [HistoryMaker Anthony Samad] the best thing to do is to--," my name was Anthony Essex at the time, they said, "the best to do is just go in and acknowledge, they'll probably give you probation and community service."  Now I was told this by all my lawyer friends.  I was told this by three judges.  They said, "Look man this can go away, you have a young family."  I ended up getting one of the most conservative judges in the 9th District [District 9], a Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] appointee.  His name was Robert Keller [sic. William D. Keller].  He was bent on demonstrating, you know at that time the S and L scandal [savings and loan] had broke, Bush's son had gotten caught up in it, and I ended up going before this judge and he ends up sentencing me to five years in prison.  He suspended four and a half years and said you have to serve six months.  I ended up serving, actually serving three and a half months, but even the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] had to acknowledge that this was the biggest miscarriage of justice that they had ever seen.  I had never been involved in any criminal activity in my life, hadn't been involved in any criminal activity since that time.  My four children none of them have ever been to jail.  I'm a law abiding citizen.  People ask why did I do it, because that was what was done in the 1980s to buy homes.  In the early '80s [1980s], there was significant redlining in Los Angeles [California].  The banks were discriminating against home buyers, black home buyers, so you had to show that you made a certain amount of money.  I was a vice president of the bank.  They knew how much money I made, so I didn't have to show any money.  But, what they did they packaged and sold loans, so you had to have certain level of documentation on the loan, so you had to have two years tax returns.  You know I couldn't send it to loan committee with one year's tax return, so I couldn't find the other year so I had to have it made up, and that's essentially what happened.  It wasn't any intent to defraud.  There wasn't any intent to misguide anybody.  I made over two thousand loans while I was vice president at Founders [Founders Federal Savings and Loan Association].  They investigated every one.  The only one that they could tie me to was my home and a loan that had made, been made to a business partner that was in good standing at the time that they called it out and so I had to acknowledge that my high visibility was one of the reasons that, because nobody else in the bank was prosecuted.  The president of the bank was implicated in a restaurant deal and several other deals.  He was never prosecuted.  They filed a civil suit against him, ended up with a couple of million dollar judgment against him.  He dies and leaves $25 million to the University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California], the Peter Dauterive center [Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall].
Story_ID: 641910
Speaker 1: Go ahead you were, you were--
Speaker 2:  	I was just--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --getting ready to say that I believe 'Souls for Sale' ['Souls for Sale: The Diary of an Ex-Colored Man,' Anthony Asadullah Samad] in my experience will, will be made a movie one day, 'cause we've seen a lot of leaders in Los Angeles [California] be undermined that way, run out of office, run out of pastorships, you know that's politics and so that was a rough lesson for me to learn, but it didn't stop me from being an activist and it didn't stop me from trying to help my community.  You know I went in and did my three and a half months, and I promised that after I left Boron [Boron Federal Prison Camp, Boron, California] I would never go back and that I would be a truth teller the rest of my life and I, I came out and within the first year I began writing a national column.  It started out as a local column with the Herald Dispatch, which was the paper that Malcolm [Malcom X] used to write for.  The publisher was a gentleman by the name of John Holoman [John Henry Holoman], and you know he told me, he said man if I had gone through what you've gone through I would certainly have something to talk about.  He said I want you to remember that I have a newspaper.  And so about seven months later I said do you still want me to write that column.  And so I started writing the column.  It caught on like wildfire amongst the NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association] papers.  Then the L.A. Watts Times picked it up here.  Then the Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel] picked it up and then I was in the Sentinel for fifteen years.  And then for two years I was with our Our Weekly and for the last two years I've been with, with the L.A. Wave, Los Angeles Wave, Pluria--
Speaker 1: That's Pluria Marshall [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.]?
Speaker 2:  	Pluria Marshall.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And you know I never imagined that as many people would read the column as read it.  It became quite popular, the height of its readership.  It was 2 million readers in over seventy-five papers okay, and it is now on several major cyber sites, you know.  But, it became a way for me to continue my advocacy while I consen- continued to pursue my other passions.  You know I came out, I started Samad and Associates [Los Angeles, California], which was a continuation of my strategic planning experience.
Story_ID: 641911
Speaker 1: One thing that happened I guess is a conversion to Islam during this period of time as well right?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I actually began to convert to Islam before I went to prison [Boron Federal Prison Camp, Boron, California].  I think that that was another factor in them, me, not wanting me to become NAACP president [of the NAACP Los Angeles Branch, Los Angeles, California].  They had begun to hear that I had began to visit the mosque.  Muslims began to join NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], if you could believe that, you know because Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] had begun to resurrect the Nation, and he said the Nation--Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] ran for president in '84 [1984] and then in '88 [1988] and he said that members of the Nation should begin to get involved in all of our organizations that you know are trying to do something for our community.  And so as they began to see Muslims attend the meetings, the membership meetings, they began to get nervous.  They were like, "Oh Samad [HistoryMaker Anthony Samad] is beginning, you know, to become a Muslim and we can't have no Muslim president of the NAACP."  So, I believe that was a factor too.  My actual conversion came about in 1989.  I began to, to see some things in First A.M.E. [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California] that I didn't agree with.  Chip Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray], the pastor there, had almost been like a father to me and I brought those things to him and really didn't get satisfaction in his responses.  And I just didn't think that that was a spiritual fit for me anymore. And so I just began to look other places.  And I began to really listen to what was going on in the Nation of Islam, you know, and so I joined the Nation, Nation of Islam in 1990, but my conversion to Islam began as early as, as '88 [1988].  I was actually a Muslim before I went to prison, which was just a prison camp.  It was, you know they used to call it Club Fed.  It was a closed down [U.S.] Army base, you know bunkers, no fences.  If you walk away you know when they catch you, you just have an additional five years onto your sentence kind of thing, you know, but it really, it just wasn't--
Speaker 1: (Unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2:  	--a prison.  And so the conversion to Islam, to me, put me in a comfort space to be able to deal with the level of scrutiny.  I will say that my community always embraced me.  I mean they welcomed me back.  Everybody knew it was a political prosecution.  They knew it was okay.  I mean within three years of me coming back, the Masons, you know, they give me the 33rd degree.  You know people ask me to run their organizations during the riots.  In '92 [1992] then State Senator Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson] asked me to head the emergency relief fund, the South L.A. Emergency Relief Fund, to provide relief to over thirty-five thousand people who was displaced during the riots.  You know so the confidence that the community had on me never waned.  They said look you know it's unfortunate you took that hit, you know, come out and do you, and that's essentially what I did.
Speaker 1: So, the community basically wrapped its arms around you and redeemed you.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah they knew what was happening, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	You know you have one or two detractors that want to wave that as a flag, but the folk who were on the ground, the activists, the city leadership, the political leaders, and the folk in the community who were customers of Founders Savings [Founders Federal Savings and Loan Association] who knew they never would have gotten their home loans through Bank of America [Bank of America Corporation] and then Security Pacific [Security Pacific National Bank].  You know they knew that I gave them a chance at home ownership that no other bank would give them, and you know those are the people who to this day continue to support me with the Urban Issues Forum [Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles], and other community ventures that I'm involved in.
Story_ID: 641912
Speaker 1: Now well tell us what Samad and Associates [Los Angeles, California] is?
Speaker 2:  	Well, it started out as a public affairs firm where basically politicians would call me in and ask me for advice and how to implement community programs and then it allowed me to continue my technical writing, because for a lot of nonprofits in order to qualify for grants they would need technical writers, so I would write grants.  I would write sustainability grants for nonprofits that would receive federal funds.  They would have to talk about how they would sustain outside of the, the federal grant once the federal grant went away, okay.  And so that's how I made a living basically consulting to politicians and consulting to nonprofits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Then eventually corporations they needed community liaisons, so they would hire me to be a community liaison.
Speaker 1: Okay and that's still in existence today, Samad and Associates?
Speaker 2:  	I don't do full-time consulting.  I usually take on one or two clients a year because between my writing and my full-time teaching I don't have a lot of time to consult, but I will take, I will take on a client here and there.
Story_ID: 641913
Speaker 1: Is there a memorable, I guess client [of Samad and Associates, Los Angeles, California], I mean, in terms of one that really stands out that you're really proud of assisting?
Speaker 2:  	There's a couple.  My first client was a gentleman by the name of Jim Jones.  People don't know who James T. Jones is, but James T. Jones is a legend in this town.  I think he's still living.  He would be about eighty-eight or ninety years old now.  He was the first black McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] franchiser in Los Angeles [California], and he was the first black Sizzler franchiser.  He was also the first black Marie Callender's franchiser.  And when I came home, my girlfriend at the time who subsequently became my wife took me to dinner at Marie Callender's and he came over to me and he says, "Young man I want you to work for me. Come back and see me tomorrow."  And he gave me a twenty-five hundred dollar a month contract to basically do nothing.  He called me on the phone and asked me about this.  He might call me four times during the week, said, "I got a project over, near USC [University of Southern California, Los, Angeles, California]" you know, "You know, So and So can you tell me about them."  "How would I be able to get them to," you know, because Sizzler was across the street from USC.  And Jim doesn't know how much that meant to me, and Jim, Jim was my client for about ten years.  My biggest client was the [U.S.] Department of Health and Human Services, the Healthy Start project.  That was where you know the federal government sought to try to implement an infant mortality reduction program.  And that infant mortality reduction basically helped save the lives of African American babies, and I had five projects and it was quite a healthy proj- a healthy contract and I was a consultant for them for about seven years.  I had a project in Greenville, Mississippi.  I had a project in Sikeston, Missouri, which is the boot heel of Missouri, okay.  I had a project in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute the boot hill of Missouri?
Speaker 2:  	The boot heel of Missouri.  If you look at the State of Missouri, there's a part of the bottom of the state which borders Mississippi or borders Tennessee I think.
Speaker 1: Oh boot heel, h--
Speaker 2:  	The boot, it looks like a boot heel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: Not boot hill like cemetery (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) No, no it's like boot heel, right.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2:  	And so I had a proj- a project there.  I had a project in Detroit.  I had a project in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and I had a project in Fresno [California], and so it would travel me all over the country.  I'd have to spend two days at each project helping to make sure that they were one, using the federal funds correctly; two, they were developing plans to sustain after the contract ran out.  So, those were probably my two proudest projects.
Story_ID: 641914
Speaker 1: So as things move on, your column is syndicated and papers all over the country and NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association].  Now what, now did you play any role at all during the Rodney King riots, those '92 [1992] riots?
Speaker 2:  	Well I did.  I mean I was with, I was consulting to then State Senator Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson].  So, we were at First A.M.E. Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California] the infamous night that the, that the verdict came down and then we were at First A.M.E. when they were shouting down Tom Bradley and most of the leaders.  While we--I was watching a television screen watching the building across the street being set on fire, so we got up out of the church.  Somebody ran into the church and said the building across the street is on fire.  And so at that time Diane Watson was running for county board of supervisors [Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors], and that's really kind of what I was, I was her issues consultant.  And she had an office on Crenshaw [Boulevard] that we converted into a center where people would bring goods, food, necessities to be able to survive 'cause the power was out in South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in many areas.  You know people had running water, but they didn't have heat.  You know they shut down the gas, so there wouldn't be any explosions and several people gave money and we created this nonprofit called the South L.A. Emergency Relief Fund and that's essentially, excuse me, what I was asked to run.  Diane Watson appointed me to run the South L.A. Emergency Relief Fund, and we ran that for about eighteen months until the money ran out.  But, it served its purpose in helping people in the immediacy after the riots.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right so you know I just wanted to point out during those riots, fifty-three people were killed and I don't know how many were arrested and injured, you know big--
Speaker 2:  	Right.  Well it is still the nation's most disastrous man made riot over a billion, I think it's $1.3 billion in damage you know, still considered the most costly urban riot in the history of America.
Speaker 1: Now you were writing your column you know--I'm sure you wrote about this right and?
Speaker 2:  	I did.
Speaker 1: Okay and what were your observations I mean after (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Well, my observation was one, the city fathers and mothers knew that this was coming, and I basically recounted the three years prior in which we had meetings in which we told the people of the circumstances, the city leaders, of the circumstances in the streets that we're basically by and large being ignored.  And so when Rodney King happened in March of 1991, it wasn't a surprise to a lot of us because they had been beating people, you know, for years and it was on the street that if you get a light on you, a red light, don't run because if you run that will make them beat you worse, okay.  It'd just, it'd just piss them off.  And so it took something like that really to shake the dust that was over the eyes of the--because this was the era of Tom Bradley.  Tom Bradley was in his fifth term.  Tom Bradley was mayor of this city for twenty years.  People thought we were past race, but Daryl Gates had put a system in place that was vicious to black people.  People on the Westside and people in the Valley [San Fernando Valley, California] couldn't believe it because they had never had that experience because there was two different methods of policing in Los Angeles [California].  There was, there was what you, how you policed on the Westside and in the Valley, and then there was how you policed on the south side and on the Eastside where Latinos lived.  And it wasn't a surprise to blacks and Latinos.  Now what came out of that riot was you also saw the wealth divide, because most of the rioters in the '92 [1992] riot were Latino and all the archival film shows that.  When we, we celebrated last year the twentieth anniversary of the riots, and when we talk about the stigma that took place between blacks and Koreans, Latinos are definitely silent because basically they were in the shadows at that time, but they came out of the shadows for that riot because there was an opportunity to get things for free that basically showed that there was a significant impoverishment in South L.A. and the central city L.A. that people had by and large ignored.
Story_ID: 641915
Speaker 1: What was the dynamic between Tom Bradley and Daryl Gates? I mean how did, I mean did Bradley have any control over him?
Speaker 2:  	Well, he, he didn't, he couldn't fire him because Los Angeles [California] at that time had a strong council, weak mayor system, which meant the city council hired all of the department heads and fired all the department heads okay.  Richard Riordan got the city charter changed after Tom Bradley was mayor, so now we have a strong mayor, weak council system.  But, then he needed eight votes to fire Daryl Gates, and Gates had more votes than Tom Bradley because he had a dossier on over half of the city.  He was J. Edgar Hoover, Jr., in that regard (cough) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now did the, did the African American community realize that Tom Bradley really had no political control over Chief Gates?
Speaker 2:  	If there was a time where the community realized it, it didn't come about until the riots when we called for Tom Bradley to fire Daryl Gates and found out he couldn't fire him.  Now, Tom Bradley and Daryl Gates didn't have a good relationship either largely because Tom Bradley being part of the community knew how LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] treated--Tom Bradley was a former policeman, okay.  Tom Bradley retired from the police department before he went into politics and so for Tom Bradley's last term, at least the last four years, him and Daryl Gates never even spoke.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay I just wondered about that.  So, then you know further down the line you've got the O.J. Simpson--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --matter which you know this is--
Speaker 2:  	Well that, that, at that point that made L.A. look crazy.  You know everybody was like okay they, they have gone mad out in L.A. you know.  I think O.J. Simpson was 1995 [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: Right, so I don't want to skip by anything that's important, but--
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: --but you know I know there's a few years, then you got '93 [1993] and '94 [1994] in between there, but I don't know, were you focusing on local issues or national issues in your column?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I always from the time that I've written a column I would write one week local and one week national, so I would alternate.  I think the most significant thing of 1995 was the Million Man March, and I was part of the national organizing committee for the Million Man March.
Speaker 1: Okay of course the Million Man March was proposed by Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] and--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --pe- by people all over the country.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, but Mr. Farrakhan was the convener and he brought everybody in and everybody came to the table except the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.].  Those were the only two major black groups, but many of their members came, but those two groups didn't endorse the march.
Speaker 1: So what are your memories from that, that period?
Speaker 2:  	Well, that was a period in which I had remarried.  I remarried in July of 1992, okay, and by 1994 I had custody of the kids from my first marriage.  So, I had three children [Kellie Essex, Gabrielle Essex Fulse, and Anthony Essex, Jr.] from my first marriage, and I have one child [DeShawn Samad] from my second marriage, so I have four children.  And at that time we were still living in South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and we were basically just trying to adjust to the rebuilding of L.A.  You know L.A. went through probably I would say a three year rebuilding period.  A federal consent decree was put in place.  LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] was given a federal monitor.  Federal civil rights charges were filed on the police that were exonerated by the state jury trial, so I think two of them ended up getting convicted in the federal civil rights trial.  But, basically you know that period from '92 [1992] to '95 [1995], L.A. was just basically trying to find itself and that's when I was really kind of deep into the, into that public health service contract [with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services], so I was kind of traveling quite a bit during that time too.
Story_ID: 641916
Speaker 1: And I know many people think that the O.J. verdict [in the People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995] was payback by, you know, by jurors to, for the mistreatment of the police in the black community.
Speaker 2:  	No, it's unfortunate that the O.J. Simpson trial was as racialized as it was, and I don't think that the people ever really understood what was going on there.  I think it has come out since, but the, the prosecutors in this city don't want to touch that.  It was too much of a live wire.  That's still the quickest way to break up a cocktail party in Los Angeles [California].  If you go to a mixed party, multiracial and you say, "O.J. didn't kill them people," your drink will get snatched out your hand, and you'd be shown the door okay, because that's just how highly polarized the city was over that.  And O.J. Simpson was a beloved figure in this city, and he wasn't really of the African American community.  O.J. Simpson spent most of his time in Brentwood [California].
Speaker 1: So you're saying he's a beloved figure of the white community basically.
Speaker 2:  	Well, I mean as an athlete you know you can't take away all the things that he did, you know.  A lot of people say O.J. Simpson put USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] on the map, okay, and some people might say it was Mike Garrett who came before him, but O.J. Simpson was certainly John McKay's heyday.  And you know the Juice became a hall of famer in the NFL [National Football League] and he made his home here in Southern California.  So, you know they did--while--no he wasn't an activist and he really didn't socialize in black circles too much, he was someone that was held in esteem who basically got out.  And basically O.J. Simpson was seen as someone, he, I wouldn't say he was seen as a sellout.  He was seen as someone who basically mainstreamed himself.  That's the best, best way that I can put it, you know.  I mean that's what everybody is trying to do today.  Well, O.J. was one of the first to do it.  He mainstreamed himself.
Story_ID: 641917
Speaker 1: People didn't hate him for it, they--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --but he wasn't like a--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --familiar figure in the black community (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) That, that's correct, that's correct.  They, they didn't have a high degree of animus for him.  Now when the trial [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995] came about, the real issue in the trial was jury selection and the involvement of the police, okay.  And the reason why that case was lost was because of the tainted evidence of the police, the Mark Fuhrman, the use of the N word, all of that.  That's, that's what really turned the women, the black women in particular of the jury in O.J.'s favor.  I mean the evidence was largely circumstantial.  The word on the street is he was covering for somebody, most likely his son who had gotten in an argument with his wife the day before and may have come back and, and done something okay.  The popular thought is that O.J. didn't do it, but he knew who did it.  And because he didn't give up who did it, that's essentially what the animus is about toward O.J. Simpson, and the fact that he just happen to hire the best lawyer this side of the United States, Johnnie Cochran who was basically--his expertise was police misconduct.  Johnnie, Johnnie Cochran had sued and beat LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] over two dozen times.  Okay, so once the misconduct element came out in the case, you knew they were gonna win that case, okay, that's, and that's, that's what happened with respect to that case.  And so basically the people ended up rooting for O.J. because they thought he was wronged by the police (laughter), that he was entrapped.  It had already been said that Mark Fuhrman had been out to his house a couple of times, found reasons to try to cite him and stuff like that, commented on his interracial relationship.  So, you know you don't have to drop much in the African American community for conspiracy theorists to come out.
Story_ID: 641918
Speaker 1: Now you started teaching political science and African American studies at Los Angeles Community College [Los Angeles Community College District] this is in, in '96 [1996]?
Speaker 2:  	In '96 [1996] I took an interest.  I got tired of traveling, and I wanted to--my kids were now beginning to enter high school, so I needed to be home more and I wanted to go back and work on my Ph.D.  So, that was--the same year I began teaching was the same year I began to start to work on my Ph.D.  I had applied to Claremont [Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California].  I wanted to study race and social construction.  I really wanted to study--after the Republicans took over [U.S.] Congress in 1994 when they came out with that Contract on America or Contract for America [sic. Contract with America].
Speaker 1: Yeah it was--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, which was a contract on black America, I really wanted to study the new conservative movement, and Claremont graduate school, the Claremont Colleges, were considered the conservative think tank.  So, I wanted to go out there and study race, and that's what I did and I began to.  I got an offer to teach at Northridge, and my first teaching assignment was at Cal State Northridge [California State University, Northridge, Northridge California] and then I got an offer to teach at Southwest College [Los Angeles Southwest College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2:  	And then I, you know so between those two and then I got an 80 percent assignment at West L.A. College [West Los Angeles College, Culver City, California] in 1998.  I taught the PACE program [Program for Accelerated College Education], which was basically an accelerated degree for working students, you know where they could essentially take a fifteen week course and complete it in a six week window.  And then I took on, I was hired full-time by the district at East Los Angeles College [Monterey Park, California] in 2000.
Story_ID: 641919
Speaker 1: In 1995--
Speaker 2: (Cough).
Speaker 1: --now you're forty-two I guess in '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: You became the--now did you found the Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles?
Speaker 2:  	I did, I co-founded it with a former council member, Robert Farrell, who had left politics and he had become the political editor of the Los Angeles Sentinel.  And so he stayed with it about two years, but it was my concept that I had been shopping to publishers for several years.  I first gave it to John Holoman [John Henry Holoman].  I think as early as '95 [1995].  I said, "John we need to do a discussion forum around issues in our community [Los Angeles, California], sort of like what town hall does," okay.  John said, "Nah, nobody is gonna support that."  Then I took it to Charles Cook L.A. Watts Times, and then I took it to Jennifer Thomas who had taken over the paper from her husband, Ken Thomas [Kenneth Thomas].  She says, "Well run it by Bob Farrell, Bob is with it."  So, Bob really didn't understand the concept, but he understood the importance of public dialogue, okay 'cause Bob you know was kind of a nerdy guy, you know, an intellectual.  In fact, Bob was more intellectual.  A lot of people wonder why, Bob was a freedom rider who ended up going into politics, and he, he likes to discuss.  You know he likes intellectual stimulation.  So, he said, "Yeah well let's go ahead and do it," and so our very first forum was then police chief [HistoryMaker] Bernard Parks okay, and Bernie Parks was a Daryl Gates clone, okay.  They brought in Willie Williams [Willie L. Williams] to take over to reform the department and they, the department ate Willie Williams up from the inside.  Daryl Gates comes back, all of the old boys come back.  Anyway they had this scandal called the Rampart scandal that the, that the movie ['Training Day'] that Denzel [Denzel Washington] did was a biopic off, okay, and this was a situation where basically cops were stealing from--beating up gang members and stealing from drug dealers and you know in some instances killing folk.  And then folk began to be sent to jail and they began to start comparing notes and say well that's the same dirty cop that arrested me, that took my money, took my stash.  So, that's how the Rampart scandal busted.  So, Bernard Parks came to the Urban Issues Forum said that this was an anomaly, that LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] is in reform.  The next thing we know the scandal had spread across five divisions, the week after he came to the Urban Issues Forum.  So, the Urban Issues was a hit from the dump--jump street.
Speaker 1: Now Parks is the black police chief, is that?
Speaker 2:  	Huh?
Speaker 1: Is Parks the black police chief?
Speaker 2:  	He, he was the black police chief, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay he was.
Speaker 2:  	--at that time.  He only did one term as police chief.
Story_ID: 641920
Speaker 1: But, we've been able to host the nation's top--our next biggest speaker was Winnie Mandela.  Winnie Mandela came to the United States on the commission for racial reconciliation of South Africa, and they basically came to study the American Negro.  You know how did black America reconciliate after segregation, and she was on a--she was on a ban.  She could not speak, okay.  She was not supposed to speak in the United States.  She came to our forum and spoke, even though she was under a speech ban.
Speaker 2: Now this is in, this is after '99 [1999]?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah this is in two thir- she came the forum in 2000.
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000] and she was still in some ban in South Africa. Now this is post apartheid so.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, well it was post apartheid, but remember she was, she was put on that commission by her husband [Nelson Mandela] and she was kind of in reform at that period.  You know they wouldn't let her be the mother of the nation, but you know they still had great love for her.  You know they just said don't go over there and make any political statements, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	But, she came over here and spoke and you know that, that was a great thing for the Urban Issues Forum [Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles].
Speaker 2: So, what she did wasn't against the law or anything it was just something she was asked not to do it (unclear)--
Speaker 1:  	Yes, that's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1:  	And then we got Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] in 2000 during the Democratic National Convention [2000 Democratic National Convention, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1:  	And so you know since that time we had [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis.  Ossie Davis was one of our first speakers when they had given Mumia Abu-Jamal a date, an execution date.  He came out and spoke against the postponement of the execution date.  You know we've had Judge Greg Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis].  We've had you know, [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun came and spoke, and probably our highlight is when we hosted Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] in October of 2007.  No excuse me.  Yeah, that's, that's correct, October 2007, and this was a period of time where he was just largely a curiosity.  He had released his book, 'Audacity of Hope' ['The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream'], but the whole City of Los Angeles [California] was locked down for Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and we were actually threatened not to host him.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he, he had declared his candidacy by then?
Speaker 1:  	No, he didn't declare his candidacy until January.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So how did, I know Cornel West (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Oh excuse me it was, let me correct--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	--that it was October 2006.
Speaker 2: Okay 2006.
Speaker 1:  	Okay, 'cause he declared his candidacy in February of 2007.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	Okay.
Story_ID: 641921
Speaker 1: Before I ask you about some of these people I just wanted to--what was the--how often did the forum [Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles]--?
Speaker 2:  	We started out monthly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Okay, and we would do ten to twelve forums a year.  We generally wouldn't do one in December or January and then we wouldn't do one in the midsummer month, usually August.  Now we do them quarterly because the forum has grown; over thirty-three thousand people have attended a forum.  More than that we give free breakfast, not continental breakfast, free sit down breakfast and we have people underwrite that.
Speaker 1: So this is a, a mor- morning forum (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	This is a morning forum, and when I first started it, my first sponsor said, "Black people are not gonna get up in the morning, and listen to this," you know.  This year we had, we hosted [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis over eleven hundred people came, had breakfast for free.
Speaker 1: So what hall do you hold it in, I mean was--
Speaker 2:  	Well--
Speaker 1: --it was in different venues around this city?
Speaker 2:  	Well, our principle venues are the California African American Museum [Los Angeles, California] and the Staples Center [Los Angeles, California].  We have a partnership with the Staples Center, partnership with African American Museum, and then the third venue we use is the Regency West [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, the Staples Center is more than just a basketball floor. I was saying (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right, they have rooms up in there that can hold you know anywhere between seven hundred and a thousand people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 641922
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the--whose--you know, well was the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] forum the most popular (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) So the Obama fo- forum was one of the most popular forums along with Winnie Mandela, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], but we--Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] has spoken there twice.  Tavis [HistoryMaker Tavis Smiley] and Cornel [Cornel West] had been there three times each.  You know so we have--you know Michael Eric Dyson, Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton].  We've had everybody come and speak to this forum [Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles], you know not just local leaders, but state leaders.  We've had three police chiefs, two mayors, you know a couple of attorney generals.  You know so we've had some significant figures come to the forum.  It is now part of L.A. [Los Angeles, California] culture.  It is probably the leading public affairs forum in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and so that's significant you know--
Speaker 2:  	Thank you.
Speaker 1: --that's, that's something that you know a lot of cities have had this in the past and lost it, some are trying to recapture it.
Speaker 2:  	Right, right.
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2:  	And I can, when I send you the electronic file, I can send you some of the photos of the forums.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you think in terms of the forums, I mean has any one forum been effective in changing public opinion or policy in a, in a dramatic way?
Speaker 2:  	Most of them have, we've had forums that you know after, for instance, a black man was hung in the Los Angeles County jail in the early 2000s and we brought the sheriff in and you know he spoke at the forum and they changed their supervision policy.  There're still abuses in the county jail, but we think that we have moved the needle in terms of bringing attention to this.  Last year they criticized the fire chief for response times, and we had the fire chief come to the forum and explain what had happened.  Well, the budget had been cut.  They had to cut down, close down two or three firehouses.  Then we found out that the consultant that basically reported the fire times, the response times had actually made them up.  Well, had we not put a spotlight on that, that wouldn't have come up, okay.  You know we've, we've done some significant things in the city.
Speaker 1: So, what you're telling me is nobody was really keeping track of the response times (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Oh no they were keeping track of the response times, but they were--a national report came out that said Los Angeles was something likes twenty-seventh in response times or something.  They were trying to compare us to New York [New York].  Well, you know Los Angeles is, you know, something like 477 square miles.  You know Manhattan [New York] is forty-seven square miles, you know, I mean you can't compare one to the other.  You know and so we were able to one, highlight, you know, how the mis-comparison really was the detriment of the fire chief.  Secondly, the absence of resources.  If you want better response times, you don't take away resources you, you add resources.  So, the forum has been excellent in raising the profile of significant issues in the community.
Story_ID: 641923
Speaker 1: Now you received your Ph.D. in '97 [1997]. Is it '97 [1997]?
Speaker 2:  	No, I received my Ph.D. in 2007 [from Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California].
Speaker 1: Two thousand--2007 okay.  Well, it's not time to talk about that yet 'cause we're still in the late '90s [1990s] I guess. We're likely to return there.
Speaker 2:  	Well we, you were in '99 [1999] when we talked--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	--about the Urban Issues Forum [Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles]--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2:  	--the founding of the Urban Issues Forum.
Speaker 1: And that's been going on since then and still going on now.
Speaker 2:  	It's still going on today.
Speaker 1: And you're still, and your columns are still--well, well I guess we could talk about the Ph.D. actually if you want, you want (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	Well, the Ph.D. experience was, was different in as much as I was an older student who went back.  I was interested in teaching at a university and in order to get a tenure track appointment at a university you have to be a Ph.D., but during that process I also had three kids in high school.  In fact my, my, all of my kids graduated from high school and were in college at the same time I was (laughter), you know so I had to take my time with that.  But, the important thing was, it's that I was able to finish it and--
Speaker 1: When did you start working on your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2:  	What year did I start?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2:  	Nineteen ninety-seven [1997].
Speaker 1: Oh okay all right, so you work, you work on the--
Speaker 2:  	Well, I went on--I took a couple of breaks.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2:  	You know I went four years straight, then I, I took a year off.  Then I went back and studied for my oral exams and passed them, and then I took a year off and then I took three years to write my dissertation.  So, I took the full seven years that you get you--give you, and then they let me come back a couple of times.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and in the interim you wrote a, you wrote your first book in 2002, 'Souls for Sale' ['Souls for Sale: The Diary of an Ex-Colored Man,' Anthony Asadullah Samad], right?
Speaker 2:  	I, I wrote 'Souls for Sale' was my first book, which was an autobiographical experience of my civil rights years as a, as a young NAAP--NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] activist.  I talked about the challenges.  I talked about my downfall.  I talked about my prosecution.  I talk about, you know, what happened in the aftermath including the riots.  The book ends on the first night of the riots, you know.  I talk about the birth of my youngest daughter [DeShawn Samad], you know.  And so it was basically a book that deals with the, the vola- volatile, what I like to call the volatile period in my life.  I also wrote my second book while I was studying for my Ph.D., which was '50 Years After Brown: The State of Black Equality in American' [Anthony Asadullah Samad], and it was basically all of the data that I had collected from my dissertation that my committee said I couldn't use, so I published it anyway.  Then I basically talked about how the studies that were coming out at the turn of the century were reflecting that economic and social circumstances hadn't changed since the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Story_ID: 641924
Speaker 1: Have we made any progress?
Speaker 2:  	In fact, we've actually lost ground.
Speaker 1: Now this is, this comes as, this is counter to what most people believe, you know--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --believe that we've, we've--
Speaker 2:  	Well because they seek black in- affluence and they see black influence and they see a black middle class, they assume that the vestiges of poverty are done, but poverty has actually increased over the last fifteen years.  And because we don't talk about race anymore we went through that period, the post '92 [1992] period of you know where we are no longer racial.  We, they called it post racial after the election of Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], but in '92 [1992] after the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the [U.S.] Supreme Court they talked about how we were a color blind society, we no longer--you know [President] George Herbert Walker Bush claimed that he didn't see any color when he appointed Clarence Thomas because we were color blind, okay, and so that whole movement period from 1991 to 1996 where we saw the total deconstruction of affirmative action ending here in, in '96 [1996] with Prop 209 [Proposition 209].  So you know America went through its color blind period.
Speaker 1: Well now what's Prop 209?
Speaker 2:  	Prop 209 said that no government institution, no government funded institution could use race as a criteria for receiving their funding.  So, what that did was that caused the universities, the colleges and universities not to be able to use race as a criteria.  So, you basically saw black college admission shrink to nil in the UC system [University of California] here in the State of California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	You also saw state contracts shrink to nil for African American contractors.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so, so this information is fifty years after Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]?
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And your dissertation I didn't ask you about that, but you mentioned it earlier is about Brown v. the Board.
Speaker 2:  	Well, what, what the dissertation is about is the policy implementation challenges of Brown okay, and it was a study of why integration didn't work.  And it talked about the ten year massive resistance period, and it talked about all of the policy challenges that each state that had the jury segregation, segregation by law they put up barriers and impediments to the implementation of Brown.  For instance, California never desegregated, so they were one of the first states along with Pennsylvania to go through forced integration, which produced busing.  Remember the busing challenges that took place and both, I mean the most visible ones were California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and (cough), excuse me black children were able to be bused to the Valley [San Fernando Valley, California], but white children never came into South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  And white parents were able to resist busing to such much so that the federal government just withdrew from California.  In other words, California was the first to have, Los Angeles Unified School District was the first to have its bus decree just rescinded because it just didn't work.  The logistics of the layout didn't work.  Students had to be on, on the bus stop at five a.m. and then it wasn't being reciprocal you know.  And so that's what the study of, of my dissertation was, was how public policy in some sense was put in place to remedy the situation, but in many instances it only made the situation worse.
Story_ID: 641925
Speaker 1: The question was raised even back in the days when we were discussing busing in the '70s [1970s] was would the federal government, I mean or would local government put equal resources in, in public schools, you know, regardless of where they were?
Speaker 2:  	And they still don't to this day.  And they've found different ways to manipulate, you know, inner city schools.  And they have found ways to disproportionately place inexperienced teachers in, you know the lowest performing schools.  Public education in the United States has been broken thirty years, you know, since 1980s, you know.  We need to look at a new model.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay in 2007 you published 'Saving the Race: Empowerment Through Wisdom' ['Saving the Race, Daily Affirmations for Young Black Males: Empowerment Through Wisdom,' Anthony Asadullah Samad] tell us about that.
Speaker 2:  	Well 'Saving the Race:  Empowerment Through Wisdom' was, is a book of daily affirmations. One of the things I do is I speak to high school students, and I speak to black male groups, and in fact I'm speaking to one today at Cal State, Dominguez Hills [California State University, Dominguez Hills, Carson, California] and this was a book that I wrote for my son [Anthony Essex, Jr.].  We moved to Altadena [California] to this house in 1996, and all of my children's friends grew up playing out in their driveway playing basketball in their driveway and my son use to have about eight or nine friends that were playing out there and somewhere around 1999, you know, I began to see them disappear.  And around 2006 I overheard a conversation, we were sitting out there on the porch, one of my son's friends had come by to see him and to say, "What's going on with So and So?"  "Oh, he's doing time in prison" or "What happened to So and So?"  "Oh, he got shot. You didn't hear he got shot?"  "What happened to So and So?"  "You know he's strung out on drugs."  So, of the twelve or so boys that use to play in my driveway, only about three of them were doing well.  Largely because of poor life choices that they had made, and so I wanted to write a book to young black males to help, one, the study had come out that black males don't read, so I figured if they read a page a day, start out reading something positive maybe they would enjoy reading and to basically help them understand consequences of their choices.  That's what that book is about.
Speaker 1: Okay around the same time you served as president and chairman of the board of 100 Black Men of Los Angeles [100 Black Men of Los Angeles, Inc., Los Angeles, California], right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  That I kind of did as a favor to my mentor, Fred Calloway, who was our second president.  I had not planned on getting involved in anymore organizations after my NAACP experience [with the NAACP Los Angeles Branch, Los Angeles, California].  I was done with organizations.  Fred said, "We, we need you."  Fred knows that I was a fundraiser and that I had significant community connections.  In fact, within me being president, two months, we did a fundraiser for [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama you know.  And so basically I came back to build what was the--the Los Angeles [California] chapter is the second oldest chapter in the nation, second or third oldest chapter, and I came back to help build it and I brought back, I brought fifteen new members to the table; and I raised nearly seven hundred thousand dollars for the chapter while I was president.
Story_ID: 641926
Speaker 1: You have a new book, right?
Speaker 2:  	I have two new books.
Speaker 1: Two new books all right.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  I released a personal book in December of 2012 called 'REAL EYEZ: Race, Reality, and Politics in 21st Century Popular Culture' [Anthony Asadullah Samad].  And basically that book is a critique of American institutions.  It basically studies the influence of popular culture on America society and how popular culture has shifted American institutions.  And so American institutions have changed since the turn of the 21st century, and most of us still look at the world through a 20th century prism.  We still look at the world as we did thirty, forty, fifty years ago, and we don't realize that in the 21st century the world has changed significantly, and so it's a study of education.  It's a study of religion.  It's a study on how culture identity has changed, a study in how politics and sexuality has changed.  That's why we didn't see the major shifts coming in our society.  We, we didn't see a black president until it was upon us [with HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  We never saw it coming because we didn't understand that race and race interpretation had changed.  We didn't see the gay movement, the gay and lesbian movement come upon us.  I like to tell my students, Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] freed the slaves, and the [U.S.] Supreme Court freed the gays.  But, we didn't see that culture shift coming until it was upon us, okay.  We didn't see the slip of the black church.  The black church in many instances is not on the moral high ground it once was, and the controversies, not just in the black church, in the Catholic church, in the Evangelical churches.  We see, saw these scandals take place in the last ten years largely because the church has taken on the ways of the larger society.  And then as I stated earlier, public education, we have become an anti-intellectual society.  We have become a dumbed down society largely because public education the last twenty years has failed us and is actually failing more students than it is matriculating, particularly in the urban cities.  So, that's what that book is about.  And then around the same time I started writing that book I was commissioned to write the 100 year history of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity ['March On, March on Ye Might Host: The Comprehensive History of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. (1914-2013),' Anthony Asadullah Samad].  And it basically talks about the influence of Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.] on the black fraternity movement, and the imprint that the members of Phi Beta Sigma have had on American culture.

Speaker 1: We were just talking about 'March On, March On Ye Mighty Host: The Comprehensive History of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity 1914 to 2013' ['March On, March on Ye Might Host: The Comprehensive History of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. (1914-2013),' Anthony Asadullah Samad], and I know I was surprised about the history of Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.] just leafing through the book that people like A. Philip Randolph and Alain Locke and Nnamdi Azikiwe even were--
Speaker 2:  	That's right.
Speaker 1: --Sigma, so, Sigma I don't know maybe it's just in my mind, but I see it's almost like the fourth, it's like the stepchild of the fraternities in some way.
Speaker 2:  	Well, there's actually five--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--because the Iota's [Iota Phi Theta Fraternity] came in 1963.  We were the baby of the original four.  We were founded in 1914 on a campus of, of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And it was an honor to be asked to write the history book by our then international president, Jimmy Hammock because Phi Beta Sigma were oftentimes seen as the scholars and intellectuals and the social change activists, and it had really never told its story.  Its last history was written in 1957.  It stopped at 1955, so it basically told the first forty years of the fraternity.
Speaker 1: Now when was the fraternity founded?
Speaker 2:  	It was founded in 1914.  January 9th, 1914, on the campus.
Speaker 1: All right and what was the, I mean how, was it founded when the different, I mean what was, what were the guiding principles that, you know separates it out from the others?
Speaker 2:  	Well, first and foremost it was founded by three men who were from the South, okay.  One is thought to be from the North, but they came to Howard University and they basically looked at the campus life and didn't see any fraternity that was service oriented.  And then in the first decade of the 20th century you essentially had the first and second generations of African Americans matriculating and you had an elitism forming.  You know you had a color caste system within the African American culture, and you had organizations that were giving, you know, brown paper bag tests.  And you know if you were darker than a brown paper bag you couldn't get into certain organizations.
Speaker 1: So, was this actually a factor in the forming of the Sigmas--yeah.
Speaker 2:  	That was an actual factor, you know.
Speaker 1: And I ask that question sincerely because we've, we've interviewed Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], and a lot of them downplay that now.  I mean that's something that, that is a rumor as to why the Deltas separated from the AKAs and that sort of thing, but they say, they'll say, they both, both of them say oh no, no, that, that's not the reason, but I recently heard a dramatic story about it from someone's grandmother's story about that, which makes me think there's more to it than (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	No, there, there, it was actually a fact, you know.  You had some of the early organizations that really kind of maintained that they didn't want their northern children associating with some of the southerners that were also coming to Howard, and you know so you know the northerners were calling the southerners country folk, and the southerners were calling the northern folk you know stuck up and elites you know.  And so then you had a whole segment of the population that were biracial that wanted to maintain that, that color caste divide because there's most certainly been studies that said then and now that the fairer African Americans are, the more life chances they have and so that was a founding principle that Phi Beta Sigma wanted to be the fraternity of inclusion not exclusion, and that is in all of our early documents and we read that to mean that we didn't want to exclude anybody because of their color, because of their geography, because of their upbringing, okay, that we wanted to be an organization of men who created a culture of service and with that service we would serve humanity; and that's what the fraternity's motto is, culture for service and service for humanity.
Story_ID: 641928
Speaker 1: --Founded on Howard campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and so the, what's the scope of the organization now and how many campuses is, I mean can you just give us a little idea?
Speaker 2:  	Well, over a hundred fifty thousand men have come through the organization.  We have 750 chapters.  We have chapters on four continents, so you know we--because not only Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.] was the first to make a presence in Africa, we were also the first fraternity to establish a chapter in Switzerland and Europe.  We were the first to establish a chapter in the Koreas, in Asia.  We were one of the first to establish chapters in the Caribbeans of culture for service and service for humanity has spread globally.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and any, is there any, well is there any one thing you want people to know about the Sigmas that they don't know?
Speaker 2:  	The one thing that I would want people to know about Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity is that it has been involved in every significant social movement of the 20th and 21st century.  Many people don't know Lafayette Hershaw [Lafayette M. Hershaw] was one of the founders of the Niagara Movement.  People don't know, you know that A. Philip Randolph was the coordinator and the founder of the March on Washington [March on Washington Movement], that he had actually proposed the March on Washington in 1941, pulled it off the table and put it back on the table in 1963.  You know many people don't know that George Washington Carver saved the South, that basically when he died they declared a national holiday.  He was the first African American to have a national holiday because his inventions on how to improve crop rotation saved the South; people don't know what okay.  People don't know that Huey P. Newton pledged Phi Beta Sigma and was a member of Phi Beta Sigma and didn't see Phi Beta Sigma as a suitable remedy to try to change the direction of social injustices and so he introduced a radicalism based on the teachings of Malcolm X that basically changed this country forever in the Black Panther Party movement and the pro black radical movements.  People don't, people don't know that significance.  People don't know that [HistoryMaker] John Lewis who was basically the founding president of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and basically was one of the Freedom Riders and one of the counter sit-in participants and was beat along with our fraternity brother, Hosea Williams at the front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama].  These are things that people don't know about Sigma.  They don't know about the imprint that Sigma has had on sports from Willis Reed to Jerry Rice and Emmitt Smith.  You know we have had a significant influence on American culture.

Speaker 1: This was published in 2013 ['March On, March on Ye Might Host: The Comprehensive History of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. (1914-2013),' Anthony Asadullah Samad].  What are your, what are your future public- publishing endeavors gonna be?  You know you got some other projects planned I'm sure.
Speaker 2:  	I do.  We're currently involved, I am currently involved in a documentary on the centennial rollout of Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.] where we are moving around the country to film different landmarks, interview different people about what the significance of a hundred years means.  I am part of a documentary on the election and the governing of [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama, (cough) excuse me.  We've actually been working on that documentary for five years, and we are kind of glad that we didn't release that documentary because that story is unfolding before us.  We were gonna try to put it out before his reelection, but we think the full story will be told and the challenges he faced as the nation's first African American president.  My next book project is a book project on the celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the Urban Issues Forum [Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles] and talked about how the Urban Issues Forum brought newsmakers to Los Angeles [California] at critical times, and we will tie in the issues that were occurring at that time those newsmakers spoke and how those issues eventually turned out.  And then in 2015 I'm looking to publish a book of my columns.  I've written over a thousand columns, and the book will be entitled 'A Thousand Times No to the Status Quo,' and it will focus on twenty-five years of countercultural writings.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question: when you look back at everything you've done to this point in life is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, there's a lot of things I would do differently (laughter).  Probably, I would probably have gotten married later, you know.  I think I got, I got married too young, even though I love my children and we go out regularly now they're all adults.  That, that is tough for a young man to get married early in the period in which I came of age.  I think that I would have made some different decisions.  I do have a great regret with respect to my conviction.  That wasn't something that had to happen.  That was, that was a function of carelessness more than anything, careless, just being careless.  I most certainly would have continued to be engaged in my activism, okay.  I think that my activism has played a significant role in shaping my character and in shaping the character of my children, showing them that it is important to stand up for some things.  I think that you know some of my life experiences has shown them that you know walking through adversity builds character, particularly when you're accused of wrongdoing and you are not guilty of any wrongdoings.  I think that part of life is not just experiencing good things, but you know going through trials and challenges because they help fulfill the gaps in your life that you probably would not have otherwise experienced had you not gone through those things.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2:  	My biggest concern for African Americans in 2013 and beyond is that we are now in a position where we are gonna go backwards faster than blacks after Reconstruction.  It took blacks twenty years to go backwards in reconstruction from 1970s, I mean excuse me from 1876 to 1896 when Plessy [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896] came about okay.  They were able to turn the law back in twenty years.  African Americans in the 20th century will go backwards in less than fifteen years.  If you, if you use 2000 as the embarkation point, when we talk about the deconstruction of public schools, when we talk about the prison, the effect of the prison industrial complex, when we talk about the disappearance of work, you know.  So if you have no education, you can't find work, okay.  If you have a conviction, you can't find work.  You know you have a total breakdown in the traditional family structure, so you now have more single women with children than married women with children.  We see a real breakdown in the cultural fabric of African Americans, and how do we turn that around with a, with broken school system, with a new conservative movement that is not looking to let up any time soon, okay, even though we have done the greatest things that any generation of Americans have accomplished.  The generation before me killed Jim Crow and was able to relieve of us of segregation.  Our generation elected a president that nobody ever thought would happen, but what did that gain us.  It, you know it may have gained us a few more positions of prestige in a society, but the larger, the larger masses haven't benefitted and in fact are going backwards and having a harder time then we've seen African Americans have since segregation.  So there, my hopes for the African American community is that we're able to turn this around, that we have to fight anti-intellectualism at all cost, that we have to make learning sexy again.  We have to create an appeal for people to want to go to school, want to embrace entrepreneurship, and then we have to just break down these barriers of discrimination, particularly economic discrimination that has created a gap in wealth and has created a bridge, where capital was concerned, where we just can't seem to get across the bridge when it comes to getting capital.  We have to train a generation--the mindset of our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren will be that they can do anything because they will come up in an age where they witness an African American president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], but will that be the extent of, of their dreams to, to be a president.  Will they become billionaires and will they become equal and you know that's a question mark.  That's, that's a fear that equality is gonna be a perpetual chase for the next three or four generations of African Americans.

Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.  Now you got some dau- you, you have daughters and a son right, two daughters?
Speaker 2:  	I have, I have three daughters and a son.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	The ages of my children at this time are thirty-one, thirty, twenty-eight, and twenty.  She'll be twenty-one in March.  My oldest daughter [Kellie Essex] is, is a fashion buyer.  The thing that I'm proud of with all of my children is I was able to raise them without any of them going to jail and with all of them going to college.  That is, if I was to have a greatest accomplishment of my life, that is the greatest accomplishment of my life and the fact that I was there when each one of them was born.  I watched each of them come into the world.  My middle daughter [Gabrielle Essex Fulse] is, is a cosmetologist.  She has a hair business, and she does well and she's married and she has three beautiful children.  My son [Anthony Essex, Jr.] is in college.  He is an architectural student, you know, and he has had his life challenges, but I think he's going to be all right.  You know he keeps his head on straight.  He has three children, and he is looking to try to make his way, and I believe that he will.  He's continuing to stay out of trouble, and I have the greatest confidence in him.  My youngest daughter [DeShawn Samad] is a math and engineering major at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], and she is doing fantastic and I believe that she is going to be a great contributor to our society.

Speaker 1: What would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2:  	I didn't hear the question, I'm sorry (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2:  	My professional legacy is that I was able to be a social critic in a time where African Americans saw the second redemption period.  If the Civil Rights Movement was the Second Reconstruction, we're living in the second redemption where time has been turned back.  And I think my professional legacy is that I was able to document that time in books and editorial commentary in the classroom in which I was able to--I've taught over seven thousand students, and I was able to influence their thinking to be observant critics of the time and to use their minds and to use their critique to try to improve society.  I would like my professional legacy to be that I was an engaging opinion leader who not only wrote and taught, but I was able to present forums.  Nobody in the country can say that they have presented the collection of newsmakers and historical personalities that I have presented in the Urban Issues Forum [Urban Issues Forum of Greater Los Angeles] and that we were able to critique our lives in real time, in real time.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2:  	No, I think you pretty much covered everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well last question is similar to legacy the one I just asked, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2:  	I would like to be remembered as a young man who was raised by two loving parents [Margaret Davis and Charles Essex, Sr.] who saw some things wrong with the world and pointed it out to their children and who gave me the opportunities that they didn't have to go to college in hopes that I would give my children the opportunities that I didn't have, which I am trying to do.  I would like to be remembered as a person who didn't seek fame and didn't seek to be famous, but in my community work, developed a notoriety, but didn't become notorious, but was a person who was known as a truth teller who told it like it was and for the thirty years that I was on the battlefield, you know, gave everything I had.  I won more battles than I lost.  I claimed more victories than losses.  I made more friends than I made enemies, and I tried to live my life to the fullest.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you very much.
