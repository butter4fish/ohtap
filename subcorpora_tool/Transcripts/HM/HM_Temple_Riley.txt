Speaker 1: We're just going to start, Mr. Temple, with me saying my name is Racine Tucker Hamilton and I am the interviewer.  Carey Lane is the videographer.  There is no observer today, and the location of this interview is taking place at 1821 23rd Street Northwest, Washington, D.C., and today's date is Monday, May 24th [2004].  And if you would, Mr. Temple, please start by telling us your full name and spelling it please?
Speaker 2: Middle name included?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Riley Kene Temple.  R-I-L-E-Y, K-E-N-E, T-E-M-P-L-E.
Speaker 1: And could you please tell us the date and location of your birth?
Speaker 2: The date?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: You want the truth?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: It's July 9th, 1949.  Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm an attorney.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111504
Speaker 1: And the next couple of questions are just some People magazine-ish type questions, just to kind of help us break the ice, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Could you please share with us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I have a favorite food.  I enjoy eating, very much.  I eat everything.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: It depends on my mood for the day.  I think probably blue.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I love the change of seasons.  I love a snowy winter day.  I love a spring day like today, although it feels a little like summer out there.  I love looking out my window here and seeing the gorgeous leaves on the trees and the blossoms.  Spring is just, in Washington [D.C.], it's just glorious.  And I love the heat of summer.  I like it to be what it's supposed to be, and summer when it's sizzling, because it forces you to slow down and then the crispness of fall comes about, I'm enthralled, so I like them all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Italy.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It would probably come up during the course of the interview.
Speaker 1: Sure.  And if it does, just remind me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, I will.  And probably inherited from my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple], who had a way with words.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111505
Speaker 1: And speaking of your mother, let's begin talking about your mother.  Please tell me your mother's name and where she grew up, and just what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  My mother was Helen Burnette Jones Temple.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Burnette?
Speaker 2: B-U-R-N-E-T-T-E.  And she grew up on a farm, was born and grew up on a farm in Charles City County, Virginia, which, curiously enough, she loathed, from the very moment of her existence.  I don't know how you can be born into something and not like it, but she never did like living on the farm.  She was afraid of everything and when the farm failed during the depths of the [Great] Depression and they moved to Richmond [Virginia], she sat in front of the windows to watch the city lights come on every night, and from that point on, she cursed the darkness and loved the light in almost every way in her life.  And she was educated in the Richmond Public Schools.  She did not go to college, which is really rather unfortunate because she's a brilliant woman.
Speaker 1: And, what else do you know about her background and her growing up?  Did she ever share any stories with you about growing up?
Speaker 2: Always, always.  She was one of nine children and she was next to the last, next to the youngest.  And by the time she was born, she had brothers and sisters who were fully grown.  And she always described her life in the country and with her mother and family as being troubled because she was so different.  And she was willful.  And I can guarantee you that she was willful throughout all of her life.  And so she was sort of a sassy child and I think she got a few spankings as a result of being a sassy child, but always very smart and opinionated, and, but she had a delicate side to herself as well and she would tell the story about why when her mother combed her hair she would faint.  And she would just swoon at the drop of a hat.  I remember when my brother and I were growing up and we thought that my mother was just being overly dramatic all the time.  Of course she was overly dramatic, melodramatic, all the time.  Whenever she would swoon and faint, we'd just step over, and say, "Oh, Mother. Get over it.  Let's go."
Speaker 1: And now, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Beautiful.  She never thought so, but she was.  She turned heads everywhere she went.  Always very stylish.  And had a will and a self-discipline, that is, I have rarely seen in other people.  She could will herself to do virtually anything.  I think at the end of her life when she discovered, when she realized that she could no longer really take care of herself, she willed herself out of here.  She willed herself to death.  I know she did.
Story_ID: 111506
Speaker 1: Now tell me a little bit about your father, same things starting with his name and where he was born and where he grew up.
Speaker 2: My father, David Lorenzo Temple, Sr., because there is a junior, my brother, was born in King William County, Virginia, raised in Richmond, Virginia.  He did not know his father and if he did we never knew about it.  My father was never close to his family.  It was odd.  There were people that never talked about his family, although we knew periodically, you'd meet periodically, members of his family and never really wanted to talk about it.  So much so that I remember at my father's funeral, there were people sitting next to me on the front row that I'd never seen before in my life and have not seen since.  Don't know how to get in contact with them.  It's bizarre.  He was an ambitious man.  He shined shoes to make money.  He shined shoes on the street corner, but made friends with some of the best families in Richmond [Virginia].  They like him because he was industrious and ultimately, he became one of the most successful insurance brokers in the company business.  North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company [Durham, North Carolina], was at that time the largest black business in the world.  He was very successful.  People loved my father.  He was very active in the community and was a member of many clubs and of community activities, raised money for all kinds of causes and knew just about everybody, and in many ways, he was my role model.
Speaker 1: And did he ever share any stories with you about growing up, his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, all the time.  He loved people and people loved him.  And he loved to party.  One time he told the story of this grand old family in Richmond called the Giltons [ph.], and I think a descendant of the Gilton clan is a Kenneth Gilton who writes for the New York Times.  I'm not sure, I should find one day and ask of him.  But my father tells the story about how he came and someone had snuck in, and this was, of course, during prohibition, I'm sure, and someone had snuck in some whiskey.  He got drunk and danced on someone's dining room table.  Those people never forgot it and, but they loved him for it, because it just--everybody just loved him, and they helped him to celebrate major events in his life always.  He worked very hard, worked very hard all of his life, and always made it a point of making everyone feel wonderful.  I remember as a boy being with my father, I think at a grocery store in the bank.  It's always at the grocery store or at the bank, interesting enough, he always shopped for the groceries in our home.  My mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] was out of the home working and, and we were there and somebody came up and were talking and he said, "Riley, this is Mrs. So-and-so," And she said, "Oh yes, we've met before," and she said, "Do you remember?"  I said, "No, I think, I don't think I do."  And so it was a nice conversation and a few minutes, a few seconds later, the lady, she left and my father backed me into vegetables and he said, "Boy, don't ever tell anyone you don't remember who they are.  You say, 'but of course,' you start asking them questions to draw more information so that you'll be able to respond intelligently, but never, ever, ever let someone know that you're, that they're not important to you."
Story_ID: 111507
Speaker 1: What can you tell me about your ancestors?  How far back can you trace them?  Do you know if you all came from free people, or were they slaves?  What can you tell me about your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Because of my father's [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] curious relationship with his family, I know virtually nothing, except that his mother, my grandmother, was a domestic worker in the home of a rather prominent history teacher in King William [Virginia], and who was my father's father, my father's father, my grandfather.  And, but he never married her.  So therefore, I never knew him.  And, my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple], as I mentioned, is from Charles City County, Virginia.  She, we cannot find any evidence of slavery on her side.  I do know that during the Civil War, sometime around the Civil War, my uncle, my grandfather Al Cotman [ph.], my grandmother's father, I guess it's is my [maternal] great-grandfather, went to Canada.  Family lore has it that he hid in a cave or tunnel.  We now know that he escaped by the, via the Underground Railroad, to Canada, where he met my great-grandmother Sue, who was at the time thirteen years old, and a Native American, and brought her back to Charles City County, where she proceeded to have nine or ten children in rapid succession and she died in her early thirties.  I have her photograph over here behind me.  We've had family reunions in Charles City County, Virginia, and we cannot find evidence of slavery.  It was the home of, I think, it's William Henry Tyler, and interestingly enough, the people in Charles City County who are in the immediate perimeter of the plantation are very fair and those, you know, just in the next circle are medium brown, and those of the dark skin people in Charles City County around, the outskirts. So that says everything, doesn't it?  Right.
Speaker 1: What can you tell me about your grandparents, starting with your maternal grandparents?  What were their names and any stories about them growing up?
Speaker 2: My [maternal]grandfather, Thomas Wyatt Jones, who grew up in Charles City as well, and my grandmother, I think was a distant cousin.  Lots of lunacy in Charles City because, you know, a lot of intermarrying.  People say it was to preserve the fair skin.  And it's probably somewhat true, but it's lots of it, we call it eccentricity but it was really lunacy.  And he was a farmer.  And he took care of other people's farm animals.  And so he treated the with illness, I mean, I guess had he been an educated man, he would have been a veterinarian, so, but he took care of everybody's farm animals and that's what he did and that's how they made their money.  And his wife was my  grandmother Magnolia Cotman [ph.] Jones.  Very religious woman, devout, and I only knew her in her older years of course and she died when I was ten.  And she seemed ever so gentle and warm to me, but apparently she was a task mast- mistress.  She brooked no disobedience or rudeness or sassiness in her children.  Strict disciplinarian.  A side of her I never saw.  And she was not beautiful, but attractive, and also directed plays in the church.  She loved drama and theater and so she did a lot of that, which is probably where my mother got her sense of drama from.
Story_ID: 111508
Speaker 1: And you said that your mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] worked outside of the home.  What kind of work did your mother do?
Speaker 2: She was a--she started--she grew up in segregated Richmond [Virginia], and for most of her, her childhood and early adulthood and teenage years, black people could not work on Broad Street, which is a downtown retail place in Richmond, in any capacity other than as maids and porters.  She broke the color barrier.  And she became a sales girl at Harper's Linen Mart, which ultimately became Harper's Department Store for Children.  Basically she sold layettes and infant clothing for people during the baby boom essentially.  And she ultimately became an assistant buyer for Miller and Rhodes, Brooks Brothers, Miller and Rhoads and Garfinckel's [Garfinckel, Brooks Brothers, Miller & Rhoads, Inc.], which is where--how she retired.
Story_ID: 111509
Speaker 1: Mr. Temple, tell us what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: On 24th Street, 1305 24th Street [Richmond, Virginia], in a home that my father owned.  We lived upstairs and we had tenants downstairs.  A teacher named Mrs. Stevens, I think it was Bernice Stevens, a single woman, rather severe if I recall, who wore her head, her hair in a bun.  It was a wonderful house with a front porch that always gleamed, waxed to a fare-thee-well, with the snake plant in the corner, green striped awnings which we would rush to pull up when there was a thunderstorm coming.  Miss Margie Johnson lived next door with her husband, Mr. Bob.  They called them Ms. Margie and Mr. Bob, as people do in the South, never by the last name.  It's too formal, but never so familiar as to be called Bob or Margie by children.  It's Mr. Bob and Ms. Margie.  It was a wonderful neighborhood.  And I remember a man who lived down the street, Mr. Tompkins [ph.] who had a horse farm out of the city and my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] would leave and go out of the city to ride horses.  I have a picture of my mother on Strawberry, somewhere.  That was the name of the horse, and she was a very fine horsewoman.  I remember that she would come back from riding.  And there was a woman who lived next door, an elderly woman who was sick and bedridden.  Her name was Mrs. Ham [ph.] and I loved her dearly.  And I would go over and she would tell me stories.
Speaker 1: What kind of stories would she tell you?
Speaker 2: Oh, about her children and about her life, and you know, she had grown up on a farm, and it's just that, she was just so accepting of me.  I was a different child, which we can talk about at some point.  Different from other children in some fundamental ways, but she was always so affirming, and she died when we were children.  I don't remember when, but it was sometime before I was seven because we moved when I was seven into the house on the, which was the family home until 1997.  And I remember being very sad when she went away.
Story_ID: 111510
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about, just what life was like growing up in your house, holidays, special events, that kind of thing, what was, and daily life as well?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was, but it seems so long ago now, and you know, it seems like just five years ago, it seemed like yesterday.  It seemed very easy.  The holidays were always festive, lots of food, lots of church, and lots of family and people dropping in and I remember getting dressed up and going and getting in the car.  My father [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] had a dark green 1954 Chevrolet.  Not 1954, earlier than that.  He got a '54 [1954] Chevy later.  But getting into the car and going to my Aunt Thelma's Bookers, who was not really my aunt, but we called them that because they were like godparents to us.  Aunt Thelma and Uncle James.  We would go to Aunt Naomi and Uncle Bob's.  They had a daughter, Roberta, who was our age.  We would go to see the Woodsons, little Cleveland, who was our friend.  Little Cleveland would eventually be called Woody.  I didn't like him too much, he was too rough, played too rough.  And, you know, my Aunt Thelma, my Aunt V around the corner.  It was a loving neighborhood, a wonderful neighborhood.  Mrs. Daniels up the street who would babysit for my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] and my dad when we were away and we would see my father, you know, in the street and we would say, "Daddy, we don't want to go over to her sister's house."  She would take us to her sister's house, which we loathed.  And we were not very nice about it.  And my brother and I used to laugh because she always had a case of severe flatulence.  And she let it rip whenever she wanted to.  My brother and I would just giggle and giggle and giggle.  And I remember one time she said, "Stay out of that street!  You boys don't play in the street!"  And I looked at her and said, "You can't say anything to us, my daddy's home today, you can't say anything today."  Of course, we got a spanking because we were being sassy to her.  But people were nice.  And it was a value system, I think, we don't have anymore.  I remember we would always walk to school with our book bags and our lunch.  My daddy would give us thirty cents, twenty-five cents for lunch.  That's how much it was in those days.  And I remember my mother saying to us, "Don't go by Miss Beulah's house because she'll talk your head off and make you late for school."  Beulah Wilder was the mother of [HM L.] Douglas Wilder.  And we were very close, they were part of our neighborhood, and wonderful people.  But she could really talk and she would stop and she would talk, and we would be like, late for school because she would make us late.  We would sit there and talk to her.
Speaker 1: Did you grow up with [HM L.] Douglas Wilder?
Speaker 2: He's older than I am, by much.  He was a young adult when we were coming along.  But I remember, I know him well.  So well, I mean, I remember eavesdropping on a conversation that he had with my father when they, when they were talking about strategy for Doug's pursuing public office.  When Doug graduated from Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], my father gave him some of his first speaking opportunities in order to give him visibility in the community to help move his law practice along.  Doug also presided at my father's retirement banquet.  And my brother managed the northern Virginia part of Doug Wilder's campaign for lieutenant governor, which was part of the state that put him over the top when he was elected.  And, so he's a very good family friend.
Story_ID: 111511
Speaker 1: Could you please give your siblings names and the order of their birth, including yourself?
Speaker 2: My brother, David, was born on July 18th, 1947.  He was the first child of my father's [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] to survive.  My father was married before.  He married into a very prominent Richmond [Virginia], black Richmond family named the Purnells [ph.] and he married their eldest daughter, Alma.  She became pregnant, I think she had a miscarriage and then she had, she was pregnant again with a son, who was to be named David.  And in 1941 she died.  And the child died as well.  We used to have, I don't know where they are now, but pictures, she was so prominent that the, it was covered by, her death was covered by the newspapers, you know, the black press, the Richmond Afro American, for which my father wrote for many years.  And I remember a picture of her father, Mr. Purnell, who was like my grandfather, with his handkerchief over his face like sitting at her grave, and it seemed as if, when I was a boy we lived with Alma because my father still loved her.  I think it was painful for my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple], but he loved her, and so when my brother was born, (unclear), you know, it was my mother described it like the second coming.  He was so excited that he had a son and he had my, and the story was that he was driving all over our neighborhood with my Aunt Suzy in the front seat and almost putting her eye out waving to people, "It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy.  I have a boy".  They, my father's nickname was Temp, you know, short for Temple, Temp.  And so my brother was Temp, Jr.  And, and now in an unguarded moment, I will call him Temp Jr.  And, he was loved, of course.  And he thought that he was God on Earth, until I came along, two years later.  And my mother tells the story that she said, "This is your new baby brother" and he said, "Where did he come from?"  And she said, "Well remember I carried him, you know, for nine months" and then she, he said, "Put him back."  And that's the story of our relationship. (Laughter)
Story_ID: 111512
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights, several.  Dogwood trees.  I have dogwoods here outside my window.  Magnolia trees.  We had two huge magnolias at our house, three beautiful dogwood trees, tulips, spring in our back yard at 3102 East Gray [ph.] street in Richmond [Virginia].  S- music, the sounds.  Church music.  I spent a lot of time in church.  My father was a deacon.  My mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] was very active in her church.  I spent a lot of time in church, speaking, Sunday school, choir, plays, scouts.  Smells, food, cooking, Je Reviens, my mother's favorite perfume when we were growing up, by Worth.  Today I have hand lotion of the scent of Je Reviens.  I wore it when I wanted to think of my mother, I'd put it on my hands and I smelled the perfume and I'd think of her.  Or Old Spice 'cause my father [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] wore Old Spice when we were growing up.  Also segued into Aqua Velva.  I never liked it as much, but it smelled good on him.
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some are not so pleasant.  I felt in some ways out of place.  I didn't know how to express it at the time, but my homosexuality was evident when I was a boy.  And I felt out of place.  And as I looked back on it, there were some adults who were very mean to me.  Out of the earshot of my parents, they would pull me aside.  I remember one man, I won't even call his name on tape.  He's dead now.  May he rest in peace.  "Sissy Riley Kene, Sissy Riley Kene."    I loved dolls when I was a boy.  And everybody thought it was horrific that I loved dolls, except my mother.  And she let me have them, because she, as the way she said it, she felt that I would hate her.  Later in life she didn't let me have them.  But I always had to keep them aside and apart, and one day I came home from school and we were staying with my Aunt Bea [Beatrice Jones White] after school.  She worked at home and she loved to sew.  And one day I came home from school and she said, "Go into my bedroom and look on top of the chest of drawers."  I said, "Okay."  So I went in there and she had made a completely new outfit for my doll.  It was sitting on top of the dresser. It was a lavender dress, was lavender, with a big flower made of fabric there in the corner on her waist, for me.  I never forgot that.
Story_ID: 111513
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Temple, let's pick up.  We were talking about your Aunt Bea [Beatrice Jones White] who had made this wonderful outfit for one of your dolls.  And what other memories do you have of your Aunt Bea in that time in your life?
Speaker 2: She was always so kind to me, 'cause there are a lot of people who are not kind.  And I was the subject of some ribbing from other kids.  It was hurtful, but she never judged me, ever.  She just accepted me for who I was and helped me to celebrate that.
Speaker 1: You had said earlier that you were a different child.  Different, how so?  How would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: I was very quiet, and content with it.  My teachers would tell my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] that I was a deep thinker and they never could figure out what was on my mind.  I knew then that what was going on inside of me was much more interesting than what was going on outside of me, and that a life of the mind is, was going to be who I would be, the type of life I would live.  And it's still the case, what goes on inside of me is, has, can hold no comparison to everything outside.  It's a cauldron, generally, and I didn't know how to express that when I was a boy and I spent lots of time alone, reading or playing, and I still appreciate my moments of solitude.  People say, but you're alone.  I said, I, I, "It's fine."
Speaker 1: And you said your homosexuality was not as accepting back during that time, especially by many adults.  What about in your family?  How did your family react to it?
Speaker 2: Of course, they knew, but no one ever said anything.  Occasionally, my mother would make it known that it was not a good thing.  But she never discouraged me from expressing myself however way I wanted to express myself.  And for that I'm eternally grateful.  And my father [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] was, never really addressed it, but was always wonderful about it because he never put me down because of it.  Oh, I think it was one time, I don't know what it was, and he said maybe I should buy you some shampoo or something.  I was fooling around with my hair, I don't know what it was.  But that was the only time, and it was, and so it was, you know, the subject of some abuse at school.  I remember I had a beloved music teacher in school, Maurice Williams, who I first got to know in fourth or fifth grade, and who taught me music until my senior year in high school, until I graduated from high school.  And I remember standing in line one day, in the lunch line, and feeling someone come up behind me, and take my hand off my hip.  And I, it startled me, and I looked around and he kept walking.  It was him.  It hurt my feelings at the time, but I realize now that he was, it was an act of caring.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: He didn't want other people to hurt me.
Story_ID: 111514
Speaker 1: How about your brother [David L. Temple, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: David is also homosexual, although he is not nearly as open about it as I am.  He ultimately married and never had children, but married.  He's not married now.  But he, you know it was the source of some difficulty between us.  He found me once, discovered me in some kind of sexual experimentation when I was early, in my early teens, and he blackmailed me with that information, had me doing all of his chores, and a little bit of everything else until he left for college, the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].  And when I came home from college one summer, it was a summer in which, I always thought in my homosexuality, this is an issue that I will deal with when I'm older, when I'm twenty-one, when I'm an adult, I can earn the money to go into therapy and fix it all.  When I was spending the summer away in college [at Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania], when I turned twenty-one, when I realized it was not going to change.  And I was depressed the entire summer.  And I would go to bed at night and wonder if I would wake up sane.  And when I came home, he was there before going back to school at Virginia, maybe he was in graduate school at the time at UVA [University of Virginia], and I said to him, "I have finally come to the conclusion that nothing is going to change, and I am a homosexual." And he said, "Well so am I."  And I said, "So you mean to tell me you blackmailed me all that time?  You jerk."  It took me a long time to get over that, but it was okay, and when he finally said to me, "You know, you never gave me credit for being a child or for my immaturity, you know, make room for my limitations," which I did.
Story_ID: 111515
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit and let's talk a little bit about the elementary school years.  Do you remember the name of your elementary school and some of your friends and your teachers?
Speaker 2: I do. I do. My elementary school was George Mason Elementary School and my first teacher was Mrs. Evelyn Jenkins, who I adored, and I knew her because--oh, I think I was assigned to another teacher, and I refused to go into that class because I knew Mrs. Jenkins.  She had taught my brother [David L. Temple, Jr.].  And occasionally he would take me to school with him.  I think kids could take their brothers and sisters to school at the time, and I would go to school with him periodically, which I loved, and so I knew her and so I wanted to be in her class.  And so I was, and, which was great and I loved George Mason.  We had a nice time there.  I don't remember who I had for second grade.  Maybe it was her again.  But third grade was another turning point because my teacher was Mrs. Gladys Morrison, Gladys Purnell [ph.] Morrison, my father's [David L. Temple, Sr.'s] first wife's sister, and I remember kids in the class remarking upon the fact that, "Oh, she's your aunt and she's going to favor you."  She wasn't really my aunt, but she felt like it.  What's interesting about my father's first wife's family is that they became like our family, and they still are.  His, her parents, Alma's parents, were like my grandparents.  I didn't know my father's parents, which they were like his parents to me.  We were always very close.  The families have always been very close and their, what would have been her nieces and nephews, are like my cousins, and we called each other cousins.  So this great extended family was fabulous, and it's wonderful.  And it was so unusual because people thought it was little odd, because it was my father's first wife.  She was dead.  He was married to my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple], but it worked out beautifully.  We were always there for all of the family gatherings and everything.  It was just fine.  And--
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends back at elementary school?
Speaker 2: Lynwood Wildridge [ph.] who was smart in school and probably my nemesis because I competed with him all the time, and he with me.  And, but he was always there.  We went all through elementary, secondary school together.  At George Mason there was Artiel [ph.] Benjamin, who was my first girlfriend at the age of ten, and she and I are very good friends today.  We've been friends all of our lives.  And her name is now Artiel White, and, but those are the two people that I remember best.  Patricia Robinson who was very smart, smarter than I was, and I couldn't stand it.  I always wanted to be the smartest one in the class, you know.
Story_ID: 111516
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about--at this time in your life, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Now that's very interesting.  A lot of people thought that I would be a minister because I stuck out as being so different.  I didn't play like the other children.  I spent all that time alone and everything, and I was rather too contemplative.  And I guess they saw that as a precursor to some kind of devout life.  And I never thought of myself as a minister so much, but I knew that I wanted to have some kind of an impact on something and I wanted to do something special and I wanted to live well.
Speaker 1: And you knew this in elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well first of all I had my father.
Speaker 1: Uh hum.
Speaker 2: Who made--you are David [L.] Temple's son.  You will do well.  You will go to college.  You will be the best that you could possibly be.  Always he made sure that we understood that we were, in his mind, with everyone.  But especially with his sons.  You know, you can be the best.  And, you know, I used to resent, I think I told you earlier that when I said, "Daddy, you're coming to the concert?" and he would say, "Do you have a solo?"  I would say, "No."  And he said, "I will come when you have a solo," you know, message sent, message received, that you must stand out.  And to this day, I mean my brother [David Lorenzo Temple, Jr.] sings in his church choir and he said, I said, "Did you sing today?" and he said, "Yes," and I would say, "Did you, did you have a solo?"  You know, we both laughed about it because that's how daddy was, and that was, it was so important to him to have his sons stand out. It was very clear to us that we needed to do that.

Speaker 1: You spoke earlier about attending church.  What were some of those experiences like?
Speaker 2: I remember, my father [David L. Temple, Sr.] was a deacon.  I'm not Baptist now, I'm Episcopalian, but when I was a boy, I was a Baptist and my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] and father--my father's church was also my mother's church when they were courting and when he was married the first time, but at some point, the churches split.  It was a very big split.  It was lots of drama and my mother and her family went to that other church.  My father stayed at Mt. Olivet Baptist in Richmond [Virginia], but we went to church with my dad.  Of course, we would go with my mother periodically, make it a special day for her.  So we grew up in two churches basically.  And, but my, on a Sunday-by-Sunday basis, we went to church with dad and he was a deacon and sat on the front row.  And the image I have is of my father taking his handkerchief, putting it on his knee and we would lay our heads on his knee, on the handkerchief on his knee and go to sleep in church.  The image I have.  How wonderful it was when my mother would come to church with us.
Story_ID: 111518
Speaker 1: Earlier you spoke a little bit about your father's [David L. Temple, Sr.] first wife, and that you thought it was painful sometimes for your mother.  What about the extended family?  How did your mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] handle that?
Speaker 2: The family lore is that when my father started seeing my mother, she was a real looker, that my father's first wife's sisters, Gladys and Elsie,  Gladys who taught me in third grade, were not nice to her.  "That's my sister's seat," you know, things like that.  Or occasionally, her mother, Pearl Purnell [ph.], would come over to our house, they lived right down the street, would come over to our house and enter the house and say, "Alma!"  My mother would say, "It's Helen."  And, but eventually all of that subsided because they grew to love her very much and she worked at it, I know she did.  And I remember when Pearl Purnell [ph.] died, it was like losing my grandmother.  I was nine years old.  I think it was 1958. I'll never forget it and I was standing outside of her house.  At the time people brought the bodies home, to the family home, and she was laid out in the family home, and I remember--and the funeral director coming that day.  I was standing outside.  I don't know why I was outside and everybody else was inside, but I remember the funeral director standing there on the front porch of their house calling out the names of the family in the order in which they were to go to the cars.  And after all of the Purnell [ph.] siblings were called, the last name to be called, names to be called, "Mr. and Mrs. David L. Temple and David and Riley," as a part of the family.  It was the first time that I had experienced spontaneous grief for when they brought her mahogany coffin out of the house, I suddenly burst into tears and I really didn't understand why, but I grieved greatly for her.

Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about junior high school?
Speaker 2: Wiled.  I wiled.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends, and who was influencing you as a young person, and do you remember any of your teachers from back then?
Speaker 2: Junior high?  Yes.  One teacher was my history teacher, Jane Harris Gray, family friend.  My brother [David L. Temple, Jr.] had been the ring bearer at her wedding.  She just celebrated her fiftieth wedding anniversary and invited him down and he said he couldn't go, which really appalled me.  I was horrified.  But I went.  And she taught me history and I had got a crush, I had a crush on her, and, of course, my parents were always officers of the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association].  They went to every PTA meeting.  They went to every single parent-teacher conference day, and I'd always say, "What did Miss, what did Miss Hammers [ph.] and Mrs. Gray say about things?"  She used to be Jane Gray to me, but when I had her as a teacher, she was Mrs. Gray.  "What did Mrs. Gray have to say about me?"  She said, "Of course, everybody thinks you're wonderful, Riley, and I said, I said, I told her that you had a crush on her."  I said, "You did not, you did not.  Why did you do that?"  "She said, 'Helen, I know.'"  I said, "She does not know!"  She said, "Of course she knows, don't be ridiculous.  She's knows children, you're not the first person to have a crush on her."  Anyway, oh God--and my father would do things like he would always, president of the PTA, but he would always tell a little joke before the meeting.  And he loved to talk about food and would always ask us about food, and, of course, you know these segregated schools in Richmond [Virginia], the cooking was wonderful, and they would make homemade biscuits and they would butter them for us and I'd say, "Daddy I love those," that it was biscuits with butter just oozing out, and one time he came back from the PTA meeting, he said, he said I just want to give you a fair warning, when you go to school tomorrow, everybody's going to be laughing and teasing you.  I said, "Why, what did you do?"  And he said, "I told them that you loved those biscuits with the butter just oozing out."  I said, "You did not, oh Dad."  And sure enough, I went to school and they said, "Riley do you want those biscuits with the butter oozing out today?"  I was so embarrassed, Jesus.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Artiel, Lynwood, Darlton [ph.] Haskins was his name.  I liked Darlton because he was overweight and so was I.  And I felt better around Darlton, I didn't feel so conspicuous.
Speaker 1: And who was influencing you at this time in your life?
Speaker 2: Of course, my parents.  But also a pattern emerged in my life that I began to see as a pattern and not some isolated events in which I would always get reinforcement from someone.  You're going to be special.  You're special.  Don't let anybody deter you, don't let anybody keep--and there were always teachers who did that, and teachers that I didn't think were paying attention and didn't care for me at all.  But it happened.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you wanted to do with your life at this particular time?
Speaker 2: I didn't know, I did not know.  That's not true.  I thought I wanted to be a doctor.  I thought I wanted to be a doctor.
Story_ID: 111520
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about high school now.  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Armstrong High School and in Richmond [Virginia].  There were two black high schools, Armstrong High School and Maggie Walker High School.  Ours was the better school.  There was a great rivalry between the high schools, and the people from Richmond of our vintage and before said did you go to Maggie Walker or Armstrong?  And we'd all feel equally as strong and loyal to our heritage.  We had a wonderful high school which claims Judge Spottswood Robinson, Oliver Hill, Doug Wilder [HM L. Douglas Wilder], [HM] Paul [Douglas] Freeman, symphony orchestra conductor.  I mean you name it.  It was a very fine, fine school.  And we're very proud of it.  Max Robinson, whose sister Jewel is a very good friend of mine.  Randall Robinson, whose father Max, he taught at the school.  (Unclear) Randall Robinson, TransAfrica.  So, it was very special and we all felt privileged to be a part of that school.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your experiences like in high school?  What kinds of courses were you interested in taking, that you like the best, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Right, we had a tracking system, and I think of my first year in high school--first of all let me just add that my brother [David L. Temple, Jr.], who's two years older, was a junior when I got there, and he told me, "When you see me--you're coming to Armstrong tomorrow." He told me, "When you see me in the hall, do not speak to me."  I said, "Fine."  He was starting a second language. I was taking my first foreign language, which was German and so we were in the same class.  And I outperformed him every single time.  He tried to cheat off my paper, I wouldn't let him.  He sat right behind me in class.  It was dreadful having your brother sit right behind you in class. We still talk about Frau Wintermueller [ph.], our teacher.  And we would always speak German at home, which was wonderful.  She was a great teacher.  I remember, we had a tracking system so I went--we started with like maybe twenty or thirty kids in the top track, and by the end of high school, I was going to class with the same eight kids.  And they've all done very well.  And it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 111521
Speaker 1: It was wonderful.
Speaker 2: What kinds of activities were you involved in?
Speaker 1: Drama, orchestra, I played the clarinet, started on the clarinet, and spent a brief period with the saxophone because you needed more saxophones in the marching band, which I hated marching band. I couldn't wait for concert season.  It was loathsome to me to walk around playing an instrument.  I never remembered the music so I began to just fake it.  I played the tenor sax for a long time in marching band, went back to the clarinet, but my love, I played the bassoon for a bit, but my love was the oboe, so I played the oboe in high school.  But I was good at drama, and I loved it because it gave me a sense of self-confidence.  I felt awkward moving most of the time, walking around I felt awkward.  I didn't realize that all kids at that age feel awkward, just crossing a room.
Speaker 2: And did you feel awkward because you were a little overweight?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Awkward because I was overweight, because I knew that I had a little bit of sashay, you know, and if I showed it too much people would laugh, but I was voted the best actor in my high school class, as was my brother two years before.  We were very good at that.  My mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] was our harshest critic.  I remember one time starring in this play, an Easter play and I was at a moment of redemption.  I was to be on my hands and knees and crying and I remember looking up to see if the curtain had closed and my mother rushing backstage after the play and she said, "You were wonderful, but you ruined it, you ruined the whole thing the moment you ruined it when you look out at the audience."  Anyway, but we liked that very much, and our parents were very supportive of it.  And my father [David L. Temple, Sr.] never really came to see me until I had the starring role, which I loved.
Speaker 2: Tell me about that.  What year was it?
Speaker 1: My senior year, and I had run for student body president.  I lost badly.  I was not popular in high school.  I was not popular at all, not simply because I did--but because I was so different.  And relative to most of the kids, we were fairly well off.  We were not well off in an absolute sense, not by any stretch of the imagination, but we were so, there was a little--all my teachers would say there was a little jealousy there and, you know, I lost badly and, you know, I felt kin- it was the worst defeat of my life, I thought.  And so I lost to this big old bruising football player, ooooh.  In any event, I was chief justice in the student court, which was fine.  And which made me feel better because I was head of another branch of government.  And I did well in high school.  I was number two in my class.  Of course I still resent the woman who was number one.  My godson, Adam, said to her one time when he was introduced, Artiel's [Artiel White] son, said, "Adam, this is Jackie Harris.  She was number one in our high school class."  And Adam said, "Oh, you're the one that Riley said took all the easy courses."  I said, "You did not, you did not say that to her."  This was when I like forty years old, he did this.  Anyway, so I was always resentful that I was not number one, but it was fine.  And my senior year, I starred in this play.  I played a horrible man, but it was a great role and I could chew the scenery, you know.  And so I came up for the curtain call, I got a standing ovation from people who I know did not like me at all, which is wonderful, was affirming what all the teachers said, "You see, you see, it's okay." And I came out on the stage to take my curtain call and I don't care how many people stood up to give me a standing ovation, the image I remember was a silhouette of my father in the door.  Seeing this, and it meant everything in the world to me.  And I remember it as being a supremely satisfying moment in my life.
Story_ID: 111522
Speaker 1: And at this time in your life, were you thinking about going to college and thinking about--?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was clear, yeah.  I had already been admitted to college.  You know in those days of segregation, what happened was that colleges and universities in the northeast would make visits through the segregated high schools to look for and try to recruit promising black students.  At that time, negro students, a term that I don't object to by the way.  And, and so colleges would come by--I had a teacher who was a guidance counselor when I was in ninth grade, would say, "I'm gonna start you kids early talking to colleges and universities."  One of the first colleges that came through, there were two that came through that she exposed us to.  One was Franklin Marshall College in [Lancaster] Pennsylvania.  The other was Lafayette College [Easton, Pennsylvania].  A man named George Watson interviewed me ninth grade, tenth grade, eleventh grade, and twelfth grade.  When I applied to colleges I--I don't remember how many I applied, but I think I applied to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], Wesleyan [University, Middletown, Connecticut], Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina], Lafayette, Franklin and Marshall.  I got into all of them except Wesleyan which was where I really wanted to go, so I thought, but my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] and father [David Lorenzo Temple] were very upset because the fellow who--that would take me to Wesleyan for an interview, and they said, "No, don't come up, we have somebody in Richmond [Virginia] who will interview you. He's coming through." And the guy stood me up.  So they said, "Even if you get in, you're not going."  Now my brother [David L. Temple, Jr.] and I got hold of a great scholarship to Duke.  My brother had gone to UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia], was one of the first black students at UVA.  It was a very painful experience for him.  Other people in my high school had gone to Duke.  They did not speak highly of the experience, and I wanted to get out of the South.  And so, Lafayette was the obvious choice, and so, I didn't know very much about Lafayette other than the fact that George Watson had been there every year to visit.  It was a good school and I had gotten a nice scholarship, and so I went to Lafayette.  As it turns out, it was--I see it now as a divine hand that sent me there.  As I look back on the arc of my life and my relationship to that institution, it was meant to be, and no matter what would have happened, it would have been Lafayette.  I'm not a fatalist.  I don't believe that our fate is mapped out for us, but I do think that we are guided by a divine being and I was guided by a divine being to go to Lafayette College.
Speaker 1: What does your parents think about your decision to go to Lafayette?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [David L. Temple, Sr.], who had--was an almost fifty-year employee of North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, based in Durham [North Carolina], wanted me at Duke.  I had more money from Duke.  He had to pay some to send me to Lafayette, but I had more money at Duke.  He wanted me to go to Duke.  But it was our decision, it's my decision, and he said, "If that's where you want to go, that's where you'll go.  You'll go to Lafayette," and so that's what happened.
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking you would study at Lafayette?
Speaker 2: By that time, I had disabused myself of the notion that I would become a doctor.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because I had worked, my father had gotten me a job at MCV Hospital [Medical College of Virginia, now Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center].  The only job they had was one of sweeping floors which, of course, I loathed, didn't like that, you know.  I worked there for two weeks, hated every minute of it.  I called him up one day, I said, "Daddy, I quit my job. Come get me."  He said, "I'll come get you after lunch."  I said, "Fine."  I came back, he was standing in the door and he said, "I got your job back for you."  I said, "I don't want this job, I don't want it, do you understand me?  I hate this hospital."  I realized I didn't like being around illness.  It depressed me.  I was very depressed.  And so I stopped it, and when I went to Lafayette I didn't know what I was going to major in at all.  Ultimately, I became an American Studies major; we called it American Civilization at the time.
Story_ID: 111523
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Temple, let's talk about your years at Lafayette [College, Easton, Pennsylvania].  What were they like?
Speaker 2: You know, they were years of change.  From 1967 to '71 [1971], when I got to Lafayette, it was all-male.  And, you know, it was, three, two years after the passing of the Voting Rights Act of '65 [1965] and four after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, you know I would question white students about the Civil Rights Act, you know, some would say, "Well, we're not political," you know, and it was so central to our lives, and it was a shock to me to see that it was merely one aspect of politics to them.  And it was a little odd because, you know, in the South, while the races did not mix, we knew each other, and I kind of shattered their stereotypes and they didn't know what to make of me at all.  And I remember when we were, my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] and father [David L. Temple, Sr.] and my brother [David L. Temple, Jr.] and I were unpacking in my room, and getting ourselves ready, and listening out in the hall, and I knew it was my roommate coming down the hall, and he said, "Well he looks like his picture."  I said "Ooh."  And, and I guess my first year could be--I did well my first year, better than anybody else on my floor.  And, much to their surprise, this young black kid coming from segregated schools in Richmond [Virginia], but they didn't know about, you know, that when you segregate black people, you get excellence, which is a whole 'nother different topic.  And one guy turned to me, because I was still fairly big, he said, "You know, I thought you were here on a football scholarship until I saw you walk down the hall."  I said--now he found a way to insult me several different ways in the same sentence.  You know that was really rather clever.  I come to admire him for it actually because it was so clever.  And I remember to this day of actual when the students, this was oral history in Lafayette, that was the quote that one of the quotes he pulled out of my oral history.  "I thought you were here on a football scholarship until I saw you walk down the hall, and I knew that couldn't possibly be."  But the-let me tell you why I liked La- There was years of change, the war came, came, you know, we said, the Vietnam War and Cambodia, and everybody came politicized, the black students started on their thing.  Of course, I was always a little bit different.  I was president of a predominantly Jewish fraternity [Pi Lambda Phi], and I remember going to a meeting of the black students one evening, and raising my hand to say something while I was president of this predominantly Jewish fraternity, he said, "Halt, halt, let the king of the Jews speak!" you know.  Honestly I lost my footing, but I could not come to say what I wanted to say, but we went co-ed so women came my senior year and I realized what I missed a lot in college was having women friends.  And that is unnatural and unhealthy to segregate the genders at that point in their lives.  It was just, just makes no sense.  I saw much that led the objectification of women and horrible things.  Women have a civilizing effect on men, and it is a good thing.  But, in any event, that began to change at the college.  But what I loved most was my emotional and intellectual growth.  I realized that as much as love my family, that, you know, we, there were big personalities in my family.  My mother and my father and my brother were all big personalities, and I was a shrinking violet in the family.  I was quiet.  I was reticent, I was more contemplative, more studious, more academic, and when I went away to college, you know, that became a premium and so I began to flower in college, you know, running for office and winning, and getting the respect of people, and I realized that, you know, maybe I do have a little something going on.
Story_ID: 111524
Speaker 1: How did you become the president of a predominantly Jewish fraternity [Pi Lambda Phi]?  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, that became a pattern, too, because it seems that whatever I get myself involved in, I wind up in some kind of leadership position.  Don't ask me why.  But it just happens.  And sometimes I wish it didn't.  I think sometimes I can't get pregnant because I don't know how to say no.  You know, but it's, but that's how it went.  I first began as a commissar, which is the dreadful job because you have to feed people and be in charge of the food and the feeding the people and no one ever likes the food, ever.  Horrible job, and then, morphed into the presidency of the institution, which is a very interesting fraternity actually.
Speaker 1: And did you feel like while at Lafayette people were a little bit more accepting of you and your differences?  Did you feel that way opposed to high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can tell you one moment of dread when I--well, I had had some experience.  I went one year, my brother had gone the prior year to a summer science institute at Bennett College in [Greensboro] North Carolina.  It was put on by the National Science Foundation [NSF] for talented black youth, Negro youth, and to this day remains the most academic and rigorous program that I had ever been in, but there I experienced no put downs whatsoever.  The premium was how smart are you?  And whether or not you can hang with us intellectually.  That was the-and I loved it, loved every minute of it so I knew that when I got into the higher academic environment, that it would be the same.  I came back from the--we had open fraternity houses, open visitation, and I came in and one guy down the hall, Steve (unclear), came to me and he said, "Riley, you know they really liked you at Pi Lamb [Pi Lambda Phi]," which was the fraternity house I ultimately went to, "But you know, they thought that your handshake was a little fay." And I said, "Oh God, here we go, here we go," but nothing after that, nothing after that.
Speaker 1: And, tell me a little bit about how you made the decision to go to law school once you graduated.
Speaker 2: In this predominately Jewish fraternity, which is a remarkable place.
Speaker 1: The name of the fraternity?
Speaker 2: Pi Lambda Phi, which is the Sigma chapter, which no longer exists.  It was the chapter which hosted its first black president of any predominately white chapter in America and the first black president was Leonard Jeffries, who was dismissed not long ago from CCNY [City College of the City University of New York (CUNY)] because of his anti-Semitic views, which is a real irony.  We had a reunion last year in New York of some of the people there, a remarkable group of people, and it, it slanted my view of the Lafayette [University, Easton, Pennsylvania] experience and how different it was from everybody else's because we had such high achievers for two semesters in a row.  The average GPA in the fraternity was 3.8, and most of the people there were either going on to law school, medical school or dental school.  And this people today, the CEO of Snapple [Michael Weinstein], formerly of PepsiCo; groundbreaking researcher in child psychiatry; the world's greatest retina detachment surgeon, Harvey Topilow; the Executive Director of the Smithsonian Museum of American History, Brent Glass. We were all in that fraternity together.  It was a remarkable place.  And I didn't really know what I wanted to do after college, but I knew that I had done well in college, I could probably get into law school and that's what I decided to do 'cause I really didn't have anything else better to do.
Story_ID: 111525
Speaker 1: And where did you decide to go to law school?
Speaker 2: I applied to several places--Georgetown Law School [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.]--applied at several places, and, of course, The University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] was among them because it was cheap.  It was my state school, but my brother [David L. Temple, Jr.] had gotten into graduate school there and I realized Charlottesville was not big enough for the two of us.  So, and after being at Lafayette [College, Easton, Pennsylvania], I wanted a city, so I came to Georgetown.
Speaker 1: So in your first year of law school there are some courses that everyone has to take.  Tell me of those courses the--property, civil procedure, which one did you like the best and why?
Speaker 2: Surprisingly enough, I liked property, and because I've always considered myself an old soul, and the property laws go back and probably are the most ancient and unchanged over the course of time because no one really wants to put a cloud on anybody's title.  So I found it fascinating, and, but the ritual of passing seisin which taking a clump a dirt and passing it from one owner to the other was just fabulous to me in history.  But also because of a little quirk that happened.  When we got there, I was in section four, section six.  There were six sections of a hundred each.  The class was six hundred strong and I was at the end because the last name T, S through Z was the last section, and all the black students who were older came to me and said you got to get out of that section because Don Wallace [Sr.] teaches Property.  He flunked four of the five students in that section last year.  This was before affirmative action.  Only five students in a section of a hundred.  And I said, I'm not gonna be, let that man intimidate me, you know.  He has not met me.  I'm going to stay in that class and I'm going to do well.  Well, if you want to be able to get attention and you're the only black face in the sea of white faces, which is what happened, I was the only black person, but actually there was Gloria Sutton, but she was so light-skinned, nobody knew.  And, you know, because when the professor looks up and he, at the time, he looks around the room, he's going to call the person who catches his eye, and my eye got caught all, and Don Wallace called on me all the time, which I recall in other classes, meant that I was always prepared because I was intimidated into not being prepared and I did well, and so I liked property, and so, the other course I took in law school that I loved was tax, and it would surprise me because it's all public policy.  You change people's behavior because of things that you want to encourage.  You let people deduct interest on their mortgages because you want to encourage homeownership, things like that.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.] in the early '70s [1970s], as an African American?  What were your experiences like then?
Speaker 2: We were fairly rare and at that time, and you know, it really, it's interesting that in law school, race became less of an issue in law school than in undergraduate school, because first of all, we had a-it's a commuter school.  People did not live on a campus.  And people had other things going on.  Some of us worked while we were in law school, which I did as well after my first year, and people were dispersed.  And so it really wasn't a cohesive community, and so, you know, everybody just focused on the work.  So it was odd.  It was kind of odd in a way.
Speaker 1: And what was it like being in Washington, D.C. at that time?
Speaker 2: Loved it.  And I knew that there was Washington that I want to be a part of, but could not yet either know about or afford because I was in school.  And law school was all-consuming.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about some of your professors in law school.  Who, did you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, of course I did.  His name is Steve Newman [ph.], who's now a part of Williams & Connolly [LLP], and nicely for me.  You know all those students that he taught over the course of time, I mean I see him on the street today and he can still call my name, which is nice.  He taught me the first year, criminal procedure and criminal process, or criminal law and process, or something like that.  And, fascinating man, brilliant man, and I enjoyed every single moment of his class.
Story_ID: 111526
Speaker 1: Okay, now let's begin to talk about your professional career a little bit.  Upon graduating from law school [at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], you went to PBS [Public Broadcasting Service]?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.  Corporation for Public Broadcasting [CPB].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, I'm sorry, and that was in 1974?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about what the culture was like at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting back then.
Speaker 2: First of all, I was not going to start at CPB.  What happened was that I had the job at the Federal Trade Commission [FTC] where I had worked when I was in law school, and it was a nice job, a very nice job, but the law professor for whom I had worked while I was in law school, called me up and he said, "I know you are going to the FTC, you have this job, but this wonderful job just opened up and I think you'll love it.  Why don't you go for the interview?" And I did, and I did like it.  The culture was that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was a private corporation.  It was established by Congress, what I called to take away the governmental taint of money to support public broadcasting.  I called it a heat shield to protect the First Amendment right of broadcasters because it was taking all this government money.  CPB would launder the money of governmental taint and pass it on.  And it was a small office and interestingly enough, a lot of people in the public broadcasting community had no respect for CPB because [President] Richard Nixon, having just been impeached and having resigned--didn't get impeached, he resigned before he got impeached--had stacked the board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting with similar people and told them to not fund public affairs programs, so no one trusted CPB.  And I stepped into the middle of that and--but I stayed there for three years.  It was a wonderful new job, a good job.  I got to do some political work and (unclear) lobby for changes to our statute, met some nice people and began to lay me a foundation for my future in communications.
Story_ID: 111527
Speaker 1: And how, and what did you do next after that and what year was it?
Speaker 2: It was 1970, the end of 1976, '77 [1977], I'm sorry, in which I went to work for [U.S.] Senator Charles Mathias, a Republican of Maryland, which began my career in earnest as a Republican.  I don't regret it.  I'm not a Republican anymore, for the record.  And, I came to my senses, I say to the camera.  And, but he was a liberal Republican, a wonderful man, and I did his Senate Judiciary Committee work and then he had me do this Governmental Affairs Committee because he was working on the reform of civil service, the high point of that for me was being called to the White House and being told by President Jimmy Carter to let his bill [the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978] go.  That was a highlight.  And then because I was so difficult in carrying out my bosses' instructions, he represented a lot of civil servants. Jimmy Carter ran on revamping the civil service and getting rid of all these people.  You know, we, of course, did not want him to do that.  Hence, when they finally got a deal, they did not invite me to the signing ceremony at the White House.  A slight I haven't forgotten.
Speaker 1: And, Senator Mathias was also a huge environmentalist--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and did some very significant work on the Chesapeake Bay--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in that at all?
Speaker 2: No, but, of course, we were all very close in those offices sitting on top of one another.  Marian Mars was his environmental person and she did remarkable work, and Monica Healy also did work for him on his environmental stuff.  It's fine.  I did a lot of the Civil Liberties Judiciary Committee work, which was really quite wonderful.
Speaker 1: Just to go back a few steps.  How did you make the transition from CPB [Corporation for Public Broadcasting] to going to work on the [Capitol] Hill?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a lawyer working in my office, John [H.] Bayly, who is now a judge in the D.C. Superior Court.  I came back from the holiday and he said, "By the way, you said you're interested in working on The Hill [Capitol Hill]. I have a friend who Senator Mathias' Chief of Staff, Bob Kelley and he is looking for someone to be Senator Mathias' Judiciary Committee counsel.  Would you be interested in doing that?"  I said, "Absolutely," and so that's how it happened. It kind of fell in my lap.
Speaker 1: And how did you like working on The Hill?
Speaker 2: Loved it.  It's a lot of fun, met a lot of interesting people, a lot of famous people, and working in the United States Senate suited me greatly.  It was a body of one hundred and those were the days that the Senate was rather courtly and nice.  People were nice to each other.
Story_ID: 111528
Speaker 1: And so from there, in 1978 to 1980, you went to work for RCA?
Speaker 2: RCA Global Communications.  I wanted to get back to communications, and also wanted to live in New York [New York].  And I don't quite remember how I got that job, but I got it, and I went to RCA Globcom.  Hated RCA Globcom. Hated the job.  They did not like me.  The first time in my life that I experienced blatant racism.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: When I walked in one day wearing a navy blue blazer and a dark pair of gray trousers and I was always impeccably dressed I thought.  This little twerp of a guy came to me and he said, "You know your pants don't match your jacket."  I said, "I know that."  And he said--so I said, "I wonder what that's all about." And I went on and I said, "Is there a problem?"  And he said, "Well, I don't think anybody is going to say anything to you about wearing a navy blue blazer and dark gray trousers, but make sure you don't come in in any of your flowered shirts or anything."  I said, "Okay."  I said, "Let me tell you something, if it's good enough for the United States Senate, it's good enough for RCA," and I turned around and walked away, and, at some point these guys would, on a daily basis--other lawyers in the office--would go out to lunch together.  They never asked me once, not once.  One day my boss gave me an assignment, it was late at night and I turned around and he said, "Riley, when I give you an assignment, I want you to run, you understand me? Run."  And I said, "You got the wrong guy."  One time late at night he came into my office--we were talking about a case--and as he turned around and walked out, he said over his shoulder, walking down the hall, "And get married!"  All of that being said, I loved living in New York.  It was also the time, though, that I began to drink problematically, heavily.  And sometimes I wonder why I'm still alive.
Speaker 1: Was it because of a lot of the struggles you were facing?
Speaker 2: No, I think I have an addictive personality, and didn't come to terms with my alcoholism until 1983 when I got sober, and have been sober--month, day at a time--for twenty-one years, and--but it was a breaking point for me because a woman--I began--said to the woman I noticed that she drank--she did not drink, and it was very deliberate.  Mind you, this was also the woman who gave me the formula for running marathons, which I began to do as well, but she kind of changed me in a way.  And, and she said, she was--I said, "You know, liquor doesn't hang out in my home."  She said, "What do you mean?"  I said, "If it's there, I drink it."  And she said, "Do you think you have a problem with alcohol?"  And I said, "Yeah, I do."  And she said, "Well let me bring you some questions." And I answered the questions and I--it became clear from the questions that I was an alcoholic, and she said, "Well, stop drinking."  And I said, "Well, I'm not going to."  And she said, "Why?"  I said, "I like it."  And she said, "You just haven't gotten into enough trouble yet."  That hung over me like a Sword of Damocles.  But, in any event--but I loved living in New York.  I met interesting men that I dated, I discovered the city and I loved being a boy from segregated Richmond [Virginia] on the Upper East Side of New York and enjoying all of New York life.
Speaker 1: So why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I hated RCA so much, and I looked all over New York for another job, and I came down to a party that was given by the guy who was my boss at CPB [Corporation for Public Broadcasting].  He had opened his own law firm, and one of the people there was a fellow named Ward White, who I'd known from the Hill [Capitol Hill] the first time around, and he said [President] Ronald Reagan had just been elected and the Senate had just turned Republican and he said to me, "Are you interested in coming back to Washington [D.C.]? I think I have a job for you."  I said, "Really?"  I said, "What job?"  And he said, "I'll call you Monday morning." And I said, "Fine."  So he called Monday morning and he said, "Would you like to be the Telecommunications Counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee?"  I said, "Are you kidding?"  I said, "In a heartbeat."  The reason I liked it so much was because my--the people at RCA Globcom were lobbying that committee to try to keep that committee from doing a bill that would damage the company, and, and the people in Washington at RCA Globcom said, "Bring Riley down to help him lobby because he knows all these people," and they said, "No, no, no, it's too important, we can't have Riley do it, it's too important."  When I got that job, I went to him, I said, "By the way, Frank"--my boss--I said, "I have a new job."  He said, "Oh really, what are you going to be doing?"  Over my shoulder, I said, "I'm going to be counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee, Telecomm Subcommittee." And he said, "What?"  I said, "Yeah."  And he said, "Well, oh well, congratulations."  One of another supremely satisfying moments for me, that moment.  When I got to work on the Hill, one of the people that I had to work with was [Senator] Barry Goldwater--which was another interesting story, I won't go into all that--but Barry Goldwater said to me, "I need you to introduce that bill that blah, blah, blah, blah," and this is the bill we've been fighting all the time.  First thing I had to do was introduce that bill, repeal that section of the act, and introduced it and those people, and it was (clap, clap, clap, clap).
Story_ID: 111529
Speaker 1: Anyway--
Speaker 2: And during that time, that was from 1980 to 1983, you were also a Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] lecturer?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 1: I was invited to the Kennedy School to give a couple of lectures.  It was an endowed lecturer named in memory of Oliver Cromwell Cox.  Don't ask me about who he was, I don't know.  And, but I participated on a panel once with Percy Sutton, and I can't remember who else, but anyway, it was wonderful.  It was wonderful.  You know the Kennedy School, seeing all the people there talking about telecommunications policy.  It was great, it was great.
Story_ID: 111530
Speaker 1: And from there you went on into private practice in 1985?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Bell Company [AT&T] was split up.  This was before you were born.  It was split up in 1982, while I was on the Hill [Capitol Hill], and in 1984 I went to work for an organization called Bell Communications Research which was designed to, to, for the seven Bell companies that were created after the breakup, to have a central core (unclear) among their legislative operation.  It quickly became clear they didn't want that done.  I went to Ivan Seidenberg at NYNEX [Corporation], and Ivan is now the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Verizon [Wireless].  And he was at Washington [D.C.] at the time and he said--I said, "Ivan, I want to work at NYNEX."  He said, "If you came over, they'd have to split my job."  I wish he'd offer that to me now.  But he said, "Have you ever thought of going into private practice?" And I said, "Well, no, I haven't really."  And he said, "If you go into private practice, you'll have NYNEX as a client."  I said, "Great."  I didn't realize what, how God had smiled on me at that moment.  But God had smiled on me at that moment, and it proved to be a, the breakthrough in my career, the big breakthrough, to come out with a Fortune 50 client that way.  I went into a small telecomm firm, Fletcher, Heald & Hildreth, then another partner and I left there to go to a large firm, Kattis and Felzer [ph.] which several months later dissolved in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  It was an L.A.-based firm and I had to scramble to get someplace else.  Very bad period in my life.  Overcame it.  Came through it and landed at the Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand [now DLA Piper LLP] where I stayed for about seven years as a partner on the hiring committee, and then I, I left.
Speaker 1: And went where?
Speaker 2: Well, the process by which I left there is an interesting one.  What I liked about being in private practice was the addition of the ownership of your own business.  What I resented was that, at the end of the year I had to go before a committee to determine how much I was going to take out of the business.  And, for long--I had helped a guy one time named Aubrey Sarvis  who had had difficulty getting a job.  He ultimately became an officer of Bell Atlantic.  I was representing NYNEX.  He called me and said, "I don't forget people who helped me.  I want to give you some business from Bell Atlantic, but you know you do all this work for NYNEX, can you find somebody else to put it on to be the billing partner?"  So I went to the guy named Lloyd Hand, who had been [President] Lyndon Johnson's secret [chief of] protocol, and very social in Washington.  His wife [Ann Hand] is, you know, a big jewelry designer.  I said, "Well let me see if Lloyd wants to do the gig," but Lloyd screwed me.  And gave me nothing and Aubrey complained as a client, "This guy, this guy doesn't know our business.  Why do you have him here?"  And finally I said, "You can do something about this.  It means at least fifty thousand dollars a year to me in income that you have not said something about this." And finally he said, "I'll take care of it," and when he did all hell broke loose.  Lloyd went ballistic, we got into it.  He took me before the managing partner and the chairman of the firm.  Aubrey, too, is openly gay.  And he said, "Berl [Bernhard], I know why Aubrey wants to increase Riley's compensation.  I know why Aubrey wants to feather Riley's bed.  But you and I have to go the Chairman of Bell Atlantic to let him know that Aubrey Sarvis is putting his relationship with Riley Temple over the interests of the corporation."  I said, "Lloyd, you don't know the business, they don't want you there."  And he said, "You are a liar."  I turned to my partner who'd been working on the case and knew that I wasn't lying, and I said, "Larry, am I lying?"  He said, "Well, I don't know," you know.  I said, "Thank you, Larry."  I said, "Lloyd, I hope I never get so desperate for a dollar that I could stoop that low."  We came up with a compromise.  He got the first hundred thousand [dollars] of the client and I took everything over that.  When I left a year and a half later to form my own firm, I took all of the Bell Atlantic business with me.  After that meeting, the chairman of the firm and the managing partner came into my office and closed the door and thanked me for not hitting him.
Speaker 1: And so you opened, you started your own firm in what year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when I--1993 and as I walked out Verner Liipfert, Berl who always, always wanted back at Vernon Liipfert said, "It's been difficult with Lloyd [Hand]."  I said, "Lloyd thought that he had in front of him a nigger faggot boy.  He had the wrong guy."
Speaker 1: The wrong guy.  And you continued to operate your own practice today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I opened our own firm, actually, we had started it earlier, but I took a little longer to get myself out of that situation, so they had done all the difficult work and I kind of waltzed right in.  And, which is great and I haven't looked back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111531
Speaker 1: You've been vindicated so many times.  That's got to--how does that make you feel?  That's gotta make you feel good.
Speaker 2: Well you know I, you know I, I'm reminded and I was reminded then [1993] as I walked out of that firm [Vernon, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, now DLA Piper LLP] and with those clients with me, of the twenty-third Psalm, "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies" [Psalm 23:5]. And, as I grow older I realize how--more and more, how God has blessed me beyond all measure and I never understood as a boy, as a young man, why people would go to church on Sunday morning and want to get up and shout, but I do.  I mean, I understand that, why people want to shout.
Speaker 1: In addition to your illustrious professional career, you are also very active in community, very active in the arts.  How did your community involvement come about?
Speaker 2: Fairly slowly.  I--when I came back to Washington [D.C.] and, you know, a couple of years later, in 1983, I decided that I would, needed to go to AA [Alcoholics Anonymous], and the second meeting I went to was a gay AA meeting and in walks Jim Graham, a man I had known in law school, and had run into on the Hill [Capitol Hill], who had worked for Abe Ribicoff [Abraham Ribicoff] .  And, and he said, "What are you doing here, you're here for yourself?"  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "How long have you been coming to AA?"  I said, "Well about a week." And he said--I said, "What about you, are you here for yourself?" And he said, "Yes," he said how long--I said, "How long you been coming?"  He said, "Five years," and that's--he became my sponsor in AA.  Jim, who is now on the city council [Council of the District of Columbia], became the executive director of what was then the Whitman-Walker Clinic.  Before that he was a voluntary president and he said to me, "Now we need to get you involved in the clinic.  I know you come from a history of community involvement.  I know your family was always involved in the community.  You're doing nothing in town.  Get on our board."  I can't tell you the number of people who told me because Whitman-Walker is associated with AIDS at the time.  This was the early days of the [HIV/AIDS] crisis, that "this is very expensive for you Riley, but don't do it, don't you do it.  It's too expensive.  You've got this career" and blah, blah, blah, blah, but let me tell you, I felt God's pleasure from the moment I walked in that door, and I--the clinic used me to gain entry to a part of Washington with which they were unfamiliar.  And that's what I did when I became a member of the board of the clinic.  We were in public policy territory, pioneers.  We didn't know where we were going or what we were doing, but, I became the treasurer of the clinic in 1984 when we had an annual budget of $300,000, and when I stepped down as president, we had a budget then of about $15 million, and now its's $26 million.
Speaker 1: How, how many years was that you stepped down as president?
Speaker 2: In '92, in 1992.
Speaker 1: Less than ten years?
Speaker 2: Less than ten years.  Millions of dollars because we built the organization with--Jim Tyson was saying, and he was quite right, it was like building, constructing the ship at sea under sail in the middle of a storm and under assault.  And it was a remarkable journey and I can tell you the moment I started doing that--the reason I said I felt God's pleasure, was because doors started opening for me like I've never known.  I went to accept and convey a [Daily] Point of Light award at the White House.  We had [First Lady] Barbara Bush at the clinic to open a--demonstrations of course--to open a day care center, one of the volunteers was also a member of the board of Arena Stage [regional theater, Washington, D.C.], and she introduced me to Arena Stage.  It's how I got involved with Arena Stage, and that's how my time of the arts began to happen.
Speaker 1: And your involvement with Arena Stage includes?
Speaker 2: I was, I began as president of the board, and just after my term as president, I chaired the search committee to bring on the current artistic director, Molly Smith.
Story_ID: 111532
Speaker 1: It also--AIDS--let me also tell you that my college [Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania] invited me back to speak because they had read about my involvement with AIDS [HIV/AIDS] in the Richmond [Virginia] newspaper, and I didn't tell my parents that I was coming out, but it did come out and they were in shock.  My father [David L. Temple, Sr.] called me.  Richmond did a big article on me about me chairing the board of Whitman-Walker [Clinic].  My father [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] called me one evening and he said, "You're the man of the hour."  I said, "What do you mean?"  And he said, "The picture in the paper," and he said--because he was an old newspaper man--he said, "There's a teaser on the front and then the jump page has a half page picture of you with this article.  Let me read it to you."  And he read it to me from beginning to end.  Now the words gay and lesbian had never--or homosexuality--had never crossed my father's lips to me ever.  He read the entire story.  At the end of it, he said, "I am so proud of you."  I said, "Thank you."  I told him how much it meant to me.  I said, "Is mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] okay?"  He said, "No, she's crying, but that's all right, she'll understand.  She doesn't understand that, but she will, don't worry about it."
Speaker 2: Did she come to understand?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  When, after daddy died, and she sold the house in Richmond, and she moved here.  I made her a part of my life and we went everywhere in town and she knew then that it was okay, that it was good.  Boy, that took that out of me, that story. In any event, I was invited back, they had gotten, Lafayette had gotten a copy of that article. They ran it in the Lafayette Alumni News.  They invited me back for the AIDS quilt, to make a speech.  I gave a speech in which I talked not about the people who were remembered there, but the people who were not remembered because of stigma.  And that they were helping to stop the stigma and, even if I do say so myself, it was a very good speech and I felt the inspiration.  When I got back to Lafayette, the first time I had been back since I graduated, they converted my old fraternity house into an inn, which was not lovely when we lived there, but now it's quite lovely.  And she said, "When you go upstairs you make a right and you blah, blah, blah, blah at the top of the stairs."  And I said, "Oh my God, I think I'm going to go to my old room," and I went to the top of the stairs and went right to my old room, and I had to sit down and catch my breath because who would have thought that I would have come back here when I spent some summers in Lafayette when I was a junior and senior, during my junior and senior year, and the summer after my senior year, I would sit and listen to the Beatles' 'Long and Winding Road' and I knew that I would be back and the long and winding road took me back because of AIDS and my work as a member of the gay community.  It was profound to me and it laid the groundwork for my becoming a member of the Board of Trustees at the college.  But, in any event, but Arena Stage was wonderful for me--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Let's go--
Story_ID: 111533
Speaker 1: Let's go back to the college [Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania] for a second--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because in addition to that you also have endowed a scholarship there.  Can you tell me a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did a capital campaign, which we raised $213 million, forty percent of which came from the board, and they're (unclear) like me.  But they came to me initially and they said--it's a good thing they told me how much money they wanted out of me because it allowed me to faint in front of those people as opposed to fainting in front of the president of the college, when they asked me for 100,000 dollars.  Nobody had ever asked me for that kind of money before, and I didn't know whether they had the nerve to think that if I had that money that I could give it to them, but you know, we worked it out and ultimately, I increased my pledge and and I ultimately gave them about $275,000, but, but they worked with me and came up with an idea, they said "You're interested in performing arts?"  This was after my father [David L. Temple, Sr.] had died and I said, "Why don't I do, you know"--I knew that the students at Lafayette, that the financial aid did not cover study abroad, and we had a big study abroad program, and I was also interested in the performing and visual arts (unclear) and so we came up with this idea of having an endowment fund, in which I could have a visiting lecture series in Africana Studies, and that I could take a portion of the money as well and establish a fund for students to study abroad who could not ordinarily go, with a preference to minority students.  And just shortly after that my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] celebrated her eightieth birthday, and I announced the creation of both of those endowment funds that they were named in the memory of David L. Temple, Sr. and in honor of Helen J. Temple, both [the David L., Sr. and Helen J. Temple Visiting Lecture Series Fund and the David L., Sr. and Helen J. Temple Study Abroad Fund].  And my mother got to see some of the return.  Some of the students would write to her and send her pictures.  One guy who wrote and sent her a picture of his trip to Africa, which is really wonderful, and that was my eightieth birthday gift to my mother.  And now they're both there in their memory.
Story_ID: 111534
Speaker 1: How did you develop your love for the theater?
Speaker 2: Well first of all my parents, because as I said, my father [David L. Temple, Sr.] always wanted us [Temple and his brother, David L. Temple, Jr.] front and center.  We were always on our feet in front of audiences doing something or other and my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] loved the stage and she loved the theater and she was tickled pink when we acted in high school.  And she loved the fact that we both were musicians, and she played the piano, and so it was very important-and then we both sang, and she was a singer as well in her youth.  And she--it was just a part of our being.  It was so important and so my return to Arena Stage was like a duck to water.  I was home.
Speaker 1: And tell me about the current theater project that you are working on [True Colors Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know when I was on the search committee to find a new artistic director-chaired the search committee to find a new artistic director for Arena Stage, one of the two finalists--there were four finalists, but two of the people, one was Molly Smith, who got the job.  The second one was [HM] Kenny Leon, who was African American, the first African American to run a major theater, the Alliance Theater in Atlanta [Georgia].  He was actually my candidate for the job, but you know, the interview didn't quite work out well, and you know, now again, I see the hand of God in all of this, and Molly is there.  She's doing well.  I'm happy about that, but Kenny would direct in Washington [D.C.], we became friends and one time when he was back directing at Arena Stage and I had always bemoaned the fact that Washington and the United States did not have a theater company, an African American theater company of high artistic merit.  And it was a shame, and shameful.  And I said, "But Kenny, you are the person who can help us do this."  He thought about it for a little bit.  He called me up, "Let's do it." And it's a high wire act.  Frank Raines [Franklin Delano Raines] of Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage Association] said to me, "To start a theater company at a time like this is kind of gutsy and it takes courage."  And I said, "Uh-uh, Frank, it's crazy."  You know, I'm sitting here sweating and two weeks and $250,000 a week, so that we can cast him in Langston Hughes's 'Tambourines to Glory,' but I think we'll do it.  Kenny had just finished directing a revival of 'A Raisin in the Sun' [by Lorraine Hansberry] on Broadway with P. Diddy [Sean Combs] and Audrey [sic, Audra] McDonald and Phylicia Rashad, who he's worked with many times, which we were very proud of, and someone came in the other day with People magazine.  For the record, I don't read People.  And in there, there was an issue of the "50 Most Beautiful People," and in it was Kenny Leon.  You know, I said, "I don't know how to act around you.  You're one of the fifty most beautiful people in the world."  And he said, "What we'll do is that in the lobby we'll sign tambourines for people for 'Tambourines for Glory.' [by Langston Hughes]" And I said, "Uh-uh, sign the picture, autograph the picture."  And so we're gonna do this.  We've done two performances, two plays.  We did August Wilson's 'Fences,' and then we did 'Steel Magnolias' [by Robert Harling] and so 'Tambourines' will be the third play.
Speaker 1: So True Colors [Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia].  Tell me--so in September, you have a big production?
Speaker 2: Yes, we have our opening door, well Langston Hughes's 'Tambourines to Glory' will premier in Atlanta for the National Black Arts Festival this summer [2004], and we are doing, we are going to cast it with a Washington [D.C.] cast and open it at the Lincoln Theater [Washington, D.C.] on U Street, historic Lincoln Theater, on September 16.  And so we are very excited about that, still a high wire act however.  We don't have the money for it yet, but I guess we will.
Speaker 1: Are you confident that you will?
Speaker 2: I am never confident of anything.  That's one thing I've learned in life, I'm never really confident of anything except what has already happened.
Story_ID: 111535
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your involvement with The Duke Ellington School for the Arts [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: One of the people that I've met over the course of my lifetime has been a woman who is a force of nature.  Her name is [HM] Peggy Cooper Cafritz and she got me involved with--she formed the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, along with Mike Malone.  God, I can't remember now, like maybe thirty years ago, twenty-five, thirty years ago [in 1974], and she got me involved as a member of the board, and as a vice president, and it's wonderful.  I'm not, I'm no longer involved there.  And she's not either, she's running her school system, but for the time that I was involved there, it was absolutely wonderful because the kids are so talented, and, you know, you go into that school and people talk about our kids so badly.  But we go into that school and I don't care where you go, you turn a corner and you see two people, one playing a guitar, the other one writing.  They're working on a song of lyrics together, in a stairwell.  And they're serious about their work, disciplined about their work.  And these children who had been all over the world.  You go backstage and you see the people who have come through there, want to help them.  And I am just uplifted and buoyed every time I walk anywhere near them or see them because it's our future and I'm so happy, so happy that it exists.

Speaker 1: Let's, I know you wanted to talk a little about some of your rites of passage.  Let's talk a little bit about those, high school graduation, and others that were important to you.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I never knew how important those rituals would be until they started becoming a part of me and they were about me.  My high school graduation [from Armstrong High School, Richmond, Virginia, in 1967] was a sentimental point for me in my life because it was everything that I ever wanted it to be.  I had honors that evening and, you know, my picture was in the paper the next day and I had made my father [David L. Temple, Sr.] proud.  My mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] as well, but especially my father.  And, or college graduation [1971], and when my parents dropped me off at Lafayette [Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania], and, I never really encouraged them to visit because I was never really sure that I was doing well enough.  And sure enough, when I was in town to get my degree they came up to see me.  They had not been there since they dropped me off freshman year, and they stepped into the campus and people came up to them and said, "You must be related to Riley Temple," and they just gushed about me and my mother or father have never been happier.  Then, you know, of course in law school graduation [from Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], which they loved, and the day that I passed the bar [examination].  This was before the internet and they always published the results in the Richmond [Virginia] newspaper to the Virginia bar.  And, but you could call for the publication and get the results.  So I called in the afternoon, I had taken the exam and I'd mentioned offhandedly to my parents the day that the results were published in the paper and we'd go the day before.  And I thought everybody had forgotten about it.  So, I called the Richmond newspaper from my job at Corporation for Public Broadcasting [CPB] and I said, "I'm looking for my name."  She said, "Yes" she said, "What is it?"  I said, "Riley Temple."  She said, "Riley Temple?"  She said--I said, "Yes" and she said, "4600 South Fulmer [ph.]?"  I said, "Yes" and she said, "Passed."  I said, "Wonderful."  She said, "Oh, and Mr. Temple?"  I said, "Oh no-yes?"  She said, "Please call your father.  He's been here twice today already." (Laughs)  So he had remembered and that was another day in our lives.

Speaker 1: And then, of course, the days of their deaths.  And I was there for both of them.  My father [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] had lapsed into a coma.  By--early in the morning when I got there about noon, he was already in the coma.  He was on his way.  And he lasted until about six o'clock, but during the course of the day, you know, and I was sitting in the room with him and the times we were alone and I kept a list of all the people who had come by to see him.  And his eyes were half open and not focusing, and they said, "The hearing is the last thing to go." And so I leaned and I went to his ear and I said, "Let me read you the names of the people who have come to see you today to say goodbye."  And as I read those names, his eyes started going like this and I knew he was hearing me and how wonderful it made him feel.  And I remember the touch here to feel his pulse, but it was no longer there.  His death was profound for me and I didn't know how I was going to get through his funeral, but it was like a curtain had come down to protect me from hurt and from grief, and I was able to sit there and listen to the wonderful things that were said about him, and the church was packed.  The mayor was there, all of his men from (unclear) Beneficial Club, fifty or so men, you know parading and you know the pageantry of a black funeral.  And it was major and it was an event and I knew that he would have been very pleased with numbers and I was very happy for him. And we got through it just fine.  And then, of course, my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] moved here and we became, she was my girlfriend.  We went everywhere together, you know, and she did her best to try to prepare us for her death, and she told me before she died, she said, "You have done all the wonderful things that I could ever possibly think of."  I have a picture back there of her with [President] Bill Clinton.  I took her to the White House and she had been to the White House several times and she looked at me then, it started to rain, she looked at me, she said, "You know Michael Jordan is playing tonight, don't you?"  She didn't want to (unclear).  I said, "All right, Mom," but I knew she would meet the president that night and sure enough she did, and she was so happy.  She loved Bill Clinton.  She always said that he could put his shoes under her bed anytime.  And, and so she prepared us for her death and until two hours before her death, she was giving us instructions.  She was cremated.  She said, "Riley, remember, no casket."  I said, "I know."  She called me over one time during the course of her dying and with all of her nieces and women around her, one thing I never really appreciated in my mother's life, was that she always wanted a daughter.  And all the women in her life loved her.  And they ministered to her at the end.  And at one point she called me over and she said, "Take care of your brother [David L. Temple, Jr.]."  I said, "You know I will."  And I turned away and I said, "Shoot, I almost made it, I almost made it."  And as she began to take her last breaths, and it was clear that she was, I jumped into the bed and I held her, put my hand over her heart until it stopped, and my brother was on the other side holding her hand.  And I thought how apt at this rite of passage.  The woman who brought us here, and that we are here as she leaves us.  And after her heart stopped, all of her body, her skin shivered.  All over her body, and I knew that that's what the resurrection is all about.  Her soul left her and we watched it leave her.  And I rejoiced for her for a few days.  Then I felt real sorry for me, that I'd lost my mother.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As being kind and generous.  Mostly for generous because what I've discovered is that what your mother tells you when you're growing up and that is, when you give it away, you get it back.  I have never given anything away that I haven't gotten it back tenfold.
Story_ID: 111539
Speaker 1: And what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I've given of myself.  Nothing renews me more.  I pray every day, God please make me amusing to young people because young people around me are fulfilling to me.  They renew me.  They give me hope.
Story_ID: 111540
Speaker 1: And, are you happy with the way that you've lived your life, and is there anything that you would have done differently.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  I have one regret.  And I knew it at the moment of my father's [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] death.  And that is I never became a father.  And one- death would not be so final if there is new life around.  And the moment he died, I knew it, I said this isn't right, it's not right.  And as my brother [David Lorenzo Temple, Jr.] and I sat in my mother's [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] funeral, I sat there and my heart ached because it's not right.  It should not stop with us, but it will.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  Thank you very much, Mr. Temple.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Carey.
Story_ID: 111541
Speaker 1: Just tell us who's in the photograph.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is on the occasion of my fiftieth birthday, which I was not going to celebrate because I don't want anybody to know how old I am, but my mother [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] said she was going to give me a party and so I decided to give it myself to take control of it.  The woman on the right is Artiel Benjamin White.  She has been my friend since we were ten years old, and the other woman is Shara [ph.] Dyson Gardner.  Shara and I met each other when we were in our early teens and we'd all been friends-they're both from Richmond [Virginia].  We've been friends all these years and I am the godfather to Artiel's son, Adam.
Speaker 1: If it doesn't appear correctly in the moniter, we'll adjust it in post production.  And all you really have to say Mr. Temple is just who's in the photograph.  No, no, no, don't adjust it.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see, I see.
Speaker 1: It's just whatever fits better in the camera, and just about what year it was taken.
Speaker 2: Can I talk now?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This is taken in, I think, 1998.  It was a Mardi Gras ball that my mother and I attended here in Washington [D.C.] at the Canadian embassy.
Speaker 1: And your mother's name again?
Speaker 2: Helen [Burnette Jones Temple].
Speaker 1: This is a picture that I love.  It's an old photograph of my Aunt Maggie, with whom I was not particularly close, but it's a great picture.  And I think it was probably taken in the late 1920s.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what was your Aunt Maggie's last name?
Speaker 1: Hicks, Maggie Jones Hicks.  Actually she was married several times, but prior, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She was married often.
Speaker 2: My mother gave me this photograph.  It's the only picture of her as a child, and it's a picture of her and her brother, Malcolm, when they were children after the farm had failed and they were moving to Richmond, to move into town to get out of the dire poverty of Charles City County, Virginia, and she is about seven or eight in that picture.
Speaker 1: So, what year is that?
Speaker 2: 1920-something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my Aunt B.  This picture was probably taken in the early 1930s.  It's to my grandmother [Magnolia Cotman (ph.) Jones] and grandfather [Thomas Wyatt Jones], to mom and dad it says, and it was taken by the Browns and I love it because it's such a sweet picture of her, the woman who just always took me for who I was and never wanted to change me.
Speaker 1: And what was Aunt Bea's last name.
Speaker 2: Her name was Beatrice Jones White.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother and my brother [David L. Temple, Jr.] and I taken in the early 1990s on Palm Sunday at the Hay-Adams Hotel [Washington, D.C.].  My brother David Temple, my mother Helen, and me.  I always liked that picture because I like to say that, although my mother and I were very good friends and my brother said that she always preferred me over him, of course.  But look at that picture.  She's looking adoringly at him.
Speaker 1: This is my great-grandmother Sue.  A Native American from Canada, who came to America, North, I mean the United States at the age of thirteen, and she's my grandmother's mother.  Her name was Susan Cotman [ph.]
Speaker 2: Okay, and did you say about what year?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I would--in the late 1800s.
Speaker 2: And this is an early-twentieth-century picture of my grandfather.  Very early tw- I would say maybe 1902 or 1903.  My grandfather Thomas Wyatt Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my grandmother and grandfather on their wedding anniversary.  Don't ask me which one.  I don't remember, but we all remember it in the family as being a time of--a joyous time and a time of great celebration, and it was taken some time in the early 1950s.
Speaker 1: Would you give their names again?
Speaker 2: Thomas Wyatt Jones and Magnolia Cotman [ph.] Jones.
Story_ID: 111542
Speaker 1: This is my mother's [Helen Burnette Jones Temple] and father's [David Lorenzo Temple, Sr.] wedding picture.  And it was taken in 1946.  It was actually their reception because they really eloped.  You know, this is my father's second marriage and they wanted it kind of understated.  They eloped and were married in Washington, D.C. at the Metropolitan Baptist Church.  The minister was late in getting there and they were married after midnight, so they were married on Halloween.
Speaker 2: This is my mother's oldest brother, and oldest sibling, Alfonso Jones, and Uncle Al we called him.  Some people called him Dude.  Probably early 1920s.  At the family orchard in Charles City County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: This was taken in 1994, 1993, and is a photograph of my brother David [L. Temple, Jr.] and I outside of my church, St. Luke's Episcopal Church on 15th Street, when daddy [David L. Temple, Sr.] was visiting, and was just before he started with Alzheimer's and he had prostate cancer at the time as well.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father taken in the early 1950s.  It was his business professional shot, and I've always liked that photograph very much.  It's very much him.
Speaker 1: And this is my mother's engagement picture, which is from 1943.  They were engaged for a long period of time because he went into the war, World War II, and this is published, of course, in the black press.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me taken by my friend Colin Robey [ph.], when I was thirty-one years old sitting in the window of my home on Calvert Street [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So about what year was that one taken?  1979?
Speaker 2: 1979, 1980.  No actually, yeah '80 [1980], '81 [1981]--
