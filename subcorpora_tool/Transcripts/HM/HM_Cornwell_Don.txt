Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe and I'm interviewing for The HistoryMakers; our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you give us your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Okay, so my full name is Wyllie that's spelled W-Y-L-L-I-E, Don just Don not Donald, Cornwell that's spelled Capitol C-O-R-N-W-E-L-L and I go by Don.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 17, 1948 and I was born in Cushing, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am retired and also active on corporate boards these days.
Speaker 1: Okay and during your career you were a--?
Speaker 2: Well my career started after graduate school; I started at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker and I did that for seventeen years and then I left there in 1988 and started a television business.  We were in the business of owning and operating local television stations around the country.  The name of that company is Granite, like the rock, Broadcasting Corporation and I left it in 19, I'm sorry in 2009 and have been I guess I would call myself quasi retired depending on which day you ask me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is, I have to look at my watch, today is May 17, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Times Square; we're at the Skadden Arps office building.
Story_ID: 55160
Speaker 1: Alright, okay now before we go into depth there are five light weight questions that we always ask.  It's kind of a warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Lately I've been extremely happy to eat salads made of kale which is pretty boring but if you'd asked me thirty years ago I would have said my mother's fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Alright, favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: We've spent a number of years, many years at a home that we own out on Long Island and so I tend to like to spend time there which is not to say that we haven't vacationed in lots of really nice places around the world but if I had to pick one I would say Amagansett, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or a favorite saying?
Speaker 2: "It is what it is".
Story_ID: 55161
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's [Lelia Allen] side of the family and your father's side and then we will try and put them together but we will ask about them separately.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: So her first name is Lelia, L-E-L-I-A, her middle was name Mae, M-A-E and her maiden name, are you asking that?  Her maiden name was Fredericks, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K-S.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth would be May 30, 1922 and she was born in Oklahoma and I must confess that I don't remember which town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family, how far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I don't know that much about my mother's side of the family beyond my grandparents so I'm not able to trace them back in any sort of terribly detailed fashion.  My grandmother, my maternal [Willa Fredericks] grandmother was born in Louisiana in the Baton Rouge area.  I do not know when she was born and she married my grandfather [Cordoza Fredericks], my mother's dad and he was from Arkansas and I do not know where they met or when they met but I do know that ended up in Oklahoma which was not that uncommon for many African Americans from the South at that time because there were perceived to be opportunities and so they moved to Oklahoma and that's where my mother and my uncle were born.  They lived there until the early '50s [1950s] when we all moved to the Pacific Northwest; my grandparents to Seattle and my mother and dad and the rest of us, the children to Tacoma, Washington which is where I largely grew up.
Story_ID: 55162
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did your grandparents [Willa Fredericks and Cordoza Fredericks] do for a living?
Speaker 2: They were teachers and if I could just embellish that a little bit I refer to them as itinerate teachers.  They were hired in many of the historically small black towns that are located in the heart of Oklahoma.  Places like Wewoka and Boley and what have you and they were hired each year under contract to go to these very, very small town and to in effect, provide the education for the African American children in those towns so that's what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You alluded to in the black tradition in Oklahoma, the black towns that were created after the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think there were over thirty at one time in Oklahoma and now we have lost a lot of them.
Speaker 2: Yes and that's where I was born in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother [Lelia Allen]--she grew up in Oklahoma I take it.
Speaker 2: Yes.  She became a teacher, she attended Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma], proud to say finished first in her class.  Graduated at the age of nineteen and became a teacher as were her parents and the tradition being an itinerant she went off at the age of nineteen to Kansas and--Topeka, Kansas where she began as a teacher in Topeka, Kansas.  Before ultimately coming back to Oklahoma and then out west when we moved.
Story_ID: 55163
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the town that you were born in Cushing [Oklahoma], is that an all black town?
Speaker 2: Not anymore and it wasn't even then.  I was so young that if you asked me to describe much about the town I couldn't describe it.  We lived--I always had the impression that we lived outside of the town on what one might describe as a reasonably rural area we didn't really have a farm, we had rabbits and chickens and that kind of stuff but it really wasn't a farm.  And we would go into town when I was very young and one of the great thrills was to observe the ceremonial of dances of Native Americans because there were lots of Native Americans and tribes in that area who would come to town on Saturdays and essentially perform.  So the town had African Americans, had Native Americans and because I experienced my first although I didn't realize it at the time, exposure to segregation that could have had to be white people.
Story_ID: 55164
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother [Lelia Allen] have any stories from her childhood or early adult experiences in Oklahoma that she shared with you that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if I would describe it as stories, I mean I know a little bit about sort of her history as I talked about.  She became an educator and was quite smart.  She and my father [Felton Cornwell] met at Langston, he was also a student there and this was in I'm going to say roughly 1940 or '41 [1941].  And then a thing called World War II started and he volunteered, my dad volunteered to join the service and left college and ended up as a member of the division, I get my military terms confused a bit, but he was part of what is generally called the Buffalo Soldiers and--which was an all black unit at that time.  So my mother and father married and during the war my sister, Felicia, was born while my dad was overseas he was in first northern Africa and then Italy and then he came back obviously after the war and in 1948 I was born.  So I don't know that I have a lot in the way of stories beyond that, quite frankly other than just the stories that my mother travelling at the age nineteen to Topeka, Kansas.  Also, by the way, with her younger brother my uncle, Uncle Ellsworth she had been given the responsibility by her parents to not only be a young teacher, a young adult but also to take care of her brother because of their travelling as teachers to have a more stable place for him to be.
Story_ID: 55165
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to go back--I was trying to find out if there any stories that your mother told about growing up, you know before I get to your father's side but I'm going to your father's side in a second.  So is there anything that she related about growing up in Oklahoma?  I take it that she moved around a lot with your parents from different towns in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: I would have to say that I assume so but we never really talked about that very much.  I know that she--I don't know much about what happened prior to college.  I know that when she went off to college and she was only about sixteen she went to Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma] which is located in that area.  Langston as you know is not a historically black college but in a sense it is.  It's a public school, it's a state school part of the University of Oklahoma system but in those days it was a black college.  And so that's where she went off to college but I do not know any anecdotal stories before that.
Speaker 1: I think it is named for John Mercer Langston, I think.
Speaker 2: Could be I don't know, yeah I don't know.
Speaker 1: I believe so; he was an abolitionist and a member of congress at one time in Ohio.  So--.
Story_ID: 55166
Speaker 1: Oklahoma just as a quick aside and you probably know this but most people tend to think about all of the great civil rights battles and incidences taking place in Mississippi and North Carolina and what have you.  But Oklahoma was actually quite at the forefront of many of the battles around education that there were cases that involved desegregation that took place before Brown v. The Board of Education which as we know involved Topeka, Kansas, and so Oklahoma had quite of a interesting history as being pretty Deep South even though people don't tend to think of Oklahoma as being Deep South.
Story_ID: 55167
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  Let me go to your father's [Felton Cornwell] side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Felton, F-E-L-T-O-N, Robert Cornwell capital C-O-R-N-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he older than your mother?
Speaker 2: He was by not too many years by about three or four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So maybe born about 1918?
Speaker 2: I'm going to guess that sounds about right.  I was going to say 1918 or 1917 something like that and I believe, just to clarify I believe that he was born also in Arkansas but I'm not sure about that.
Story_ID: 55168
Speaker 1: Okay, so now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you very much, okay and that's because as a family we ended up not being very close.  My dad [Felton Cornwell] obviously before I was born went off to the war and I would describe my dad as having been an early example of what we now call post traumatic syndrome that soldiers suffer.  He was an extremely intelligent man and quite, as a mother used to say a gift for gab.  Quite a talented speaker but he never finished college, went off to war and his unit of Buffalo Soldiers experienced some really traumatic incidents in Italy, in fact, again my lack of knowledge of military terminology division, platoon, troop I'm not very good with it but the unit that he was involved with was largely killed in Italy in drowning as they attempted to cross a river.  And so my dad experienced some pretty tough stuff which I have come to learn a lot more about in my adult years because I was not very close to my dad.  He came back, he and my mother came together again obviously and there were four more children myself and three siblings.  But he was never the same and as I got older by the time I was about eight or nine years old it was pretty clear that it made no sense for my mother and my dad to stay together and so they divorced and separated when I was about eight somewhere between eight and ten years of age.  And as a result of that, my father's family, we lived in the Pacific Northwest, most of his family at that time seemed to have migrated to southern California.  That's where an awful lot of Cornwells lived. And we were never close.  He was one of I'm going to say thirteen children, I may have that not quite right and there were several brothers and several sisters.  One of his sisters my Aunt Thelma she was extremely good with my mother in trying to help my mother raise her five children as a single parent.  And one of my father's brothers, my Uncle Raymond, who is now a resident of Los Angeles in what do you call it Bakers not Bakersville Pomona that area.  He is a retired minister and he was also along with his wife they were somewhat involved with my family but beyond that we really had very little contact with the other members of the family.  So I'm not going to be able to give you any details, I can just tell you that right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55169
Speaker 1: In my adult years I have started to have some of my cousins from my father's [Felton Cornwell] side of the family get in to contact with me and so as a result of those contacts I've met a few of my cousins and occasionally I will ask one of them so who is that person or who is this person because I don't know who they are.
Speaker 2: Do you know what your father's parents did for a living?
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I believe they were farmers but I don't know much beyond that.
Speaker 2: Did your father--now he went to Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], we know he went to college.
Speaker 1: He did yes.
Speaker 2: Did he graduate--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No.  He enlisted, I guess about his sophomore year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 55170
Speaker 1: And do you know what his aspirations were what he was aiming at?
Speaker 2: You know it's a good question, I don't really know.  I know that he had high aspirations, he was a very proud and--I would describe him as proud and self confident individual.  He happened to have a gift which is going to sound sort of amusing.  But he was an excellent barber, somewhat self-taught.  He was cutting people's hair on the Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] campus as a way of helping to pay his way through college and so when he came back to the country after the war that became his profession.  For a time in Tacoma, Washington which is where as I said I grew up and where my parents settled after they left Oklahoma, after we all left Oklahoma he was involved with a very popular barber shop in Tacoma, Washington.  Which was kind of 'the place' where all of the young black men went to get their hair cut and my dad could do a great job but I don't know much beyond that.
Story_ID: 55171
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So is there a reason--well first of all we know they met on the campus at Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] is there story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know the story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You've seen some pictures of my mother in the photos that I gave you and I think it is fair to say that my mother was a very attractive young lady (laugh) and you have seen a couple of pictures of my dad and he was a pretty good looking guy.  So I suspect that may have had at least a little something to do with it.  My mother was-I don't know what she was like at that age but in her adult years she was very no nonsense and very focused on what she wanted to get done and probably was that way at that time.  If you finish first in your class and you're a member of the AKAs and you're doing all that stuff, I suspect that she is probably the kind of person that would catch someone's attention and as I said my dad was pretty ambitious and so she seemed like probably a good match.  But that's me making that story up I don't really know.
Story_ID: 55172
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story as to how the family decided to move to Washington from Oklahoma that's quite a move?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So back on my comment about Brown v. The Board of Education there is always unintended consequences of things that happen in life and my mother was an educator as were my grandparents and at the time prior to Brown v. The Board of Education there were starting to be desegregation efforts in various communities and Oklahoma was one of those.  They had a famous incident at the University of Oklahoma Law School [Norman, Oklahoma] where the school was desegregated but they chose to seek the young student in a cordoned off area in the classroom and so my parents, my grandparents and my mother and presumably my dad but the three were close to other educators in town including white educators.  What my parents were told was that when desegregation was ultimately implemented which I think everybody assumed would ultimately happen, that the odds were based on what was being told to everyone was that most of the black teachers would probably end up losing their jobs and that the school systems would become integrated but with white teachers.  My parents loved teaching, my grandparents loved teaching and so they began to look around for places where they would be able to continue to do what they had trained themselves to do.  So they looked in a number of different places.  I know that they spent a fair amount of time exploring California.  As I said, my dad's family had started to move to California in that time period from various (unclear) places but my mother didn't particularly like California.  She didn't think the school system was very good and so through some means, I have no idea, Google did not exist in those days (laugh) I don't know, she discovered that the State of Washington had excellent public schools.  And they were able to ascertain from people that it was a community that was relatively welcoming to African Americans.  So we all decided to move there and I guess I was about four or five something like that when we moved there.  My grandparents settled then to Seattle [Washington] in an area, I'm not sure what that area in Seattle is called, but it was near Garfield High School and it's near a very predominantly black community that my grandparents moved in to.
Speaker 1: That's called the CD Central District, I believe.
Speaker 2: I guess so it's funny I don't really remember exactly what it was called.
Speaker 1: I think that was the traditional black community they called CD.
Speaker 2: Could be, yeah.  Wonderful house, they had--I really enjoyed it.  But my parents being the typical young parents with grandparents and as I get older I begin to understand the tensions.  They did not want to live in Seattle with my grandparents because my grandparents were extremely attached to the children particularly to my older sister and myself because we had lived with them for extended periods of time.  So we then moved as a family to Tacoma, Washington and my mother entered the public school system there and taught in Tacoma public schools for over thirty years.
Story_ID: 55173
Speaker 1: I didn't ask this question did you have any idea where your mother's parents went to school?
Speaker 2: I know that-I don't know here is what I know, I know that they did not get there college diplomas in what we would call a more traditional fashion.  They took about eleven years to complete their education but Oklahoma was a State in those days anyway where if you could satisfy certain proficiency you could do lots of things.  So for instance, I started school when I was about three years old because I was able to pass a test that I had to take.  I have no idea what was on the test but I passed it and so I was able to enroll in school and that ultimately led me in later years to as my children like to say, I flunked the third grade before my mother made me do the third grade twice in order to catch me up just a little bit.  I was two years at one point--two years younger than anybody else I was in school with.  And so she got me to the point where I was only one year younger.  But I digress to simply say that I think my grandparents were doing their teaching while they were simultaneously getting their graduate education.  When we moved to Seattle [Washington] they then both attended Seattle University and got Masters Degrees there but I don't know where they got their--they may have gotten them at Langston for all I know, I don't really know.
Story_ID: 55174
Speaker 1: Alright, so when you were about eight is when your parents split up.
Speaker 2: Yeah approximately.
Speaker 1: So you saw him infrequently after that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--.
Speaker 2: And frankly infrequently before that which I guess in hind sight was probably an indication that things were not all good.  As I indicated I've come to have a deeper appreciation for what my father went through and what was affecting him as I've gotten older.  I was not quite so forgiving as a younger person to be candid.  But in that time prior to the divorce he was not around a lot.  The one thing I would say about my dad that is I think a positive statement to make about him is that insofar as the children were concerned no matter what was going on with him (laugh) his expectations for us were extremely high.  I sometimes remind my children, they are no longer children but I once described to them my first report card which I got at maybe second grade, third grade whatever.  And you could get an excellent or satisfactory or an unsatisfactory that was one of three grades and I got all satisfactory and I was extremely pleased with myself when I brought this report card home.  And my father was extremely displeased with me which he expressed and that was the first I think very vivid memory I have of expectations being set high.  I sort of knew that just being average was not really good enough and I think that was a good lesson.
Story_ID: 55175
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is--how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: There were five children, I'm the second oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you name them all and put yourself in order?
Speaker 2: Sure, so Felicia, F-E-L-I-C-I-A is the oldest and then I'm second then my sister Lelia spelled just like my mother L-E-L-I-A then my sister Felteen obviously named after my dad F-E-L-T-E-E-N and then my younger brother Felton obviously named after our dad, F-E-L-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you are--.
Speaker 2: I'm the second, Felicia is the oldest.
Story_ID: 55176
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you think about your parents' personalities, their talents, dispositions, their looks who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably more my mother in that one of my dad's attributes was as my mom used to say 'the gift of gab' and I've never had the gift of gab I'm not inarticulate but I'm never going to be the one to stand in front of a crowd and make a speech that's going to cause everyone to stand up and cheer.  I think that my mother displayed over her life an enormous resilience and I think that throughout my life I've been able to display that also.  And I think both my parents were very smart and I don't want to sound immodest but I'm probably above average in intelligence and I think I get that.  They were both good looking and somehow or other missed that gene (laugh) but my children have come out pretty well so I think that it passed through me to them in a good fashion.
Story_ID: 55177
Speaker 1: Alright.  So do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: So I remember being with my grandparents in Oklahoma living in a very small house during one of their stints as itinerant professors as I described it, educators.  And living in some small town where there was nothing but dust and I guess what one might describe it as a desert, you know, foliage and tumbleweed and what have you. And the school was what seemed a very, very long way away from the house though if I had to bet maybe a hundred yards because I was very young and I remember having lots of fun playing outside of the house while my grandparents were off teaching.  Doing such things as chasing desert lizards and other creatures that if I think about--thought today that I would dare to actually try and catch one of these strikes me as absolutely amazing.  I think that my ability being left on my own in the house while my grandparents were teaching probably led them to accelerate getting me into school (laugh) to keep their eye on me because I was always a curious child and so I would undoubtedly find ways to get myself into trouble.  But that's an early memory and it sort of a--it's a totally different visual image than where I grew up which was the Pacific Northwest which is lush and green and then there if you asked me sort of what my memories would be it would be I had a group of friends there were four of us.  We were sort of a band of brothers, we fancied ourselves to be a gang which was a joke.  But we had an awfully good time growing up in a modestly tough neighborhood by what I call small city standards.  We took care of each other and developed friendships, at least with one of these folks, has continued at least through Facebook to this day.
Story_ID: 55178
Speaker 1: Can you describe the home that you grew up in, Tacoma [Washington], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So there were two, I'm sorry I should let you finish.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: So there were two, the first one which is the one that I remember most vividly was in the neighborhood that is referred to as Hilltop which is in Tacoma.  If you had--thirty, forty years ago if you had gone to Tacoma and you said so where do African Americans live there were basically two neighborhoods; one with Hilltop and the other one which is where people like Ahmad Rashad and what have you.  Ahmad Rashad is from Tacoma, he was better known as Bobbie Moore.  They lived over on I guess it would be the east side of the city and we had a small wooden nice enough house.  Not nothing fancy, to say the least.  My mother was a school teacher and she was making I believe about ten thousand dollars a year raising five children and making some extra money teaching piano to students.  We clearly were not well off and I think she rented this house, I don't think she ever owned this house, in fact, I'm pretty sure she never owned that house.  But she seemed to have a very long term rental arrangement because we lived in this house for many years.  Until about 1964 I believe, '63 [1963] or '64 [1964] and she wanted to own a home and she had found a home quite a ways outside of the city of Tacoma or at least the Hilltop area of Tacoma in a suburban area called Parkland which is near Pacific Lutheran University and a lot of different places but it's also very near the military bases.  If you know the Tacoma area there is a very large base called Fort Lewis and there is also an air force base McCord and I think they have combined those two now.  In any event that was the area that we moved to and there we had what I would describe your more typical suburban home that was sort of a split level.  Three bedroom nice house my mother was extremely proud of that house.  That's where I lived for two years before I went off to college and I did not live in that house for very long because of the circumstances.  And so other than coming back home for summers after college I went directly east to graduate school.  In fact I got married and went east to graduate school and so I never--I can't say that I really grew up in that particular house, the second house.
Story_ID: 55179
Speaker 1: Okay.   We always ask this question just like it so whatever comes to mind.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: So I will take Tacoma [Washington]--I would describe it as lush and green, damp contrary to opinion it's not--doesn't rain all the time but it's misty and so it can be pretty damp.  Tacoma itself was an old mill town and refinery town so for years at certain times there was an odor in the air that came off the smelting mills that existed which have now largely been shut down.  So there was sort of this wood pulp smell that you would smell in the air.  Sights and sounds beyond that--I'm not sure that anything immediately comes to mind beyond that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said it was very green.
Speaker 2: Yes, well I don't if you have been to the Seattle-Tacoma area but it's--because of that rain it's no accident that the rhododendron is the state flower, wonderful flowers, wonderful daffodils and massive evergreen trees and what have you.  So it's a very beautiful place.  And I suppose I missed one which and I'm sorry I didn't put a picture in Mount Rainier which is this massive presence that every couple of weeks when the clouds would lift and the rain would abate a bit you would look up and there was this massive mountain that I guess is--I think it's either the tallest in North America.  There is a taller one in Alaska but it's a very, very big mountain.
Story_ID: 55180
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now you said you had a gang of friend and you all fashioned yourselves as gang though you weren't really a--(simultaneous) (unclear)
Speaker 2: Well Tacoma [Washington] is a small town and I mentioned that there were essentially two black neighborhoods.  And while ours was not by any stretch of the imagination upscale the other black neighborhood was a little tougher than ours and it had a true gang that would not be inconsistent with the gangs that I read about in those days in places just like Chicago [Illinois] and what have you.
Speaker 1: So is that like east Tacoma?
Speaker 2: That's over in the eastern part.
Speaker 1: That's the toughest part?
Speaker 2: That was then the toughest part.  As I said neither--I don't want to portray either neighborhood as being bucolic and idyllic, it was not 'Leave it to Beaver' country.  You know we had drug dealers and people getting shot that kind of stuff.  But some neighborhoods are tougher than others.  And this neighborhood had a true tough gang and because it's a relatively small town, when you would have the inevitable weekend parties it was rather obvious to anyone that there was only one gang in Tacoma period.  And so I jokingly call us a gang because we had enough common sense to know that we did not want to go anywhere near any of those parties and attempt to present ourselves as a rival gang because that would not have been a fun experience.  Our parents raised smarter kids than that.
Story_ID: 55181
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you were growing up, I mean you mentioned Ahmad Rashad was on the other side, the east side but is he about the same age as--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: He is little younger than I am.  He--Bob Moore I still call him Bobby, he was a obviously an amazing athlete.  There were a lot of amazing athletes in Tacoma, Washington that people don't necessarily know about but Bobby was a great athlete there and my younger sister Lelia [Lelia Cornwell] and Bob were quite the social item through high school and end of the first year or two of college.  My sister, in fact, once told me that in Bob's autobiography he actually talks about her at some point in the book.  So I knew him and stayed in touch with him.  Haven't spent much time with him in probably the last four or five years but every once in awhile I will see him and say hello.

Speaker 1: Did you like sports growing up?
Speaker 2: I did, I did, but I--tragically, and of course you think I'm going to say I didn't have the talent but I'm going to say that of course I absolutely had the talent but I was born with a, I guess this is redundant, but I have a congenital heart defect, it's called a heart murmur and my mother chose when I was young not to have it repaired surgically because the odds were not nearly as good as they would be today to have something like that repaired.  And so what that meant was that my heart murmur which is extremely distinct, doctors loved to listen to my heart because it's a good teaching device.  I would always be ushered off of any team that I had somehow or another competed to get myself onto because they always made us take a physical before we could compete.  So I ended up being the manager of the basketball team and the manager of the football team and what have you because I wasn't able to play.  But I liked sports a lot and as I said I always fancied myself to be pretty good particularly as a baseball player but that's--but at my age everybody has those stories.
Story_ID: 55183
Speaker 1: Now did--now I was surprised when you told me that your grandparents--you were staying with your grandparents and they just went to teach school and left you at home.  You were at home by yourself?
Speaker 2: Not far away and when I say left me at home I'm not saying that quite right and I probably had my sequencing wrong on this because what would happen would be and this is where I would get myself into trouble, I would be sent home from school to--my grandmother believed in naps.  I'm not sure why she believed in naps but she did and so I would be sent home which as I said was a walk from the school to this house to take a nap in the afternoon and then they would be coming afterwards.  I never believed in naps and I still don't and as a result I found that to be a period where I could get into mischief and so as I said I think my education--the length of my school day which Arne Duncan and others right now are saying is an important thing.  My grandparents knew this a lot earlier than many and so lengthened my school day at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's where you would end up being by yourself. Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 55184
Speaker 1: Now did your parents and your grandparents try to restrict your activities because of the heart murmur or you have any instructions about--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Not really I think that they always recognized that my mother always recognized that anything I was going to do, I was going to need to get over hurdles in terms of the rules and the regulations so I wasn't going to be able to sneak on to a team that I shouldn't be on.  So as a result for instance, in high school we had a gym requirement and that requirement involved a variety of things ranging from wrestling to basketball to swimming.  I was immediately put into swimming and that--so instead of doing one tour of duty in swimming and one in each of the other; I would do three in swimming and so I became not a great swimmer but a more than adequate swimmer just because that's what I did and that was fine for my heart.
Story_ID: 55185
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did you start school, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: So I started school in Oklahoma.  In the first school I remember though I did some of these what I call itinerant schools with my grandparents but the first school that I remember where my grandparents were not teachers was a school called TT Minor (ph. splg.) and that I'm pretty sure was in Cushing, Oklahoma or Davenport, Oklahoma, I've forgotten which one.  And that was where we lived, they had their home and then we lived there.  Then when I moved to the Pacific Northwest, you know it's funny I think I've got something wrong so I'm going to correct myself for a second.  I don't remember the name of the school in Oklahoma.  I have a very vivid memory of the school because of certain teachers but when we moved to Seattle for a brief period of time, I went to an elementary school in Seattle while staying with my grandparents before we moved to Tacoma [Washington].  And that was TT Minor, that's in Seattle and then when we moved to Tacoma I enrolled in an elementary school the name of which is Stanley Elementary School and I stayed through the third grade.  My mother then decided that I should change schools and she moved to another school where she also happened to be a teacher called McCarver [McCarver Elementary School, Tacoma, Washington].  That was when I did the third grade again (laugh) you know much to my great chagrin.  And that school went all the way through the, I guess the ninth grade and at that point I transferred or we all transferred because the school stopped and I went to a high school in Tacoma called Stadium High School which is where I graduated.
Story_ID: 55186
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Stadium High School is that near where your mother moved?
Speaker 2: No, Stadium High School is right in the heart of Tacoma.  It would be on what's known as more the well I guess you would call it the west end of the city but it's a wonderful, wonderful beautiful school that was originally built by the Union Pacific Railroad to be a hotel and for whatever reason it never became a hotel and the city took it over and made it into a school.  So it's this gorgeous sort of gothic looking building that sits up on a hill and overlooks Puget Sound.  And you asked me about vivid memories, my wife who is a New Yorker when I first took her to Tacoma to see where I had grown up and she saw the school and she said, "You know you've never mentioned how beautiful this setting is."  And I said you know when you are growing up here you really don't think about such things.  People would die to have this location in most places.  So, wonderful school and wonderful setting.
Speaker 1: So the school was actually featured in a movie called 'Ten Things I Hate About You.'  That movie was made in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Okay so you know about this school?
Speaker 1: Yes it's an iconic (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's funny. That's where I went.
Story_ID: 55187
Speaker 1: Now in--you started school at three?
Speaker 2: I started school at about three.
Speaker 1: In Oklahoma, so I take it you learned how to read early?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so did you take advantage of that, did you read a lot when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I read--like most young boys I hate to be so gender specific but I do think that is an element.  I read as a younger person--I read a fair amount then I went through a period where I wasn't doing a whole lot reading until I got, other than what I had to read, until I got to high school and then I had a college counselor in high school who had an old fashion way of helping people improve their SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] scores.  And her advice was to get a book during the summer, try to read three books if you can, if you can read more that's great.  But she gave me a little pocket dictionary and she said anytime you come across a word you don't understand, just look it up.  And so I started reading a lot more from that time on in to college and then I'd have to say that after I got into the business world I found myself reading mostly for business purposes and with just a little bit of reading for pleasure along the way until the year 2010 when I was first semi-retired and I resumed doing a lot of reading.  And I'm trying to do more these days just because I enjoy it.
Story_ID: 55188
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your family have a television early on?
Speaker 2: Ok sure, in fact, the first--we actually had television in Oklahoma now that I think about it.  My grandparents had a very strict attitude about television which was to have it on one or two times a day.  Not for any great length of time.  My sister and I of course did not agree with that and so when my grandparents would leave to go off to church or whatever they were off to do, we would turn the television on and watch it.  What we didn't understand was that the television heated up so when we would hear them drive up we would immediately turn it off.  My grandfather would walk over and put his hand on the television and that would be a moment of clarity, I guess would be the best way to put it.  So we had television around, you know, from my earliest memories.  And I guess commercial television really sort of got introduced into this country and I'm being exactly correct but largely beginning with 1948.  And so if you think about it I was born in 1948, so I sort of grew up--just as my son grew up with Apple and Macintosh computers, I mean that was sort of his first introduction; I sort of grew up with TV.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright so did you watch a lot of TV growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean we watched some.  The choices were not all that great. There was always a show or two that would capture people.  So maybe there were some 'I Love Lucy' type shows or something that maybe you would watch.  As you got a little older I hated things like Lawrence Welk which would sometimes be on and I could never understand why anybody wanted to watch that.  And so I watched a lot less television when I was younger than I started to watch as an adult.  Probably some of that is because with the advent of technology and additional capacity and cable channels and what have you there is lot more to watch.  And so I watch more TV now than I did when I was younger.
Story_ID: 55189
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about church; was church a big deal?
Speaker 2: Church was a very integral part of my community and my growing up and for my grandparents and for my mother. In particular, my mother was sort of a quasi-founder of St. John Baptist Church there in Tacoma, Washington.  My grandparents were very active with their church in Seattle. I couldn't tell you what the name of it was.  But--so I grew up very much in the more traditional black Baptist church and I would describe myself as being extremely respectful of the church but having never been totally sort of I don't want to say not connected to it but I never really bought in, I guess.  Maybe that's the right way.  I learned a lot of ethical values from my church and when I went off to college I did a fair amount of reading of religion and some, I would describe it as new think religion and what have you, and developed some beliefs about my own sort of ethical framework that have sort of guided my life.  But the church was very important to me and at an early age I was pretty close to the then minister, Reverend Boles (ph. splg.) and he used to teach my Sunday school class.  And even at that age was I think always slightly amused at me for asking some of the questions that probably (laugh)--I couldn't quite understand Jonah and the Whale story but I had great respect for the black church and what it's meant to the African American community, but I'm not a particularly religious person in that sort of traditional sense.
Story_ID: 55190
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we are talking about growing up.  Now at school did you have any particular teachers in elementary school who were particularly interesting or were mentors to you growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really in elementary school.  I remember my first grade teacher, I think it was first grade it may have been second grade, but her name was Mrs. Callahan but to be honest with you I just remembered her because she was tall and she seemed really nice and so I just remember her.  But I think that when I got to--can I move to middle school?
Speaker 1: Just one quick question the school in Oklahoma was segregated right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All black school, all black teachers, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In Tacoma [Washington] or it was Seattle [Washington] or Tacoma what was the case?
Speaker 2: Much more likely to be white but with a smattering of black teachers.  There were not that many my mother being one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about the students were the students segregated in Tacoma?
Speaker 2: By the time you got to high school no and a little more so in middle school and elementary school but even there at the time and I think that is probably still the case, Tacoma its African American population would be somewhere between six and nine percent of the total population something like that.  And so just by definition you weren't going to end up with a largely segregated environment.  You might--segregation in those days would be more residential patterns which is not the case in Tacoma anymore which is also a surprise (unclear).  And it would also be segregated in a social sense so that the people that I hung out with by in large whether it was middle school or high school were largely black.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it would be probably church, and social--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Church and sports and just hanging out in the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 55191
Speaker 1: Would you say it was a tight black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Very much driven around and I talked about the church very much driven around several churches.  My mother's church, our church would have been one of those and it had a very interesting, in fact to just allow for a second, it had a very interesting impact which is something that I think seems to be missing a little bit today.  Again, I talked about unintended consequences, integration, desegregation etc.  Our home, the first home in Tacoma [Washington] was a block and a half from the church and the school that I attended and that my mother taught at was a block from the church itself.  So that home was two and a half blocks from school and church was sort of right there in the middle and what that meant was that the kids--many of the kids at the school also attended--or their parents attended the church.  And I as I was fond of saying to people because I would come home for lunch and my mother would come home for lunch and so if I had gotten myself into a little bit of a mess, as she would put it that morning, by lunchtime the wrath of God would have exhibited itself upon me and by the next Sunday all of the mothers of my friends would also have been given some disclosure, I guess is the best way to put it, of our behavior.  So it had a real, I think in my opinion, positive effect as a community because I was always--I talked about my father having high standards, my grandparents took eleven years to go through college but they clearly were very focused on education.  Obviously my mother etc. and so I was always whether I knew it or not on a path to go on to advance, to achieve to go to college, etc.  As I said, it took me a long time to realize that's the path I was on.  But I was on that path.  Most of my friends were not on that path.  They came from different households but their parents were nonetheless very caring about their kids.  They wanted the best for them and so I always thought that my friends, my buddies that we all--it was sort of a symbiosis we all benefitted tremendously from the existence of this community because I can talk about things that I benefitted from in terms of what I learned (laugh), I might not have learned from home.  But they benefitted from the fact that they weren't able to kind of just get off the path and not be held, in a sense, to the same standards that I was being held to and so that was a very, very important thing and that was all within essentially in that three, three and a half blocks.  That doesn't exist anymore.  The church is still there, the school has closed it's used for something else.  Most of those homes have been--there is a big hospital that has started to gobble up that entire area known as Hilltop.  So if you go into Tacoma now and you look up to the top of the hill you see this massive hospital building which I'm sure is all very nice but that community is very different than it was when I was growing up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I digress that was not what you asked me.
Speaker 1: No, but that's a--you make a good point.  People in the interview often make a good point that their neighborhood was a village in some ways.
Speaker 2: No question about it.
Speaker 1: They admit the loss of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 55192
Speaker 1: So did I ask you (laugh)?
Speaker 2: You asked me about my elementary school and whether I had teachers that were mentors and I wanted if I could, I wanted to say that in middle school that's when I first described myself as having had a mentor for the first time.  So can I talk about that?  So the first mentor would simply be my mother being she was a teacher there.  I got a chance to observe her and how she operated and that was instructive to me.  And she was my mother so of course she was my mentor, I wouldn't have acknowledged it at the time.  But then there was a counselor there, Mr. Wentworth (ph. splg.) who pulled me into his office one day and I think I was in the ninth grade, and his question to me was where do you think you want to go to college?  And that was almost as if someone had asked me can you speak Greek.  I have no ideas as to why that had never occurred to me but it was one of those incidents where I really remembered for a long time that not only that I could do this but that people thought I could.  That was a very important kind of conversation for me to have.  It made a big difference when I left this somewhat more segregated not totally but somewhat more segregated and much more African American student dominated middle school and went to high school, Stadium High School that we've talked about which was exactly opposite.  It was more dominated by what I would describe as the whiter, Caucasian elite of Tacoma because in those days it was the school.  The Weyerhaeuser family, the famous lumber company, they lived not too far from Stadium High School.  Their kids would go there unlike today where people tend to self select themselves many times based on economics into private schools and what have you.  That largely did not exist in those days.  In Tacoma a private school, unless it was Catholic, was more likely to be a school for the bad boys or bad girls.  Whereas the public schools kind of everybody went and going into that environment and having the self confidence to put myself forward back in what 1962 whatever it was or '63 [1963]. You know was greatly enhanced by the self confidence that I had gotten from a few people like this Mr. Wentworth who sort of said well you can do this and that was as I said, a bit of an eye opener for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well that's interesting that you had counseling.  Some people don't have any and some have bad counseling.
Speaker 2: Well as I said when my mother did her education survey and figured out where we were going one of things that she had learned was that, at least in those days, the state of Washington had excellent schools and so they have a lot of things that students lack these days, counseling and what have you was pretty much par for the course in terms of what we got.  I didn't realize it at the time but it was pretty good stuff.
Story_ID: 55193
Speaker 1: Now did you have an aspiration as you entered high school?
Speaker 2: Aspiration--.
Speaker 1: A career aspiration.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I had a hero--my hero was a guy by the name of Jack Tanner, T-A-N-N-E-R.  He became a federal judge and Jack was a local black attorney who was famous for raising hell (laugh) it's the only way to describe it and he was the lawyer for the underdog including the Native Americans.  He did some famous cases where he won the right for Native Americans to fish on their land using their traditional methods which was pretty controversial because some of those methods can be a little disruptive if they had done it in large scale.  But Jack was very much a defender and so I had sort of been aware of him and sort of liked that fighting spirit and had done a little reading about people like Clarence Darrow and what have you.  So when I went into high school and ultimately into college I was convinced that I was going to be an attorney that I was going to law school and that I might in fact someday be like Jack Tanner or I might run for public office or what have you.  But that's what I thought about it.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Jack Tanner?
Speaker 2: No.  Well that's not true I probably did--my mother probably introduced me to him at some event, church event or what have you that I might have gone to but not to ever have spent any time with him.
Speaker 1: He was somebody in the news and somebody your mother talked about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Very well known, Tacoma [Washington] is a small city and so if there is someone that's an African American and who is "doing something" everybody would know about it.  He was-I think he may have been the head of the NAACP for the area but I'm not sure of that.  He ultimately-I think President Carter [President Jimmy Carter] but I could be wrong about it ultimately appointed him to the federal bench and he became a federal judge.  He is now dead.
Story_ID: 55194
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now as you're entering high school the civil rights movement is really cranking up.  Days when CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] is really bearing down and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in Mississippi and so you were getting all this news?
Speaker 2: To some degree, you know, we had the Urban League and we had the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and we had a lot of different organizations there and around.  You know as I said we had a wonderful black church community which almost by definition would tend bring a certain sense of social activism and knowledge to the communities.  So you would learn about these things, you would hear about it.  Clearly news--the dissemination of news is so totally different now as to then that you didn't have what I would describe as twenty four seven.  So when Malcolm X was assassinated I remember--I'm pretty sure it was on a Sunday, I don't know why but I just remember going to church and listening to the radio this was announced on the radio.  And so you would know about things that were happening from the evening news or what have you but not as obviously as on the present as you would have today, for instance.
Story_ID: 55195
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't ask about this before but you said your mother helped found the church that she was in?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think she was one of the--she may not have been a founder but she was probably one of the founding members and then she went back a long, long way with this church.
Speaker 1: Okay and so she actually helped founded when she became an early member in Tacoma so it is a fairly new church-congregation?
Speaker 2: You mean at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because a lot of time has passed (laugh).  Yes and that would have been true for most things involving African Americans and so for instance she with a few friends founded the chapter of the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha] sorority.  My mother when she died she was--I think she had been in for over sixty years just to put that in some perspective.  Whenever she would go to their annual conventions whatever you would call it she would always get honored because there were not that many people like her around.  So most everything that was done involving sort of black organizations was basically new and started up in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandparents didn't attend that church they attended--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: No they were in Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 1: Seattle.  That's about how far away --?
Speaker 2: Well these days it takes you close to an hour to get there but in those days it was thirty to forty-five minutes because there was a lot more traffic you know that area has grown so much.  We would go visit Seattle often but we didn't attend church there.
Story_ID: 55196
Speaker 1: Now did you--when you were a youth did you go to the Seattle World's Fair [1962]?
Speaker 2: We did, I don't remember that much about it.  I've actually spent a little more time around the fairgrounds as an adult.  I've taken my children there and what have you; got them the Space Needle and all that sort of thing.  It was a very huge deal you know, everybody was very proud to have it.  I remember that my mother was extremely happy that she was able buy these World's Fair glasses.  My mother passed away about two years ago and we were doing sort of an inventory of her house and we came across these glasses.  But if you ask me what do I remember about the World's Fair I couldn't tell you very much about it to tell you the truth but I just remember it.
Speaker 1: Everybody remembers the space needle this is the symbol of Seattle now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's the--it was nationally--everybody focused on it.  I know some of my teachers came back to school talking about it with slides of the Seattle World's fair.  So that's 1960--?
Speaker 2: I was going to say '62 [1962], '63 [1963] or something like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 55197
Speaker 1: Now in '63 [1963] there was a march on Washington [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, 1963].  What do you remember about that?
Speaker 2: I just remember it.  Obviously very interested in it and focused on it but it seemed like this far off land to me because it wasn't happening right there in my back yard and I hadn't traveled much, I had never been to the East and hadn't really traveled very much outside of Washington other than the little time in Oklahoma and then a trip or two to California.  So this was a little, I guess, I don't know if I want to say awe inspiring but it was a very--sort of a big deal.  I remember sitting with my mother watching it, listening to the speeches and what have you.
Speaker 1: I kind of asked about this, I know King County is now named for Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] where it was named for a former slave owner, Rufus King (ph. splg.).
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well you know they are very active as I said the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and other organizations in both Seattle [Washington] and Tacoma [Washington] so there were little marches and what have you.  But again nothing that sort of would rise the occasion of sort of being truly awe inspiring and what have you.  I would describe it as more in sympathy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Dr. King never came to--did he ever come to Seattle as far as you know?
Speaker 2: You know I don't know.  He came to my college, I met Dr. King but I don't know.  I would be shocked if he didn't come to at least Seattle.  Seattle had a lot of stuff going on.  Seattle is one of those cities that kind of flies under the radar screen.  I always tell people that you know, I mean for God's sake Jimi Hendrix was from Seattle, you know.  Ray Charles started his career as a practical matter in Seattle and what have you.  And so there was a lot going on there but the critical mass of African Americans was relatively small.
Story_ID: 55198
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a black paper in town?
Speaker 2: Small one, small one, like many, struggled, may still exist but I don't think so.  I'm not sure about that to tell you the truth.  So it was there but I wouldn't describe as being, I don't want to say it was insignificant because that's not fair but I wouldn't describe it as being as impactful as maybe the Amsterdam News might have been in New York [New York] and Harlem [New York, New York] at least that's what I'm guessing or the Defender [the Chicago Defender] or you know some of the papers of older times terribly undercapitalized.  A good friend of mine, a young woman that I went to high school with and she worked there and what have you.  I don't have much memory of it other than that.
Speaker 1: Did you get to Johnson Publishing?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  Well you know the thing that I say to people and it probably goes back a little bit to what fascinated me about the business that I ultimately went into in television and that is that news and information is even more important to people in these smaller communities than it is to people in the big, sophisticated urban settings like Chicago [Illinois] or New York [New York] or Los Angeles [California] where people take for granted all the information and access that they have.  So 'Ebony' and 'Jet' were always in my house okay and in my grandparents' house.  As were other magazines because my grandparents used to read the Readers Digest all the time when I was a kid just because it was always around and it always had these really interesting stories (laugh) that I would read.  And a lot of that is because if you are living in a place particularly like Tacoma where there might be one station, radio station that focuses a little bit on African American music let alone African American news.  And you know it didn't exist, cable channels or any of that sort any of thing.  Your ability to know what was going on outside of your own environment was extremely limited.  So there was a great appetite for these publications.
Story_ID: 55199
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in high school--so you had the aspiration of becoming a lawyer following the footsteps of Jack Tanner.  So did you have a favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that I would describe it as a favorite subject.  I've always liked history you mentioned that you're a historian.  My grandfather loved history, we used to spend a lot of time when I was a kid just talking about historical figures and what have you and sometimes he would give me these sort of child like history books to read about a particular person.  Nothing terribly heavy or academic or what have you.  So I always liked history but I always veered towards what I would describe as more of the qualitative, the verbal skill set.  I was not a scientifically focused or mathematically focused.  I was able to do more than--well enough in those subjects but--I liked Latin, I liked English, history and you know what have you.  But my focus was more I was sort of goal driven, goal oriented so I decided okay I'm going to college.  So I wanted to do what I needed to do to get there.  So I needed to get good grades, you know be involved with the school and you know what have you.  And so my focus was less academic and more what I would describe as putting the package together.  I wouldn't have described it to you that way at the time but as I look back that's what I was doing without sort of knowing it.
Story_ID: 55200
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a favorite teacher in high school?
Speaker 2: I'm embarrassed to say that I had a number of teachers that were meaningful to me but I don't remember names, I don't have quite the same vivid memory I had.  My most vivid memory was of my college counselor, an elderly white woman, Evelyn Forbes who seemed to identify me as one of her special projects and guided me in a lot of different ways.  Nowadays to be candid with you if someone did what she did lots of parents would be very unhappy but it turned out to be absolutely great advice for me.  So she would be the one person, but she's not a teacher.
Story_ID: 55201
Speaker 1: What would be disturbing about her advice?
Speaker 2: Well disturbing probably too strong a word.  So I just kind of-so I happened to come onto the scene in high school at about the time that African Americans students were all of a sudden being welcomed, somewhat into schools that had historically not had many African American students and many of our parents even though they had gone to historically black colleges had decided that it made sense for us to go to some of these schools as opposed to historically black schools.  So, for instance, I was never encouraged to apply at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] or you know what have you or Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  On the other hand, I was advised to apply to the best schools I could get into and we had a college counselor.  I tested pretty well, had very good scores and had a lot of extracurricular things going for me and so I applied at three colleges.  I applied to the University of Washington [Seattle] which in those days was sort of like a sure thing.  It's much more difficult to get in there these days.  I applied to Occidental College [Los Angeles, California] which I was steered to by Mrs. Forbes because of its size and its sort of I would describe it as small teacher/student ratio and it's sort of tradition of a very close relations with faculty and students.  And then, of course, if you are on the West Coast and by the way if you've been told that you're not applying--my mother told me don't apply to any of the eastern schools.  So don't apply to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or what have you. I wrote away for all the catalogs that would come to the house and my mother would say to me why you realize that you would never be able to come home; we won't be able to afford to have you come and visit it's just too expensive.  So I applied to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] because Stanford was the big deal school and still is on the west coast.  And I got into all and I chose Occidental over Stanford and I can tell you that most parents that I know today at least in New York City [New York] would have a tough time with that decision.  But it was the perfect school for me because I was not yet ready to compete in an environment with a lot more students that my skill set tended to be very good in interpersonal settings.  And so a smaller environment would be a way for me to sort of get my footing early on and to thrive and it turned out to be perfect.  Like our president [President Barack Obama] who came to Occidental and spent two years and then decided to transfer at the end of my sophomore year I was ready, okay.  I thought very seriously about transferring to a larger school but I had become so immersed in Occidental's social and student political life and other life there on campus that it was extremely difficult to do so I stayed.  But back on Mrs. Forbes, the advice to pick a school that in terms of national reputation is substantially below Stanford.  It would be pretty controversial these days but it was great advice for me and I'm glad I did it.
Story_ID: 55202
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what were some of those activities you were involved in at high school?
Speaker 2: I guess the most significant in high school because I didn't play sports and I stopped all my managing stuff because that was in middle school I got involved with student government.  I was in student counsel all that sort of thing and then I did not have the courage to run for president of the student body.  I think in a way you could say that I sort of self selected myself out of that process.  I was convinced that the likelihood of an African American student winning that at that high school was pretty slim but I had an awful lot of classmates, white, who disagreed with me and so after having let that go by I was persuaded by several that I should run for class president which had historically been sort of a lesser job and no African American had ever been a senior class president.  So I ran and I learned something about what I call old school Chicago [Illinois] politics from some of my buddies from the neighborhood.  They sort of made sure that the balloting was not tilted against me.  I won't say they tilted it for me (laugh) they chose to not tilt it against me.  And I became the class president and I guess I would describe it as blossoming because I think by the time we had graduated, all the honors that had historically always been given to the student body president were in fact given to me because I was clearly the better leader than the fellow who had become the student body president.  As I said my sort of resume so to speak as I was leaving high school was pretty good, was pretty good.
Story_ID: 55203
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were senior class president?
Speaker 2: I was senior class president and ended up being one would describe me as probably the top leader in the high school and I said I didn't have the courage to do that and so I ended up in the right place anyway.  Just because I'm sounding immodest and I don't mean to but that's just the way it worked out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in 1966?
Speaker 2: '65 [1965]
Speaker 1: '65 [1965] okay.  And you are on your way to Occidental [College, Los Angeles, California] and that's in California?
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But over in the east side of Los Angeles near Pasadena in a little community called Eagle Rock.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I must confess that one of the reasons I accepted the advice of my college counselor to pick Occidental over Stanford and I'll admit this publicly I believe this will be on your digital archives so forever more known that I didn't have the ability financially to visit any of these places and so I looked at maps and what I could see from the map was that Stanford was located down the peninsula from San Francisco [California] because in those days if you thought of the bay area you thought of San Francisco only.  And therefore in my mind it was a suburban school whereas Occidental was right in the heart of Los Angeles.  Now it never occurred to me how large Los Angeles is and it never occurred to me that Los Angeles does not have public transportation or ways for people to get around and so Occidental in some ways was just as isolated in my mind as Stanford would have been.  But as I said I'm still glad I made the decision that I made.
Story_ID: 55204
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you liked Occidental [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: I did.  It's a very difficult time '65 [1965] to '69 [1969] and there was lots of things going on.  I think as black students we were all I think in a good way learning about ourselves, trying to learn a bit more about our heritage, our history, feeling assertive and all of that sort of social ferment was all around us in all sorts of ways.  Whether it was involving civil rights or it involved the growing discontent with the war in Vietnam, you etc.  But having said that I was happy to be there once I got there as a freshman.  I didn't sort of look up and say boy did I make a mistake.
Speaker 1: What--describe Occidental for us.  I don't have a sense of what kind of school it is, when it was founded.
Speaker 2: It's a relatively small school.  It probably has I'm going to say roughly fifteen hundred undergraduate students and maybe a couple of hundred graduate students.  The graduate students are almost exclusively in literature and English and what have you where they can get Masters and PhD programs. It's your quintessential liberal arts college.  It was founded in and I'm going to say something like 1898 or what have you.  It was originally founded as a Presbyterian school though it became non denominational at some point you know in the twentieth century, long before I got there.  It had historically been a school that had catered to what I would describe as a more affluent segment of Southern California in particular the Los Angeles area.  Lots of students came from communities in and around the campus.  There as a famous community near Occidental called San Marino [California] that used to be known as sort of the hot bed of relatively conservative republican, you know, folks.  It's now become the community of largely Asian Americans.  People who have or I should say Asian immigrants; people with lots of money who have migrated here from Taiwan and Hong Kong [China] and you know what have you.  And so the nature of that community has changed (laugh) like a lot of America.  But that's where Occidental would have drawn its student base from.  Our president went to a prep school in Hawaii called Punahou which if you know much about Punahou it's somewhat like Andover or Exeter for Hawaii, it's an extremely wealthy school and so I had lots of classmates who had attended Punahou School who would come from Hawaii to Los Angeles to attend Occidental.  Famous graduates include people like Jack Kemp, the former congressman and football player and I guess vice presidential candidate.  I'm trying to think of others that I could point to obviously our former president, who didn't graduate there but I shouldn't say our former our current president [President Barack Obama] didn't graduate from there but attended for a couple of years.  Used to have really terrific track and field teams which have been a tradition for many years and it's only issue is that its coaches would be rated by UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, California] and Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and other places after a few years and so many of the coaches would stay for four or five years and then go to other places.  A lot of Olympic athletes, you know, and what have you.
Story_ID: 55205
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the conservative element--was that like John Birch Society type?
Speaker 2: No not that conservative that's Orange County [California].  This would be--I would describe this--this would be today this would probably be viewed as moderate republicanism, okay.  This is--there was a guy named Bob Finch who had been a lieutenant governor in the state and who was a big Nixon [President Richard Nixon] guy.  Jack Kemp is an example of that.  So no conservative is one of those evolving terms and today you would call these moderate republicans and they would lose in primaries (laugh).
Speaker 1: They would be targeted by the Republican Party.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 55206
Speaker 1: Alright.  Did the black students there have student organization?
Speaker 2: So as a freshman and this is where I was starting to go the answer is no but my class as I said there was about fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred students so there might be four hundred or something like that in a class and out of that group I think there were about thirteen to fifteen of us African Americans and we were the largest group that had ever attended the school at that time and probably hasn't grown that much since then.  Maybe now it's twenty-five but in any event we of course felt that we needed to start to create such organizations.  So along with a buddy of mine, we founded the Black Student Association and which still exists to this day, I believe.  So those organizations were like in many campuses were just being started if you think about that period of history, you know '65 [1965] to '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay now was your organization originally called Black Student Association?
Speaker 2: Yes that's what we called it.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting because '65 [1965] a lot of places we were still Negroes in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Not at Occi [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The BSA, The Black Student Association.
Speaker 1: Association?  Okay BSA alright and were there aims of organization to influence curriculum or hiring practices by that school?
Speaker 2: Yeah I smile a little bit because sometimes when I look at Occupy Wall Street people and what have you and everyone marvels at what you know so what really your aim, what's the point here (laugh).  I would say that we were just really interested in making things better but I'm not sure that we had a clear notion.  Over time we all had a sense of the need for some things to improve on the campus and those did relate to things like curriculum.  They related to hiring in other words more black faculty, you know that type of thing.  But out of that organization came some other efforts because there was also a sense that the campus was somewhat isolated and that there was a lot going on out here in the world so to speak and we needed to find ways to allow us as students to be more engaged with community and what have you.
Story_ID: 55207
Speaker 1: Okay so did you make kind of--reach out to the black community in LA [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Well the black community in LA was a long way away from us.  The black community would have been traditionally when you think of Watts and South Central, Los Angeles [California] and that was quite a distance from us.  The area around Occidental was much more Latino and also Caucasians sort of working class, etc.  It's not a real affluent area around the campus but there were and as I said this was an effort that involved not just The Black Student Association but also other students who had arrived in this time period who wanted to be more engaged.  Whether it was in stopping the war, protesting the war or whatever the particular issue was at the given time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there wasn't a community it was convenient--.
Speaker 2: No that's correct and so for the black students what tended to happen was that we became both focused on ourselves on the campus so we had our own organization and that involved some socializing and some other activities.  But in addition many of the students--the black students had come from the southern California area and so they had classmates at other campuses whether it would be Cal State LA [California State University, Los Angeles, California] or Pomona [Pomona College, Claremont, California] or UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, California] or what have you and so many of the black students would also seek both social life and other life away from the campus.  So it was kind of a bit of back and forth.  For me, I had no car and couldn't get around so as a result, Occi [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] became pretty much my focus.
Story_ID: 55208
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you take any leadership roles at Occidental [College, Los Angeles, California] beside the Black Student Association?
Speaker 2: Yes.  First founded the Black Student Association with another fellow and then at the end of my freshman year while I was very happy to be Occidental, I was also feeling very isolated.  I discovered to my chagrin that I couldn't go hang out in Westwood [Los Angeles, California] and UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, California] and what have you and so I became pretty close with a professor, Norm Cohen [Norman S. Cohen] and he was a history professor and I loved his class and the school tradition encouraged a lot of interactions between students and faculty and so one afternoon sitting around in a college lounge having a coke or what have you I started complaining about the isolation and the inability just to get anywhere so he and I started brainstorming.  We came up with an idea to create a bus that would on a regular basis take students from campus to other places in southern California and then basically wait and bring them back but on a pretty regular basis.  And so I decided having been successful in student government in high school that I would run for class president.  So I became--I ran for sophomore class president and I had one platform (laugh).  That platform was that we needed to create what we call the Bengal Bus; it's called the Occidental Tigers, that's the nickname so we decided to call it the Bengal bus.  And I ran was resoundingly elected because lots of students agreed with me and so I was able to persuade the student counsel which had a budget to work with a relatively affluent alum who owned a Volkswagen dealership who gave us, at a very good price, a little minivan, a little Volkswagen van.  And that launched the Bengal Bus program which still exists at Occidental to this day and I think they have about four or five of them now.  It still carts people around and so that was my first involvement with student government.  So I'm going to continue on this if you don't mind just to get it all out there.  So having gotten myself involved with student government, I guess some people discovered that I was pretty good at getting stuff done I was approached by an upper classman a guy by the name of Bill Tulley (ph. splg.).  Bill is now the--I think the title is rector he is one of the top Episcopalian priests in the country.  The very famous church there--what is it St. Bartholomay on Park Avenue [Los Angeles, California] and Bill decided he wanted to run for student body president and he got the bright idea that I would be a very good both campaign manager for him and also would be a good vice president of the student body even though you ran separately.  People voted, you know, they didn't vote as a ticket they voted separately.  So I allowed myself to be talked into doing this and ran for vice president of the student body and also ran Bill's campaign.  My problem was that I couldn't get Bill to campaign.  Bill didn't believe in going out and meeting people.  Occi [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] is a small place going back to what my college counselor had said she sort of knew that one on one I could do pretty good and so I was in all the dorms and all the fraternity and sorority houses.  And when the election was held I became vice president of the student body and another fellow became the student body president as opposed to my candidate and so that was sort of the continuation of my career there in student government.  Ultimately I became the president of the student body the next year.
Story_ID: 55209
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you majored in political science now did you start off majoring in political science?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And again that goes back to my notion that I wanted to be in public policy and possibly law, politics, etc. and so that fit very well with what I thought I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what history did Dr. Cohen teach?
Speaker 2: I would describe it as American history and I'm not sure if I can remember exactly at this point what periods we were talking about but that's my memory of his teaching.  He was an excellent professor.  It's been a long time ago I remember him for lots of positive elements of my time at Occidental [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] but if you ask me--if you quiz me in content today I would not do very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the other teachers or students or people there that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well there were lots of people.  I'm going to have to fumble just a little bit with names but there was a Professor Winter who headed up a required course for every student during your freshman and sophomore year called The History of Civilization and he was fairly famous on campus and this was a course you had to take.  It was intended to give us all a deep grounding in "civilization."  Now you might imagine between '65 [1965] and '69 [1969] if civilization was defined as entirely Western.  That was somewhat controversial and therein led to a fair amount of discussion and dissention and unhappiness and what have you.  But Dr. Winter and I actually became I wouldn't say good friends but we developed a pretty good relationship because I was growing as a leader and having founded The Black Student Association and having had lots of young African American students show up afterwards who took over the leadership of it which was the right thing.  I found myself in what I would describe as a role of mediator and one who wanted to try and make sure that we got the right things done without creating life changing events for some of the students.  Like getting thrown out of school (laugh) and what have you.  So he was a faculty member that I had a lot of affection for because I usually found that he and I could have a pretty good discussion and I could explain to him why we people were unhappy with his class and what we might do about it in a way that would ultimately lead to some pretty good outcomes.  Other faculty there was an African American teacher Marguerite Archie (ph. splg.) who showed up on campus initially during the summertime with a program it's not A Better Chance, it's called, oh boy, Outward Bound, I think that's the name of it, Outward Bound.
Story_ID: 55210
Speaker 1: Is this the one where the high school students go to--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Upward Bound.
Speaker 2: Upward Bound thank you, thank you.  And so she first was introduced to Occidental in those summer programs where high school students from the LA area would come and I would get involved.  Then she ultimately became a professor at Occidental [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] and was a great, great mentor to a lot of us and somebody that we really looked up to.  There are lots of professors, Larry Coldwell who was one of the top professors in Political Science very memorable.  Somebody I have stayed in touch with at least until recently.  The head of the department is a guy by the name of Ray McElvey (ph. splg.) who had actually been a sub cabinet memory in the FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] administration and he headed up the Political Science department and he was cantankerous, controversial but provocative and memorable and I probably have him to thank for the career choice and path that I took which led me away from law school and ultimately to business school. Because he explained to me at one point--he used to take great delight because I was known on campus for raising hell about a little of this and little of that and his favorite line to me was what are you complaining about you're going to get yours which he knew would really set me off (laugh).  But at one point he explained to me that he was not going to allow any person to graduate with a diploma from Occidental in Political Science who knew nothing about economics and that knowing a little economics would not be a bad thing.  So I was forced, much to my chagrin, to take an economics course and it was an extreme eye opener for me and basically changed my complete direction at that point and I ended up going into business school instead of law school because of the course and also frankly the faculty member who taught it with whom I developed a good sort of casual after school chat relationship.  So those are just some of the names but then I'm sure if I thought about it I could come up with another five.
Story_ID: 55211
Speaker 1: So that's--so the economics course [at Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] you took focused you on business?
Speaker 2: It did; it was an interesting time.  Again going back to conservative Republicans, we had a president who we all detested, of course [President] Richard Nixon and he had--he was talking about things like black capitalism and this, of course was a time whereas as young African Americans you were on one hand reading the teachings of Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and at the same time reading the teachings Malcolm X and if you were so adventurous you might even go and see what Elijah Muhammad and the people like that had to say.  So you were focused on empowerment and the ability--learning what I call the 'golden rule' which is he who has the gold makes the rules.  I as a professor of the student body and having my inevitable fights with the board of trustees of the college became quite aware of what I call the 'golden rule' and so I decided that I wanted to be in a position where I had more to say about the distribution of resources and what have you and that led me to business.  That's essentially the thought process in my senior year where I did an abrupt turnaround.  I had applied to some very good law schools and gotten in to all of them including Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and decided to not go there and instead I went to Harvard Business School.
Story_ID: 55212
Speaker 1: Two things I want to ask you about in the age of our cultural revolution and black power.  People were concerned about power and concerned about cultural issues as well; did you encounter the Black Panthers?
Speaker 2: Well so it's good you asked the question because again this is one of those things I think people who grew up on the East Coast don't really realize in that Los Angeles was in many ways almost an epicenter for a lot of that kind of discussion and conflict.  There were two organizations that clashed mightily in the Los Angeles area particularly around UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, California].  You know the Black Panther party and then the Ron Karenga group called US [US Organization] which was a cultural nationalist organization and there was some really difficult and violent and unfortunate things that happened in that time period all while I was in college.  Shootings at UCLA, people being killed, etc.  One summer I had worked on campus at Occidental [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] in this program this Upward Bound program and a friend of mine who was also an instructor in the program that summer who by coincidence was also from Tacoma [Washington] and had decided to come down and teach, the two of us decided that we were going to go the trial of Huey Newton so we drive all night to get to Oakland and got there at five in the morning.  So we were to get into the court room and sit and watch the trial for a day I have no idea why I wanted to do this (laugh).  But we did this along the way we stopped at a rest stop in Sacramento [California], a bus stop and a van pulled up and out of it piled a bunch of Black Panthers and one of them and I'm embarrassed I can't remember the fellows name now but Bunchy Carter (ph. splg.) I think was his name.  And there was another guy and we all said hello and chatted and what have you and they were on their way to the same event.  Some months later both of the guys that we met that night were killed at UCLA in a clash with the Ron Karenga group and so that was a very tumultuous time.  If you went to a Black Student Association meeting at Occidental you always were a little nervous because other people might be attending who weren't from the school and therefore you didn't know them and everybody had these jackets that they wore and it was not uncommon for somebody to be "packing" and so it was a memorable time.  To be candid with you I'm glad not to be there anymore in that environment.  It was a time--it was pretty seared in your brain quite frankly.
Story_ID: 55213
Speaker 1: Okay.  The other thing I wanted to ask you about was the murder of Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in '68 [1968].  You were in college when that took place?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah so first of all I met Dr. King and I assume it was the year before.  One of my classmates from Occidental [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] and I'm drawing a mental blank on her last name, I want to say Jeannie I'm not sure what her last name was but her father was a very prominent African American minister in Los Angeles and as a result of that relationship they were and the school was able to arrange for Dr. King to come and speak to the students at school and because I was the student body president I was fortunate to be put very close to him and sat at the table with him and got to speak with him a second or two, you know, he was obviously speaking to lots of other people besides me.  But that was one of those memories that was very memorable.  Some people have asked me about it and I've said that the thing I remembered most about it which is going to sound very very strange but it was that his hands were incredibly soft.  That when he shook my hand and I don't know why I remember that but that was sort of a little awe inspiring.  When I think about the fact that he was only in his thirties, you know, at the time he seemed like a "really old man" to me.  But you think about the things that he did and accomplished at that age.  I think the following year; I think that's when he was assassinated.  You know it was-I think like for everybody it was a just an incredibly emotional--.
Speaker 1: Yeah did the campus do something to commemorate him?
Speaker 2: The campus was pretty much shut down.  There were lots of memorials and what have you.  You have to excuse me I'm getting a little emotional about it.  It's been a long time but--.
Story_ID: 55214
Speaker 1: So the assassination of Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--were there riots in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: You know I have think about that for a second.  I should know.
Speaker 1: It would probably didn't reach all the way out to Occidental [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Well no we were isolated but you would have known.  There were so many riots at so many different times and I don't remember whether there riots in Los Angeles over that.  I mean Los Angeles you got to remember had obviously just as I was coming to Occidental in '65 [1965] it had famous Watts [Los Angeles, California] riots which were something that this country had never seen before and so in Watts I think there was almost a certain wariness about this kind of urban violence that I sort of remember.  But I wouldn't swear to it.  You would know history about better than I would and obviously subsequent to that time with things like Rodney King and what have you there was some very significant sort of uprisings and things and upheaval after that.  But I don't remember--I don't think there were riots in Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 55215
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just in terms of power, I just wonder like Los Angeles' police department, of course, got a lot of attention in the Rodney King--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Not new.
Speaker 1: I just wonder how you were treated as minority students at a white campus like Occidental not necessarily by the university but by the surrounding community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you were--so the answer would be with regard to campus I don't think anybody would perceive any significant problems, in fact, I actually think that there had been racial tensions on campus in more recent years, more significant than would have been the case in those days.  Because I actually do believe that most white students in that time period essentially bought the notion of inequality and that African Americans had a legitimate grievance and so there wasn't a lot of, at least outward, dissention on that point.  I think that if you go to campuses today you will find a much more vocal group of white students who dispute that premise and as a result that can lead to clashes which did not really exist to any large degree even if people thought it in the '65 [1965] to '69 [1969] period that didn't say it and so on campus life was pretty much I would say generally okay.  Off campus I don't think there were any real issues in terms of you know going into the community, going to the local store or what have you if you chose to do that.  Most students tended not to do it just because it wasn't all that much to do to be candid.  The area has become a lot more I would describe it as user friendly now.  My daughter lives in that area now and I go visit her sometime.  She didn't go to Occidental but she's in that area and I sometimes chuckle at it.  What you knew however was that white or black if you looked a certain way that you wanted to be careful with the Los Angeles police force.  One of my sort of earlier amusing incidents was a friend of mine who was white, who was from Chicago [Illinois] who had decided that he was going to let his hair kind of go very much the sixties style and quite long and a little frizzy and what have you and I had my afro.  He had gotten a car, his parents had given him a car and the car did not have the proper-it had sort of temporary plates and what have you on it.  We were driving in an area not too far from campus and we were pulled over by a policeman and my friend, his name Conway Collis (ph. splg.).  Conway, I think not having been raised the way I had been raised around policemen, Conway immediately started reaching for his glove compartment and I through the mirror was able to see the policeman immediately go into a crouch.  And I said Conway cool it,  take your hands put them on the steering wheel and just behave yourself and wait until the guy comes up here and talks to you.  Everything was fine after that but I do think that we were probably pulled over as much for the fact that we were interracial, we both had long hair; we probably looked like we were up to something at least in the minds of people in those days and the Los Angeles police force had a reputation of being not fun to deal with and if they did stop you they tended to be a little difficult.  I had at least a couple of incidents where I got tickets and wasn't overly happy with my treatment though I don't think I had anything to call Johnnie Cochran about.
Story_ID: 55216
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I was just thinking that the times being what they were, you were thinking about power and did the black students talk about ownership around those things, I mean what we owned and didn't own?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think I was and this may have been a function of the type of student that was attracted to Occidental but I think I was viewed as somewhat unique if not strange for the decision to go a business route as opposed to a law school route.  It wasn't really I would describe it as sort top of mind topic.  Now control and power in the sense of wanting to have an influence over the curriculum, wanting there to be more black faculty, those kinds of issues were on people's minds.  And the famous incident at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, California] you probably know about with the shooting [Black Panther Shooting, 1969] largely broke out over control of a cultural center that had been funded, I guess, by the university.  So in that sense people were worried about control but if you think about it they were fighting over control of something that was so small as to be almost infinitesimal.  If it weren't so tragic it would be humorous if you think about it in hindsight.
Story_ID: 55217
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now Harvard--did you work during the summer after you graduated?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I worked for a sort of kind of a quasi-consulting firm that was doing a project with UCLA and my then wife and I because we got married our senior year at Occidental, this is the mother of my son.  So we did that together and finished the summer and then headed east to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: So did you meet her at Occidental [Occidental College, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes she was a year behind me at Occidental.  So now having decided after years of preparing to be a lawyer that I'm going to go to business school and having now developed, I don't know if I want to describe it as arrogance or self-confidence (laugh), what one describe it but by that point I had been able to conquer just about anything I had set--I talked myself into not being student president and then all of a sudden I'm running the place and then I get to Occidental and I'm running the place.  And so Harvard Business School, after all these are the business school students they couldn't possibly be as smart as the people that go to law school.  Since I had gotten into all the law schools I, of course, was convinced that my intellectual prowess was much greater than most of these individuals.  So I arrived at Harvard somewhat full of myself though I must confess never having been east driving into an eastern city for the first time and not being accustomed to anything that's really old that was quite a shock and I give my first wife a lot of credit because I was about ready to turn around and go back east and take UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, California] up on their offer.  She persuaded me I would be stupid to do that and so off I went.

Speaker 1: What I quickly discovered at Harvard Business School was that I was in no way prepared.  That all I had was somewhat of an analytical skill; that I had the ability to work very hard but that I had been dropped into an environment where if people were speaking Arabic or Greek or Korean or what have you I wouldn't have known because they were speaking a language that I knew nothing about.  So my--it's a two year program.  My first year after classes I would go to the library, Baker Library and simply immerse myself in the stacks of magazines, Fortune and Forbes and what have you and basically read articles about people whose names would come up in class. Because if they would mention a corporate raider by the name of Jimmy Ling (ph. splg.) in class and what he had done and why this was smart and what have you.  Well I had no idea who Jimmy Ling was and so I had to very quickly get myself acculturated to the environment and spent my first year basically just using whatever aptitude I had and fortitude and what have you to survive the place.  Which, you know, I didn't do too badly in that environment.  Harvard Business School was if I could just add a quick comment--so now I'm in the East and for the first time I find myself with I would describe it as people who are ostensibly liberal and who are ostensibly on my side but who unlike my friends on the West Coast white who seemed to accept my premise of whatever I thought the path should be, at Harvard it was exactly the opposite.  That it was we know best somewhat paternalistic and we're going to tell you what you should do.  And my class of African Americans was by far the largest group that had ever been allowed in the Harvard Business School.  I think there were about seventy of us out of class of about eight hundred.  It was the first time in my memory where I was expected to fail as opposed to succeed.  The Harvest News which is the campus newspaper, I think it still exists, had an article the first week of school that indicated that faculty members-unnamed faculty members felt that the flunk out rate they called it hitting the screen at Harvard would be much higher than had historically been the case because the implication was that the school had allowed in a much larger percentage of people who probably were not qualified to be there.  And so if there was ever any doubt that the African American students would coalesce and become reasonably cohesive, it was in that environment. And so the freshman, the first year was quite an interesting experience for me and it I could tell you anecdotes forever we would end up with a nineteen hour interview.  But there were lots of times during that year that ended up being very interesting and helped formed probably my personality as I went further into my adult business career.
Story_ID: 55219
Speaker 1: Well give us one anecdote.
Speaker 2: Well at the end of the first year in those days the school had a game that all the students competed in and it was essentially a business model game and some of the African American students decided that they had had enough of the expectation of or the perception of inferiority and so they challenged the school administration to allow the black students to voluntarily opt into a "all black corporation," the abc corporation and much to their surprise and probably and much against the better judgment of the administration today or then they agreed to it and so we formed an all black corporation to compete against everybody else.  And the way it worked if you know Harvard Business School you have sections there are ten sections of about eighty students a piece and each section was broken into three for this game so that you would have thirty teams competing and they were able to organize it in such a way that African American students had one of the thirty slots.  For any number of reasons which I won't bore you with we started off sort of middle of the pack in competing in this and as we started to get to the end of the game we were in first place.  We were on the verge of winning the game through-I have learned over the years small details count and someone entered our final submission with just a tiny error in it but that ended moving us from first to second.  But what was interesting about the experience was that as each day went by and we were winning this game many of our fellow classmates decided this game didn't matter anymore and began to dismiss it as infantile and silly and not realistic and what have you.  So that was a real eye opener for me and for some of my fellow classmates.  But we were extremely pleased with the way it came out.  So, as I said there were lots of incidents like that.
Story_ID: 55220
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any black business instructors at Harvard?
Speaker 2: I have to think about that for a second.  I don't think so at the time.  There have been any number since that time, folks like Jim Cash (ph. splg.) and others but I don't think there were black business instructors at that time.
Speaker 1: Well who of the instructors stand out in your mind or the personalities on campus?
Speaker 2: Well I again, there were at any point in your life I'm sure you've had the same experience that there are people who will say something that sticks with you.  That alters the course for you so for me there were two that made a big difference for me.  One was a guy by the name of Samuel Hayes who was at that time the "professor" of investment banking.  I had decided that I wanted by that time I had decided that the way that I was going to pursue my business career was going to be in the world of real estate development.  I wanted to build big projects; I wanted to emulate a guy by the name of Rouse who has built new cities; who has built major developments like Faneuil Hall in Boston and I'm trying to think of the name of the big city that's in the sort of Baltimore Washington area I can't think of the name of it but it's a whole city that he basically built.  I had this notion that this is something that I wanted to do and I knew that doing this took a lot of other people's money and that somehow or another I had a vague notion that these investment bankers had something to do with that.  So I decided to take the class and I had decided at some point, this is now my second year, I had decided at some point that I wasn't all that interested in engaging in the classroom dialogue which is a very important part of the business school process.  But for a lot of reasons I had chosen not to engage.  When the midterm came I wrote I guess a pretty good exam and so Sam Hayes, the professor, pulled me aside and he said you know I read your exam, you're smarter than I thought you were which is not an unfair statement because I never said anything in his class unless I was called upon and had to.  He asked me what I was going to be doing the next year and I told him my aspiration about real estate and blah blah.  And so he suggested that I actually consider interviewing with some of the investment banks and I was extremely opposed to that.  My impression of investment banks was that most of them had gone to Andover.  They had been in the navy or gone to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].  That they came from what I would describe as sort of the "blue blood" background and I had about as much chance of either getting hired or succeeding in that environment and didn't think that would make me happy.  And he persuaded me that every firm that that was starting to change on Wall Street.  That it was becoming for better or worse much more of a cut throat meritocracy and persuaded me give it a try and I reluctantly interviewed two firms.  One which is very notorious these days called Goldman Sachs and the other one Merrill Lynch. For whatever reason I hated Merrill Lynch from the minute I walked in the interview and I think it's fair to say they hated me.  That did not go very well (laugh) and for whatever reason I had a great interview with the people at Goldman Sachs and even though I had very little idea of what they really did I thought this was an amazing opportunity at the age of twenty two to get a chance to work there so that's where I ended up working.
Story_ID: 55221
Speaker 1: The second professor was a guy named Hugo Iderhoven (ph. splg.) which I believe is a h and a u but I don't remember exactly how to spell his name.  But he was a very, very popular professor.  He taught courses in human behavior in organizations and again in my classic style I had said very little in his class so after my midterm exam he pulled me aside and he looked at me and he said Mr. Cornwell I'm here to tell you that you are a great listener it's obvious from your exam but Harvard Business School only partially rewards listeners (laugh).  So I decided oh that's good advice.  So, again as I said there are things that you recall and then and he had in his own small way an impact on my life.  So those would be the two that I probably identify from that period.
Story_ID: 55222
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about your classmates, any significant classmates?
Speaker 2: Well a lot of friendships and I've stayed in touch with a variety of people.  A fellow in Washington, DC by the name of Mickey Countee, Thomas Countee, C-O-U-N-T-E-E spelled like Countee Cullen.  He and I became very close; we sort of lost a little touch in the last two years but he was a very interesting character.  He became a paraplegic, he had a diving accident when he was in college and so he is in a wheel chair and so I always had great admiration for him.  Just in the way he was able to continue to persevere and accomplish things.  If I started going down a list it would be a lengthy list but we were relatively close knit.  And there were a few of us that were closer than others but even spreading it beyond that I will occasionally friend someone on Facebook and we will catch up a little bit and what have you.  The other day I ran into a guy that it turned out his sister had been pretty big deal executive at NBC who I had known and was only by coincidence that she said you really ought to meet my brother.  So we agreed to get together for lunch and I googled him and I saw his picture and I said I know this guy and it turned out that we were classmates at Harvard Business School.  I just had forgotten the name and what have you.  So it was a good time in that respect.
Speaker 1: Did any of your classmates go on to do something, you know I guess to say significant?
Speaker 2: You know a number of people went off into small businesses and started businesses and did reasonably well for themselves.  I had an interesting class.  I want to describe it as follows: we really represented in a sense kind of what you would describe as a first okay in many ways.  By first I mean this is the first time Harvard Business School had decided to admit a large number of African Americans into the school.  Historically they had admitted anywhere from one to two then it kind of edged up to about ten to twenty and in our year which was in the time period of all the turmoil based on some pressure they decided to admit a much larger group.  And I would say that they admitted a lot of students who didn't really have a clear sense of what they were going to do with this degree, okay.  In other words it was I guess I would describe it as it's a good thing to be admitted to Harvard, I mean that's like huge.  Harvard Business School, The West Point of Capitalism that's huge but as my son is fond of saying that's kind of the beginning not the end point.  And so a lot of my classmates I would say were somewhat underutilized post-graduation.  Whether it was through their own fault, maybe not really understanding how to make the system work for them so I don't have--I'm very good friends with a guy named Ken Chenault of American Express. Ken is a Harvard Law graduate and every summer he has a group of classmates out to his house and I'm always sort of struck by from that time period there were more success stories post Harvard Business School or post graduate school I should say from the law school than from the business school.  Which is starting to change there have been some really terrifically successful people in later years.  So I don't know if I'm adding much to your question but that's how I would describe it.
Story_ID: 55223
Speaker 1: There is another aspect to this.  How much--you spoke of your trepidation of entering Harvard Business School--entering investment banking because of the inherent advantages that people had in business.  When you look back on it now do you think--it is the first big class of black student as you said you think they don't--you think they were--could the expectations of what people had for what they were going to do have anything to do with whether they met them or not?
Speaker 2: Well, if I were to try to do a totally nonscientific study and correlate something in my class with those that achieved a reasonable amount of success.  I had one classmate for instance who became a partner of a big real estate development firm called Trammel Crow (ph.) down in Texas.  But if I were to try to do a correlation I would say and this is going to sound terrible, it's going to sound controversial and I don't want to sound that way but I would say that those of us who had been forced by our parents to go to integrated colleges and who had been fully engaged in those colleges so that we were sort of running stuff whether it was black stuff or white stuff or both or what have you I think we were better prepared to then go the next step and to go into a place like Goldman Sachs and by the way it was hard (laugh).  But to navigate through kind of very difficult, uncharted terrain if you follow what I'm saying.  And so I think that the flip side of the wonderful stuff that I missed by not going to say Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] just to pick that as a school, was that I was forced to learn how to adapt.  It was a little bit like going to a foreign country, okay.  As a young person and I suspect that that probably had an impact on my ability to then go into largely white--I mean I was the first African American ever hired in investment banking at Goldman Sachs.  And so just the ability to kind of keep ones wits about oneself and maybe I learned from my grandparents and parents that "always keep moving."  If they're going to not let you be a teacher in Oklahoma you can be a teacher in the state Washington.  So there are just skill sets that everybody kind of picks up on along the way but as I said this is like totally unscientific and I've had friends of mine from particularly college days [at Occidental College, Los Angeles, California] who would eviscerate my argument in a heartbeat.  But that's about the only thing I can think of that would make that difference.
Story_ID: 55224
Speaker 1: Well I was going to say that even in those somewhat more segregated settings my experience was largely with black students.  I think that by going to the high school that I went to and sort of navigating my way through that it helped me.  Having said that when I think what my own neighborhood was like there were enormous benefits to that somewhat more segregated environment and so those were the--I think those were a lot of the challenges we face today because I don't think we've been able quite figure out how to model it all so that it works as well for us and that's the struggle.
Speaker 2: What you are saying is we haven't learned how to protect ourselves in an integrated environment?
Speaker 1: Well I think how to give our children the benefits of both.  To give them the skills they need.  Just as a quick comment I always found, not always--I occasionally would find that some people I would run into that had not had a more integrated experience could sometimes be almost naive in their expectations about what was going happen; what was going to happen that either good or bad.  And maybe I'm too cynical, okay too paranoid or what have you but--and I don't think I'm--I know people way worse than I am but I just had a way of sort of sizing situations up that's intuitively was different.  I think a lot of it is just because of experiences in life and that's necessarily reflected on how one might feel about African Americans or black people because you can size that situation up in either community and know how to navigate if you follow what I'm saying as opposed to not navigating.  So it's not just about being integrated, I think it's developing skill sets.  Maybe we need more mentors, you've asked about that.
Story_ID: 55225
Speaker 1: Goldman Sachs so you were the first one--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was the first one in the investment banking division to the best of my knowledge.  It may have been somebody before me but I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You didn't find his remains and so what happened (unclear) and what did you learn from there?
Speaker 2: Well it was-I spent seventeen years there.  As you may recall I went there with this idea that I was going to someday go off and have a business and so I realized-I was only twenty two so I figured by the time I was twenty five, twenty six I was going to be there out of there.  That this was just going to be a short stop along the way and it actually ended up being one of the more meaningful experiences of my life.  I learned an enormous amount.  I had never really had much work experience before--in a business sense before going there and so in a sense I kind of did a post graduate program by being around all these companies that Goldman Sachs does business with and you would get assigned.  I describe it as and you have to realize that this was the Goldman Sachs of 1971, '71 [1971] to '88 [1988].  It's a very different place today much bigger.  When I joined, there were maybe fifteen hundred employees worldwide and so very quickly you knew everyone.  So whether it was Gus [Gustave] Levy who was the head of the firm in those days or John Weinberg and John Whitehead who ultimately became the head of the firm.  Or Bob [Robert] Ruben who was the secretary of the treasury but became the head of the firm and then you can go down the list.  I knew them all and Hank [Henry] Paulsen started at Goldman Sachs a year after I did.  So it was a--I would describe it as a small somewhat close knit place.  Hard to get into, extremely hard to get into but once you were sort of in then you were kind of sort of part of the club not really, okay.  As a black person I want to be candid and clear about that but I always felt like if nothing I was running hard to keep up.  I was working with incredibly bright people many of whom had a lot more experience than I had but also a lot of brain power.  And I would be honest and say that at least one or two of them had more brain power than I did at least one or two.  And so it was a very challenging I would describe it as collegial environment.  I made a lot friends and over time I guess I developed a reputation which served in pretty good stead in that I wasn't cut out to be a investment banker it was not what I'd really set out to do.  I had really set out to learn something and then move on to something else but over a period of time now I'm married and I have a son and so I'm enjoying the fact that I'm doing reasonably well, financially making a decent income and what have you.  Not getting rich but doing a lot better than I ever thought I would do frankly growing up in Tacoma, Washington.
Story_ID: 55226
Speaker 1: And you know I've got a son but as sometimes happen in life my first wife and I decided that we would probably should go our separate ways and by coincidence it was about the same time that my parents separated.  About my son's eighth or ninth birthday something like that, I don't know whether I'm drawing significance about it but it's just historical.  And so I wanted because I felt very strongly about the fact that I felt I don't know if I want to use the word abandoned but I felt very distant from my father when he asked me those questions and he said I don't really know the answer.  I was determined to be deeply involved with my son's life and so my wife and I--my then wife and I decided to do something that was relatively unusual at the time which was that we were going to have a very active joint custody arrangement and that our son would live part of the time with her and part of the time with me.  There are pluses and minuses to that I'm not sure how great it is for the kid but it makes the parents feel a lot better.  So that meant that this life that I had had of being a client service investment banker which meant if a client called you in the morning and said I need you on a plane this afternoon, you get on a plane and you might be gone for two or three days.  That was a little more difficult if now my son is sitting at home after school wanting to know where is the hamburger, dad.  So I went to a fellow his name is Peter Sacerdote who had only recently become my boss and who had just taken over our department basically told them that I was going to leave the firm.  That I was feeling that I was not able to fulfill my duties as a parent and at the same time be what I needed to be to be successful in the world of Goldman Sachs and that it might be better for me to look for something else.  He urged me to take a little time to think about that and that he wanted to actually talk to a few people because he was just getting to know me.  And I guess the reputation that I had which I didn't realize I had was that I was very good at organizing stuff and very good at mentoring people and that I had a reasonable amount of respect even though I don't think anybody thought that I was the best investment banker in the world.  But that I was respected by the bankers and that I was not afraid of them because we were all peers.  So he asked me to be his number two, to become the chief operating officer [COO] for the entire department which was a very big job because we were about to grow dramatically in size.  We ended up I think we ended up with about a hundred and fifty professionals by the time I was leaving and then all the support staff.  We implemented a lot of technological advances and what have you that were new to Wall Street.  So I ended up and this is my way of saying that I ended having thought I was going to leave there three or four years after starting and I ended up having a seven year run purely as an investment banker--actually ten year run and then a seven year run where I was both an investment banker and a manager.
Story_ID: 55227
Speaker 1: Okay so let's get the dates straight.  So you started in '71 [1971] and in '81 [1981]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And so I'm glad you asked me this because I am going to straighten this out.  It would have been 1980 I believe that I then took over the operational role and so--.
Speaker 1: So you're CEO?
Speaker 2: Chief Operating Officer [COO] of the corporate finance department.  It's a department within investment banking.  Very important department for a lot of different reasons.  They changed in a lot of ways since I left but-because it's gotten even bigger but in those days it was kind of a very core element of the professional staffing of the investment banking division.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you take that job in 1980, roughly 1980 and then remain there until '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Until '88 [1988] when I left and I would say that during that time I learned a lot.  Peter [Sacerdote] who passed away a year ago is and was a lifelong friend was a great mentor, a great boss and I loved his style because no nonsense.  If you are doing something good you would know it and if you hadn't done what he wanted (laugh) he didn't mince any words and so it made life very clear.  You were able to live up to expectations because you knew what the expectations were.  Which by the way for many African Americans at least in my generation, I don't know what it's like today but I think that a lot of African Americans find that bosses are not always willing to be as candid as they should be in terms of what's expected and also helpful in terms of thinking about how to navigate the future and I was extremely blessed in having a boss who really cared about me as a person who I think was extremely impressed with the fact that I wanted to be involved with my son and so he would give me a lot of great life advice but he was also as I said a great boss because I always--I knew he had my back.  There were times when I ended up having to battle--friends like that there are battles internally all the time over allocation of resources and sometimes I was a little too aggressive (laugh) in my expectations of what we were entitled to.  And Peter was always great at protecting my back and occasionally taking me aside to explain to me that I might have to take a half a loaf not a full loaf and here is why but he was really a terrific boss.  So I did that for seven, eight whatever the number from '80 [1980] to '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: This is Peter [Sacerdote] what was his last name again?
Speaker 2: Sacerdote it's S-A-C-E-R-D-O-T-E.  He was Jewish and Italian and I think part of the reason he related to me in a weird sort of way his family fled Italy during the war, you know, because of the Nazis and came to this country.  And so he unlike many in the world of investment banking who have been more privileged, I think he sort of identified with the underdog and I think he kind of liked me for a lot different, who knows, reasons.
Story_ID: 55228
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in--as we get towards the time that you leave Goldman Sachs what are you doing?
Speaker 2: So what happened was that as it always happens in organizations I was very closely in line with Peter.  Peter was a rising star in the organization but his star was not as bright as some others and so Peter in affect got beat out for a larger job and the fellow who beat him out had a reputation of not being very I guess I would put it supportive of those who were deemed to be "on the other side" and so I felt having been extremely close to Peter that my career was probably going to stall at that point in the firm and I was also approaching the age of forty.  I had had this aspiration to be in business for myself for a long time and had spent a lot of time probably four or five years before that flirting with this a bit back channel with people, talking about ideas and exploring opportunities and what have you and I decided that if I'm ever going to do this, this is the time to do it.  I need to take my own fate into my own hands.  One of the benefits of the job that I had was that I got to continue to have clients and some of the clients that I had picked for myself were media related which had--I had always liked media, consumer products, etc.  In the process of that I had one client that owned television stations and I got an opportunity to spend a fair amount of time looking at their stations and that's how I got the idea that there might be an opportunity for me.
Story_ID: 55229
Speaker 1: Plus again going back to Nixon [President Richard Nixon], for a guy who is essentially a democrat and it's amazing how some of the republicans had actually done some things that were actually pretty good.  Under Nixon there was created at the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], a policy that encouraged minority ownership call a tax certificate.  I learned about this through reading and what have you and I decided that this was actually a terrific, made for me because I felt that my background as a banker made me probably better than most at not only being able to understand how it worked but able to explain to others who might own stations how we could make this work to their benefit and an tangible, value creating way.  So I set about to start trying to explore opportunities to buy stations and along the way had become friendly with a fellow whose name is Stewart Beck, B-E-C-K.  Stewart's a white guy.  He was a classmate of another good friend of mine and we had met, we had done a little business together; some investing and what have you and so he and I started talking about the idea of starting a company.  He had access to lots of owners in the television business through his father and friends of his father who were engaged in the business and so this was a very good partnership for me because in order to get an audience where I could explain to somebody how this tax certificate could be very valuable to their family, I needed to first have somebody introduce me to somebody who actually owned a TV station (laugh).  So through that connection I met an old man his name Bob Rich, R-I-C-H in of all places Duluth, Minnesota.  He and I had a long lunch and talked about families and children and aspirations and I then told him what I wanted to do and he got intrigued and he did me a favor which was that he knew I had no money (laugh) and he gave me in affect an option so to speak if you want to call it that to go out and try to pull together the money to buy this TV station and that's how we got started.
Story_ID: 55230
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That actually started in 1987 and as I got into early 1988 I realized that I was going to be able to accomplish this and at that point I told--I had told my boss Peter Sacerdote in '87 [1987] what I was doing and in '88 [1988] I told more people at Goldman Sachs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it all came together toward '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you were able to get investors?
Speaker 2: And we completed our first transaction.  We bought two stations; we bought KBJR which is the NBC affiliate in Duluth, Minnesota and we bought WEEK which is the NBC affiliate in Peoria, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Home of Richard Pryor.
Speaker 2: Home of Richard Pryor, in fact, his son worked at our station for awhile.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just for the record, what did his son do?
Speaker 2: His son-he did sort of technical work sort of the behind the camera type stuff.  But his real avocation--he was sort of a, I guess the best way to put it was kind of a cross dressing entertainer.  I mean he had a little bit of a career.  Peoria is one of these weird little towns that it's sort of midway between Chicago [Illinois] and St. Louis [Missouri]  and back in the period of prohibition was sort of a famous place where people who wanted to misbehave in Chicago or St. Louis didn't want to misbehave there they would go to Peoria.  So Peoria had a long history being a town of brothels and bars and speakeasies and what have you.  And so even to this day there are some famous clubs that occasionally would be featured on a television show that are still kind of thriving in the city.  Good Midwestern stock.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Not just Caterpillar. Okay these two stations--these were your first two stations?
Speaker 2: First two stations, yes.
Story_ID: 55231
Speaker 1: Now when you purchased these stations were these the first two stations that were partly owned or owned by an African American?
Speaker 2: They weren't.  There was a group that had preceded--always called them the doctors and dentists and I don't remember the names of any of them.  But there was a group of doctors and dentists who for some reason had been persuaded to buy a TV station up in--there was one in Wisconsin in a very small town I want to say maybe Fond du Lac or someplace, I probably don't have it right and then another one in a small town like Bangor, Maine or someplace in that part of the world.
Speaker 1: So these same doctors and dentists bought both stations?
Speaker 2: Yes they bought both stations.  They did not run them they had a series of managers and then ultimately sold them.
Speaker 1: I'm sure I probably read about the-was your purchase broadcasted in Jet and other magazines?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah we were in everything from the Chicago Tribune to the--particularly the station that we bought in--because WEEK is a powerhouse little station.  It's been the station of the year in Illinois probably if they had given the award thirty times they have won it twenty.  It was a fairly big deal to buy that station so the Tribune wrote about us and what have.  The other thing and I just say this, the other thing that got people's attention was that we had--we wanted to have some African American investors.  We knew we could get money from Goldman Sachs and from some others but we wanted some African American investors and so we were able among others but this was the one that was the most significant.  We were able to persuade Oprah Winfrey to be an investor with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oprah's career at that time was-she was taking off.
Speaker 2: She was still big, I mean she was big by the time we went to see her but she became even bigger.
Speaker 1: Right.  She was about maybe four or five years in.
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did it work out?  Were you able to--were they profitable stations?
Speaker 2: Yes and now are you talking in general for the whole company in other words over the scheme of the twenty one years or just these two?
Speaker 1: Well the beginning did it seem like you--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah we had a basic thesis.  The thesis was that which is going to sound terrible but you have to be objective about life.  Our belief was that electronic information was taking over print and that the local newspaper was essentially declining in its significance in these small towns and that local television stations were going to become more important and because of the immediacy.  Now, of course, the internet was not something that was on our radar screen in those days.  So we approached both of these stations with the notion of being a, I would like to describe it as an important citizen in the local community and being a leader so to speak.  But at the same time pretty cost conscious.  So we exceeded our expectations our first year much to the surprise of my old friends at Goldman Sachs who never thought they'd get their money back.  Goldman's smart they sold a little early so they ended up doing better than some did.  But yeah we got off to a very good start.
Story_ID: 55232
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a--what was your management philosophy in terms of your business philosophy and did you have any cultural aspirations for your stations--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well you know, I think that the way I looked at it was if I'm buying a NBC [National Broadcasting Company] affiliate which by definition is a broad based audience as opposed to a narrow based audience that I'm going to operate in that fashion and try to maximize that.  If I wanted to be I hate to use the word narrow because that sounds narrow but if I wanted to be targeted than I wouldn't have paid the price that I paid for these assets because they are pretty expensive stations.  Having said that, our basic premise in most of our communities we were successful with it and that was to be the station that everybody of importance in the town or city wanted to be associated with our station whether it was advertisers or the mayor or local community leaders, etc.  So we worked very hard at developing a truly deep local presence.  I became very close to mayors of Peoria [Illinois] and other such people because our belief was that we couldn't be distant so we would journey out to Peoria, Duluth [Minnesota] or Fresno [California] or Syracuse [New York] or different markets and spend time there.  And the reason for that is that unlike a major city like New York [New York] where a local TV station, channel four here--Sue Simmons who is a long time anchor is about to retire.  Very popular, very well known in the city and of some significance but I will tell you that in Peoria--Tom McIntyre who is still the anchor on our own station there is a huge deal in Peoria and we wanted to make sure that people took advantage of the fact that these stations have more presence and importance to the local community if you emphasize that and therefore that can be good business okay to be candid about it.  But it also, I think preserves and enhances the franchise in terms of your ability to compete into the future.  So cultural I'm not sure I would describe it as cultural but I would describe as very community oriented.  We raise a lot of money in communities, in Peoria.  The largest telethon for the St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Memphis historically the most dollars raised in the country is raised right there in Peoria at our station.  It's just an event that community had adopted over the years.  And so they give if there is a tornado someplace and our stations would mobilize and raise money and give to the Red Cross and what have you and we would raise I would describe it as pretty significant amounts of money when you consider how small these communities are.  I think that was--our view was if you want to be the leader you got to lead.  So that was kind of our approach to broadcasting.
Story_ID: 55233
Speaker 1: I should have said community service rather that cultural.  Okay so these were the first two then how did things--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Then we just started-business operations went pretty well but we ran into--we started at the end of '88 [1988] so we had '89 [1989] and '90 [1990] and then '91 [1991] was a desert storm which had a disrupting effect on sort of advertising confidence and so '91 [1991] was a very rough year for us.  We decided to begin to put more capital into our company.  We had not put enough in initially so we decided we would go public and by that time we had bought two more stations.  We bought a station in Fort Wayne, Indiana an ABC [American Broadcasting Company] affiliate and we bought what was then the ABC affiliate for the city of San Jose, California.  Just as a quick comment that station is now the NBC [National Broadcasting Company] affiliate for all of the Bay Area [California] which we converted many years later but that's another story.
Story_ID: 55234
Speaker 1: Alright we are talking about two--this gives you four stations, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah so we [Granite Broadcasting] bought from two separate owners both newspaper companies. We bought San Jose [California] and Fort Wayne [Indiana] so now we have four stations and at that point we decided that we needed to bring an outside capital so we decided to go public with the four stations which we did.  And then after that--so we went public the end of '91 [1991] and then I don't remember the exact date but I would say 1993 we then bought two more stations.  We bought a CBS affiliate in Syracuse [New York] and a NBC [National Broadcasting Company] affiliate in Fresno [California] and then in '95 [1995] we bought the ABC [American Broadcasting Company] affiliate for Buffalo [New York] and we bought the CBS affiliate for Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo [Michigan] television market okay and we also bought I believe in '96 [1996] a television station in Austin, Texas.  And I describe it as a television station because when we bought it, it was a Fox [Broadcasting Company] affiliate but because of some activity in that market that involved Rupert Murdoch, we ended up becoming the CBS affiliate for Austin, Texas and that station is still the CBS [Broadcasting, Inc.] affiliate for Austin, Texas.
Story_ID: 55235
Speaker 1: So how--you care to elaborate on that?
Speaker 2: On what?
Speaker 1: The Fox--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was very simple Rupert Murdoch in those days--this was '95 [1995], '96 [1996] he had decided that he wanted to own a lot more affiliated television stations and he has a--and most of his affiliation agreements he has a provision which says that if he can buy a television station in a market he has the right to take the affiliation away from the other station and put it on his.  And so just as we [Granite Broadcasting] had a handshake deal with the owner of the Fox [Broadcasting Company] affiliate in Austin, Texas Rupert announced that he was buying a group of stations which included the station in Austin which had been the CBS [Broadcasting, Inc.] affiliate but was now going to become the Fox affiliate.  So using some connections and what have you we went to CBS and persuaded them that they should give us the affiliation and we had to commit to them because our station did not do any sort of news cast.  We had to commit that we would have a newscast on the air and so in something like eight months we rebuilt the station and put a newscaster on the air and started off--didn't do too badly.  I think we did a good job for them.
Story_ID: 55236
Speaker 1: It does sound risky though because you were building a local, I guess a local news and local programming into--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well this is the first market we [Granite Broadcasting] had gone into where we were not buying a long standing news franchise and so--and it was humbling because we discovered that habits are hard to break and that even though we did a couple of very smart things that forced, not forced but encouraged sampling of our station.  We, to be candid, quickly dropped to be the number three news station in the market because old patterns resurfaced and people went back to what they were used to doing.  They watched the team on what used to be the CBS [Broadcasting, Inc.] station but now Fox [Broadcasting Company] but still largely the same team that watched that station.  And then the ABC [American Broadcasting Company] station in town that had historically been pretty strong and they watched that as well as the NBC [National Broadcasting Company] station.  So that was a more challenging thing.  We were pretty proud of the way we pulled it all off because it--in fact I think the CBS people were surprised at how seamless it all went.  I think in the photos that I left you there is a picture of me sitting with Dan Rather and that was in that timeframe because we--as we launched that station and we wanted to brand it with CBS it turned out that Dan Rather is from that part of the world.  He was turning sixty and so we decided that we would give a sixtieth birthday party for him which he was happy to come and participate in and it allowed us to get a little more local press so to speak because of his presence.
Story_ID: 55237
Speaker 1: That was a good idea. (unclear) So now you've got like sounds like eight stations?
Speaker 2: Yeah something like that.  So there was more and so if I can just continue to tick them off.  So we [Granite Broadcasting] bought Austin [Texas], bought Buffalo [New York], Kalamazoo [Michigan], Syracuse [New York], Fresno [California], San Jose [California], Duluth [Minnesota] and Peoria [Illinois].  Then we decided and this is one of the big mistakes of my career we decided that we had missed the phenomenon of Fox [Broadcasting Company] and that we wanted to try to take advantage of the next opportunity that might come along and there was a new network starting called the WB Network, Warner Brothers.  We decided that maybe given Warner's long time great strength in television production and programming that that would be the right network to back, part of Time Warner, etc.  So we were wise in that but what was wrong was that we attempted to go too big with it so we had an opportunity to buy the WB Network in Detroit [Michigan] which we did and that worked out reasonably well.  Although that's a very different asset than any asset we had managed before because these are not news stations and we're used to managing news stations and they are also in much bigger communities than we were used to managing.  And we're also used to being the most important person at the party so when the African American Museum for instance opened in Detroit and the then mayor Dennis Archer was hosting a big celebration.  Dennis had always been extremely helpful to us.  I think he wanted to encourage a minority broadcaster.  Nonetheless when we showed up at the event we didn't have all of the big news trucks, celebrity anchors everybody else had.  So it was a little bit of a--it was sort of one of those times when you gulp very hard and you realize that you're really the little guy in the room.  But undeterred by that we then went off and bought the WB affiliate for San Francisco which again put us in a very big market and with a station that had even less presence to be candid than our station in Detroit.  I guess the most significant thing to say about that was that we underestimated the difficulty of managing those kinds of assets; we overestimated how much of a commitment Time Warner would make to the WB Network.  We made the mistake of assuming that they would be as single minded, as focused--say what you want about Rupert Murdoch he is single minded and focused and he wants to win.  And we made the mistake of assuming that they would operate in that same fashion which they did not so those two stations which by the way were partially paid for through the sale at very, very large profits; our station in Kalamazoo and our station in Austin we sold both of those.  We sold Austin to CBS and we sold Kalamazoo to a company called Freedom Broadcasting.  The proceeds from that plus some other financing bought Detroit and San Francisco [California] and big mistake.  Turned out to be frankly the--I wouldn't say the undoing of the company [Granite Broadcasting] because the company continues to thrive and it's doing a lot better now but it led to a six or seven year period of great difficulty for the company and for me personally.
Story_ID: 55238
Speaker 1: So it was better to be a big important station in a small town--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Than a junior in a big town.
Speaker 2: There is no question about it.  It also-- I think the more important thing is because we [Granite Broadcasting] were perfectly capable of managing successfully a big station in a big town and we proved that.  We became the NBC [National Broadcasting Company] affiliate for the Bay Area [California] in 2002 I think at the time of the--just before the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and that station was very successful and very profitable and we were competing right in the pack with all of those long time legacy stations like KGL and what have you.  But our financial condition was such that we found ourselves frankly not able to own the station and so we ended up selling it to NBC.  It's owned by NBC.  So we could have managed the station--I think the mistake we made was that we didn't really understand what we didn't know and so as a result we discovered that managing a WB [Warner Brothers] or independent no news station in a market like Detroit [Michigan] is a very different exercise than managing a NBC affiliate in Peoria [Illinois] where the mayor knows your name, calls you up and it's just a very different kind of asset.
Story_ID: 55239
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we're like almost at two thousand?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. So 2000 was an important year for us because we got the bright idea that our ABC [American Broadcasting Company] affiliate in San Jose [California]--that even though it only served in a historic sense the San Jose portion of the Bay Area [California].  If you are familiar with the bay area there is San Jose, there is kind of the peninsula, people call that Silicon Valley [California] then there is San Francisco [California] then there is the east bay with Oakland [California], Berkeley [California] and what have you.  We were technically the San Jose affiliate for ABC but our signal covered the entire market all the way up to Napa [Napa Valley, California].  We didn't have as great a signal in some of the nooks and crannies of San Francisco though but people in Oakland, Berkeley whatever they could get a signal perfectly well.  So because NBC was having a fight with its then affiliate KRON, K-R-O-N and this was public, we went to NBC [National Broadcasting Company] and said you know if you guys really are unhappy with your affiliate before you go and affiliate yourself with one of the lesser stations in town because there was a couple of other options but they didn't have nearly what we had, we said you ought to consider working with us.  And so the first thing they had to satisfy themselves was on the engineering in other words are these guys correct about what they say about the signal.  And so they did a lot of work on that and after the work they came to us and said you are right, we had no idea and so we would like to work together.  Long and short of it all a lot of different anecdotes that I could go on for way too long in that incident or that story.  But at the end of the day they ultimately decided to switch the affiliation to us and that took place in 2000 but they couldn't actually switch until 2002 because their deal with the other affiliate lasted until 2002.  That gave us we thought a wonderful amount of time where we could comfortably rebuild the station.  It needed to have a much bigger news presence than a news presence that only covered San Jose because we now have to satisfy the other communities and that would be expensive and time consuming and we didn't want to do what we did in--if we could avoid it in Austin [Texas] again which was to cram this in about seven months.  So we had 2001 to start this process but unfortunately 2001 as you may recall was a rather interesting year with 9-11 and with war breaking out and what have you.  And once again we found ourselves in a real recession from an advertiser perspective and so we were spending a very significant amount of money.  Probably over twenty million dollars to build out both with new equipment and with new people, reporters and what have you what we felt a first class news operation in the bay area.  We were doing it against a backdrop of declining revenue throughout the rest of our business and so we sort of struggled our way through 2001 and by the end of 2001 where we're ready to go in 2000 but I guess it's fair to say that NBC wanted the station.
Story_ID: 55240
Speaker 1: I think it's fair to say that NBC recognized that we were in a weakened financial position and so they made us an offer that I guess to quote an old movie "we couldn't refuse."  We decided the better part of valor was to take the offer.  We had paid forty million dollars for the station; we sold it for two hundred and fifty million.  It's hard for anybody to criticize us.  The problem was that however, it was the core--the central core to our company going forward and we had really counted on all of the profitability revenue, etc. coming out of the station to allow us the time to fix our issues in Detroit [Michigan] and also the WB p[Warner Brothers] station that we owned in San Francisco [California].  And so all of a sudden while we had some cash we also had a much sicker company at that point because we took this very profitable company out of the mix and as I said from 2002 until basically 200--well I thought until 2006, I would say until 2009.  I would describe it as extremely challenging years in my professional life.  So I'll stop and let you ask any questions.
Story_ID: 55241
Speaker 1: You said--well the company [Granite Broadcasting] is still going?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So it didn't go under.
Speaker 2: So here's what happened.  So from 2002 until 2006 we felt we had a path to fixing our financial situation and that path largely involved either selling or trading our Detroit [Michigan] and San Francisco [California] WB [Warner Brothers] stations to someone who had more value attached to them and who might either pass cash which would allow us to fix our balance sheet, pay down debt or would give us other assets which we would be more comfortable managing which had news, which had profitability, etc.  And we pushed the ball up the hill--rolled the rock up the mountain more times than I can count on both hands, toes and what have you.  Only to have it slip back down at a point and what happens in business, I tell people this all the time, it's not necessarily whether you are making money; it's whether you run out of cash.  And in our case we found lots of ways to buy ourselves more time but we ultimately started to run out of cash and we had a buyer at long last at a price that we weren't happy with but it was going to be adequate for the Detroit and San Francisco station.  This buyer was delayed in coming to the closing table until January 2006 and I will never forget this I was on an airplane and I looked at my Blackberry and I saw an email that announced that Time Warner and CBS [Broadcasting, Inc.] had decided to close the WB Network and they were going to merge and create something called the CW [Television Network] and guess what, Granite, which owned stations in both San Francisco and Detroit was left at the altar because CBS had stations in both San Francisco and Detroit and they would be getting this new network affiliation called the CW and our buyer was therefore unwilling rightfully, to proceed ahead because he would be buying a different asset that they thought he was going to buy and at that point we then decided as a company--my board of directors that we really had a financial problem.  We weren't going to be able--we saw no real easy way to deal with it so we then hired a financial advisors to approach different financial stake holders, lenders and other people who owned paper in our company to essentially as I put it, figure out who was going to own this company going forward and how we're going to get it back on a path.
Story_ID: 55242
Speaker 1: Because it's [Granite Broadcasting] a good company it's just that it had a bad balance sheet so the question is how are we going to get it so that it's back running in a fashion.  And with our going through lots of all the inside baseball about it we found ourselves negotiating as between two hedge funds that owned pieces of our company.  One owned what you would describe as the senior debt and one owned a preferred stock.  The senior debt is just that, senior and it became clear to our board that the hedge fund that owned the senior debt had a view of the company which was that we needed less debt which we all agreed with.  The hedge fund that owned the preferred stock thought we needed more debt and that because the markets would give us more debt with his backing that that was the better way to run the company.  We decided to opt for the path of less debt.  We tried to negotiate an amicable and constructive settlement with the other fellow whose style of operation is never to settle.  So at some point we decided that there is only one way you can make this happen and that is to go before a judge and have the judge be the referee because somebody has got to have some power to make something happen here.  So we voluntarily filed for bankruptcy in December of 2006 and six months we had a plan.  We presented it to the judge.  I got beat up pretty badly on the stand by the other side because they didn't like our plan and the judge agreed with our plan and so we emerged, that's the term for bankruptcy in June 2007 which meant that we sold the company at that point to the other investor, the senior debt holder.  And so that company called Silver Point Capital became the owners of the company and my management team was asked to stay on to manage it.  We were given kind of a two year sort of contracts and off we went.  This was June of 2007 as I said my belief at that point was blue sky was ahead of me, smooth waters.  We had now fixed the balance sheet; we could now get back to growing the business.  I was happy, I wasn't happy with some of the outcome; I didn't like the fact that we had to go to bankruptcy, etc.  But, you know life goes on.  Unfortunately a little thing happened called financial crisis and what was particularly happening at that time was that the automotive industry which is a huge customer for local television from an advertising point of view began to really get sick.  So 2007 and 2008 and 2009 for me as the CEO and founder of this company were extremely painful because whereas I had spent five or six years doing a lot really tough stuff and cutting costs and what have you and I thought now was time for my colleagues and me to grow the business instead we found ourselves in a situation where it was really more of the same because even though we thought we had "just the right amount of debt" we then discovered we still had too much debt.  Because we lost half of our automotive advertising and I could kind of go down the list but that was the one that really stands out the most.  And so at the end of 2009, okay my contract was up and the new owners decided that they never wanted to own anymore TV stations (laugh) which I couldn't blame them it had not been a great experience.  It's not like they historically invested in television, this was something that they did opportunistically and so it was pretty clear that it was time for me to depart.  They replaced me with one of their own people.  My chief operating officer with whom I'm very close departed at the same time.  He now runs the (unclear) NBC [National Broadcasting Company] station down in Atlanta [Georgia] and has a very big job. So that's how I got to at the beginning of this saying that I'm quasi retired because that's--the end of 2009 I left Granite and became just an active director on some corporations and in a state of retirement.
Story_ID: 55243
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back at everything you've done to this point is there anything that you would differently now?
Speaker 2: Well if you're talking specifically about Granite [Broadcasting] or just--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: About anything, Granite I guess too.
Speaker 2: Well I think that with Granite as I said at the outset clearly lessons learned.  Make sure you know what you don't know.  If I had it to do all over again, of course, I wouldn't buy the Detroit [Michigan] and San Francisco [California] station.  If I had it to do all over again with perfect 20/20 hindsight when I sold Austin [Texas] and Kalamazoo [Michigan] and San Jose [California] at really high prices in hindsight the smarter thing to have done would have been to pay off all of our debt and basically be a debt free company.  We would have had a very solid base of stations in Fort Wayne [Indiana] and Peoria [Illinois] and Duluth [Minnesota] and Syracuse [New York] and Fresno [California] all of which are nice little profitable stations and doing reasonably well, a little less with Syracuse that one is a little quirky but basically doing reasonably well.  And so if I had it to do all over again sure that's what I would do.  But having said that people ask me many times whether I regret leaving Goldman Sachs because despite their current notoriety I will say for the record it has historically been a great firm.  There are a lot of smart people there.  People of my generation made a lot of money.  Quite frankly when the company became public it wouldn't have the worst thing in the world to have shared in a little bit of that.  But I don't regret for a minute going off and pursuing this vision that I had of running a business and learned an awful lot from it.  When I say I'm quasi retired my wife gets a little shiver when she hears me say this but I'm not sure that I'm done yet.  So you never know; you have to stay tuned as they say in TV.
Story_ID: 55244
Speaker 1: What advice would you give young entrepreneur today because you've sort of been to the mountain top in a lot of ways in terms of business--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I didn't make this since this is history.  I do think this is an important point.  Our [Granite Broadcasting] station in the bay area, the NBC [National Broadcasting Company] affiliate is the first and only television station in a top five television market ever owned by an African American controlled company.  As I am fond of saying we only had it for about fifteen minutes because we had to sell it but that was something that I was very proud of and I just want to throw that in.  So advice you know I think I started with the notion that believe in yourself.  That you should really start from the premise that you can accomplish and that you have to recognize that everybody is not going to see it that way but that you shouldn't be bashful or ashamed to ask for the order to say I want to do x or y or z and if it turns out that that you don't get to do x y or z whatever that may be at that point in time that doesn't necessarily mean you should give up.  You have to just kind of settle back a bit and figure out another angle at getting around whatever obstacle you may have.  So I'm a big believer in telling people to believe in themselves.  I also urge people however, to be objective.  That there is a time when as when I told a story about being a wannabe gangster as a young man and going to the parties and having enough mother wit, sense whatever you want to say to realize I don't think that we want to go up against that gang.  I think that the ability to be objective and to be self aware and to recognize what your strengths and weaknesses are and to work at it is something that is a, I think is an attribute that I always urge young people to work on.  I guess the third thing this is sort of random thoughts and this is going to sound very weird but I was taught by a person who has been a mentor and a friend, Vernon Jordan to always say thank you and that's something that I find a lot of young people--I don't know if they just haven't been taught or that it is not popular, or common or what have you but it's amazing in business in sort of approaching or trying to do something that--trying to develop a relationship with somebody, trying to be respectful to the person that you are asking for help is a good thing.  It's amazing how people remember the small things that you do sometimes.  And I think a lot of times young people think that the most important thing is slamming the basketball into the hoop as opposed to all those tiny little things like dribbling the ball or acting like you've done something great once you have done it as opposed to acting as if you've never done it before.  Those are things that make an impression on people.  I'll stop there.
Story_ID: 55245
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: So that's a long question and there is lots of different thoughts and I'm sort of giving you a sort of visceral off the top of my head.  I see our society as one that is changing so rapidly in its composition.  I think the New York Times today has an article that talks about that the group of babies being born today. This is the first time that the majority is not Caucasian or European heritage, I guess is the way it was put.  And that's kind of an interesting fact.  Just that fact and the fact that if you go to Fort Wayne, Indiana not only is there an African American community of seven or eight, nine percent of the community but there is also a--Latino community is growing and people are shocked to realize that.  And it's my way of saying that as African Americans we're going to have to adapt to the future as we've expected the society to adapt to our needs and so I worry that we may not be spending enough time figuring out that everybody that we run into may come from a cultural heritage or history which does not necessarily automatically grant us as African Americans what we so deeply believe rightfully are I don't know if I want to say grievances but let's just say the history that we have in this country.  And I think we're going to have to adapt to the fact that the guy from Afghanistan or the guy from Columbia that runs around Brooklyn working and what have you.  Or a young African from West Africa or what have you who is working here that people don't necessarily have the historical context to America that if you go back to my talking about being in the sixties in Tacoma, Washington and Los Angeles [California].  Very different historical context that everybody sort of accepted as the ground rules for the discussion and I don't know if that's the same set of ground rules going forward.  And I so much want young African Americans to achieve.  And I think that ability to sort to see the world a little differently than maybe our parents saw it and what have you is going to be very important in achieving success in the future.
Story_ID: 55246
Speaker 1: Now once again when you look back at everything you've done to this point and you've got some other ideas percolating so but at this stage what would you say is your legacy?
Speaker 2: So I guess I would describe it as--so what am I proud of?  I'm proud of creating Granite [Broadcasting].  Granite is still thus far they haven't liquidated or broken it up (laugh) sold it in pieces; it's still an actively thriving company.  It's got a website you can go to Granitetv.com and see the company there, I'm very proud of that.  And I'm proud of the fact that with the exception of the top two guys in the company virtually everybody running anything in that company was hired by me.  And that I basically bought all those stations and managed them too.  I think some good amount of success so I'm proud of that.  I'm proud of my two children; I view that as legacy.  Great kids, the young man who in effect forced me indirectly not through any doing of his to a different career path has now become a partner at Morgan Stanley and he is doing very, very well there.  He's been there fourteen years, extremely successful and really making his way in life.  My daughter remarried.  My daughter is aspiring to be a, God forbid, a journalist in the music world or online, etc. living out of Los Angeles [California] and struggling with the economic consequences of that which I'm sure you can relate to based on your history that you told me.  But I'm extremely proud of her and so I view that as part of my legacy.  I guess I would say that despite my lack of knowledge about a lot of the history of my family, I'm very proud of my family.  I have a great older sister who is really a terrific person and I have a younger brother who is unfortunately disabled and has been since he was very young.  He and I have become extremely close in recent years and that's something that I'm very proud of.  I don't know if that's a legacy but it's something that when you asked me what I think about what makes me happy, that makes me happy.  And I've been very fortunate my first wife was a terrific woman and remain friends after all these years and I was fortunate to find another mate who I will spend the rest of my life with who is really a terrific mother and a terrific friend.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything that we haven't covered before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You know I'm sure I'll think about something afterwards but I don't have anything that immediately pops to mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  So I'm not sure if I can articulate this very well but-so when my mother passed away two years ago I was called upon to speak at her services which I was very afraid to do because as you can tell I get a little emotional and I was afraid that I wasn't going to be able to keep it together.  I decided to devote my comments directly to the--I call them the grandchildren, these are her grandchildren they are nieces and nephews and there is quite a number of them who were all there at the service, most of them.  So I talked at some length to them about my mother's life and what have you.  And one of the comments that I made--I made a joking comment was I said I know you guys all think of me as some gruff Uncle Don because they are not afraid to call me and ask for advice, help, etc. and I think there is an old description of people we refer to it as a Dutch uncle and I think I have adopted that demeanor.  Meaning that I can be cranky and gruff and tough and what have you but I think they also recognize that I'm like a huge supporter and that as I try to steer them in whatever ways that I do that it's with love and desire to see them go in the right direction.  So I think over the years I have developed that--at Goldman Sachs they used to refer to me occasionally daddy Don because I find myself hiring a lot of young people out of college to work for the firm and I was always the guy that either kicked them in the pants to make sure they were doing the right thing or would be their defender, their parent in absentia so to speak to protect them from some of the people who could be a little difficult.  And so I think I sort of want to be remembered as somebody who in my own way and I definitely do it in my own way, mentor young people, give good advice, maybe sometimes a little crankily and grudgingly but will give of my time to them and so that's sort of what comes to mind as sort of the way I want to be remembered.  I think my children would both agree with that description (laugh) of me in terms of my relationship with them.
