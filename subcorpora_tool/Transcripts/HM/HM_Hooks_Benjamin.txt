Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Bessie White Hooks. B-e-s-s-i-e, W-h-i-t-e was her maiden name and she married my father whose name was Hooks, H-o-o-k-s.
Speaker 1: And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in June 1894 and I'm not sure, I believe it was Huntsville, Alabama. It was either Huntsville, Alabama or Memphis, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Do you know much about her side of the family? How far back can you trace your ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: On her father's side I don't think I have ever traced it at all. Her father's name was Jackson White. I know that he was a waiter in a hotel and that apparently he did fairly well economically. You want any more information on that? She had one brother, Walter White, who predeceased her in death.  And apparently two children, Bessie White, Walter White, and their mother died relatively young. I really think she died shortly after my uncle Walter was born; I never had a chance to see him. In any event my mother was raised by her grandmother in Huntsville, Alabama, but I believe that her father stayed in Memphis.  Later she moved to Memphis when she was about seventh, eighth or ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories passed down through your family about events from the 19th century or the Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, I remember only that for whatever reason we did not have much family history on my maternal grandfather Jackson White, except that he was a waiter. I heard my mother just say occasionally that he was very adept, when he waited at the hotel, on spotting food that the white people, as they you know used that term, very openly, never touched Cornish hen, a piece of steak, and how they delighted in him bringing it home for them to eat. I knew nothing of his family at all.  On her mother's side we did know that family. They had a whole bunch of aunts and uncles and Ada and Mildred and Cora. There was a great big long list of them, and they migrated many of them to Hyannis, Massachusetts where they apparently ran a restaurant and knew the Kennedy family.  But I don't know anything about that personally except hearing it from them. Others migrated to St. Louis, Missouri. I knew them. They came to Memphis, where I lived, quite often so I knew my mother's grandmother, the lady who raised her, and I knew all her aunts who raised almost as her sisters because of the age situation. That's basically what I know about my mother's family.
Story_ID: 18178
Speaker 1: Well what was your mother [Bessie White Hooks] like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was a--my father--even though we caught some very, very hard times during the Depression [1929] and never had a job outside of the house, she was a homemaker. She had seven children, I was the fifth child, and she was really a homemaker, an excellent cook. And she attended high school.  I think she finished perhaps about the ninth grade, but in those days a ninth grade scholar was good. As far as I've been able to ascertain about as good as an average college graduate now. To give an example, when I went to high school, I did not recognize that most of my teachers had never finished college when they started teaching.  They finished college either while I was in school or after that, but they were some tremendous teachers when it came to English, spelling, arithmetic, penmanship, poems and poetry, and they were exceptionally gifted.  You finished the twelfth grade and the next year you started teaching, so my mother was an excellent writer--I mean, what am I trying--penmanship. I never found her to make a grammatical error at any time in her life, and at one time she did apparently keep books for a woman who ran a small restaurant, so she was very good with figures.  And during my lifetime she was very active, having seven children, with the Parent Teachers Association at both the high school and what we called then the grammar school, public school that we attended. For year and years she was either the secretary or the treasurer for the PTA for both of those schools.  And she was active in her church, and in later years became a steward in St. Andrews AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church, she was at AME, that was her religious denomination.
Story_ID: 18179
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Bessie White Hooks] and father [Robert Britton Hooks] met?
Speaker 2: I used to hear my high school principal, whom I loved dearly, Blair Hunt and if you ever done interviews around Memphis [Tennessee] you will hear that name, he was a legendary principal of Booker [T.] Washington [High School] for twenty-seven years. And the reason I knew him very well was he married into my family, my mother's second cousin was his wife and she had some point had three boys in the early '20s [1920s], right after World War II [sic. World War I] . And she'd lost her mind, in those days they didn't have all these modern medicines, and she spent the rest of her years from maybe twenty-five, the next seventy-five years in various institutions. She died about two years ago, and she lived to be over a hundred, a very beautiful woman. I didn't know her until about seven or eight years ago. And Mr. Hunt, who's a legendary historian, used to talk about that beautiful young girl that lived down there next to Avery Chapel Church in Memphis, and he knew my father; they were the same age. And that's all that I know about that.
Story_ID: 18180
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father. Can you give us his full name, and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Robert, capital R-o-b-e-r-t. Britton, capital B-r i-t-t-o-n. Hooks, H-o-o-k-s, Senior.
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born October 1890.
Speaker 1: Are there are there any stories that you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: My grandmother on my father's side was a legendary figure. In Memphis [Tennessee] there's a book written about her called 'The Angel of Beale Street.'  She was one of the first black women in the South to attend college, early student at Berea College, Berea in Kentucky, and later taught music.  She was a musical genius. And came to Memphis, taught school for many years, and then formed her own school, the Hooks College School, where she taught. All of the outstanding black figures of Memphis went to my grandmother's school, including my father and his brother, my uncle Henry.  My grandmother had three children, Henry, Charles, Robert, my father. Charles died in infancy. And my father and uncle both attended and finished LeMoyne College, that was a normal school, now known as LeMoyne College or really LeMoyne-Owen College.  They were both graduates of that school, and my father's desire was to be a doctor, somehow in his school age he destroyed his thumb on a printing plant, and he wanted to be a surgeon. So he and my uncle had a photography studio, and they were independent business people in Memphis from 1907 until he died really.  The business stayed in existence for over seventy-five years. I trained in that field. In fact, when I was twelve I started to work for my father, stayed with him until I went to the army, and became a pretty good photographer. My father and uncle were known by everybody who lived in the Memphis area because they had their own studio, 164 Beale.  The big to tall, short to small, everybody who was anybody came to Hooks Brothers. They had the only black studio in Memphis for all of those years, from 1907 until way up perhaps the end of World War II.  After that many blacks had studios, but they had an actual business and place, and that's where I worked. And my father had, and my mother [Bessie White Hooks] had, seven children and he remained in that business. Later in World War II, my older sister and brother and my father started a Hooks School of Photography, and just a few years ago, down in Mississippi at one of the colleges there they got all of those pictures and negatives. When my father came along and they did glass negatives. In fact when I first started working with him we were still using photo powder.  I don't know if you've ever seen it or not, but you had flash bulbs, and we made pictures, flash pictures, you spread the powder in a little capsule like, put a paper cap under it and pull the trigger and it went off smoking, and there was always a great deal of confusion.  I loved it.  Usually at weddings and you know events like that. And we had some tremendous things; pictures of Booker [T.] Washington and others who came to Memphis to speak, President Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt. All of that was destroyed in a fire, a disastrous fire, in the 1970s I think, but much of it remained, and they were putting it together in an exhibit. And one day if I have the strength I plan to do a little traveling with it.
Story_ID: 18181
Speaker 1: Can you reflect back on growing up and give us some idea of some of the sights, and the sounds, and the smells or growing up in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother lived to be ninety, so I had a chance to know her. She was born in 1852 but born free, and was a musical prodigy, a graduate--not a graduate because she was put out of Berea [College, Berea, Kentucky] for protesting certain racial exclusionary policies.  But she went back to teach, and I did hear her talk about the days of slavery, but unfortunately I did not have the sense to ask the kind of questions that had I read Alex Haley's book I would have been very knowledgeable, because being a brilliant woman whose mind never left her, and I was sixteen when she died.  So you see I could have asked her a lot of questions about those days. Her brother, one of her brothers, was a jockey, a jockey during the Kentucky Derby days before they excluded.  And it's always strange to me to realize that most black folk don't recognize what a period of success we had from 1865 to 1900, and my grandmother could talk about those days when there was no Jim Crow. She was arrested many, many times for refusing to go to the back of the streetcar.  My pastor, Dr. Teal Fuller at First Baptist Church of Lauderdale, was the first--the last black state senator in the state of North Carolina, so I had a lot of chances to learn a lot that I did not learn, but I did come in contact with people who were part of that, what do you call it, the first Reconstruction from 1865 to 1900.  So that coming up around the table I heard my grandmother talk about all of these things and did not have the good sense to follow through, for which I'm sorry. But I did, you know, learn about Jim Crow, James Crow, and Mary Crow.  And my mother--my grandmother was not only a teacher but she became the first juvenile court probation officer, she and her husband. In fact, he was killed in 1918 by one of the inmates they were keeping. And my grandmother, from 1918 on, wore a black dress every day of her life in commemoration of the death of her husband.  So that I heard them discussing things, many, many things about those early days.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that come to mind now that are particularly interesting that you think?
Speaker 2: I cannot, you know, think. As I say, I heard the story at some point there was a musical project called Big Head Tom, and my grandmother used to carry him around, exhibit him in circuses and fairs all over, and I heard her talk about things, but no particular story, you know, just leaps out at this time.
Speaker 1: Is that the same gentleman that they called Blind Tom? Thomas the Fool, who played the piano...
Speaker 2: No that was a different, no this was a different--.
Speaker 1: So this was Big Head Tom?
Speaker 2: This is Big Head Tom, sort of a head so big he couldn't--he couldn't--When I said musical project I really made a mistake because his head was so big he couldn't--he was not mobile. And I remember that my--one of my grandmother's sisters, Dr. Mary Britton, was a medical doctor, one of the first black women doctors. I've been to her home in Kentucky.  My grandmother's home was Lexington [Kentucky], and I've been there. I've been to many churches where she was the organist and pianist and choir director in the 1800s and latter part, and I've been in the home of her sister Mary--Mary Britton, who was I said a medical doctor, so a very gifted family.  But unfortunately, and I think about that sometimes I may hire somebody one day to do a little research because for some reason we have not kept up with our family, Mary, her sister, never married so she had no children. Susan, one of the sisters, never had children, but some of her uncles and brothers did. But we've not kept up with the family history.
Story_ID: 18182
Speaker 1: What kind of a child were you? What kind of a young man were you when you were growing up? What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well of course in my early childhood it was strange because my father [Robert Britton Hooks] was a prominent public figure. Everybody thought we were rich and actually we were as poor as you could imagine because photography's a business that does well in good times, and when things are bad like they were during the Depression, the Depression hit in 1929 and I can remember my father saying many times how one day in October when he went to the studio, one Sunday, he didn't do a single--we call them settings, people dress up on Sundays, come to Beale Street and he'd make six or seven settings, people would come in, and later on in the week they'd come in and order pictures, and that Sunday in October he didn't make one.  Things went bad in '29 [1929]. He changed his political philosophy; if you mentioned [Herbert] Hoover or the Republican Party he'd want to lynch you. You know he became a dedicated Franklin [Delano] Roosevelt New Dealer in '33 [1933], and remained a dedicated Democrat until the day of his death.  That's important for me to remember because Robert Church, a legendary, legendary black Memphian who was a delegate for the Republican National Convention from 1912, I think, until 1952, he and my father were sort of contemporaries.  I think he may have been four or five years older than my father, but they came up together on the same street and he was very fond of Robert Church. But he broke with him politically. And not that he was an active, but just in his own. So that I remember the stories and I remember hardship in my house--we didn't have any indoor hot water tank, we didn't have indoor water.  I never had a bath in a bathtub until I was 14. But the façade of my house looked beautiful; a big, beautiful imposing place. We did have some kind of indoor toilet, I can't describe to you how it works but it was there.  But a--
Speaker 1: Did it work the way the ones work now?
Speaker 2: No, it worked different from--it had a--it flushed differently, it had a--a faucet that the water came out very strong and it rolled around. But somehow it did, you know, whatever you do to a toilet that makes it flush.  It flushed--it had a flushing feature on it. But the bathroom was built for a bathroom, but we never--my father never even put a tub in it, and it never had heat in it, so in the wintertime it was just there. And so I knew what it was to use a slop jar to take all my baths until I was 14, and then we lost the house in a foreclosure, and I can remember that----I was 14 at that point.  And I remember moving two years later to the public housing projects.
Story_ID: 18183
Speaker 1: And when I went to college I was the first child, by the time I became--I finished high school at 16 in 1941, and by that time things were a little bit better, so I was the first child of my family, the fifth child, but the first child who had a real chance to go to college.  If you look back at the days of segregation, my brothers and sisters were very brilliant academically, but they did not have a chance to go to college because the state school was in Nashville, Tennessee State University, and they didn't have the money to travel up there. The school that was owned by the state, Memphis State [University, now University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] where I'm now an adjunct professor, was closed to black students, so Lemoyne, an outstanding black school was there but they couldn't afford the tuition. And when my sister, I remember it like it was yesterday, finished high school--gifted academically, her first job they called her 'salad girl,' but she made three dollars a week. Actually black women worked routinely for years and years in Memphis [Tennessee] and all over the South for one dollar a day and car fare, and I remember it like it was yesterday. My brother went to work for eleven dollars a week in 1933, and my other brother got a job at fifteen [dollars] and he didn't get a raise every year--you stayed on the same sort of salary. I remember those days very well. I remember the New Deal, even though I was a little boy. I remember my sister's salary, by that time she'd moved to a department store, moved from $6.25 a week to $12.50 a week. And I never shall forget that, the NRA did that. And they cut her hours; she now had a half day off on Wednesday and got off at, you know, six o'clock. It was a tremendous thing, and those of us who lived through PWA [Public Works Association]. My brother got a job at NYA, National Youth Administration; it paid him twelve dollars a month which was a fortune in those days.  So I remember personally, even though I was only, what, eight, nine, ten years old, what effect the [Franklin D.] Roosevelt policies had on individual people.
Story_ID: 18184
Speaker 1: What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: My grade school was Porter School. And my principal, Elliott Brown who was an early graduate of Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] , a very brilliant man, and he must have been very in politically, because Porter School was built from the ground up for black kids; it was not a left over school. It had an auditorium in it and a cafeteria, and very few schools built for black folks had that. The only way you had an auditorium and a cafeteria was you inherited a school that the white people had used and the neighborhood patterns had changed, and they moved, and they turned the school over to us. If it was built, they very seldom had a cafeteria or an auditorium, and I remember Mr. Brown was a very brilliant man and I've been told since I've been an adult that he ran one of the best schools in the country.  Porter School was a very highly rated school. Then my high school principal was--my high school school was Booker T. Washington High School, Blair Hunt was principal, built in 1927. I went there in '37 [1937], and at that time every teacher that had been hired had by that time achieved a bachelors degree.  In fact, in 1927 maybe ten or twelve teachers were hired, all of whom had degrees; the other teachers who had taught there for years and years had gone to school on Saturdays at Rust College [Holly Springs, Mississippi] or LeMoyne [Lemoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee], got a degree and so many black people every summer lit out for the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and all over the North and got their bachelors or masters degree, so that Memphis [Tennessee] had a fairly good school system in those segregated days.
Story_ID: 18185
Speaker 1: And Memphis [Tennessee] in those days was like two black high schools, Booker T. Washington [High School] and--
Speaker 2: Manassas [High School], yes. And strangely the boss of Memphis, we had a boss there, one of the most dictatorial bosses of the whole country, E. H. Crump.  Pendergrass machine, Hague machine had nothing on him, except he was not quite as mean openly, he ran it but he routinely--when he would have a candidate for governor, we elected governors every two years, I remember it like it was yesterday, his candidate would get 60,000 votes, the opponent would get 780; it was sixty to one. So in order to achieve 60,000 votes he had to have blacks as well whites to vote, so that that was a strange tradition in Memphis, Tennessee; black folk had been voting as long as--I'm seventy-eight now--and I can remember as a boy in 1930s when black folk were not voting anywhere in the South, in the Democratic primary black folk were taking an active role in the Democratic primary process because Crump had to have those votes to achieve 60,000.  A church, the black political boss, got those votes in November. We voted, I was told as a young man, for the Republican Party in the November election, you know, but in the summer when the Democratic primary was held in the South, there was no Republic primary, and I during my young lifetime visited a church that had a primary but they were very small, so most black people participated in the Democratic Party primary in Memphis Chevron County, Tennessee, which was unusual.  When I came back to Memphis and started my political career it started on a background where at least in Memphis black folk had been accustomed to voting, but just before I came back Crump fell out with the governor and the governor purged the roll--took every voter off the roll, black and white, and had to start from scratch.  So when I came back to Memphis in 1949 there were only seven, 7,000 blacks registered to vote. Today I suspect there are well over 200,000. It was my great joy and privilege to participate in every major campaign that moved that black registration of 7,000 to more than 200,000.
Story_ID: 18186
Speaker 1: Now tell us about some of your high school activities, what did you do in high school?
Speaker 2: Well basically I was relatively small. I weighed, when I finished high school I think I weighed 112 pounds, I was five foot three or very small, so I didn't play any basketball or football, or anything like that. But I did work for my father [Robert Britton Hooks]. I went to work every evening.  And that's why I tell people I was raised on the backside of Beale Street because my studio fronted on Beale Street, and on the back it fronted on sort of an alley like but some of the best kids I've ever met, and so I played with the kids down on Beale Street, those kids who lived behind me there.  And before I went to Beale Street at the age of twelve we had the biggest backyard, and I had an older brother who made a tennis court, a basketball court, and a softball diamond at the proper time using the next two yards. So he, Robert, was very, very innovative in doing things like that, and we played.  At that time you had to make up your own games, we played cowboy and Indians, and we played hide and go seek, and Little Sally Walker, and all--marbles, and I played tennis and softball, but not very well. But I had great time growing up as a kid. I don't have any great horror stories to tell.  My mother [Bessie White Hooks] cooked well, and I didn't know--for instance if I said we had greens for dinner that's what I mean; a big pot of turnip greens with a piece of cornbread, that was dinner, we didn't have any macaroni or meat, if we had string beans that's what we had, cabbage and I was full grown before I started this business of you know of meat, starch, and a vegetable.  In fact, on Sundays I now recognize that my mother had the meat, the vegetable, the starch, and a dessert. But growing up, basically six days a week, we had one meal; usually a chili on one day. I can almost tell you cabbage Monday, greens on Tuesday, string beans on Wednesday, macaroni and cheese and meatloaf on Friday, chili--I can almost tell you what we'd have. And of course in those days we had pretty big breakfasts. It was nothing unusual to have fried chicken and gravy and rice, or my mother would take a round steak and whip it up with a stick or with a mallet or something, and beat it, beat it, beat it, fry it with onions, and we had gravy and rice.  But breakfast was the big meal growing up. I don't eat much breakfast now, but as a boy we had a pretty big meal. So that we ate, I don't recall being hungry any day of my life, but on the other hand what my mother cooked is what her children ate; we didn't have parlays or Wall Street diplomatic forays or United Nations council, "Well what do you want this morning, do you want this or that?"  What she cooked is what we ate or we didn't eat. If you missed eating one day because you didn't like it you soon learned to like it. And one thing I knew, if my father [Robert Britton Hooks] liked it, we would have it, but my mother never cooked a dish that he didn't like. And unfortunately for me he liked everything.  I don't recall him disliking anything but beets and pumpkin, and so I didn't have any beets or pumpkin growing up. But we had a charmed, I think a charmed life; kids came to my house to play, we had ice cream on every Sunday and we'd make the boys in the neigh--
Story_ID: 18187
Speaker 1: So what were your favorite subjects in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Actually starting in grade school arithmetic, as we called it in those days, I used to just do tablets of improper fractions and all. But I had a poor algebra teacher in high school of what we called the homeroom, there may be forty students or fifty or whatever number, and they divide it in half, A, B, C, D, E , you know of some number and one half of us went to one teacher and one half went to another. J.D. Springer was one of the best math teachers in the country, and unfortunately I didn't have him. I had a woman who had lost it somewhere, she was quite old, and so I sort of lost my edge.  But we had trigonometry, geometry, and first and second algebra, I took Latin, and I had an excellent teacher in Latin, and of course English literature. The poems that I recite now and I can, you know, rattle them off, "Build me more stately mansions on my soul," "My captain, my captain," and I used to be able to recite poems, you know, English and American literature, Roland Robinson and Esther McClendon, and of course we had to learn differently then. History, I could recite all the presidents and when they served, George Washington and all them, of course we stopped with Franklin [Delano] Roosevelt so I didn't have so far to go. But I never had any trouble, and I liked studying, and we had homework from as early as I can remember.  In the third grade the teacher would put on the board on Monday morning twenty words, spelling, and on Tuesday you had to bring back those twenty words with a written definition, and on Wednesday you had to use that word in a sentence, and on Thursday you had to stand up and spell it verbally, and on Friday was a written spelling test, twenty words a week; and that's 700 words in a run of a year.  And you got a lick in your hand with a strap for every word that was misspelled on Friday. Well even--even--we didn't have any dumb students apparently because after about the third or fourth week wasn't nobody getting a lick. That meant that you'd used the sentence--the word in a sentence, you had looked up the definition and written it out, and spelled it verbally, and on Friday she'd pull that curtain, she had a curtain up there, and she'd pull it down and call the words out and you would spell them and pass your, you know, student next to you they would grade you, and then the paper went to the teacher, twenty words, if you misspelled any of them you got one lick in your hand for every misspelled word. So that school was a joy and we used to, what's that word, you know diagram sentences and analyze verbs, all the kinds of things that I don't know whether kids are doing now or not, but I remember--the subtrahend and the dividend and the product, and all those words that I very seldom hear kids use now. But we had an excellent school, and teachers were very diligent. And of course they had a system that we didn't know called "tracking."  Now it has become a very nasty thing, but then all of us came from big families and if you were the third or fourth child they knew what your family could do.  So it would be passed down, "Hooks can do well--don't take any foolishness off of him."  On the other hand if your family was not that gifted they expected you, every child had to do his or her best, there was no fooling around. But they knew when you got there from the grades before about what you could do, or your family before you, so it was a joyful thing.  I enjoyed school discipline, it was excellent. In high school we just didn't have a lot of foolishness. Mr. [Blair] Hunt walked into the auditorium, it was overcrowded, it seated 1800, we had 2200, in my high school graduating class about 470, when he stepped in to that auditorium you could hear a sound, I mean it was almost frightening, and his booming voice, you could hear him halfway across the campus, you'd rather go to jail than have to face him. He carried a big strap and a hand bell. When he rang that bell it was absolute--and then when we had public concerts up at the auditorium I remember asking Hayes one night when kids are cutting up about having to go to the public program and he just stood on the stage, put all the lights on, and stood there for about a minute. It got quiet, he said "You are having your fun tonight, I'll have mine Monday morning," and he walked on back, and it got so quiet the rest of the night, and we were afraid to clap or applaud because that meant Monday morning he was going to meet every student. And so that we had great times, and most of our principals were excellent disciplinarians, every one of them was. They just kept things and the foolishness we have today in school, we just simply didn't have it in those days. If you walked the hall you had to have what we call an excuse card. There were no kids in the hall. If your room was here and your next class was here you walked to the end of the hall and came around. And I've had teachers ask me "Why did they make you do that?" and I think it was good because life is orderly; why do I stop at the stop sign when there's no policeman looking, no traffic? Because I've been taught that if I don't want to have chaos I've got to follow the rules. There are certain rules in life and when--and what they taught us in high school was not only reading, writing, and arithmetic but that life is orderly, it has a system to it, a beginning and ending, and you did things.

Speaker 1: So now when I went into the army it was no great big problem for me, and I think the army saved America, changed this country; 12 million men and women went into the service and came back different people. Then the GI Bill of Rights, the most phenomenally successful affirmative action program the world has ever known.  They said to me, "Ben Hooks, we took three years of your life, took you from your family, your school, sent you to the army, therefore we're going to give you money to attend college, and give you a monthly stipend, and give you cheap insurance rates and let you buy a house," you know all of that. That's an affirmative action program.  My brother [Robert Britton Hooks Jr.], who tried to get his best to get in the army, was turned down because he had married and had two kids. He often regretted that I had a chance to get all these things free that he didn't have. So they said to the black people at one time, "We mistreated you, we did everything we could to stop you, and now we're going to do a few things to try to redress that wrong."  But the minute it included race then the same people that enjoyed the GI Bill of Rights fought against affirmative action for black people. Well, if they owe me something for taking three years of my life as a soldier, what about all those years they took because I was then and am now black?  So it's just amazing how the color question has pervaded much of America, and has really kept us from being the truly great nation we could have been.
Story_ID: 18189
Speaker 1: When I went to my father [Robert Britton Hooks] in '37 [1937], I saw--'38 [1938], '39 [1939] things getting a little bit better financially. And I saw that it would be possible if I wanted to go to college that my father made it clear he would be glad to send me and he'd have the, you know, finance to do it.  And also working for him I could make five, six dollars a week, which would be enough to--at that time I think I was smoking cigarettes and car fare, I mean I could have enough to make it. So I made up my mind about '39 [1939] or '40 [1940] that I wanted to go to college.  In my father's building there was a black doctor, a black dentist, a black lawyer, and an office where the black preachers had an office so I was exposed to these professional people, and in those days nothing was that busy, I could go and sit down with the doctor and maybe talk an hour, move back to the lawyers' office, so I made up my mind that I really think that I wanted to preach, at the age of 12 or 13.  My father was not a fan of organized religion. I never saw him go to bed at night without getting on his knees to pray, but he did not belong to a church, to an organized church. And seemingly he'd had some experience which sort of--and he made a statement one day which--"If you're going to preach be sure that you want to live the life that a preacher ought to live," and kept that in my--in other words it sort of changed my viewpoint for awhile and so I did not follow my first inclination, I think was to go into the ministry. And I decided that I did not want to be a doctor or a dentist, and I decided I wanted to be a lawyer.  But really--
Speaker 2: Were there preachers that you admired or was there a role model in the community--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well my high school principal, Blair Hunt, a great orator, and pastor, Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church [Memphis, Tennesee], my pastor Dr. Theo Fuller, who was an early on Ph.D. and who had been--who served in the state senate in the state of North Carolina from 1898 to 1900 and had written several books.  And I thought it was a big thing to go home, and we had a little small bookcase at home, 'Banks and Banking,' 'Flashes and Gems of Oratory,' 'History of Negro Baptists of West Tennessee,' these books had been written by Dr. Fuller, and for me to be able to open those books and read them and relate to the man who was my pastor, and he was a great--and I liked public speaking, and he was a great public speaker. So my pastor Dr. Fuller, my high school principal elder Hunt, and three or four other preachers for that matter sort of appealed to me, and then in 1937, '38 [1938], '39 [1939] remember that many of the major black leaders were ministers; Bishop Walls of the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion Church, and Bishop D. Ward Nichols, and when you read--I read the Pittsburgh Courier, the Chicago Defender every week, and it was preachers that were really, you know, bringing about change in America so they were sort of the leaders in black America. And the early fraternal orders were started by ministers. And I made up my mind that I wanted to--actually most black kids knew the best thing you could ever be is a teacher; that is about as high as you could aspire for. If you were lucky you may become a doctor or a dentist, but remember only two law--one med--two medical schools in the whole country, Howard [University, Washington, D.C] and Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  God alone only knows how many black folk were denied the chance of a medical education because they couldn't get in school. Most of my teachers in high school who taught physics or biology really wanted to be doctors but they couldn't get into school.  To get into Meharry was one of the hardest things in the world, or Howard. And the same thing was true of law, almost, but I'd made up my mind that I wanted it so that's why I knew when I finished high school I recognized that I could go to college. Now my choices were limited; I received a scholarship offer at Talledega [College, Talladega, Alabama], at Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Alabama], but I knew that my father probably could not afford a school for me out of the city.  He could pay the tuition and I could stay at home. But it was almost unthinkable that I would have enough money to leave home and pay room and board and tuition, and that's why when I went to Lemoyne [Lemoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee], and I started Lemoyne in 1941.
Story_ID: 18190
Speaker 1: In September [1941] the war [World War II] had not started.  In December, Pearl Harbor [December 7, 1941] came and then things really opened up, but I was already in college [Lemoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] and I stayed in college until '43 [1943]. And in August of '43 [1943] I was drafted. And when I came out of the service at that time you could attend law school if you had two years of college; I had two years of college, so when I left the Army I had a choice of going back--
Speaker 2: I just want to deal with the Army a little bit. There was an incident that happened in the Army that was significant that I read about.  One of your duties was guarding Italian prisoners of war, can you tell us about that (inaudible)?
Speaker 1: I was in a completely segregated outfit. I took a little examination before I went to the Army called the Army Specialized Training Program, and if you made a certain mark you were to present that when you were drafted and they'd change your career, so I presented my little credentials and I ended up taking my basic training in Fort Benning, Georgia at the place where they trained all the second lieutenants in the infantry.  Now the company that I was in was 200 and some strong, but only thirteen blacks, so we had our own place, hut, that we lived in, hut thirteen, we formed our own squad. In the dining room we had a table that we ate at that table, no other table. We were completely segregated within that setting.  When our training was over we left there and went to--I went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], the white boys went to various colleges now. During a part of that time one of the things I had to do was guard one day some Italian prisoners of war.  And down in a little town, I believe it was Macon [Georgia], Macon or Columbus, Georgia, I was alone with other black soldiers guarding these Italian prisoners of war, and when lunchtime came they went into the big cafeteria to have lunch and the black soldiers who were guarding them had to stay on the outside.  And I thought about the fact that here I am a black man who was using my rifle to save the country, and here's an Italian prisoner of war who used his rifle to destroy the country, but because he was white and I'm black he could eat in the restaurant and I'm out there to guard to make sure he doesn't run away.  And that irony lived with me even until today. It was a completely segregated time, and I recognized that overseas they couldn't quite put it like they wanted to.  The first time I'd ever been anywhere where the city itself, Rome [Italy], Florence [Italy], the cities I went to were not segregated because they didn't have any black people to segregate.  A lot of white soldiers did all they could to erect barriers, but if you got into town into Florence or Venice [Italy] or wherever you happened to be, the restaurants, such as they were, were open.  Now Italy was a desperately poor country during World War II [1939-1945], so there wasn't much to buy, but they did have bars where they sold wine and they had a lot of wine, and they were not ever able to really pull segregation like they wanted to because individual white soldiers tried to enforce segregation by saying to the owners, "If you let black soldiers in here then white soldiers won't come," but it never was able to take effect like they wanted it to.  So that one day at the end of my service, and the war ended in Italy, I was sent to the 92nd Infantry Division and often cursed myself for ever going to the ASTP because had I not gone to ASTP I would not have ended up in the infantry.  And of all the armed services, in my judgment, the infantry is the worst place to be because that's where you die. And I was on the front line. In that service they had what they called "rest and recreation camps"; you spend so many days on the front line and go back for R&R.  It was then as I met the white soldiers from their outfits that it dawned on me that most of us were going to be a little bit different when we got back home, and even the white soldiers recognized that the kind of segregation that they had known was not going to always be.  So when we came back it took a while for that to take root, but I think those soldiers had experiences that they never would have had in civilian life.
Story_ID: 18191
Speaker 1: You finished your bachelors degree at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No, what happened was that I went to school at Howard and I went to school in the Army. There was a period of time when the war [World War II, 1939-1945] ended in Italy, it was not over in Europe, it ended in Europe, it was not over in Japan.  So all of these divisions over in Europe were waiting to go to Japan for that last onslaught, in which we thought that thousands of people would be killed. I didn't look to get back because I'd read about how desperate the Japanese were and how much they fought and how much they were willing to die to protect their homeland. And I believed that they were willing, you know, to put forward an effort that would result in the death of many of them and many of us.  Well we were waiting, so I went to school in the University of Florence [Italy] that the Army set up as an infantry thing. And Frank Reeds was the professor from the university, Roosevelt College [now University] in Chicago [Illinois], and I had credits from Howard and from there. But when I went to law school, I did not have to have a bachelors degree.  And I opted not to finish college but to go straight to law school, so I received my degree, graduate degree, with the three years I had of college, a doctorate of jurisprudence from DePaul University [Chicago, Illinois], September 1948.
Speaker 1: And how did you like DePaul? What was DePaul like in (inaudible)?
Speaker 2: Well DePaul was a tremendously good school. I think even today it has the reputation of having more judges on the bench in Chicago who came from DePaul than many, many great law schools; there's Loyola, Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], University Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], John Marshall [Law School, Chicago, Illinois], but we lead in the number of lawyers.  But at the end of World War II [1945] law school everywhere became almost like a big tank. Men who never thought they'd make it into, you know, graduate school, men who didn't finish college and had two years or three years like I had, opted for law rather than medicine or dentistry.  So DePaul, like every other law school that I can think of, just doubled or tripled or quadrupled in size. But they failed most of them, flunked them out. If 200 started in freshman class it would be lucky if you had thirty to finish. That was true all over the country; they took in fast and they put you out fast.  But at the same time, the number of lawyers just grew so that it--but we were not doing much in terms of what they call 'law review' and 'moot court,' all of these sidelines.  Those boys who came out of the Army, all we wanted to do was go to school as fast as we could and get out as quick as we can, get our license and start work; we were already three years behind.  So I went to school during the summer months and finished three years academically in two years--three academic years in two calendar years because I went through the summer.  I started there in 1946 in September and did my six semesters, and by September '48 [1948] I was finished, took the bar, passed it. And in October came back to Memphis [Tennessee], and got my license to practice in Tennessee in February of '49 [1949]. I got my license to practice in Illinois in November of '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were well prepared for law school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had sort of put my mind on the field of law, and the best background for college is liberal arts--Latin, sociology, economics, those kinds of subjects prepare you more for law than let's say biology or chemistry or physics.
Speaker 1: Now you set up practice in Memphis in '49 [1949], I believe?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Story_ID: 18192
Speaker 1: Now were you still kind of looking towards the ministry at this point [1949]?
Speaker 2: If I were looking toward the ministry it was somewhat sublimated. One of the problems I had was in the sixth grade, in the public school, they gave me what they call an 'irregular promotion.'  That is, the principal came in my sixth grade classroom one morning and called out ten names and we went from the sixth grade to the seventh grade the next day, so I finished grade school in seven years. I would have finished high school ordinarily in '42  [1942] at the age of seventeen; I finished in '41 [1941] at the age of sixteen, and that irregular promotion is why that happened.  So when I came out of the Army, that's what I was trying to say, I had two years of college and had the opportunity. Well by that time when I was irregularly promoted, I think it did something to me; I--I became sort of a misfit.  I was already small, already a little bit ahead, and I became sort of introverted. Up to that point I was sort of a class leader, but in my high school days I was not as active, and I lost my ability to talk so that in law school I had a hard time just reciting my lessons.  Somewhere in the last years of law school I began to wonder why in the name of God was I in law school when I couldn't talk to ten people. If I was to teach a Sunday school class I would just freeze up. And in those days we thought about lawyers being speakers, having to address the jury.  In law school some days when I'd be called on I had to struggle just to answer questions, and when I started into the practice I kept wondering what would happen when I had to argue a case before a jury.  One day a man, Reverend Gladden, asked me to speak at his church and I agreed, and I wrote my little speech and I wondered who was I writing it for because I knew I wasn't going to be able to deliver that speech.  I had been to my father's [Robert Britton Hooks] studio, we had this--I told you we started a photography school and he had 40 students in the class, and he wanted me to talk to them and I just froze up, you know, couldn't do it. When I was in high school, if you'd call me to make a public speech I started crying and snotting up and just could not do it.  And on this particular Sunday in 1949, at the St. John Baptist Church in Douglas, in Memphis [Tennessee], I wondered what was going to happen. And I call it a miracle. That Sunday morning when Reverend Gladden presented me and I had my little notes I stood up to speak and I never had a problem, and haven't had one since.  I was delivered from my bondage of fear of public speaking, and since that time I've spoken to audiences of more than a hundred thousand at one time. And one year I delivered, I think I'm the only black reverend to deliver the major address at the Republican and Democratic Convention in the same year.  I spoke in Detroit [Michigan], Bill Brock from--who was the Republican National committeeman had me to deliver a major address to the Republican convention in Detroit, and I left there the next month and went to New York [New York] and spoke to the Democratic National Convention. I've spoken before congressional sessions of state, I mean, legislative sessions, I've spoken to great big audiences of a hundred thousand, commencements.  I, in other words, that--I was delivered that Sunday morning, and that I call a miracle. After then I did a lot of what we call laymen speeches, Young People's Day, Men's Day, African-American Black History Day, and from '49 [1949] until '56 [1956] I moved more and more toward the call to the ministry, and finally in 1956 I told my pastor that I felt that I'd been called to preach.  He had had me deliver two or three laymen sermons, and on that Sunday morning in May in 1955, it was, he announced--I announced to the church that I felt I'd been called to preach. And usually they'd let you deliver a trial sermon, but he said, "Ben has already spoken in this church three or four times, you know him," and they voted that morning to give me my license as a preacher in May of 1955.  Before one year had passed I'd been called, that's the expression we use in the black church, in the Baptist church, white and black, we believe that pastors are called by the church at the revelation of God.  And by March 1956, and I had not been preaching a year, I was called to my first pastorate. And by the way I'm still at that church. I went there in '56 [1956] and this is July 24, 2003, so I've been there from 1956 to now, almost what is that, forty-seven years.
Speaker 1: And that's--
Speaker 2: Greater Middle Baptist Church.
Story_ID: 18193
Speaker 1: And let me just take a minute, my church in Memphis [Tennessee], Greater Middle Baptist Church--in Detroit [Michigan] it was Greater New Mount Moriah Baptist Church. Now at one time my church was just plain Middle Baptist Church.  But there grew a some kind of a--something in the black Baptist church that for some reason they put the prefix on 'Greater' or 'New,' and in Memphis apparently in 1935 and '36 [1936] my church, long before I thought about going there, built a new building.  And when they erected the new building from the ground up they added to the church name the word "Greater." I didn't use it for many years, I just used Middle Baptist. But there are two churches, and the other church, Middle, in Memphis over the years became much larger.  When I first went to my church in '56 [1956] I was the largest, but up in the '80s [1980s] this other church moved up to three or four or five thousand members, so our checks kept crossing in the mail and people would get confused so I went back to using the name that was my official title, Greater Middle Baptist.  In Detroit, my church was originally Mount Moriah Baptist Church. There was a split and the other church called themselves Mount Moriah so we became New Mount Moriah, and there was another split and we became Greater New Mount Moriah.  Personally, I would prefer to be Middle Baptist and Mount Moriah, but I had to accept what the folk had so my church officially is named Greater Middle Baptist Church.
Story_ID: 18194
Speaker 1: Now you got married in the '50s [1950s] too, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You met your wife [Frances Hooks] in the '50s [1950s] ?
Speaker 2: Yes '51 [1951], I got married the 21st day of March 1951, so I've been married now--we've celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary. We had a great, great, great 50th commemoration, and we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary.  At that time I was pastor in Memphis [Tennessee] and Detroit [Michigan], so I had a 25th anniversary celebration in Memphis and a 25th anniversary celebration in Detroit. When I celebrated my 50th anniversary I had resigned the church in Detroit, so I had the celebration in Memphis but a bus load of people came from Detroit and some folk by plane. Over a hundred people came to participate with us in my 50th wedding anniversary.
Story_ID: 18195
Speaker 1: Now you were part of a firm that got involved in civil rights cases, right?
Speaker 2: Well actually when I came back to Memphis [Tennessee] to practice law I became very active in every aspect of civic and fraternal life of Memphis. I joined the Masonic organization, I joined the Elks, Knights and Daughters of Tabor, Knights of Pythius, I am today the supreme chancellor, which is the national president, of the Knights of Pythius, it's a very small organization.  I am today the grand master of the state of Tennessee, which is state president of the Masonic organization, and I have been active in the Elks, and I've been national treasurer of the Knights and Daughters of Tabor. I belonged to these organizations, and continue to belong because I think that human life is group life, and that these organizations have in the past demonstrated the power they had to help bridge that gap from slavery to freedom.  Through the organized efforts of black fraternal groups, through the organized efforts of the black church, what else could save us? Here we were treated almost like dogs six days a week, "Boy, girl, get out of the street--get off the sidewalk on the street, let white folk pass by."  But on Sunday morning we were Deacon Crowe, Deacon Hooks, Reverend Hooks, we could approach God for ourselves, we were teachers, treasurers, superintendents, choir directors. So the black church that was a vehicle not only religiously, but organizationally wise they brought us through.  No accident that many of our great leaders of the days in the past were preachers, many of our congresspeople and early state senators and state legislators were ministers of the Gospel, and even in the Civil Rights Movement--the modern Civil Rights Movement, I want to make that distinction, not the Civil Rights Movement but the modern because the Civil Rights Movement has been going on in American since 1619 and it hurts me to hear people say "in the civil rights days."  We've been involved all those years. But that [Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] was a Baptist preacher, Jesse Jackson, Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Wyatt Walker, Ben Hooks, these men were ministers of the Gospel, and because the pulpit has given black America much of its great leadership.
Story_ID: 18196
Speaker 1: So when I came back to Memphis [Tennessee] in 1949 I mentioned to you that the governor of Tennessee at that point, before I came had purged the rolls,and the black voter registration was down to 7,000 and I determined for myself that one of the ways to change, I came back to Memphis because I wanted to be a part of a change, I was offered many outstanding opportunities in Chicago [Illinois].  Dr. J. B. Martin, a legendary figure, he and his three brothers, B. B., A. T. and W. S. owned the Memphis Red Sox baseball team, and they were the only black owned baseball diamond in the country. They owned the Red Sox park that could hold some three or four thousand people.  So he had been run out of town by [E. H.] Crump in a spat that none of us never quite understood. He put the police in front of Martin's drugstore and examined everybody who came in there, physically, and obviously Dr. Martin couldn't continue in business in that way so he left and went to Chicago.  But it was like throwing that rabbit in briar patch; he was a Republican, he became active in the Republican party. When I was in law school he and a part of his family owned the Chicago baseball team, he was the president of the National American League of Baseball.  They had an all-star game that they played in Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois], fifty thousand people there at that game, and that money that was raised then, you know, kept the league organized, and he was elected to the position of Cook County Sanitary Commissioner.  At that point it may have been the highest elected position that a black had anywhere in America; the Cook County Commission allocated the money for every public facility in Cook County, which was perhaps the second or third largest county.  All of us remember back in the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s] Chicago was the second largest city before that, and J.B. Martin became legendary in Chicago and knew my family very well, asked me to come by to see him after he discovered I was in law school, and asked me to remain in Chicago and work with him, and there were black judges then, black members of state legislature.  There was no question that Chicago was perhaps the most advanced city politically of any city in the nation, far ahead of New York [New York] in my judgment, because the first black congressman after Reconstruction was not elected from New York, he was elected from Chicago, and in 1920 Oscar DePriest, a Republican, was elected the first black congressman since 1900.  And then Arthur Mitchell and later the Democrat [William Levi] Dawson, long before New York thought about Adam [Clayton] Powell. And I was intrigued by this opportunity. Chicago was like heaven compared to Memphis. My brother was driving a streetcar, blacks served as policemen, and all these public officers--city council.  But I decided that the change was going to take place in the South and I wanted to be a part of that change. I felt it would not occur in Chicago, so I made a deliberate decision to move back here to Memphis, Tennessee, and that's what I did, and did it to practice law. And I became active.  George Lee headed up what we called then the Lincoln-Lee. At that point black folk, I have mentioned, could vote in the Democratic primary but they could not belong to the Democratic Party. It was a party of Bill Bull, of [U.S. Senator John] Stennis, Eastman, it was a party that lost Barnett and [U.S. Senator] Strom Thurmond.  It was a party of the "cannot make it, will not do it," and so I joined the Republican Party and became one of the outstanding officials of that party, became the co-chairman of the Shelby County Republican Party. But after the [Barry] Goldwater situation I decided that the Republican Party was moving in the wrong direction.  The demagogues, too many of them left the Democratic Party and became Republicans. That didn't mean that there were not still great Republicans, because without the Republican vote we never would have had a civil rights bill, our Voting Rights bill [Voting Rights Act, 1965]. We tend to forget that. But after the Goldwater situation, I left the Republican Party and I've been an active Democrat for the last 40 years; voted every year in the Democrat primary.  However, in the years that I served in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] I maintained a strictly non-partisan tradition; I invited an outstanding Republican every year to the NAACP Convention, I insisted that we give time and attention to both parties so that the Republicans could not ignore us and the Democrats take us for granted.  And I have no regrets for running a non-partisan NAACP ship. I think it helped us, helped the nation, and of course we produced some outstanding black Republicans. Who can forget [U.S. Sentaor Edward] Ed Brooks?
Story_ID: 18197
Speaker 1: Well actually what happened was I was active in politics and in all of these various organizations, I have no regret. I'm glad that I got into it, glad I got active politically. I mentioned the fact that I left the Republican Party and went and became active in the Democratic Party.  And in the meantime during one of the political campaigns I supported Frank Clement for governor, along with A.W. Willis, and I believe that Sherman was in that crowd, Jesse Turner, a whole group of us, and so we changed the landscape of Tennessee.  C.F. Williams who was the grandmaster of Masons opened the door for us to talk to the Masonic brethren all over the state, at that time they had 14,000 members, and we succeeded in solidifying the black vote. So for John Hooker and Frank Clement and other Democrats we were producing a 98 percent vote for our candidate within the Democratic Party.  And so we were agitating for blacks, and we used running for office as a mechanism. In '52 [1952] I served as a campaign manager for Dr. J.D. Walker who ran for the school board, and we moved the voter registration from 7,000 to 17,000.  Every year we would try to run somebody and utilize that to increase the voter registration. George Lee, and J.D. Walker, and Jesse Turner, who was a legendary leader in the civil rights struggle in Memphis [Tennessee], Russell Sugarman, A.W. Willis, Willis, well I just could name them, Frank Kilpatrick, and others worked hard to change the scene.  And in fact people came from all over the South to ask black folk in Memphis, "What the world are you all doing to move so fast?" A.W. Willis ended up in the state legislature. H.T. Lockett, Shelby County Criminal Court. But we got denied the right because Joel Patterson, Jr. was elected mayor, but because of that stupid law that was on the book about a runoff, which was unconstitutional, but the fellow judges would not so rule. So Patterson won the first race, got knocked out, Otis Higgs won twice, got knocked out.  When Harrington ran, who's now the mayor of Memphis, he would have been knocked out because most people have forgotten when Harrington ran he received 143,200 votes, his opponent received 143,000 votes. He ran by 2--he won by 200. But a crazy man--we call him crazy--he may have been very smart, but man who was a little bit off the wall called Prince Mongo ran and got 1,500 votes. Now you throw that 1,500 into the mix, Harrington did not receive the majority.  He'd been--he'd been short about 800 votes. Now what the judge ruled that the runoff law was unconstitutional, which allowed Harrington to assume the office of mayor. We were 12, 14 years late. And that shows you the kind of clout black people had in Tennessee making changes. Clement decided having lost the election to Ross Bass, that he'd better shore up again his black political base.
Story_ID: 18198
Speaker 1: In the town locally [Memphis, Tennessee] we raised so much hell trying to make change that we finally got the county court to agree to appoint a black lawyer as an assistant public defender, and when the time came they decided to appoint me. I didn't want the job, it only paid $150 a month.  They worked the living slop out of you. I used to spend all day Saturday down in the jail, black folk defendants running out of my ears, taking notes and getting ready for trial the next week some time, representing twenty people in the run of a week. But I did take the job because it was such a hideous scene to go to the courthouse, no black judges, no black bailiffs, no black clerks, very few blacks if any on the jury. In a criminal court the only thing there black was a sea of black defendants, so I became a public defender. And then when Clement decided to appoint a black judge he called me on the phone and said, "I'm going to appoint a judge and it'll be you," and made it pretty clear if I did not take it he was not prepared to appoint anybody else.  And as much as I wanted to be a judge on one hand it was also a great financial sacrifice, because the job only paid at that time $15,000 a year. I had been practicing law, this was in 1964, I had been practicing law since '49 [1949] and had started finally to make some money.  I had just formed with A.W. [Willis] a savings and loan association, Mutual Federal Savings and Loan Association, that company was doing very well. I formed another business called Mahalia Jackson Chicken System, which was doing very well. And now if I took the judgeship it meant I had to maybe back up on some things. But I did take the judgeship.  And--well I hadn't started Mahalia Jackson, I overstate myself, I was a judge. I mean I was in the savings and loan association, and I did serve--and not only was I the first black judge of a court of record in Shelby County [Tennessee], I was actually the first black judge of a court of record in the entire South.  Now when I say a court of record I don't mean the city court judge of general sessions where there's no record kept, but in the circuit court it's called a court of record because it's appealable, and the criminal court in Shelby County is actually a circuit court with criminal jurisdiction.

Speaker 1: I served there [Shelby County, Tennessee, criminal court] for one year, but I had to be elected countywide. There was nobody in the county, including me, who saw any way for me to be elected, but with the help of Jesse Turner, Sr., NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and some political maneuvering, and some hard feelings and bad feelings. It ended up with the fifteen immediate past presidents of the bar association of Shelby County signing my nominating petition. The word went out that the power structure of Shelby County is supporting this black man, if any white lawyer jumps up and runs against him his name is mud in every court because that meant that twenty-two sitting white judges may also have opposition, and no judge wants to run in a contested race.  It's hard enough being a judge, it doesn't pay much, and to run against somebody means you've got to spend a year out there doing things that maybe a judge ought not to have to do. So when I ran, I was unopposed, that's the point I'm trying to make. And Jesse Turner, and the NAACP of Memphis deserved great credit, along with A.W. [Willis] and Russell, and Lockett, and other leaders.  And it was obvious, if you read the record and looked at my name on the ballot, I was not the first and I was not the last, I was in the middle, twenty-two of us running for election or re-election that year, in the big white wards full of white men running for judge, 700 votes, the next number Diamond, 800 votes, Hooks eighty-two.  In other words, even though I was unopposed there were many, many white people who did not get themselves ready to vote for me. Now had I had an opponent I may have made it, I may not have made it, the fact is I did not have an opponent and it started a trend. We have had so many black people elected judge in the county of Shelby that it's unbelievable.  And the court that I went on, Division Four, in 1965, that's what 30--over 30 years ago now, it's always had a black judge. And I suspect today in Memphis we have about seventeen or eighteen black judges, including a federal district judge. They are not elected. But we've had about fifteen men and women elected judges in the city and county of Shelby.  So it was a great experience, a great opportunity, and it made a difference because when I went on the bench people always raised this query, "What difference did it make?" It makes a hell of a lot of difference. When I went on the bench that same day the prosecutor's office, Phil Genaldi, added black people to his staff. They put black men in the courtroom as bailiffs, the deputy sheriff sits there.  They put black clerks in the clerk's office that day. And the judges voted in my first meeting, they voted to change the system of selecting juries so there would be as many black names in the jury pool for posting as there were black people in the city.  They made the motion and passed it, and appointed me as a sit-in judge in my term to be given the money to hire an assistant jury commissioner for the express purpose of correcting this wrong that existed from 1865.  So the change was phenomenal, it was across the board; judgeship, clerks, bailiffs, public defenders, the whole system changed, and now blacks on the jury. So that the presence of a black person who happened to be Ben Hooks, brought about a change in this city, this state and indeed across the nation.  When was that?  That was in 1965 that I took the office. I was elected in 1966 to an eight year term, I resigned three years later to give my time to the business that I was involved in, but not until I had worked with the governor who was by that time Buford Ellington to make sure that another black was appointed in my place.  And he did appoint Odell Horton who was a brilliant jurist who not only served with distinction in the job that I held, but who went on to become the first black man to serve as a federal district judge. And did a similar outstanding job over in the federal district court.

Speaker 1: Your reputation in politics was still sort of, like non-partisan, even after you became a Democrat. Now did you support [Richard M.] Nixon in the '60 [1960] election, presidential election?
Speaker 2: I supported Nixon the first time he ran for office, I forget what year it was. The first year that he--
Speaker 1: The year, that was '60 [1960], but--.
Speaker 2: The first year that he--yeah, I came after [Barry] Goldwater.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but after Goldwater you became a Democrat.  I think Nixon ran in '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: Right, he ran in '60 [1960].  We had Nixon in this city, in Memphis [Tennessee], in a big campaign, spoke at Mason Temple. Jackie Robinson was a big Republican in those days, George Lee. We pow-wowed with Nixon, it was at that same time that [Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] was arrested in Georgia and sent to the state prison and Kennedy's--John [F.] Kennedy's brother, Robert [F. Kennedy], made a call to Mrs. [Jackie] Kennedy [sic. Robert Kennedy called Mrs. Coretta Scott King], and remember he was not the [U.S.] Attorney General, he was not--he didn't have any office. And Jackie Robinson in particular got with Nixon and asked Nixon to issue a statement, you know, and he was, remember now, the sitting Vice President.  The Republicans made a decision, which I'm sure they must have regretted since then, that Nixon would not issue the statement but that [Dwight D.] Eisenhower would issue the statement. Now from a theoretical viewpoint that's much better. If Eisenhower calls the governor of Georgia, if Eisenhower calls Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King, if Eisenhower who is the President of these United States takes an active in role to make sure that King is not railroaded to prison it means a lot more than a call from a private citizen named Robert F. Kennedy.  The agreement was made that Eisenhower was to do it. The letter was drafted, I've seen a copy of the letter, but for some reason it never materialized. You can ascribe to what--and that was the beginning of my real disenchantment, but it had happened before then. It became obvious that something was happening to the Republican Party, and that the great men I knew were being shoved off to the side.  I think Howard Baker, one of the greatest [U.S.] senators we've produced, I still like him, still have a great deal of admiration for him, Scott from Pennsylvania, I don't want to go into all those names. But [ U.S. Congressman Emmanuel] Celler, a Democrat from New York and McCullough a Republican put together the Civil Rights Bill [1964], so that we had to have that helped by a bipartisan or nonpartisan, and that's why when I was appointed to the judgeship, I was appointed by Frank Clement, a Democrat

Speaker 1: When I was nominated for the Federal Communication Commission it was by [Richard M.] Nixon, a Republican. And I had not supported Nixon for election to the presidency at that point, but my major push came from [U.S. Senator] Howard Baker who knew me and thought a great deal of me, and was particularly fond of Frances, my wife.  And his wife at that time, she's passed now, and Frances were great friends. And Baker was responsible for my nomination to the FCC. And I could stand--sit here on this seat for days and tell you about the changes we were able to bring about just by being a member of the FCC. The whole climate of the communications industry changed.
Speaker 2: Now you had some background in television, in producing and being a part of some various television shows in Memphis [Tennessee], right?
Speaker 1: Yes, what happened was that Maura (inaudible) was at WMCT-Channel 5 and Maura was a really public spirited citizen, we had organized a chapter of a group together called Frontiers, which was a black service club similar to Rotary, or Kiwanis, but black oriented. And Maura was a charter member of the Memphis chapter, and I was on his television--had a television program, but I also had a program on WREC called 'What is Your Faith' every Sunday morning, I was on with the pastor of First Baptist out here, Cordell, and Roy Wintherford of First Methodist.  I also had a program on WHBQ on Saturday afternoon. I had two on--I was on every television station here. And we had a great program called 'Forty Percent Speaks,' Maxine Baskill and great number of black people did that. That was when the FCC was very community oriented. The FCC was doing some real things to make the communication industry more public, but what most people didn't realize was that television is only a minor part of what the FCC covers.  We regulated AT&T at that point. When I went to the commission AT&T employed over one million people, one million; had a gross income of over forty billion dollars, was the first company to achieve a profit level of more than a million dollars a quarter, and they were in a lawsuit by the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission about their racial policies.
Story_ID: 18202
Speaker 1: And Ben Hooks, the first FCC [Federal Communications Commission] commissioner, changed things at AT&T like you wouldn't believe. They put a black on the Board of Directors the first week I was there. Black people--a black man became president of one of the twenty-seven Bell-operated companies, we made tremendous changes in the organization itself. When I went to the FCC it had about 2300 employees, 250 lawyers, and only three black lawyers.  You could walk up and down the halls of the FCC all day and never see a black person. One day I saw a young black woman and she said 'Commissioner, you looking for us aren't you?' and she laughed, you know, a black woman. And it so happened, I mean no offense by this, they were all in the basement because they were doing mail and other kinds of tasks. I was able to change that picture, but I was able to change it.  I want to be fair about that, because at that point there were seven commissioners and Dean Bursh was the chairman, and he appointed me Commissioner of Equal Opportunity Employment internally/externally. We set up a unit and employed seventeen people to monitor television and radio stations to see what were they were doing, to monitor AT&T, and all of these great, you know, telephone companies, and all of the things we were dealing with I was the commissioner that had charge of making sure that EEO was complied with.  I also had charge of trying to bring about a change within the commission because before I left we'd hired 60 black lawyers. Now one of the most lucrative law practices of the world is in communications law; it pays big money. Because as Pastoria put it, Senator Pastoria of Rhode Island, television stations returned the biggest profit of any business I know.  If you handle forty million dollars you may make a profit of thirty million. I don't know of any other business that does that, just so--it's set up like that. And when I went to the commission there were only thirteen black-owned radio stations in the whole nation, not a single black-owned television station. We were not in cable.  Robert Johnson, who became the first black billionaire, was working for a national cable television association when I went. He did an outstanding job during the time I was there. So that many, many changes were made because before I left we had started on rules which became effective after I left, they gave minorities a chance to own television stations, radio stations.  I think the owned radio stations went from thirteen to over 200. Employment changed because we said that we were going to look at every station that had as many ten employees to see what they'd done in terms of minority and the female employment. And I could spend weeks on the changes we made. All kinds of changes, some you see and some you don't see.  I went to a television station once in Denver [Colorado], never shall forget it as long as the day I live . Three young white men had met me at the airport, they were in cable, and they delighted, I mean, the FCC commission in those days had so much clout that if you walked in the broadcasting studios people would actually, you know, started shaking.  And they took me to all the stations in Denver.
Story_ID: 18203
Speaker 1: But when these three young white men met me at the airport, they were in cable, and in those days anybody in the communications business was glad to talk with any commissioner black, white, red, yellow, green it didn't matter. They took me around to the cable operators, and a lot of cable is situated right there in Denver [Colorado]. And remember cable was in its early days then.  And on this particular day I went to two Denver television stations, but the third one I went to the general manager didn't come up and it was about fifteen minutes later and we were sitting in the waiting room and they got disturbed because they felt I was being mistreated, but also they were with me and they were feeling their cheerios. And so he said to the receptionist, "This is Commissior Hooks. You know he's from the FCC [Federal Communications Commission]," and she got harassed and ran out of the room and came back. About a half hour later here comes the general manager with a young black man with him, he pushed the black man ahead of him. He said 'Mr. Commissioner, I want you to meet a man who's the general manager of our transportation division.' He'd appointed a black man to a job while I was up there waiting.That's the kind of respect--and the young man deserved the job. I met him many years after and he was still there and doing a good job. Well we went out and made speech after speech to the black community and they became acquainted with the whole idea of cable. You know this was a capital intensive business, but a lot of black people became rich and powerful off the cable thing, some right here in Memphis [Tennessee] because very few people go for cable ownership unless they had minority participation. We did what was right. I don't recall doing anything that I'm ashamed of, but I raised hell about black and minority participation behind the camera, on the camera. AT&T you must remember was a subject of lawsuits because they were not employing blacks as operators. You know, I mean a million people they employed, twenty-seven operating companies. Before I left there we had a black man who a president of a major multibillion dollar company, the first black who rose to that kind of position, or rose to that position in the telephone industry regulated by the FCC. I'm proud of the changes we made, of how we brought the first black anchorman on, Max Robinson, of how we can now go to any city where it used to be all white, and see now white female, black female, black, Hispanics as anchor people, you know, and working. Public television was almost closed to black people. It was supposed to be our resort, a place we could go to.  I saw Tony Brown grow. I helped him start the school of communications at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and the job didn't pay very much. And I worked myself to a frazzle because I was busy all over this nation; I spoke to Urban League, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], to every Greek letter organization. And I tried to tell people what the communication, John Johnson--Ebony bought a station, A.G. Gaston, the president of a company in Birmingham [Alabama] bought a station. By the way they just sold it three years ago for twenty million dollars. The station cost them a million dollars when I was up there. And we put black people in there not just to make millionaires, but to give us a chance to be seen, to be heard, to have our ideas expressed, to give people for the first time the opportunity to really be somebody as they should be. And that FCC position--that's why when I left to go to NAACP a lot of black folk in this nation were sick; they felt I'd left a much more important position at the FCC. We'd opened so many doors. But I was succeeded by a very fine young man named Brown, and the escalation continued. Finally we had these sales to minorities, what they called bankruptcy sales and other kinds of things that really opened some real doors.  Now obviously when I went around I would go to a news conference, there would be many issues, allocation of spectrum, VHF versus UHF, technical rules and regulations, all kinds of questions about issues of fairness doctrine and this that and the other, and I want you to understand that I worked like the very devil to make sure that I was on top of every issue; that I was aware of what was going on. And when I would go to a city and they would call a press conference, again that same trip to Denver, every television station came out, two newspapers and some other folk, and they asked me twenty-one, twenty-one questions, and twenty-one of them were about negroes and the black issue. At the end of it one of them had the nerve to say "Well, Commissioner you're getting the reputation of being a black commissioner because you're only interested in issues that affect black people." I said, "I'm glad you said that," I said, "There were twenty-one questions asked today, I didn't ask one of them, you asked all of them and every one of your questions was about, you know, conditions affecting black people. Had you asked me about the fairness doctrine, had you asked me about the rules and regulations, the community ascertainment access"--I went on and named all the hot issues, I said, "I came prepared to discuss them but you did not ask me one time. Now if I have a label 'black commissioner' whose fault or gain is it?"  But let me tell you something, nobody's going to keep me from dealing with the issues that have to be dealt with.  You can ridicule me or talk about me but basically I received a good reception--(unclear) was known as the bane of commissioners because he ran a big magazine called 'Broadcasting.' He was as fair to me as any man could ever be and I enjoyed knowing him. I enjoyed working with those six other commissioners because on every issue involving the race question I got seven zero votes. Now when it came to the breakup of AT&T, which is the biggest thing that's ever hit the commission, I dissented from nearly every decision the commission reached. I had issued so many dissenting opinions I got tired of them myself. I made a great speech one day and I said, "We're going to tear up this telephone company and we're never ever going to be able to rebuild it."  And we haven't. If there's something wrong with my home phone today, I've got to call three different companies to get it straight because not one company's doing it all. When I made that speech, and I called it 'All the Kings Horses and All the Kings Men Shall Not Put it Back Together Again' I never will forget that. And the chairman of the board of AT&T said, "Had we been giving the attention to the company as we should have perhaps we would not have reached this point." So I enjoyed--that work was tremendous, but not only that but it was something that black people still have not quite learned. Those regulatory agencies like the Security and Exchange Commission, FCC, Federal Power Commission at that time, the Interstate Commerce Commission, these commissions have life and death power over so many things in America, the Federal Trade Commission, and in all the years that they have existed. In 1972 I was the third person to ever serve on one of those commissions. Andrew Brimmer served on the what's this, Alan Greenspan--you know the big board, I hope we can think of it, but where Alan Greenspan sits now, as Chairman, Brimmer served on that. Higginbotham served on the Federal Trade Commission for one year. And I served on the--
Speaker 2: Federal Reserve Bank.
Speaker 1: --Federal Reserve Bank. So that here are agencies that you don't see most of the time; FCC got a lot of publicity and we were powerful, are now. By the way a black man is chairman of that board named Michael Powell, the son of Secretary of State Colin Powell. But you know here--we changed and were able from the position I set, to try to start putting blacks on these regulatory agencies where you have a chance to change the whole tenor of the American way of life for the better. So those who've been left out can have a chance to be included in. I left the FCC in 1977 after having served five great years, and went to the NAACP.
Story_ID: 18204
Speaker 1: Now can I say a word about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]? I want to get that on in the next fifteen minutes. People often ask me about the NAACP, what shape it was in and how was it, very seldom has anybody ever heard me say anything derogatory about the NAACP. But when I went there it was having problems. In the year before I went to the NAACP, they met in Memphis [Tennessee] and there was a great big public demonstration. There was a big public dispute about Mr. [Roy] Wilkins; there were many members of the board who felt he'd outlived his usefulness and that his time had come and gone. And Roy Wilkins was a legendary genius and had done so much. But right here in Memphis in 19--in that meeting there were demonstrations because some of the board wanted him to leave. We were in financial difficulty because a judgment had been rendered against the NAACP in Mississippi for a million and two million dollars, we were about to go out of business financially--  It was a civil rights judgment?  A civil rights judgment had been rendered against because of a boycott we'd lead down in Mississippi, Fayette, Mississippi. And the state court had given a judgment against us, and we didn't have a million dollar and no way to pay it. Because of the dispute between Mr. Wilkins and the board they had taken some of Mr. Wilkins' duties away from him, given them to another man titled Administrator, the staff was in straits trying to decide who was running what. The executive director had lost the ability to name his principal officers. He could not name any longer. The general council, the Washington legislative head, many of the--all the top offices had been taken out of their hands, and there was a group called the Caucus, an unofficial group, a board who ran the association, they insisted that I sign a contract. Wiley Brandon, who was my lawyer, said to me, 'You'll make yourself a slave if you sign this.' But I had the feeling that God had called me to personally deliver black folk out of the bondage that they were still in. I felt a call that I can not describe. That in spite of the fact that I had a good job at the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] with tremendous power, in spite of the fact that had I at the age of--I was only 52--had I decided to leave the FCC and go into private practice of law--I was offered $150,000 a year to come into a law firm and not really practice, but sort of you know move around the country and just be their black presence.  And the head of the firm said, 'And Hooks if you really want to practice, Mr. Commissioner, we'll pay you 200 thousand dollars and a part of the profits."  And that gave me an opportunity to be on boards of  major corporations. Some of these boards, now that I could have gone on, paid three or $400,000 a year just for membership, and you can retire on a board like you can retire from a job. And I gave up all of that opportunity to be on major boards, to have a major job, to go into a major law firm. I suspect that my first year out of the FCC had I wanted to stay in private life it would have been very easy to make six or 700 hundred [thousand dollars] a year. And when I went to the NAACP, it was plagued with problems, but I've never said a critical word about Mr. Wilkins, will not now, because I think he was absolutely a genius at his work. I think he'd done a tremendous job, had a great staff, but there were problems. When I look back at it, I recognize that I took a big chance to go to an institution that could have been put out of business the next day by that judgment. And the press--the big day of civil rights was over, they were no longer giving a lot of attention.
Story_ID: 18205
Speaker 1: The things that I was able to start at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I started a fair share program before I left, we'd signed seventy major agreements; General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, you name the companies, you know, that dealt with the NAACP saying 'You're going to put black folk on your board, you're going to spend money with black entrepreneurs, you're going to support black travel endeavors, and follow a decent EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity] program.' We signed seventy private agreements and fourteen with utilities, eighty-four agreements that we actually signed and implemented. We started a thing called AXLE with Vernon Jarrett who came up with that tremendous idea. And since that time thousands and thousands of young people have been given a chance to exhibit their skills in twenty-seven different kinds of things, not just public speaking and singing. One of our young men did something that was on a spaceship. I don't know what the devil it was. But we've brought in thousands of young people. We had thing called 'Back to School, Stay in School.'  We recognized that unless our kids took advantage of the school system we have we were not going to advance, and so we started that program. Dave Stern of the basketball league took it over and did it in many cities. It still operates. "Don't be a fool, stay in school." We started Women in the NAACP. They'd always had a great chance, but we put them in renewed ways so they could move forward. We had voter registration drives you couldn't believe. One voter registration drive came all the way from California to our meeting in Baltimore [Maryland], across the country. Another one took the ground of the old underground railroad lead by Joe Madison, who's now a very famous radio personality. We'd put into place the first corporate campaign. The NAACP had never raised money from the corporate community. Before I left we'd raised over a $100 million from the corporate community. Today the money comes in by the millions. A campaign we started when we were there. We brought the membership to the largest it had ever had in history. I said when I went there I was going to build it to a million members, but I was told by Mr. Cullen, "You've got a long way to go because we've never had the 500,000 we've been talking about since '44 [1944]."  But before I left there we had a documented membership in excess of 500 thousand. We've made the Crisis Magazine move from a fairly small circulation until at the Post Office we were sending 423 thousand copies, and we never missed an issue; ten of them a year. Kept the Crisis Magazine, the oldest continually published black publication. After I left it failed to publish for awhile, for all the years I was there we came out ten times a year, moved the revenue to almost a million dollars every period, and covered some tremendous reading. We went into the question of the black family at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] with John Dick of the Urban League, pulled together a conference on the black family, what has happened to us as a people. We started so many programs I don't have time to--educational conferences. We called conferences on the Barkett case. We had twenty-seven major legislative victories, including the Martin Luther King Holiday bill. And I don't mean to say we did it all by ourselves, but we were the principal organization of the Martin Luther King Holiday bill, the American Disabilities Act. In 1991, the NAACP led my last march, we had over 75 thousand people over by the park by police estimate, by my estimate 125 thousand which lead to the passage of the 1992 civil rights bill. The same bill in effect that Mr. [George H.W.] Bush had vetoed a year before that. We had the Lionel Jeter case where a young black man had been sentenced to life imprisonment for holding up a Kentucky Fried Chicken place. We proved that he was innocent. He's now around selling books about that experience, a fine young man. The Bracy case where a young black man was being sent to jail for life for selling secrets to the Russian government, we proved that was wrong. The Barker case fallout. We had major legal victories. I headed the Leadership Council on Civil Rights for twelve years, so that the NAACP had some phenomenally successful years and I think we crowned it all by buying a building--we'd never owned a building in all of our years, and before I left there we had a building fully paid for, worth over six million dollars where we still operate. Just before I bought that building the rent was going to 750 thousand [dollars] dollars a year. Think about those years that we've been able to save almost a million dollars a year of rent in the last, I'd say fifteen years. And when I left, thank God we left it in good shape. We left over two million dollars cash and every bill paid. I made a special effort, and the Board of Directors of NAACP came up to bat and hit a double home run--the volunteer staff, we worked together, to raise the money to pay off every bill and leave a surplus there for our successors. Now I've been asked since I left, how did they fall on bad times so quickly? All I'll say to you is the average family is three paychecks away from bankruptcy. And I mean by that, let the breadwinner lose their job, and don't cut back on spending, go up on it, and see what happens to that household. When I left the NAACP, they almost stopped trying to raise money and began to spend it in ways I've never seen before, some of which was not really right. And so they went broke, I didn't call the names, but they did go broke, they spent the surplus, stopped raising money, and spending it like water. And there were even bills running 30 and 40 thousand dollars a month. All those kinds of things happening and it distressed me. And I give Myrlie Evers-Williams great credit and the treasurer who came in and helped to stabilize us, and Kweisi Mfume, Julian Bond, both of whom are doing tremendous jobs. The NAACP today is in the strongest financial position in history. But I thank God that I was able to contribute to that by starting the campaign. In the years that I headed NAACP we raised over 200 million dollars, never missed a payroll, and we answered every issue--it's strange how many young intelligent blacks were asking me "What are you doing?" and I said, "What do you want me to do? Write it down." And in nearly instance when they wrote down on a piece of paper what they'd like to see us involved in we were already out there doing it. We were working with the corporate community. We were putting over a hundred blacks on boards of directors. And it does make a difference when blacks sit in positions of power.
Story_ID: 18206
Speaker 1: We were working at the level of the federal government. I served as president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] during the years that [Ronald] Reagan and [George H. W.] Bush were president, and they were not particularly friendly to our cause. But they were never able to pass one anti-civil rights bill in twelve years. We had a big loss in [U.S. Supreme Court justice] Clarence Thomas. We fought him vigorously with everything we had and lost it, I think, by a vote--by less than four votes. And I regret it today, because when we talk with Clarence Thomas it became obvious to me back there he was not going to be the kind of judge that we wanted as black people, and I pray to God that some way he will change even at this date.  But the fact is that NAACP in 1977 when I went there had a big problem, and that problem was public relations wise, other organizations had been given credit for work that Mr. [Roy] Wilkins and his group had done. Of all the people that went to jail during the great sit in movement about 90 percent of them were NAACP young people. And most folk don't recognize that.
Speaker 2: Wasn't there a tension between Roy Wilkins, his office in New York, and the NAACP field secretaries in the South, like (unclear) and other people?
Speaker 1: Actually, actually I would have to say no, Ruby Hurley had a great tension between she and other civil rights organizations because she felt the NAACP was never given credit, you know, for the work they did. And there's no question that the bulk of the work fell on the NAACP. In fact one of the reasons for our loss of money was NAACP put up that money. No, we didn't have any trouble with our field secretaries. There was one field secretary who somehow got so caught up and so paralyzed that he wanted to start using a shotgun. Well you know it's obvious that--. Yes, in one of these South or North Carolina, and Roy Wilkins rightly rebuked and repudiated him. I mean, how are we going to fight with rusty sawed off shotguns? And the other thing is, what distresses me more than anything in the world, is that when you look at the history of the modern civil rights movement its success was not based on just marching feet but thinking minds.

Speaker 1: [Charles Hamilton] Houston, the great NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] lawyer, said "How can we break the back of bondage?"  And he said, "There's two ways to do it, you've either got to beat them in court or pass some laws in the Congress or in the state legislature."  Look back and ask yourself the questions.  Brown v. Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas] in 1954 is the instrumentality that said, "In the future segregation will no longer work." It reversed Plessy v. Ferguson, and most folk have not realized that. That was the result of black people using their brains and going to the [U.S.]  Supreme Court and nine white men sitting in black robes decided that segregation in the school system was illegal, unconstitutional, could not stand. And once you understand that if you're going to go to school in an integrated setting you can't have separate water fountains, you can't have separate restrooms in there, you can't have separate classrooms, you can't have separate academic facilities or sports; the back of segregation was broken May 17, 1954. And that came about because NAACP, men and women sat around for months debating, "What shall we do, how can we break this thing up? We'll do it through getting the Voting Rights Act [1965] passed, we do it through legislation, and we do it through court victories." In the case of Briggs v. Clarendon County, when a black man who was a veteran came back and said "You've got all this white kids going to school on buses, black kids have to stand in the rain, I want my young black daughter to be able to go to school on a bus." The school board said no. They went to the NAACP and the NAACP said 'We're not going to file a lawsuit to let black kids ride a bus to a black school. We'll file a lawsuit to break the back of segregation once and forever. We've tried in the '30s [1930s], Gaines v. Missouri, trying to get black folk into higher education. We tried it in all of these cases trying to get blacks into medical schools and law schools, now we're going to start at the first grade." And that succeeded. And when you look out today and see what black folk have achieved most of it is based in the modern premise of Brown v. Board of Education, when the NAACP decided, we're no longer going to take the crumb, but we're going for the main vein. And the NAACP by the time I came on board in 1977, the great days of victories were passed. Now we have the job of implementation, and Thurgood Marshall said it's far more difficult to implement than to win the major victory. You don't get headlines because you win small victories everyday.  It became the job of Roy Wilkins in his last years to implement the victories that had been won. Other organizations went out of business.You don't hear of them now. But the NAACP still stands, still has these branches all over the nation, still has these people out there. When something goes wrong in Cleveland [Ohio], Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], Memphis [Tennessee], or Mobile [Alabama] who do they call on? NAACP. Who is it that could make the Democratic presidential candidates who refused to come to our convention just a few days ago, all three of them come and apologize? The NAACP is still the most vital institution outside of the church that we have, and I'm proud of the years I spent with it. Yes, I went there at a difficult time. And yes, I was one of the men who helped turn it around. And yes, I left it in good shape. And I thank God that it has been put back into even better shape, and that Kweisi [Mfume], and Julian [Bond], and Rosaline Brock, our young dynamic vice chairman of that board, and Hazel Dukes, and those staffers I left, Mildred (unclear) and some others. And maybe I'll have to do another interview on this, but I'll tell you one thing, I'm proud of the part I played in helping to bring about change. I went at a very difficult time, and I tell you now that there will be people looking at this segment who really don't know what the NAACP accomplished. They've never really known because the newspapers have consistently, going back to the days of Walter White or James Weldon Johnson, have consistently refused to give us credit. And anybody else who came along they called their name and bragged on them. The first sit in movement in modern times was conducted by a young black woman in Oklahoma City against a drugstore. You know why it's not talked about much? Because we won it, and you don't talk about victories. In 1927 William Walls, the great bishop of the AME Zion Church sit-in at the Harvard's eating place at Union Station in Washington, D.C. and stayed there until they served him. And from '27 [1927] until modern days it's the only place in Washington where black and white folk could eat together. This history has not been told. Not just people marching and getting their behinds beat, but men and women using their brains. Black folk, wake up, you didn't make this victory because you had good feet, but because you had thinking minds. But because you had men and women who sat down and agonized and paid a price, who studied, strategized, tried to look to the future, how can we bring about change that will be meaningful and lasting? And I thank God that I was a part of that cadre of people who helped implement and make that change lasting.  Thank you.
