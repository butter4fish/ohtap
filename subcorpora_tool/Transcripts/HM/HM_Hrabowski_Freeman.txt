Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Freeman Hrabowski, F-R-E-E-M-A-N, H-R-A-B-O-W-S-K-I.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And one of the questions most people ask when you say your name is Hrabowski--
Speaker 2: Right, yes--
Speaker 1: How did a black man in America--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --become a Hrabowski?
Speaker 2: Right.  It's one of those southern stories; it's an American story.  My great-great-grandfather was Polish, and was a slavemaster.  And his mulatto son, Tom Hrabowski, who was my great-grandfather, was actually given quite a bit of land by his father.  And that came down to my grandfather, who was Freeman Hrabowski.  I'm the third, and Freeman was the first in his family born, the first boy, born after Emancipation.  So, he was not a freedman, he was a Freeman.  And so, the history of the name comes from both those facts--from the Polish ancestry and from the timing of my grandfather's birth.
Speaker 1: And so, and so they told the story?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And I have pictures.  I have pictures of Freeman the first and my father, Freeman II, but also of Tom, who was their father who was mulatto on that side.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 13, 1950 is when I was born, in Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  (Laughter).  Let me see...  Today's... okay, today's date is July 20th, 2003.  Today's date is July 21st, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're on our camp...on my campus, UMBC, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in Baltimore, Maryland.
Story_ID: 92353
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish-type questions that I'm compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the first one of these questions is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Crab, I enjoy crab cakes.  I enjoy crab souffle.  Seafood in general, but crab, shrimp, lobster.  This is Baltimore [Maryland], we are crab people.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite color?  I like black, I like black a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Springtime; hope.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I have a home in Hilton Head and I love it, in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love it.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "Success is never final."  And, "You're special, and you can better.  You can be even better."   Those two things drive my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Whatever you do, you can always do it better.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  I can always be much better than I am.  And no matter how successful the campus is, or my colleagues and students are, we can do better.
Story_ID: 92354
Speaker 1: Alright.  Let me ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you first about your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But on your mother's side--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: First of all, what's your mother's full name?
Speaker 2: Maggie Elizabeth Geeter Hrabowski.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  M-A-G-G-I-E, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Geeter, G-E-E-T-E-R, Hrabowski, H-R-A-B-O-W-S-K-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born January 23, 1916 in Wetumpka, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you tell us what you know about her family?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Where did they come from?
Speaker 2: They all were from that area, from Wetumpka, Alabama.  I was looking at a form that was asking me about her family background.  Every family has a story.  And my mother is dead now, but my mother never wanted to talk about her father.  He was, he was not someone we talked about.  So, there's a story there that I still don't know, quite frankly.  But her mother was Gracie Geeter.  And my grandmother grew up with us.  My grandmother was in my home a lot when I was growing up in Birmingham [Alabama].  And Gracie was very strong, a very strong woman who, without my mother's father and her three brothers' father, raised those four children by herself.  And what is significant is that there was great strength in that family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that that side of the family passed down from the 19th century about slavery or Reconstruction?  Any stories about that?
Speaker 2: Well, John and Litha (ph.) Hrabowski were my mother's grandparents.  Excuse me, John and Octavia Hrabowski [sic, Geeter] were my... those were my maternal great-grandparents.
Speaker 1: Your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: My maternal... my mother's... my mother's grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother, Gracie, was born in 1890.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is your mother's--
Speaker 2: This is my mother's mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought the Hrabowski side was your father's side.
Speaker 2: But you see, I said her name was Maggie Elizabeth Geeter Hrabowski.  She married my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see, but her name was Geeter.  And her mother was a Geeter.  And her... and her parents, John... her grandparents, John and Octavia Geeter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I actually have a picture of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were better off than most people.  They had a fairly large family.  There were about fourteen or fifteen children of which, of whom my grandmother was one.  And they owned a lot of land in Wetumpka.  And we still have that land, in fact.  And my mother, though, was the first in her family to go to college.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how they acquired such wealth?
Speaker 2: I don't know the story on that side, I honestly don't.  I do know that John's wife, Octavia, was also a mulatto, I do know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I know that she had had certain advantages, I'm aware of that.  And they would have been born slaves, John and Octavia.  The reason I keep thinking about it is that Octavia was my great-grandmother on my mother's side, and Litha was my great-grandmother that I talk about being on my father's side.  But the fact is that they did well in farming, and were able to have...  I've got pictures of them... they were able to have very nice horse and buggies and a lovely old home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, they did well.
Speaker 1: Now, where is Wetumpka?
Speaker 2: Wetumpka is a few miles south of Montgomery [Alabama].  I assume its south of Montgomery.  But it's a few miles outside of Montgomery.  As a child, I heard that you could go from Montgomery to Wetumpka in fifteen minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's really on the outside of Montgomery, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Montgomery is more so the center of the state?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum, um-hum, south of Birmingham [Alabama], but north of Mobile [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Wetumpka is an Indian name, as you can see.
Story_ID: 92355
Speaker 1: So, are there any good stories that they tell about any of those days?
Speaker 2: Good stories about those days?  I have an interesting story that my, that one of my mother's cousins told.  This is a cousin who lived with my wife [Jacqueline Coleman] and me here.  My wife and I had three senior citizens in our home.  One was in her seventies, one was in her eighties, and one was in her nineties.  And this is the woman in her nineties, my cousin, Ola, who was a college-educated woman who actually went to the University of Chicago [Illinois], and who was a phenomenal woman who actually had two Ph.D. husbands in her life, if you can imagine back in the '30s [1930s] and through the '60s [1960s].  Because Ola always told the story of the first time she saw a car.  She and her friends were going to school, and all of a sudden a carriage without a horse in front of it was coming along.  And they thought it must have been a dead horse that was a ghost pulling the carriage.  And when this... and the horn blew, and they all ran and got in the ditch.  And they were frightened for the rest of the day.  They were talking about this horseless carriage.  It was beyond their understanding.
Speaker 1: So, they were children?
Speaker 2: They were children, they were children.  She was in the elementary school.  And so, since she was born in 1904, if you think about it for a minute, it would of have to been in the teens, somewhere between 1910 and 1915, '16 [1916], something like that.  But she always remembered that story because it was a new day, a carriage without a horse.  That was the way she talked about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski], you said she had an opportunity to go to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  My mother went to college.  It was this cousin who inspired my mother.  This cousin actually went to Alabama State when it was a high school in Montgomery.  And then she went to boarding school in Birmingham [Alabama].  And amazingly, this was a boarding school that taught the classics for colored children.  And this was when my cousin, Ola, was fourteen.  So, this would have been 1919.  And her... the headmaster of that school was a classicist, who was the father of Margaret Walker Alexander, you see.  And interestingly, my cousin Ola and Margaret Walker were friends for sixty years.
Story_ID: 92356
Speaker 1: What's Ola's last name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Ola Scroggins as a child.  And then she married a Tatum, Dr. Tatum, who was chair of political science at Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi].  And my cousin Ola taught literature there.  And then years later she married, after this first husband died, she married a widow... a widower... I guess a guy's a widower... whose name was Nick Aaron Ford, who was a big guy in Black Studies and Chairman of the--
Speaker 1: Nick Aaron Ford is a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --famous name in Black Studies.
Speaker 2: That's exactly.
Speaker 1: Out here at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, chairman of the English department.  Well, my cousin married him.  And I would come to Baltimore as a college student to stay at their home.  I'm in Baltimore because of Nick Aaron Ford.  He convinced me to come to Baltimore.  And I was responsible for his wife, once he died.  And so, I was fortunate to get Cousin Nick's library, and to read all of his first books going back to the '30s [1930s].  You see, Cousin Nick was the first black Ph.D. from the University of Iowa, from Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa].  He had his masters in '39 [1939] and his Ph.D. in the early forties.  And he amazing convinced the team, the advisory, the doctorate advisory group, to let him do his Ph.D. research dissertation on Negro Literature.  They were convinced--those white Ph.D.'s in English--that Negro Literature was not serious academic work.  But he was able to convince them through his masters and Ph.D. to let him do his research, and to do his dissertation on that subject.  But the key is that Cousin Ola was constantly telling these stories throughout the time I was with her about growing up there.  And you asked me a question, and I forgot.  And I was telling you something about Ola, her being the first... she became the first to go to college.  She left... as it was, she taught... once you finished high school at that time, you see, in the '20s [1920s] you could teach.  You could get a teaching certificate with a high school diploma.  But she did that a little while, but she wanted more.  So, she went to Chicago [Illinois] and worked at a home for orphans, and that was as a maid.  And was a... but there was a Vassar [College, New York] woman who headed the home, who could see that my cousin Ola was literate, was educated already, and encouraged her to go to school.  And she went to school to become a social worker.  And this was, and it was amazing that in the... this was in the late '20s and through about 1930, '31 [1931].  And so, she got a degree in social work from the University of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She got two degrees, in fact, while she was there.  She got one from a place that's now called the Illinois School of Technology [Chicago, Illinois], in home economics.  And then the Depression came and they were looking for social workers, and she went back and got a degree in social work.  And years later, she went back in English.  So, she did three degrees and then went on to grad school in English.  But she was... during the period of the Depression, she went back to Wetumpka [Alabama] to help her parents, and taught.  And while she was there teaching, she taught my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] and inspired my mother--who was her little valedictorian from high school--to go to college.
Story_ID: 92357
Speaker 1: So, Mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] became the first in her immediate family to go to college.  And my mother went to college in 1934.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she met my father [Freeman Hrabowski], who was the first in his family to go to college in the mid-'30s [mid-1930s].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, where was she?
Speaker 1: She went to college first at Alabama A&M University [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University] in Huntsville when it was just a two-year school.  And then she could teach, and she went down to work in the Montgomery [Alabama] area to teach.  And she taught, and she went to school to finish her bachelor's there at [Alabama] State [University, Montgomery, Alabama], and met my father who was doing the same thing.  And so, they both became teachers in the '30s [1930s].  And then they went on to other grad schools after that.
Speaker 2: Well, so she taught, basically, as a career?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, my mother taught for forty years, from the '30s to the '70s [1970s].  And she taught me.  She taught English, and later on English and math--middle school English and math from the thirties to the seventies.  And so, I grew up in a home that had me learning Zora Neale Hurston quotes from age three or four.  From "Their Eyes Were Watching God" to Langston Hughes... Paul Laurence Dunbar.  So, all my life I was reciting poetry.  This was... and doing story problems.  And it was that emphasis on the reading--and reading from Hughes to Shakespeare, quite frankly, to Dostoevsky--as a child that led me to be curious about not just about books, but about language itself, and the power of language.  And they also, my father enjoyed math.  So, they would always have me competing with word problems.  We had word problems tacked all the way around the walls, all over the place with incentives.  If I can solve this word problem I can get a nickel, or I can get some Tootsie Rolls; we can go to the hamburger place.  And so, it was in that environment.  It was all of that coupled with the Civil Rights Movement throughout my childhood.  It was learning and civil rights all the time.
Story_ID: 92358
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about your father.  His name is the same as yours?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's spelled the same way?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Presumably you're a junior, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And where was he born, and when was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Selma, below Selma, Alabama, in a place called Sardis, Alabama, Lowndes County.  And he was born in 1910, December 23, 1910.  He was forty when I was born.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the famous Lowndes County made popular during the 1960 marches with Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Toure]?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: The Lowndes County Black Panther Party was there.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, yeah.  You know your history, you really do.  Well, my father grew up in that area.  And as I said, there was a lot of land on that side.  His family in some ways was more advantaged with land and money, and more advantaged in the sense that he was an only child, as I am.  He had a brother who died when he was a child, and so everything went to him.  And, and the family was very entrepreneurial.  And so, we were very fortunate.  We had more than most children had.  A great story, though... Do you want a story?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: He finished as valedictorian of his little school, high school.  They were always proud... working hard... hard workers, hard workers.  And he was ready to go to college.  This was in 1928.  And the day before he was to go his son--his father--said to him, "Son, I can't let you go."  He said, "I thought I had a way to handle this second plow, but I don't have anybody to do it.  Because I've got to use..."  The guy that was working for him was doing other things.  And his mother... his mother, Daddy's mother, had the same attitude as my mama's mother.  They both had seen Mr. Washington back in the teens [1910s].  Because Mr. Washington would go around the state to different towns.  And when Mr. Washington came to town, everybody would come out to hear him.
Speaker 1: This is Booker T.?
Speaker 2: This is Booker T. Washington.  Both of my grandmothers called him Mr. Washington.  And they both told the story that he would say to people, "Send your children to school.  Send your children..."  Education is the key, was the idea.  "But send..." and they believed that.  And so it was, it was really... those women hearing Mr. Washington say that...  Well, my granddaddy, who was a very stubborn man, said, "I would like to.  But you know, you got a high school diploma.  You can do this plowing and you can teach.  I need you right here."  And my grandmother was a little woman, she was probably 5'2".  She, and she never spoke back, talked back to her husband, never.  She said, "No, my child is going to school."  And he said, "Well, who's going to do this plowing?"  And she said, "I will."  And people laughed at her, because there was no way this little woman was going to handle that plow.  I want you to know, for four years she's out there in that hot sun, breaking her back for her child.  And my daddy always said, "How could he not work really hard, when he knew he was there sitting in that classroom while his Mama was doing his work."  And he always told me that, and that is something that sticks with me all the time.  When I taught about hard work, he always said, "Boy, you don't know what hard work is.  When you got to be out there in that hot sun breaking your back...  I mean it's just over and over again, up and down the rows.  You know, most people have no sense... no clue of what that means."  But that's a story that inspires me all the time.
Story_ID: 92359
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, that's right, about family helping.  Now, what kind of person was your father [Freeman Hrabowski]?  What was he like, and did he do?
Speaker 2: A strong man, the strongest man I've ever known in my life.  Hardworking... my daddy and my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] both worked three jobs each; worked three jobs all of my life.  My father didn't stay in teaching, because you couldn't make a lot of money teaching.  My father took advantage of his education, though.  He could make more money as a laborer than he could as a teacher.  And for a while, he served as a little principal of one of the little rural schools.  But my father would, he worked as a laborer at the Stockham Valves & Fittings Steel Mill there in Birmingham [Alabama].  But on the side, he would do the reading and writing for his white supervisor.  He worked at the railroad, and on the side he would do the reading and writing for the illiterate white supervisor, alright.  He wrote for the little magazine of the paper; he wrote the colored part of the newsletter for the magazine.  And finally he was... he was a very distinguished looking, handsome man, with a nice gentlemanly approach to things.  And so, he was great with families at funerals.  So, he would be somebody just to help with the families.  He could always comfort people.  (Laughter).  And he was just good to have around, "Mr. Hrabowski," as they called him.  See, I pronounce it "Rabowski."  In the South, it's "Robuski."  So, "Mr. "Hrabowski" was there to help them out.  So, literally he was working six and a half days a week, doing those three things.  My mother taught school during the day.  She taught the GED program in the evening, and she sold insurance--all just to give me the best, just to give me the best.  And my mother was very proud of the fact that she had fought for what was called equalization of teachers' salaries.  She led the protests in 1948, about 1948, before I was born.  She led the protests of a group of teachers, colored teachers.  Because she said, "Enough is enough."  Alabama was not paying colored teachers what it was paying white teachers.  And for that leadership role, she was fired.  And she always told the story of being proud of having been fired.  And, but she was such a good teacher that she was hired then by the Birmingham City Public Schools, by the colored director.  It was called the Director of Negro Public Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he saw that she was just a smart woman.  And, but that fight did help to lead to equalization of those salaries.  And she was always giving me that message, to fight for what is right; do it with dignity and you'll be okay.
Story_ID: 92360
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now they were part of this, I suppose, this community in Birmingham [Alabama] of striving black people--
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: --settled on what was then... what became known later as Dynamite Hill?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there were two very advantaged...  You have, you have a good memory.  There were two very advantaged areas in Birmingham.  One was called Smithfield, which was where Dynamite Hill was--where Attorney [Arthur] Shores' home was a, was the model of the height of success.  He had a home that was so nice that it was on a postcard that even white folks would use.  (Laughter).  It was called the home of Attorney Shores.  And it had... can you imagine a postcard with this nice brick ranch house on a hill?  And on the back it said, "And the house cost... the house cost fifty thousand dollars."  That was like un-heard of.  This was on the card, on the card.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On the postcard, on the postcard.  Oh, yes, and we all had copies of that postcard.  It was... yes, this was something we took great pride in, you see.  And a block from his house was an old beautiful home that had been renovated by my family's friends, the family of Angela Davis [HM].  Angela's brothers and sisters were taught by my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski], Angela's mother taught me.  And we lived in Titusville, T-I-T-U-S-V-I-L-L-E, which is a part of Birmingham.  We took great pride in being...  So, the two very prominent areas of Birmingham at the time were Smithfield and Titusville.  And one point while I was growing up, the Birmingham News had a headline, "Titusville has more homes owned by Negroes than any other community in America."  That was our claim to fame, that people were buying their homes in large numbers.  I'll tell you who was in that community, just to put it in perspective.  Several blocks from me was Condoleezza.  Condoleezza Rice's father was my high school counselor, who lived there in Titusville.  And so, your doctors and your principals and your teachers... and your supervisors, whenever you had them.  But it was rare to have them.  But it was in, within the Negro community, if you think about it.  We lived in those two communities, as did the most successful of the butlers or maids of very wealthy homes.  Keep in mind, the black middle class had a wide range, a wide range.  You could be a physician, or you could be even more advantaged sometimes if you were the butler of an extraordinarily wealthy white.  Because that might mean that you were traveling to Europe, or traveling around the world.  You know, it also meant you got a lot of benefits, you see.  And you saw how advantaged people in general lived.  So, an interesting mix of people, but there was no doubt we were middle class.  When you have two parents working, doing well, with college degrees, with a house that you're buying... with one car at first, a nice car.  Then you get you a nice car, the older car... the wife drives the nicer car... the father has the older car.  Then you get... you know, so we were moving into that.  This was the late '50s [1950s] through the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 92361
Speaker 1: Sure, I mean it was interesting.  You saw the impact of slavery on grandparents very easily, because I am from a family of people who could think back to people who had, to forbearers, who had been house slaves.  They did talk about the distinction between people who worked in the house and people who had worked in the fields.  And one of the derogatory terms you'd hear is "He's a field nigger."  Just, just kind of under the breath, without even thinking about it, you see.  And it was just... and you know when I would challenge it, in a funny way, they would say "You don't understand."  And it was very interesting, just the point about exposure to certain things, whether it was about language skills or behavior...  Or, I'll give you an example--if somebody wasn't courteous--if they didn't know how to be courteous to somebody.  And the idea was he's been in the fields, he doesn't have the training to know, you see.  These are just the kinds of things that were said, just as my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] was always bothered...  My grandmother had been of a lighter complexion, but my mother was a very dark-skinned woman.  She was always with an inferiority complex, by being very dark.  Very... I mean she was a beautiful woman, always considered a beautiful woman.  But she always saw herself in a different light.  She always said, "Well, I've got a great personality, and I'm smart."  Or, "I'm a hard worker."  But she really had a problem, and it was just a generally accepted point that it was a disadvantage to be dark-skinned.  And my father [Freeman Hrabowski] was smart enough to see it differently.  But she would always say, "I don't know why he married old poor black me."  It was amazing.  Just problems, challenges, and in ways in which we are, we've been white-washed into thinking about things.
Story_ID: 92362
Speaker 1: People think, say now that, you know, there are no residual holdovers from slavery and that sort of thing.  And they say, "Oh well, we've been free long enough; we ought to be past that."
Speaker 2: No, it's not true.  In my research on young black girls and young women, their images of themselves sometimes still are warped by that typical thinking about hair and color.  It's good that in many cases we're getting beyond that, but we haven't gotten beyond it completely.  Because people can send messages to children, young people, in a lot of ways, in a lot of ways.  And, you know, we still have challenges when thinking about ourselves, and appreciating who we are both internally and externally.  It's very clear to me from my own anecdotal situation, but it's also clear from my own research in working with children, young people, young men and women, especially young women... young black women.  I'll tell you a story that you'll appreciate; I'm always telling this in my speeches.  My mother [Maggie Freeman Hrabowski] tells the, told the story of having served as a child maid beginning at age twelve.  This would have been in the late '20s [1920s].  And she would, she had a choice of working in the cotton field after school, or working as a maid.  And she could make more money working as a maid.  And, she didn't want to be in that hot sun, for two reasons:  It was hot, but she didn't want to get any darker.  This was just life, reality, you see, at that time.  And she said that working at that home did several things for her.  Number one, it taught her she didn't want to be a maid all of her life, because you couldn't get a lot of money; you didn't get a lot of respect.  Number two, there was dignity in work, though; she was helping her family, and she wanted to do a good job.  Number three, the woman of the house, a wealthy white woman, decided... could see that my mother was curious about the books in the library.  The home was wealthy enough to have a library at a time when there was no public library.  And the woman would say, "When you finish your work, Maggie, you can go into the library and read" which my mother would do.  And what happened was, the more Mother read, the more excited she became about the reading and the more proficient she became as a reader.  And the woman would say, "Well, you can take the book home with you if you want to."  And my mother's girlfriends would get upset, because they would say, "Why do you have your head in that book so much?"  And it hit her, that there was a difference between her and her girlfriends.  Her girlfriends were not reading enough to become good readers.  And so when they read, it was a painful experience, it wasn't recreation.  And my mother decided at that point that she knew exactly what she wanted to do with her life, be a teacher.  Because she had, she was convinced that part of the key to the, to the success of the Negro race was to get children to learn to read well enough that they would love reading, and therefore love knowledge and the practice of just getting the knowledge.  And she spent her life focused on that.  And that very story shapes much of my philosophy of the challenge we face that I see all the time.  We're talking about test scores, we're talking about performance.  It's that most of our children don't get to the point of reading enough that it's fun, that they enjoy the experience.  It's still painful.  And if you see most little kids, most teenage kids of color reading, they're still moving their lips when they're reading, and you know that they don't read well.  And that's, so it's a powerful story about how her life was transformed.  If she had never gotten to that point of reading that way, she could never have become an English teacher, or had the life she had, and I wouldn't be who I am today.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's get to you.  Now, give us some idea of some of your earliest childhood memories.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of childhood?
Speaker 2: I remember church a lot.  We were always in church.  Sixth Avenue Baptist Church, the sister church of the church that was bombed [16th Street Baptist Church], and it was Sixth Avenue South.  There was the church at Sixth Avenue and 16th Street South, and a church at Sixth Avenue and 16th Street North.  One was right there, not far from Dynamite Hill [Birmingham, Alabama].  That group would go there.  Ours was closer to the Titusville [Birmingham, Alabama] area, you see, and relatives would go.  But I remember all the time being in church on Sundays, on Saturdays, the middle of the week.  And as a child, I remember just the freedom of going up and down the street to my neighborhood, with everybody being my parent, everybody knowing who I was, and knowing I couldn't do wrong without somebody punishing me.  I remember well feeling comfortable and secure and appreciated and special.  I remember older people living with us.  We were more advantaged; we had an extra room for people who would come and stay when they were getting older.  And so, we always had somebody older living with us who helped to shape the way I thought about the world.  I remember the sickness and the death, over and over again and learning how... learning how to live with people as they were dying, even as a little child.  And it shaped where I am today, it really did.
Speaker 1: How did you--
Speaker 2: If you love them and you care about them, you get beyond the fear.  You touch them, you oil their feet; you make them as comfortable as you can.  You give them attention, you show them how special they are.  You pray.  Sometimes they want you to read the Bible to them.  "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death..."  You know, as a child I remember doing those things.  And you ask--you could ask them questions.  And everybody enjoys reflecting on their lives.  Every person enjoys that experience of reflecting on our life, on his life.  And I heard so many stories about lives of uncles and aunts and others.  My parents were so special that people would come to them as uncles and aunts... as their uncles and aunts, and they wouldn't even go to their own kids.  Not just because we had more room, but because of my mama's and daddy's welcoming approach.  That was the kind of home we had.  We believed that you took care of your old.  And the saying was, "If you take care of your old people, you will always be okay."  And it's true, it's very true.  That's why I was very comfortable, my wife [Jacqueline Coleman Hrabowski] and I were comfortable having three senior citizens in the house for so many years.  You know, there was so much love.  And you know, it was great for my son.  Because it, it allowed him to see life at different levels, different stages.  It allowed him to see what it meant to go through the dying process with people.  Two of those three died, and it was the same thing I'd experienced as a child.
Story_ID: 92364
Speaker 1: What were some of your other childhood experiences?
Speaker 2: Childhood experiences.  I was always, I was always in school--if not in church, in school.  I started school when I was four, because I started reading when I was three.  And my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] took me to the first grade there at the school where she was working, Shields Elementary.  And I was fitting in well, but they had to hide me from this Director of Negro Public Schools.  This would have been in 1953, 54' [1954], because he knew me; he was my godfather.  He had really, in many ways he had become my mother's mentor.  He was so impressed with her having been fired from the other school system.  Here she was, this really brilliant... my mother was always brilliant.  And she was always a pretty chocolate woman.  (Laughter).  And he... and just a good Christian lady, a real lady, you know.  And this Director of Schools, Dr. Hayes, who was a very distinguished guy, took a real liking to my mother and he always, he hired her and worked with her.  And so, when I was born, he was my godfather.  And he was like the Negro superintendent.  He was called the Director of Negro Schools.  So, he knew me.  And so, when he saw me in that school, he said, "What is Freeman doing here?"  And I said, "I'm in school, I'm in the first grade."  I was four.  And he went and told them, he said, "You can't be here, this is not right."  So, they took me away for a couple of days.  The teachers said, "He can be here.  I mean, this boy knows what he's doing."  So, they brought me back.  So, every time he came to that school, they had to hide me.  And I'll never forget.  I was so frisky and rebellious, they took me in the girl's bathroom whenever he would come.  And I'd be so angry.  And they would hold me there.  And I just happened to get away from the girl, this older girl, this one time, and ran right into Dr. Hayes.  He said, "What are you doing in here?"  I said, "They brought me back."  (Laughter).  And so, so he told my mother, "You can't do this.  I can't let you do this, especially because you know who he is, he's my godson."  So they put me out of kindergarten, which was boring, for a year.  And they brought me back when I was five.  And I started teaching children.  I had my own little group every year, from age five until I finished elementary school.  I had my own little group, three or four...  I always had the slow kids.  I always enjoyed working with children who couldn't get it quickly.  Because I, I appreciated the need to, for repetition.  Sometimes kids just need the chance to go over and over it again.  And I enjoyed it.  I just... and so, all...  I mean even at age five, I remember.  At age five I was working, we were working on words and numbers.  You know, and the teachers, amazingly the teachers were good enough to divide kids into groups, you know.  And they... so you had the slow group, you had the middle group, then you had the accelerated group.  But I was blessed; I was above the accelerated group.  I had done that--done that--been there, done that, you see.  And not because I was smarter, but I had parents who at home were always reading to me.  We were always reading, you know.  We were always reading stuff, so I had already done the work.  And the point is that... so I started teaching then, I really did.  And I was fascinated by this notion of working with somebody's mind.  Even as a baby, as a child, I remember that.  And all the way through elementary school, I did that.  I mean in the groups, I would always... Freeman would always have his little group of two or three kids to work with.  And then it became clear to me by the fifth or sixth grade that the teachers really didn't know.  They were great in many ways, but they didn't know word problems well.
Story_ID: 92365
Speaker 1: They really didn't. And my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] went back to become a math specialist, because there was something called the new math that came out in the '60s [1960s].  It was a disaster, a national...  Because you had the professors up here, and the teachers down here who were just so frightened of it.  But Mama was always adventurous.  So, she went back, and she really came to understand how word problems and the new math--set theory and all those things really were about language, you see.  And so she... I was the guinea pig.  So I'd be doing new math stuff in the eighth grade when I was in the fourth grade.  So, I knew more about the word problem stuff, you know what I mean, than teachers who had not had that kind of training.  And so, they would use me in different ways-- they would either use me and be proud of me, or they would be upset by me, very upset.  Because I'd be saying... (Laughter) I was very quick to be very immature, and tell them they didn't even know what they were talking about.  So, all of that was a part of that upbringing.  But it was all about education, learning, reading, math, all of that.  And having asthma and not being able to run, and always having attacks--you know, a lot--you know, bad asthma, bad asthma always.  And I was a fat little boy who was always... my grandmother was determined to fatten me up, as she would call it, make me healthy.  You know, she wanted them cheeks to be really...  You know so she worked on me, she really did.  I tell this story at commencement, about savoring the moment.  My grandmother would made two blackberry pies, blueberry pies, I guess they were called.  And she'd write on one of them, "This one is for Freeman, don't touch."  She'd give me a whole pie.  My mother would be so angry at her.  "Wait a minute..." because she was trying to keep me from getting fat, but my grandmother wanted me fat.  I would sit there and eat that pie.  It would taste so good.  It was both the special feeling... it was the taste and the fact that my grandmother had out-ruled my mother.  (Laughter).  But I tell students, that's savoring the moment.  I can still taste that pie. (Laughter).  But those are the memories--the smell of that, of the pie... the love, you know, the feeling that I mattered, all those things were--
Speaker 2: And you got that kind of encouragement I guess in church, too?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Every time... they'd have the honor students stand.  And then they'd say, "Everybody who got all A's."  And I always made all A's so...  And you know, we'd get standing ovations.  And I found that in my own research that kids can still tell you... college students remember when churches acknowledged them.  Because on the outside, people are always made fun of when they do well, today.  At that time, what you hear people of my age saying all the time--you were always told you've got to be twice as good.  We were always taught you've got to be twice as good, because the world is not fair.
Story_ID: 92366
Speaker 1: Other memories... I pulled the cover back from... I just told this story somewhere.  I found this book... I was bored.  I think I was in second grade.  I was bored.  And you know how you have the brown covers on books which is supposed to keep them from getting messed up?  I pulled the cover off, and there was the name of that white school.  And it didn't take me thirty seconds to know that we had the hand-me-down books.  And I went up to the teacher, "Why do we have their books?"  And she looked at me, and was embarrassed at first.  And then she said, "The book may be a hand-me-down, but the knowledge in the book is first-rate, and you are first-rate, and you are a child of God."  I remember her saying that.  She said, "You don't have the time to be a victim."  I'll never forget that.  I heard that from my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski], and I heard that from that teacher.  And I heard that from my mother when George Wallace stood in the door when I was... this was about '62 [1962], '63 [1963].  I was about 12, something like that--11 or 12 or 13, in that range... stood in the door of the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] and said, "Over my dead body, I will not let these Negroes into this school."  We were sitting down, standing there watching TV.  And we were crushed.
Speaker 2: How did you... you watched and you saw that.  I heard others say, heard of the dissension in the South a little bit.
Speaker 1: We saw that.  I saw that, yeah-h-h-h-h.  I saw that, and saw the people outside with all of the potential violence and all the nasty things being said.  And I saw him in that door saying, "They will not come through this door."
Speaker 2: And this is something that... the Civil Rights Movement, the upheaval in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And the news... this was a protracted struggle that reached I guess national attention in the '60s.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it did reach it.  And it was '63 [1963] that we had the Children's March in Birmingham [Alabama].  I believe it was '63, I was twelve.
Story_ID: 92367
Speaker 1: [Unclear] The national civil rights leadership... when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was in Birmingham [Alabama], he really hit a wall, didn't he?
Speaker 2: He was.  And yeah, he'd been in jail.
Speaker 1: He couldn't get--
Speaker 2: He'd done as much as he could do.  And he was trying to think of another strategy that might work.  And they came up with the idea of let's have the children go to jail.
Speaker 1: The most off-the-hook staff member was James Bevel, Reverend Bevel [HM].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who many people think is off the hook.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: He came up with this strategy, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But he, in order for it to work he had to organize the youth, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's exactly right.  And I remember sitting--
Speaker 1: Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: I just remember there being at my church... for my group at the Sixth Avenue Baptist.  And I remember the training session that was preparing us to be focused, and to not become upset when the police and others made comments, and to know the songs to sing, and to be prepared to be in jail for a few days.  I remember well.  And because I was younger than my classmates, I was not going to be able to go to the adult jail.  I had to go to the juvenile delinquent's home type place.  Because you had to be fourteen and older, and I was about to go to the--excuse me, I was about to go to the tenth grade.  But I was twelve, and I was finishing the ninth grade.  So, I was selected to take children... younger--nine, ten, and eleven-year-old kids to this march.  And keep in mind that most of the children who marched were not from homes as advantaged as mine.  People forget that.  Because, you see, the employers, including the Board of Education, had told teachers in other places "If your children go to jail, you lose your job."  And when I told my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] and father [Freeman Hrabowski] that I wanted to go to jail, after having sat through the Alabama Christian Movement meetings every night at church--my church and other churches.  I'd be in the back of the room, my cousin and I--my cousin who grew up with me--and I would be in the back of the room doing homework.  I'd be doing my math homework and listening to these discussions and singing the songs, [singing] "Ain't gonna let nobody turn me around," on and on and on.  So, you're singing, you know, "Woke up this morning with my mind..." you know, you hear these songs over and over again.  And you hear people saying, "You don't have to be like... you don't have to live like this.  You can have a chance to go into the movies."  You know, and I heard--you know, just thinking about what we didn't have was eye-opening.  Because while all of us had wanted to go to Kiddie Land, which was the place with the Ferris wheel and those kinds of things, which we couldn't... black kids couldn't go to.  You know, if you've always seen things one way, you might not think about how things might be.  So, if you've always seen a white water fountain and then a colored water fountain, with the colored water fountain not looking as nice as the white one...  If you haven't thought about it, that's just the way it is.  Then you think about it for a minute, and you say, "Well, why is it like that?"  Right?  Or, if there's no place for you to go to the bathroom, you know.  And then, while you might ask "Why is it like that?" the question is why would you as a child think that it could ever be any way different from that, unless you started hearing people say it, you see.  So, the fact that people are saying "It doesn't have to be like this," and that these are your rights as an American... those things resonated with me, it really did, in the midst of doing math problems.
Speaker 1: And those are the things that James Bevel told you?
Speaker 2: Well, other people had been telling us that.  Bevel was a part of that group, but I do remember Bevel being a part of the training; I do remember.  I was impressed by the youth of people like Bevel, his ability to be articulate, his confidence... "We can do this" right?  So, when I told my mother I wanted to go, they said, "Oh, no, no, no."  They were involved with the movement and they were giving them money, but "No, no."  And so, I remember calling them hypocrites.  I said--
Speaker 1: And that didn't sit too well?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I said "You're hypocrites, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you know my dad, you know, my dad said, "Oh, yeah, watch yourself, boy.  Watch yourself."  (Laughter).  But I was always very rebellious.  Now, my dad was very conservative.  He did not... no, you did not talk back.  So, I said it once.  And he didn't like it.  But I, I just went to my room and cried, I did.  Now, my cousin, who was a little bigger than I was, he said... we all seemed... they were most worried...  Beyond the teachers, beyond their jobs, which they were worried about, they had seen the dogs and the hoses that day.  And my cousin said, "There's no way I'm going."  He said, "I might get bit by these dogs."  (Laughter).  He said, he said, "No, not me."  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 92368
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know what pushed me to go, other than it just seemed I had no choice, I was supposed to go.  I saw those other little children going, and I knew that all of my friends from the advantaged neighborhood with the exception of... there was one guy who's dad was a doctor.  I saw him in the front, and I was so impressed that he had gone.  He had just gotten in the Honor Society, and I was so impressed.  I remember that; his name was James Stewart.  And I saw him, then I said, "Mm."  And it always helps to see somebody you know.  You know, and I said, "I can do this."  And so, they came in late that night and they... it was obvious they had been talking and crying themselves.  They were worried about me, but they let me go.  So, I immediately started going for the training that next day.  And I went and stayed five days, a horrible five days.  People were horrible.  The adults worked to get the little kids who were there for the bad things--the stealing--and the rough kids to do things that were abusive in all possible ways.  It was awful.  I was very lucky to have...  There was a guy who was in there for the bad reasons, but he knew my family, and that was really nice, and supported and helped me out.  I'll never forget.  He helped me, protected me, and I was working with him on his reading at night, the Bible.  Isn't that something?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: That's something.  But to show you how life goes, within a matter of three months of our getting out, he got out, and he had been killed.  That was during the time when they had the stabbings.  You didn't have guns, you had switchblades.
Speaker 2: He was stabbed in the black community?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, switchblades.  That was the thing. If you had a switchblade, you're really cool.  And I did not have one.  I was a fat little nerd.  Now, don't miss my point.  (Laughter).  No, but I was saying the bad boys would have little switchblades, you know.  But no, it was an experience.  It taught me the power of the individual to make a difference, and to make choices.  I tell children that story all the time--that even when you're twelve and thirteen, you can make choices.  You know, and it taught me a lot about it.  And it led to my developing my leadership skills.  And when people ask me, "How'd you become who you are today?" I go all the way back to that experience in having a chance to look at how others were leading groups--very important.
Story_ID: 92369
Speaker 1: Now, the rest of your high school life, were you... was it fairly normal?  Were you involved in clubs and--?
Speaker 2: President of the Honor Society.
Speaker 1: Black activities?
Speaker 2: All academic.  I was president of the Honor Society.  I was spending... my parents sent me away to schools in the summer.  They wanted me to see what an integrated education was like.  This [Ullman High School, Birmingham, Alabama] was an all-black high school.  And when I had a chance to go into one of those programs that Angela Davis had been a part of with the Quakers--The Friends Program--my parents did not want to trust--they didn't want me to go.  They wanted me to understand an integrated education.  They were not willing, quite frankly, to trust their child, their black boy child, to a white family.  And they said, "Of course, there are people who are nice people.  But they don't know our child, they don't know black children."  So, they didn't feel comfortable with that, quite frankly.  They were delighted for others who wanted to do that, but they wanted me to have the experience of having some integrated education.  And so they sent us... my cousin and I went to Massachusetts--Springfield, Massachusetts.  And it was where I saw the difference in the rigor of the education.  I did see that in the literature courses, in the math course that I took.  But I was much younger than classmates, again.  I was in the eleventh grade, and they were 16 and I was 13.  I did fine, but the difference was the teacher never called on me.  It taught me that while they were not mean-spirited, and they did not keep me from gong to that school, I came to understand what Ralph Ellison meant by the "Invisible Man."  Nobody would speak.  And when I would raise my hand... after the first two weeks I realized the teacher was never going to call me.  The teachers just ignored me completely.  And I was a very outgoing little fat kid from the South.  But I learned just to say nothing.  Because when I'd speak to kids in the class, they wouldn't speak.  One girl would say Hi, but others would turn their heads.  Not in a nasty way; they just, you know, wanted nothing to do with me.  So, it taught me a lot about the myth that we had in the South that the North was so much better, (Laughter) and that you're treated like a real human being in the North.  Right.  (Laughter).  So, it was an eye-opening experience.  And when it was time to go to college, while I had friends who decided to go to major universities or...  I mean, several young women, girls on... right in my block went to Mount Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts].  Three girls went to Mount Holyoke, for example, within a couple of blocks from me; dear friends who were in the Honor Society with me.  I had had that integrated experience, and I knew how ordinary people made me feel, regardless of what I was doing academically.  And because my mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] had been most impressed by both Benjamin Mays and Booker [T.] Washington, the understanding was that I would go to one of those two schools.  And I'd actually gotten an invitation to consider going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] when I was in the eleventh grade.  And they wouldn't let me consider it, because I was only fourteen.  So, the next year, she was assuming I was going to Mr. Mays' school.  I decided to rebel, and go north.  So, I went to Hampton [Institute now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]--that was very north.  (Laughter).  Very much the North--it was Virginia, way up north.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: When you graduated from high school you were--?
Speaker 2: Fifteen.
Speaker 1: Fifteen?
Speaker 2: They kept me back.  My mother wouldn't let me graduate early.  I could have, but she... I graduated at fifteen.
Story_ID: 92989
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  You were asking me about the... the Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] experience was a special experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I grew up at Hampton.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It is my beloved Hampton.
Speaker 2: You were fifteen, though?
Speaker 1: I was fifteen, yes, yes.  I met the love of my life at Hampton.  I started asking her to go with me my first year there, and she laughed at me.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, were you still little then?  Or were you fat then, or--?
Speaker 1: I was chubby.  I was probably 5'8" and 185 pounds, 190, something like that, 185 pounds.  Yeah, I was a chubby little something, I really was.  And I was that way until I went to Egypt in my junior year, and lost all the baby fat, I did.  But the Hampton experience was a time of developing my mind and my ability to interact with people from very different backgrounds--including a lot of professors who were white--to bright kids who had been at northern schools and private schools--to the best of southern schools--and to other countries, people from other countries, from the islands and from Africa.
Speaker 2: Now, who were some of your teachers at Hampton?
Speaker 1: Geraldine Darden, first and foremost--a black mathematician, a brilliant woman, a Hampton graduate herself who inspired me in many ways--to the president of Hampton, Jerome Holland, who was a graduate of Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and who left Hampton in my junior year to become Ambassador to Sweden.  He was a mentor who allowed me to represent him and speak out to alumni groups in Atlanta [Georgia] to a major audience at the Lincoln Center in New York.  So, I had incredible opportunities to speak, to lead.  I was president of the senior class.  My wife [Jacquelyn Coleman Hrabowski] and I, as I said, my girlfriend at the time, went to Egypt and studied at the American University in Cairo in '69 [1969].  We came back and spent the summer in Europe, and came back our senior year and had a phenomenal time getting ready for grad school.  And it was, it was a great experience.  And I learned a great deal about the power of a professor to help transform the way you think about things, and to broaden your mind--
Story_ID: 92990
Speaker 1: So, you went to Cairo [Egypt]--
Speaker 2: I was eighteen.
Speaker 1: Eighteen?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Alright.  How did you find that experience?
Speaker 2: Rich, it was very rich.  We were in a frat and sorority, just all the symbolism.  I was an Alpha, so I went and got a chance to go and be right at the Sphinx.  And she [Hrabowski's wife] was a Delta, and she's at the Pyramids and we're sending pictures back to friends.  And we're getting a chance to go to the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens, and to spend time along the Nile and to go to Aswan [Egypt] and study Arab society, and to understand some of the things, the challenges, facing the Arab-Israeli conflict, and to know that we were getting only one side of it and wanted to  understand the Israeli's side, and having to deal with professors who were terribly, terribly focused on the Arab side, and trying to deal with that.  And we tried to raise questions about the fact that anytime you have a war, there are two sides to any story.  It was a great experience.  But also, having a chance to understand that the world was not simply black and white; there were issues beyond the America Negro problem, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, how were you received by the Egyptians?  Did they--
Speaker 2: They were--
Speaker 1: --see you as a--
Speaker 2: As Americans first.  My wife [Jacquelyn Coleman Hrabowski], who is much lighter, was immediately seen as Egyptian.  People didn't know what I was at the time.  Sometimes they thought I was Egyptian, sometimes Ethiopian.  And it was very interesting.  As long as I was Egyptian, it was okay to show some affection towards her.  But as soon as I looked like I was more Ethiopian or something else, they had a real problem with it, a real problem with it.  They thought, they assumed she was Egyptian, you see, and they had their own biases.  And we got a chance to understand a lot about the impact of colonialism on people.  Because we were with upper class Egyptian kids who ranged in colors from slightly darker than me to much lighter, and who spoke English and French as their first languages, and who thought of Arabic as something you spoke to your servants.  And we came to really appreciate the hierarchy and class structure there, and their appreciation and deference to other cultures, to European cultures.  It was very interesting.
Story_ID: 92991
Speaker 1: Now [Gamal Abdel] Nasser was--
Speaker 2: Was President.  It also came down to understanding the true hatred that existed between the two groups, Arabs and Israelis, the challenges that each continued to talk about that they faced, the history of... from the War of '47 [1947].  It was fascinating to study it--
Speaker 1: Well, were you there during the Six-Day War?
Speaker 2: Right after that.  That was in '67 [1967]. We went there in '68 [1968], '69 [1969], yes.  But we could still hear tremblings; there were still bombs going off not far from Cairo [Egypt].  So, at night you could hear the tremblings.  It was a very different world.  So when my students were saying a few months ago--or back in 2001 and 2002--whoever heard of army people with guns in airports?  And my first response was you obviously haven't been around the world.  America's been so lucky not to have to have them.  Back in that time, it was understood that you had military people all around.  There was, it was an eye-opening experience also to read publications from different parts of the world, to understand that the world is not America-centric; that while Newsweek and TIME give you one perspective, people from China or from Egypt or from other countries may have very different perspectives on the same issue, the same story; that educated people come to understand the need to take with a grain of salt whatever they see in print; that it's not the absolute truth, that we see things...  We can be very honest, and yet see the same incident through different lenses.  It was an educational experience that was great and broadening what we'd gotten at Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], very much so.
Speaker 1: By that time I guess Nasser was kind of problematic to the United States, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And so, that was the only embassy there.  I'll tell you, the most fascinating experience in Egypt was spending time with Shirley Graham Du Bois, the wife of W.E.B. Du Bois.  This was his second wife, who of course had been with him in Ghana and then had gone to Egypt, I think to get citizenship in Egypt.  And she had a great apartment there.  And she heard that these American Negroes were in town, American Negro college students, and she sent for us.  And she was absolutely magnanimous to us and just spent time, wanted to talk about our ideas about things.  And she was so polished and sophisticated.  She'd come from true black intelligentsia, and was an Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] graduate, and of was course even then obviously much older than we, and had just seen the world.  And she clearly was an intellectual who wanted to talk about the issues, and gave us things to read, and talked about the relationship between [Booker T.] Washington and Du Bois--the way they... just amazing, how Du Bois thought about Washington and how people took things out of perspective; how people didn't appreciate the backgrounds, the different backgrounds of those two men, and the different periods in which they came to where they were, you know.  It was just fascinating, it really was.  So, she helped to shape my interests in those questions of the "Talented Tenth," and "Working with the Hands" over these years in many ways.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, when you came back to Hampton... and you graduated in--
Speaker 2: In 1970.
Speaker 1: Nineteen-seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I graduated in 1970, May of 1970, and I went to the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign].  I found it an incredibly cold place in more ways than one.  It was great then.  There were two or three people there who were white who were very supportive.  And I went through a master's program in mathematics in one year, and had done really well.  And I would have continued in math, but I had nobody to talk to.  I had nobody to talk about ring theory with.  They said, "What are you talking about, group theory and ring theory?"  I was in abstract algebra.  Why?  Because it was just a fascinating game.  I'd taken several abstract algebra courses under my professor at Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]--Geraldine Darden, and had loved them, and did well there at Illinois my first semester.  I could not get people to work with me.  It was very interesting.  I'd ask people if they were going to study together, and they would say 'no' in class.  And then I'd come back, and I could tell they'd been working together.  I still got all A's the first semester with taking four graduate math classes.  So, I knew I could do the work.  Interestingly, after that first semester, just as I was about to finish my finals I got a call from home saying my father [Freeman Hrabowski] had had a brain tumor, and I had to come home immediately.  I finished my finals and, amazingly, they graded my papers.  And my wife [Jacquelyn Coleman Hrabowski] drove me from Champaign, Illinois to Birmingham [Alabama], straight through.  And we'd been married... we got married by the way, two months after I finished Hampton.  I was twenty when I got... I finished Hampton at nineteen, and got married... turned twenty August 13th and got married August 29, 1970.
Story_ID: 92993
Speaker 1: And I got there to the hospital, and he [Hrabowski's father, Freeman Hrabowski] was about to go into surgery.  But he wouldn't go until I got there.  And I went in by myself.  And he only had one question, only one question.  "How'd did you do at that big, white school this semester?"  I said, "Dad, that doesn't matter, that's not important."  He said, "Oh, yes, it is."  He said, "It's the most important thing.  How did you do?"  And when I told him I got all A's he said, "I'm fine, now.  I just wanted to make sure they treat you okay.  I knew you could do it."  He said, "I'm fine now."  And he said to me, he always said, "I'm not afraid to die."  He said, "What have I always told you?  Live your life in such a way that you're never afraid to die."  So, he wasn't.  He said he had only one wish, and that was... he said, "If I can't go back to work, make sure that I don't live as a vegetable."  That was what he wanted me to do.  And I could not bring myself to do what he wanted, because they said he would live six months.  My mother [Maggie Geeter Hrabowski] kept alive for almost nine years, just through love.  He couldn't speak, he couldn't move, he wasn't sure who I was.  He'd been a brilliant, strong man.  We had to clean him, put the equivalent of diapers on him.  He was a baby for almost nine years.  That shaped me in many ways.  It taught me also that you can be as strong and as powerful... internally powerful, and forceful and courageous today as a man or woman, and tomorrow you can be a baby, you know.  It just really shaped who I am today--gave me a kind of humility to know that you can be on top of it one minute, and you can be in another place in the next.  So, those are the experiences that shaped me.  But I went back to school, and so every month we're going back to Birmingham [Alabama] to help my mother.  And we had, they had accumulated some money and were doing well.  But we went through all that money, quite frankly, because she had to have a nurse while she was working.  She had to have a nurse, full-time nurse, you know.  And he, all of this happened when he was fifty-nine years old.  So, he couldn't get Social Security, he couldn't get retirement, any of that stuff, you know.  It was quite an experience.
Story_ID: 92994
Speaker 1: But it was also, it shaped who I was.  I went ahead and finished my master's, got into a Ph.D. program, and decided to go into higher ed administration, because the president of the University was in that field.  And they told me I was too young, because I was just twenty when I finished that master's, you see.  It was right before my 21st birthday, and they said, "You're too young."  And I... that gave me a real challenge, because I was trying to figure out how to use the math, the master's in math.  I knew I wanted to teach math.  And so I told them I would become their quantitative guru.  Everybody had problems with statistics in the social sciences.  And applied math is baby work compared to theory.  And abstract algebra was theory, you see.  So, they allowed me to try it, and it worked like a charm.  So, I took all the stat courses in the social sciences, in psychology, in psych, and those kinds of things.  And I did the administration.
Speaker 2: Did it scare a lot of--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, people who were...  Yeah, so I became their tutor and I worked with a lot of people.  And at the same time, it shaped my research interest in producing more minorities and blacks who would do well in math and science, because I saw this shortage.  I never... didn't have people... no professors ever.  There were no professors at Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] in those areas.  And most important, it was clear to me we were going to need more people in science and engineering in general in our society.  And I saw no blacks coming through.  Most of the blacks you saw in those areas were coming... were at black colleges.  So I actually did my, I did my dissertation on the academic performance of black graduate students, to look at those who come from black schools versus those who come from white schools.  And what I found was that invariably if you wanted to get a black through in science, the best deal you could do, or the best thing you could do, is make sure they came through a supportive black school.  Because in white schools, as a rule, they wiped them out in the first year or two.  So many black kids started out wanting to be a doctor, went to a predominant white school, and they got wiped out, yeah.  That's why this experience at the UMBC [University of Maryland, Baltimore County] is so special.  My, my experiment was to see if I could take a--the experience of a predominantly white environment with science and tech with big stuff--where you've got Russians and Chinese and people from other countries--and have blacks doing as well, if not better than anybody else.  And that's what we've been working to do, you know.  And so, all of the... but I'm saying, all of my experiences at Illinois shaped the research and my interest in terms of administration and my own research over the past thirty years.  Because that was back in the early '70s [1970s] when I started working on those issues.
Speaker 2: Well, that's some interesting stuff.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  You got your Ph.D. at age--
Speaker 1: Twenty-four.
Speaker 2: Twenty-four.
Speaker 1: I finished at twenty-three, and the advisor thought I was too young.  And so he said, "Just go back and think about it."  So, it was a very difficult experience.  I had some people who were incredibly supportive, white, who were incredibly supportive, and a black couple, Richard and Mildred Barksdale.  Richard Barksdale is another one of those big names in literature.  He was a Ph.D. from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], who would come from, had been at Atlanta U [Atlanta University, Georgia].  And they brought him up to be one of the first black administrators in Illinois.  And he was very supportive of me; he was on my committee.  Because I wanted to look at issues involving black colleges for black students, and there was nobody there who knew anything about HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  And he had the experience of working at Morehouse and Atlanta U.  And so, he was on the committee, and some others.  And they were very helpful to me, though.  But it was a challenging experience.  I really finished at twenty-three, and the man just thought that was out of the question, quite frankly.
Story_ID: 92995
Speaker 1: Did you ever get a chance to meet during those days, Samuel Massie [HM] by any chance?  Dr. Sam Massie?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  See, I know two Samuel Massies.  Now, you tell me which one you're talking about.  I know a Samuel Massie who was a chemist, and then I know--
Speaker 1: Chemist.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Because he's from this area.  He's a brilliant man who finished Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] when he was 19, in fact.  I know him well.
Speaker 1: Your stories seem so similar.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a fine person.  He's been here to visit with me.  He's been supporter for years.  I know him and his wife [Gloria Massie] well, yes.  And he'd been a college president [of University of North Carolina Central, Durham, North Carolina] and professor at Annapolis [U.S. Naval Academy, Maryland].  He's a smart man.
Speaker 1: The question is, really at some point when you get so high up in mathematics, who do you associate with in the African-American world, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you know what?  It's interesting.  Things happen for a reason.  I'm now producing people who become PhDs in mathematics.  I just had another student to finish from Rice [University, Houston, Texas] with a Ph.D. in mathematics.
Speaker 1: It's not like that it's that far--I mean, I think anybody that's been in school in the black community know there's some brilliant math students--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --who've made choices--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But they never get beyond a certain--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: --for maybe lack of training and lack of encouragement.
Speaker 2: That's right, and to get the kind of support to do it.  So now, we're producing large numbers of African-Americans here at UMBC [University of Maryland, Baltimore County] who are going on to PhDs and physics and mathematics and engineering and bio-chemistry.  We produced one-third of all the black bachelors in biochemistry last year in the country.  There were only sixty-five African-Americans to earn bachelor's degrees in biochemistry in America; twenty-two came from this campus.
Story_ID: 92996
Speaker 1: After finishing grad school? I had the experience in grad school of working in a program called Upward Bound, which also helped me to understand the impact of poverty on education and the challenge we faced with helping kids who had not been from educated homes to get what they get need.  And I focused... again, I go back to what I talked about earlier--the reading skills, computing skills, thinking skills, and the values--focusing on hard work.  And that's, that's driven what I've done throughout my career from working... teaching statistics... and being an Associate Dean at Alabama A&M University [Huntsville, Alabama] to talking in some... in several places about wanting to have a chance to experiment with education and poverty at the college level, and getting a chance to become a dean at twenty-six at Coppin State [Baltimore, Maryland]; and focusing on building the math and reading skills of students; and being supportive of returning women who were coming back with the right attitude; and coming to understand what it takes to remediate deficiencies--but the importance of focusing on the strengths of people, and understanding how much somebody who has children already brings to the table.   And when she comes back to school, she's more motivated than the typical seventeen or eighteen-year-old, and how we need to be focusing on that population of people who had experiences--men or women who have had life experiences and who really know what they want now.  They, they have the motivation, if you can give them the support, to do all kinds of things.  And so we work with a lot of returning students, which was very helpful.  And then finally coming... and I stayed there ten years as Dean, and then as Academic Vice President.  And then I moved here [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)] seventeen years ago almost, 1987, sixteen years ago, and served as Vice Provost, responsible for the academic strengths of undergraduates, and then Executive Vice President.  And for the past eleven years as President.  And we've worked to develop this campus into what Newsweek and the Times of London have both called an academic powerhouse.  It's a place that's moving towards a $100 million in research, without a medical school, focusing on bio-technology and photonics in computing areas, with a reputation for chess... national chess champions for--
Speaker 2: American championship?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's exactly right.  Yes, with an African-American called the Terminator, who's been one of the best we've ever had.
Speaker 2: The Terminator?
Speaker 1: The Terminator.  He plays just that way, he's powerful.  He's ruthless.  (Laughter).  We have a reputation for recruiting and educating large numbers of very high achieving students in science, engineering, and policy areas--a strong liberal core with major partnerships with the best campuses, not only in this country, but beyond, with lots of students to go on to institutions in other countries for example.  And so, this has been by far the richest professional experience of my career.
Story_ID: 92997
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you've written two books.  They're books that analyze the, I guess, the math potential of black youth--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --basically?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: One is called "Beating the Odds," where you focus on young, black men.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And the second one is called "Overcoming the Odds"...
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --based on the potential of young black women.  Why do you choose to separate them out like that?
Speaker 2: Right.  Because the issues that African-Americans face are in many ways the same, but in other ways different, based on gender.  The challenges that young black males face are somewhat different from those that young black women face.  Black males are faced with violence as an issue, with drugs more than any other group, with being at the bottom of the academic ladder.  Black and Hispanic males are at the bottom academically, around this country.  And the models they have tend to come from the popular culture--athletics, rap stars, okay.  The young women are faced with the issue, first, of not getting pregnant.  Because that takes away from their ability to do what they need to do.  They're faced with the issue of people not giving them the support they need when thinking about whether they can do the work.  They're faced with issues involving physical appearance and security that society--the kinds of demands society places on them--weight, for example, you see, and how people view men and women.  They're often... these are stereotypical thoughts, but often young black boys have the problem that people would be frightened of them.  Immediately when they walk up to them, they're frightened of them.  Young--
Speaker 1: This is true, I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you see it every time there's a community meeting, in black neighborhoods around the country.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And not to mention the white neighborhoods.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But surely, the black neighborhoods.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And older people black people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --always say... they beg the police to do something about the--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --kids.
Speaker 2: It's a challenge.
Speaker 1: And they see them on the street--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and what they're doing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and they call the cops to get them removed from the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --corner... removed from the... you know, they don't want to see them.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They want them to disappear.
Speaker 2: They are frightened of them.  And it's, it's so sad, because you may have five to ten percent who have the guns and who are doing those things.  The others are just rowdy because they're young.  I was playing tennis with my wife [Jacquelyn Coleman Hrabowski] last night.  And there was a group of black boys over playing basketball.  And they were loud, and I was getting bothered because they were so loud, and they were using profanity.  And my wife said, "Well," she says, "I know you're bothered, and I understand why you're bothered."  She said, "But at least they're playing basketball, and not sitting there deciding how they're going to sell drugs.  She said, "They're doing something constructive."  But I kept getting bothered by the language.  Because they were... anything you could think of, they were saying.  They saw women playing tennis, in addition to just... you know.  So finally, I got over my own initial fear.  Because I have before gone in different places to stop groups from using profanity and I've had a gun pulled on me.  And I realized that the fear comes because all you need is one guy who's high or who has nothing to lose, who happens to have a gun who gets angry because you came over and told him to do something.  And you could be dead.  And that's reality.  But I was so bothered by these young guys' language that I went over, and in a very reasonable way, I said, "Excuse me, young men.  Excuse me.  You're having an interesting conversation."  They were talking about Michael Jordan being forty, and his age, and the impact on his ability to play basketball, and blah, blah, blah.  And all that was fine.  I said, "But the problem is there are young ladies, there are women here, including my wife, who could be your mother.  And you're using all this language."  And I said, "I really would appreciate it..."  And one of the kids said, "Oh, Sir, I'm sorry."  And they all apologized.  Now, in eight of the ten cases that probably would happen.  The problem is in the one case where the one guy has the gun, that's the tragedy of this.  This is the fear that anybody, black or white, would have.  You can't say but so much, because you don't know how people are going to respond.  That's the challenge we face today.  How do we deal with that one situation in such a way that it doesn't shape how we deal with all the other situations?
Story_ID: 92998
Speaker 1: Do you think there's any way that would... anything that would help adults, black or white or whatever, to code the youth world?  I mean, because I think that we see them all as the same.
Speaker 2: I think it's... you make a very good point.  Because my wife [Jacquelyn Coleman Hrabowski], who works at an investment house spends a lot of time in the community helping children.  And because of our work in the inner city of Baltimore [Maryland], we have a clear sense of how much so many of these are kids are just that--children.  I should tell you, we supervise on this campus hundreds of little black and Latino boys who are first-time offenders.  We get millions of dollars to keep them out of jail, out of institutions.  And we have them here on campus in the evenings here; they're between eight and sixteen.  And it is a challenge, because people can get frightened of them very quickly, because they can look so hard.  But when they get to know these little ten-year-olds, or twelve-year-olds, they realize that these are children.  They're acting hard, you see.  Your point is well taken that we middle class people, black or white, tend to see a certain kind of behavior and assume this is a bad kid, I've got to be frightened.  It's not true.  We do need opportunities to talk about behavior of children and young people, and how they're shaped as they are, and what we need to do.  I'm convinced that what we have to do is to have many more opportunities to interact with these children, to help shape their behavior and their language and their values than we have right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, there's quite a few who are out on campus this evening.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, we've got all kinds of camps here.
Speaker 1: Camps, and plenty--
Speaker 2: Thousands, believe me, throughout the summer.  Oh, you'll see it all over the place.  But we have, we supervise... when I say supervise, we become surrogate parents.  We make sure they're up in the morning, in school during the day.  We bring them here to eat in the evenings.  We make sure they go home at night.  We take them home at night, and then we make sure they stay at home all night.  Then we get them back up the next day, seven days a week.  Why?  In the better of the two situations, the mother is working at night, and she needs help.  In the worse of the two situations the mother's on drugs, you see.  But we get twenty-something thousand dollars per child to hire a new college graduate to work with that child.  And we're still saving the state twenty-some thousand dollars a year.  You think about it.  You know, we're spending in this country billions of dollars to have children in institutions.  And we're saying there should be better ways to do that.  Because if we could do a better job of giving attention to that child over a sustained period of time; helping the child with reading and math skills and values; and giving the child another approach to handling his problems--
Speaker 1: You're saying to help them up front--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with this type of institution--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --rather than trying to help them--
Speaker 2: And put them in that other kind of institution where they become hard, you know, and even more focused on the wrong things.
Story_ID: 92380
Speaker 1: We were talking about your books.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the... well, what are your findings in terms of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what--
Speaker 2: The books focus on what parents of high-achieving African-American males and females did to help their children, their sons and daughters, do well.  And there are some basic messages that transcend gender.  And quite frankly, in some cases transcend race.  Those have to do with understanding what it means to love your child, that loving your child means you don't simply leave your child to the television, that you have to spend time focusing on that kid--understanding the child's strengths, the child's weaknesses, and talking with the child, building the curiosity of the child.  It means effective communication, learning how to listen to your child at different ages.  It means working to give the child exposure to other people with different points of view, and who are good role models of different types.  It means using resources from the community to be involved.  And for black children, boys and girls, young men and women, it means talking about what it means to be black and male and smart in America.  Or, black and female and smart in America, and the challenges that the child will face, and the ways in which the world will look at that child.  And the stereotypical thinking, and exploding some of the myths, and giving that child a sense of self and protection from all of the challenges a child will face when a child does well.  Because as soon as a child does well, people become envious, or they will say the child is acting white, you see.  And talking about those issues can make a big difference.  And the other factor that was important was spirituality.  Some of the families were Muslim, most were Christians, but they talked about the role of spirituality in helping the child to have some sense of strength that the child could draw on when there were problems and challenges.  And ways in which being around positive role models, who could tell the child things that would reinforce what the parents were saying, were very important.  So, these were some of the messages.  And then the curiosity for science--teaching and encouraging curiosity.  So often when kids ask questions of young parents, the parents either ignore the child or say shut up.  That's the worst thing you can do.  It's... Legos were really important... giving them puzzles to work on and things to, just things to build the mechanical skills... all very important for boys and girls.
Story_ID: 92381
Speaker 1: Tell me the popular culture image of the smart person.  When you think about black popular culture, I know the character of [Steve] Urkel in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is one sit-com ["Family Matters"].  I can't think of the name of it.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: The character of Urkel was a nerd.
Speaker 2: He was a nerd.
Speaker 1: And I was surprised when I heard that.  Because that's a term that you could hear in the white high schools in the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And we didn't use that.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: And now here, all of a sudden, here it is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in a sitcom.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they actually... it seems to me that they actually taught us what a nerd is.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And then don't be this.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it was an essential feature that he was very smart.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they, but they made him obnoxious at the same time, and somebody you would laugh at.  And that's, that's awful.  In contrast, Doogie Howser ["Doogie Howser, M.D."], you see, is a smart little white kid.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, cool.
Speaker 1: An MD, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you see.  How often do we see images of young black males on TV who are known for their brains?  It's a real issue.  Even on Star Trek, the guy, the black guy who was smart had these visors on his eyes; he was blind.  You know, there's always some negative feature they've got, you see.  And so, I mean we don't see examples of really smart blacks.  There's a little kid on a more recent TV show, but he's a little... he's a little kid, little kid who people can put their hands on his head, you know.  It wasn't somebody they were going to look up to, you know.  So, and the point that these parents were making was you've got to find people who look like these children who've done well academically.
Speaker 1: "Smart Guy."
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, yes, yes.  But you know, he's a little kid, you know.  He's not the example you want to have.  I mean, why couldn't they have a kid who was a great athlete and super smart?  You know, there was a boy who graduated from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in physics, a big brawny... and I can't think of his name now.  But I mean he... and we all know Carl Lewis.  Is Carl Lewis his name, the fast runner?
Speaker 1: Carl Lewis is a runner.  Edwin Moses might be the one you're talking about.
Speaker 2: I think Carl Lewis, because I think Carl... did Carl go to Morehouse?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think he's the one who went to Morehouse and was a major in physics.  But nobody ever talked about the fact that he had majored in physics, you see.
Speaker 1: I think Edwin Moses was a scientist.
Speaker 2: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We see him, but we... we don't--
Speaker 1: (unintelligible).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And so we need... we need to identify role models who can be both super smart, and regular guys and young women.  We've developed two tapes called "Hold Fast to Dreams" that focus on brilliant African-Americans who are doing other things, too.  And these are some of my (unclear) in the book that focus on a basketball player who's also a classical pianist and a 4.0 in biology, you see.  That's the image you want a kid to see... to say, "I can do all those things.  It's great to be a basketball player, but it's great to be planning to be a doctor."  That same young man went on and finished here and went to Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] and got his med degree, medical degree, and he's now at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] in law school.  So, he's an M.D., J.D., who's a basketball player.  You know, we need images like that to celebrate the brainpower of African Americans.

Speaker 1: Do you think that as, not just the black community, but do you think America itself is sort of anti-intellectual in a sense?
Speaker 2: America is definitely anti-intellectual.  But the upper class focuses heavily on the life of the mind--through their private schools, through an Ivy League education or a Stanford education, you see.  If you look at the standardized test scores of Americans, the wealthier the family, the higher the test scores of the children.  And that has everything to do with the quality of the schooling coupled with the quality of the test preparation sessions the child gets--coupled with, finally, the habits in the home.  The more advantaged the family, the less television watching there is.  The problem in families of color, African-American families, is that we have never developed the habit of reading as the first and most important habit of recreation in the home... few families.  And that's why even when looking at middle class and upper middle class African-American families and the test scores of their children, you will find that while their scores may be higher than those of lower income kids, they are significantly below the white counter-part with the same income level.  It's only not that way in black families from other countries, a significant distinction.  So that if a family came from Nigeria, even if they didn't speak English at first, but they're focused on that kid being the best, you will find that that child will tend to do much better on the SAT.  Or, from the Islands... so it has to do with teaching parents.  The reason we wrote these books was to give parents, particularly African-American parents, a chance to see examples of African-American parents and other black parents... and parents from other countries who've moved to this country who have been successful in helping their children to be among what [W.E.B.] Du Bois would call "The talented tenth," I mean, the highest achieving African-Americans.  We never take the time to talk about the highest achieving, and the need for those who have near perfect test scores and excellent grades, and have a commitment to helping other people.  That's my passion.

Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some of your other hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: First and foremost, that children will learn to read.  Seventy percent of inner city black children and Latino children in fourth grade are not proficient in fourth reading; that we will teach them to think well; that we will give them the appreciation... an appreciation of hard work and the understanding of relationships between hard work and success; that we will give the values that can allow them or help them to be protected against all of those negative forces that pull so many of our children in the wrong direction--drugs and violence and pregnancy, alright; that somehow we can make sure that those children of advantaged families who do get what they need will have a sense of responsibility to help those who are not getting what they need.  I worry about many of the people in the "talented tenth," that they're following in the footsteps of their white counter-parts and simply wanting to be Wall Street types, or the best of law school types thinking that they made it on their own and not understanding all the things people did to allow them to have the opportunities they're having.  I'm not sure that we're continuing to build a sense of history among our people--that we are becoming more individualistic.  And we rarely hear about race people today, in the sense of the early 20th century, you see.  And so, my concern is something that I'm focusing on in my research and my special efforts with African-American students on this campus.  These are talented tenth people, and I am working to produce race people.  And that doesn't mean they can't work effectively with others.  We want people who can be effective and appreciative of other people, regardless of race.  But we want people who also understand what their responsibility should be to people who are less fortunate.  And so, some of the people in my special minority program now are not minorities.  I have white students in my program who have an interest in these areas who want to become physicians, who work with all kinds of students.  Or, science professors who will know how to work with black kids.  So, they become in their own way race people, you see, in understanding the issues that another race faces.  So that... my concern is that we need more leaders in our society focused on these critical issues that people of color face in America.  That's the biggest challenge that I see--needing more leaders, producing leaders who can be focused on these issues.

Speaker 1: Do you have a certain philosophy of education, you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that we should constantly talk about what it means to be the best.  Mediocrity is unacceptable.  I'm constantly telling students what my mother and teachers told me--that I am special, that they are special, but they can be even better.  And most important, that nothing takes the place of hard work at the most fundamental levels.  Nothing takes the place of hard work and reading broadly.  Because we're not working here to produce the science and tech types.  We're working to produce Renaissance people who can think broadly and can, of course, do biochemistry, but can put the technology and the science into perspective, which only happens through reading broadly and appreciating the role of the humanities and social sciences in putting in context whatever we're doing in science and technology.

Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on... you've been the recipient of many, many honors and awards.  And if we were to try to read them off, we'd be here another twenty minutes.  But what, what's been the, I guess the... I guess the most... the award that's had the most impact on you, that you felt the most humbled by?
Speaker 2: I've been humbled by several recently.  I can think of four.  Becoming Marylander of the Year in '99 [1999], 2000 as a result of the Baltimore Suns endorsement, was significant, to be one of the few educators to get that, and to be seen as important in this State in making a difference.  Getting the McGraw Prize [in Education] from that company and that family for my work in education says that what I'm doing is important.  And then being elected over the past two years to the two, some would say, perhaps most prestigious honorary societies--the American Association... the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge [Massachusetts], and the American Philosophical Society most recently, at the height of my career.  They leave me, those honors leave me feeling very humble.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very humble.

Speaker 1: At this juncture--and you're still young, you know, relatively.
Speaker 2: I'm glad you said relatively.  (Laughter).  It's all relative.  To me, right now, sixty-five is very young.  (Laughter).  So, at fifty-two, I can see sixty around the corner, just as I can remember forty so well.  It's all relative, you're right, you're right.
Speaker 1: At this stage, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I have always cared deeply about ideas and about people.  And my mentees are all over the world, incredible human beings whose lives I've touched, but whose spirits have deeply influenced me.  That's my legacy, the combination of ideas and people.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently if you had a chance... to do differently?
Speaker 2: Not a thing.  I can honestly say dreams fulfilled today.
Story_ID: 92387
Speaker 1: And the last question we ask is, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just as somebody who cared, who cared deeply and passionately.   Anything I do, I do with great passion. Whether it's a math problem, it's tennis, it's reading three books a week, or it's working with my students to push and love them to be their best, it's with passion.  If you don't do it with passion, it's not worth doing.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you.  Great interview.  Great interview, Larry, very nice.
Speaker 1: Sir, thank you.
Speaker 2: Very, very nice.
