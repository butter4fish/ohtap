Speaker 1: And Ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Newark, New Jersey, November 4th, 1940, and I was promptly taken to Wilson, North Carolina at nine months, and that began my migration.  I was in the east in the, in the winter months and every summer I went south.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were raised basically in Wilson during the summer, is that right?  All right, now what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a caterer and I own two restaurants here in Harlem [New York City, New York], and I'm also the menu consultant for Wynton Marsalis at Jazz at Lincoln Center.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And you are also a retired model, right?

Speaker 1: All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is May 14th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in my home in New York City.  Welcome.
Speaker 1: All right, well thank you.
Story_ID: 107008
Speaker 1: And before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I love spoonbread.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you--that makes sense.  And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like orange.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring and summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere I can go for a vacation would be fine with me.
Speaker 1: And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of.
Story_ID: 107009
Speaker 1: Okay, well that, that'll work.  I'm gonna ask about your family history now.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Mamie Jean Sampson, M-A-M-I-E, J-E-A-N, S-A-M-P-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November the 3rd, I'm sorry, January the 3rd.  She was actually born in Camden, Alabama.  And I think it was about 1906.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Okay, as I understand it, my grandmother, Corinne Johnson, was married to a minister and had four children, and he died.  And her children were nearly grown when the owner of the plantation where she worked as a chef, took a great interest in her.  I was a grown woman before I found out that the sharecropper was my mother's father.  She always told us that her grandfather had come from Ireland.  But when I did research on my book, I discovered that they didn't come from Ireland, they came from Scotland.  And they landed in Virginia, migrated to Alabama and had quite a plantation in this little town Camden, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the, the person that owned the plantation fathered your, your mother?  Okay.
Speaker 2: The son of the man who owned the plantation.
Speaker 1: The son, the son, okay.
Speaker 2: And according to my uncle, he was a ne'er-do-well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I went back to visit Camden, I found some older citizens.  And they said that they would love it when they would see his horse hitched to the post 'cause they knew they didn't have to do such backbreaking work when he was visiting my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so had you--as far as you know, had your family all, all--I mean her side of the family been on that land for a long time with that same family in Camden?
Speaker 2: Well what we do know is that all the older brothers and sisters migrated out of Camden to Kentucky.  And they settled in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.  So--and then from there two of them moved on to Ohio.  So when my mother's mother died, she was four years old.  And the share--the ne'er-do-well plantation owner's son thought that the children were light enough to pass for white.  So they were going to give my Uncle Clyde to two old maids as he described them, who owned a turkey farm.  And they were going to give my mother to another family in Camden.  But her oldest sister said no, we're gonna keep the family together.  And she had her husband adopt these two children and brought them up as their own.  And they eventually had three more children, so there were five children, they were responsible for.  And that was Corinne Sampson.  And at that point, my mother changed her name from Mamie Jean Darden, I mean Mamie Jean Johnson to Mamie Jean Sampson.  And she considered her sister's husband her father and mother and died without telling her husband or her children this story.  It was discovered only after she passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother never did really know--
Speaker 2: No, and she didn't take any part in that story.  But it was a troubling story to my uncle who outlived my mother.  And they were full brother and sister.  And he shared the story with his family and with us, 'cause it was very bothersome to him.  She chose not to deal with it at all.  In fact changed her date in the family Bible to coincide with the year after the marriage of her sister and brother-in-law, whom she claimed as parents.
Story_ID: 107010
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, so did your mother grow up in Elizabethtown [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: So Clyde and, and, and Mamie Jean, my mother, went to join their oldest sister Corrine Sampson and her husband in E-town [Elizabethtown].  And the two of them were migrant farmers.  And they went from farm to farm seeking work.  And father Corrine got pregnant with her first child, she said no more migrating.  And they settled down in Delaware, Ohio, where her husband, who was extremely handy, built their own home.  And that home stands today.  Sixteen Noble Street, Delaware, Ohio.  A home made for five children by Granddad Sampson.
Speaker 1: Okay and Delaware is near Columbus [Ohio] I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother go to school in, in Delaware?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And we have pictures of her.  She sold ice cream cones during the summer to get money to go to college.  And she put herself through Ohio University.  And in fact all of the children went to school.  Clyde went to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], and my mother went to Ohio University [Athens, Ohio], and then the next son went to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], and the next one went to Ohio State [University, Columbus], and the baby, Uncle Asa [ph.], went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now is there a, a--so is--would you say your mother's older sister [Corinne Sampson] was responsible for instilling them with a sense of that they ought to go to college.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And she was extremely religious.  She didn't want any dancing in the home.  They were extremely chaperoned, and there was no cooking on Sundays.  They had to prepare their meal on Saturday.  And she was--she became in her later years, a minister.  And she--we have pictures of her in her robes and her Bible going out to spread the word.  And they were extremely poor.  My mother said that when Christmas came, the gifts that the children would get would be an orange or an apple and five pennies, and that was considered a very special Christmas when they got their five pennies and a piece of fruit.  And she also complained--once I was saying my sheets were too rough.  And she told me that when she was a girl, she used to sleep on burlap.
Speaker 1: That's hard to imagine that.  I guess it was probably hard, hard to imagine that, right?
Speaker 2: It was very hard to imagine it because she had an elevated sense of elegance and grace, and she presided over a beautiful household in New Jersey after she married.  And she just had an unfailing sense of fashion and decorum.  So it was hard to imagine that she'd come up under these circumstances because--but that was that generation did, they just hopscotched over obstacles and they ended up in a very beautiful place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother I suppose, just calculating her age, she must have finished OU [Ohio University], maybe if she went straight through, around 1927 or so?
Speaker 2: I would imagine so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But as I say, she had already fixed the family Bible.  In those days there were no birth certificates.  So she invented her own age.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what, what age did she claim?
Speaker 2: She didn't claim any.  She said that you don't ask a lady her age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107011
Speaker 1: All right.  So let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Walter T. Darden, W-A-L-T-E-R, T, D-A-R-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1898 I believe, in Wilson, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: All right.  What do you know about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well we know that our grandfather [Charles Darden] was nine years old when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.  And at nine years of age, he was thrust out into the world.  And all he had was a little shoebox as big as he was tall, and he was a very short man.  In fact he was shorter than his wife.  And he had to make his way from age nine.  And he wandered around the countryside in Wil--and he ended up in Wilson, North Carolina.  And he attended a church social.  And there was a perky young lady serving the lemonade, and her name was Diannah Scarborough.  And he became smitten with her and he decided no more roaming the countryside.  And he set up a little shack in Wilson, North Carolina, where he would shoe horses and he would make troughs for animals, and he could cut grass and he was very handy.  So after he'd had his shop a few years, her parents relented, and I do know that her parents were free-born blacks and an Indian woman.  And they relented and let him visit her.  And they married when he was like sixteen and she was like fourteen.  And they were to have twelve children, ten of whom lived, and the youngest of whom was my father, whom they called Bud, that was his nickname, Little Buddy, was what his father called him because his older sisters and brothers were married and had children.  So he was a uncle to people who were older than he was.  He was what they call the menopause baby, they weren't expecting him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's, it's interesting to think that all you do is go to your grandfather to be in the pre-slavery era.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: The pre-freedom era, I mean pre-Emancipation era, yeah.  That's--he was nine years old.
Speaker 2: And he never learned to read or write because it was against the law to teach black people to read or write in North Carolina in those days.  And even though his children all went to school, he never did learn to read or write.  He could only put a little X for his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Charles Henry Darden.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So Charles Henry Darden was, being a handyman, and then the town passed an ordinance that you couldn't--in those days you could just bury somebody in your backyard and put a cross and that was it.  Well they passed an ordinance that you couldn't do that; you had to have a proper burial.  So he started making coffins and he became the first incorporated black undertaking business in the state of North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he, he, he grew a business from making coffins to actually being an undertaker?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause he was called too.  Then he had a hearse, and next thing you knew he had--he was an undertaker.  Even though he was an undertaker, he was enterprising and he had all ten children.  So he also sold records, and he also had a burial society.  And he did very well for himself, considering his beginnings.
Story_ID: 107012
Speaker 1: Now did your grandfather [Charles Darden] have to get a license from the state?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Once they started that.  It's hard to imagine, but in the old days you didn't have funeral parlors.  You just--everybody buried--dug a hole and then there was a black cemetery and a white cemetery.  And he would--he also was a wonderful member of his church.  And my--his first grand--his first son-in-law, John Barnes, built the church.  People had such skills in those days and we would go visit John Barnes and my Aunt Annie, and he could play the violin and they kept chickens in the back yard.  And we would have Sunday dinner there.  And he was just a marvelous person too.  And it was a close knit community.  And my grandfather decided to run for political office because there were so many blacks who were in the state legislature.  But right after that, there was something that came along called the Red Shirts.  And they raided Wilson [North Carolina] and burned down homes of people, the black politicians.  And after that, no one--everyone was afraid to run.  And then they started doing a poll tax thing and blacks couldn't vote.  So he turned his attention from politics to education.  And he decided that he wanted all of his children to have an education, which was impossible in Wilson because after the sixth grade, you weren't allowed to go to school.  So he had to send all of his children to Livingstone College [Salisbury, North Carolina], which was a religious school affiliated with his church.
Speaker 1: That's an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion Church.
Speaker 2: Yes, A.M.E. Zion church, absolutely.  That's what it was, and all the children went to Livingstone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when John finished Livingstone, he then went to medical school.  And he finished Leonard University which is now Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  And he finished in I think the second or third graduating class for black physicians in the state of North Carolina.  And my grandmother always said he was the bell cow.  'Cause once the oldest child John Darden finished medical school, well here came J.B.  And he went to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and he finished pharmacy school.  And the two of them opened together a little shop in Opelika, Alabama, where John was the doctor and J.B. was the pharmacist.  But John was getting too much attention, so John [sic, J.B.] decided to go back to Meharry and, and finish medical school too.  So my Uncle J.B. opened up his office in Petersburg, Virginia.  And then came Charles.  He decided to become a lawyer, and he moved out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And he was a bachelor and a vegetarian.  So that was considered very odd by everybody else in the family.  And he opened one of the, one of the first black recreation centers for blacks in L.A.  But there was a religious woman, Aimee [Semple] McPherson.  And she had a, a spot there for her congregation and she cut off his water, and it was a big battle, and he lost Elsinore, Lake Elsinore, that was his, his big vacation center for black visitors.  And so that did not flourish.  Then in--
Speaker 1: Lake Elsinore.
Speaker 2: Yes, in California, near Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is interesting.  Aimee Semple McPherson has been written about quite a bit, Sister Aimee they called her.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was--she had a radio show and she--they made a movie, Elmer Gantry is basically based on the, based on the life of Aimee Semple McPherson.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.  I did know she disappeared with some kind of scandal at the El.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Elmer Gantry, he, he disappears with the sister, you know, who runs the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: That, that's the story of Aimee Semple McPherson.
Speaker 2: Goodness, yes I did know that part.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well based (unclear) inspired by it, yeah.
Speaker 2: And then I got--when I visit to L.A. and to promote our books, "Spoonbread & Strawberry Wine", there was a little--someone gave me a little poster of Uncle Charlie whom I had never met, where he was running for sheriff under the Prohibition Party.
Speaker 1: Okay he ran for sheriff, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a lawyer in Los Angeles.  And then next came Russell who was also a lawyer.  And who came to Harlem [New York City, New York] to see about setting his practice here and he was staying at the Y, YMCA.
Story_ID: 107013
Speaker 1: All right so you said your Uncle Russell stayed at the YMCA in Harlem [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Uncle Russell was staying at the YMCA in Harlem and trying to see if he wanted to move to New York, but he caught pneumonia and he died.  And the family never reached him and my father [Walter Darden] said that was just the biggest ache in the family.  So meanwhile we had Aunt Annie who became a schoolteacher and married John Barnes, who could build buildings.  And we had Aunt Lizzy who married a tall, handsome Texas, Texan, and moved to Texas.  And they discovered oil on their property.  But the bigger oil companies siphoned it off.  And it broke her husband's heart.  He died and he had to return to Wilson [North Carolina] with two small children.  And she ran a rooming house in Wilson.  And then there was Artelia, the youngest girl, who was a nurse.  And then there came my father, who was the youngest male child.  And he became a physician.  And he went to join brother John in Opelika [Alabama] and he was working in Tuskegee [Alabama], and he saw a little boy whose arm was in a sling and it was broken.  So he put a cast on the boy's arm and the white doctor who had put the sling on his arm, asked the little kid who put a cast on your arm?  That wasn't me.  And he said that was the young Dr. Darden.  And he called brother John and said that, that Alabama was too small a place for his younger brother.  So my father escaped from Alabama in a two-toned Nash [Metropolitan].  And he said that every bit of his clothing had come from Tuskegee, from his hat to his suit, tie, shoes, everything made by black hands.  And that was the philosophy of, of, of Tuskegee; that you were to be completely self-reliant.  So he landed in Newark, New Jersey.  And he'd been told to look up John Kenney, who had started a hospital in Newark.  So he went to work with John Kenney and, and eventually opened his own practice in Newark, New Jersey, where he was a physician for over sixty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now John Kenney, that's a black doctor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I imagine he's a pioneer black doctor here in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean in, in Newark.  Dr. John Kenney, that's K--
Speaker 2: I-N-N-E-Y. [sic, K-E-N-N-E-Y]
Speaker 1: E-Y, all right.  Okay.  Well he's got quite a story.  You've got, you've got really a, an interesting family.
Speaker 2: Well that's how I happen to been born in Newark, New Jersey instead of Opelika, Alabama.
Speaker 1: There are a lot of venues your family, you know lived, from Elizabethtown [Kentucky], Wilson, North Carolina and Opelika, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Down south.
Speaker 2: And of course on my mother [Mamie Jean Sampson Darden]'s side, I didn't get to say my Uncle Clyde ended up in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he became an insurance salesman for Supreme Liberty and Life Insurance [Supreme Liberty Life Insurance], which was run by Mr. [Truman K.] Gibson out of Chicago [Illinois].  And he had the Ohio part of the territory.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so your father I, I take it, he wanted to be a doctor you know, following an example of his brothers.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So this little slave, John Henry Darden, Charles Henry Darden, produced three physicians, two lawyers, two teachers, one nurse, and of course two undertakers who followed in his footsteps, which was C.L. Darden and Arthur Darden who kept the funeral business going.  And the Darden Funeral Company had a one-hundredth-year celebration, lasted for over a hundred years.  And then my cousin Charles took that business over and he died.  And the only ones left to deal with that would be my sister and myself and of course we didn't have any interest.  So the business was sold.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did it finally--
Speaker 2: It closed, it was about 110 years old when it closed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So around 2000 or so, or--
Speaker 2: About 190--I mean 1999.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-nine [1999], okay.
Story_ID: 107014
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother [Mamie Jean Sampson Darden] decided to go south and to teach.  And she was teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in Petersburg, Virginia, that was part of a lab for Virginia State [University] in Petersburg.  And my Uncle J.B. Darden was the school physician for that college.  And my father had been down to visit brother John and came back to see CL and Wilson and visit the undertaking business.  And he ended up in Petersburg visiting his second oldest brother J.B., and J.B. said there's a beautiful young schoolmarm over there.  And he said he wasn't really interested, he was enjoying his bachelor life in Newark [New Jersey].  He said I think you should meet her.  So he introduced them, and right after that she took a job as a social worker in Buffalo, New York.  So he actually made the trip from Newark, New Jersey to Buffalo to visit her in Buffalo.  And was it was freezing there.  And he'd come to the same recognition that the men were a little wary of a bachelor doctor.  So he said I guess it's time for me to settle down.  So they had a nice courtship and Buffalo was so cold, but he was anxious to get her out of there.  And they married at the little church around the corner here in New York.  And they were eight years without children and thought they weren't gonna have any when I popped up.  And then four years later my sister [Carole Darden] came along.
Story_ID: 107015
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so it's just you and your sister [Carole Darden]?
Speaker 2: Just the two of us.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now are, are your--was this an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion church your parents were married in, or was it--
Speaker 2: No, neither parent--my mother [Mamie Jean Sampson Darden] was Episcopalian, and my father [Walter Darden] was rather neutral.  He would go to church now and then, and Easter.  He was the person who would go to church on Sun--on Easter Sunday and maybe Christmas or New Year's.  And the rest of the year, Sunday was his day of rest.  But I must say he worked very hard.  'Cause in those days you did house visits.  And if somebody was sick, you had to go see them in their home.  And he did that up until the '60s [1960s] when there was just--drugs became prevalent and the doctors carrying their black bags were no--were, were prey.  People were getting conked on the head.  In fact someone robbed his office looking for drugs, drugs at gunpoint.  So house visits became out of the question.  And he had to stop doing that.  And he had to cut his hours back because there was so--Newark [New Jersey] became just desperado territory.  And so he started to take Wednesdays off later in his career.  But up until that time, he worked six, seven days a week.
Story_ID: 107219
Speaker 1: All right.  Now when you consider your parents' personalities and their dispositions and their looks and their energy and their habits and talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think we're--both, both my sister [Carole Darden] and I are right in the middle.  My father [Walter Darden] was very conservative politically because he'd come up when the Republicans were Lincoln and had freed the slaves.  So he was a lifelong Republican.  My mother [Mamie Jean Darden] on the other hand, was a very, very liberal Democrat.  So--and I think she voted for Wallace, one of her first votes, which was very progressive.
Speaker 1: This is--you mean what Wallace?
Speaker 2: Wallace I think ran--was he a pacifist, but--
Speaker 1: Henry Wallace?
Speaker 2: Henry Wallace.
Speaker 1: Okay, not George Wallace.
Speaker 2: No, no, nobody's ever gonna vote for George Wallace.  No, that's laughable on both sides.  No, but there was this pull of conservativism and great liberalism going on in the house.  I don't even know how they got that going.  And my mother of course was a lot more religious than my father, who finally became comfortable with Unitarian, Unitarianism, and did go to that church because he felt it was intellectually challenging.  But he was not one for dogma or a ritual.  And she loved dogma and ritual, that's why she liked the Episcopal church.  So my sister goes to church every Sunday and I never go.  So I guess I'm sort of like my father and she's sort of like my mother in that regard.  And of course I'm a Scorpio and she's a Taurus, so--and oddly enough everyone was born on the 3rd except me.  My mother was January 3rd, my father was June 3rd, my sisters May the 21st, which is a three, and I'm November 4th.  So I was the one who was always a little bit late.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you asked politically they were quite different, religiously they were quite different.  In looks and appearance they were quite different.  My mother was extremely light-skinned with straight brown hair, light eyes.  And my father was extremely dark with--but in temperament, they were very much alike.  And in philosophy they were very much alike.  They were very helpful to other blacks who'd come up from the South in terms of lodging, helping them to find jobs, offering them advice, money.  They were very active in the community.  My father worked with the Boys Club and my mother worked with the--with--in lots of little clubs, the Links, the AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  She--a bridge club.  She was a merry matron.  So she had lots of activities going on.  And my father used to give a fashion show for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to raise money.  And he had such celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr., Diana Sands, Harold Scott, people who were on Broadway at that time.  And this was when my sister and I were quite young.  And he had the junior models, the senior models, and then the celebrity models would come.  And we had Helen Williams, Dorothea Towles [Church], Margarita--I think Margarita [sic, Marguerite] Belafonte came.  And Sugar Ray Robinson's wife and sister participated in the fashion shows.  And it was a really big deal 'cause the governor of New Jersey came.  And he would sell his tickets and he raised quite a lot of money for the NAACP doing his shows.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is--yeah these are, yeah these are really big fund, fundraisers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And he could be big and showy, my mother was much more modest.
Story_ID: 107220
Speaker 1: Now was your father [Walter Darden] associated with a hospital in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Beth Israel [Medical Center].  And he was always so proud that they--one of the big-time gangsters had been killed in New Jersey, and he was invited to the autopsy.
Speaker 1: So he was--
Speaker 2: And I forgot, Dutch Shultz, it was Dutch Schultz.
Speaker 1: So he was invited to Dutch Schultz' autopsy.
Speaker 2: Yes, so he saw the corpse of Dutch Schultz.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it then, the black doctors weren't invited to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The kind of events that white doctors were.
Speaker 2: No, and at that time Dr. [John A.] Kenney [Jr.] had the black hospital [Kenney Memorial Hospital], and the others were a lot less inviting for black patients and they were put in special wards.  And I know that when I was born, my mother [Mamie Jean Darden] had a private room.  And that was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the, the hospital your father was associated with, Beth Israel, that was--was that the black hospital?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I didn't think so.  What, what was the black hospital, do you remember?
Speaker 2: There wasn't a black hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought you said Dr. Kenney was--
Speaker 2: Dr. Kenney had his own hospital on West Kinney Street.  That was the black hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that didn't--that was gone by the time I was born.
Story_ID: 107221
Speaker 1: All right.  Now do you have--well can you tell us like what did your home look like growing up?  Did you, you live in the same place or did you move around a lot, or--
Speaker 2: We moved once.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was born, we lived in Newark, New Jersey at 149 Kinney Street.  And the first floor was my father [Walter Darden]'s office, and then there was a backyard.  And on one side of us was the Jewish old folks' home.  And the other side was Father Divine.  Father Divine was a religious cultish figure and he had a big following in Newark, and he worked out of a hotel in Newark.  And all of his people would great you with "Peace."  And there was a man who had a novelty shop and he was a convert of Father Divine's.  And then on the top floor is where we lived.  And I had a room, my parents had a room, we had a living room, a sitting room, bathroom, and a little room for a woman who helped my mother [Mamie Jean Darden] named Katherine [ph.], who'd come from Virginia and lived with us.  And then when my sister was born, my father bought the home that had belonged to a Rothschild in Montclair, New Jersey.  And he moved us to Montclair and it was a huge shock for me 'cause I was used to running on the street and playing with kids.  And there we were, we had a whole acre of land surrounding us and I was having nightmares.  It was a huge, huge home compared to where we'd come from in Newark.  And it had a recreation room, it had a pool room, a laundry room.  It had a kitchen, a breakfast room, dining room, music room, living room, and a library, and a large foyer, a huge front porch, a, a side porch, a back porch.  And then I had my own room, my sister had her own bedroom.  There was two guest rooms, my parents' rooms.  And upstairs were rooms for servants.
Speaker 1: Well this is a mansion.
Speaker 2: It was a huge transition.  And in the backyard was--over the garage was the room for the chauffeur, two rooms where the chauffer could live.  And then next to that was a squash tennis court.  And then there were flower gardens in the back, rock gardens to the side, a brook ran through it.  And then there were the Chinese apple trees to the side, and there were dogwood trees and huge--it was just a tremendous transition for me to go from the ghetto of Newark to this huge, huge home in Montclair, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: That is something.  This was a former home of a Rothschild.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: One branch of the Rothschild.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The bankers.
Speaker 2: And they were moving because two black families had moved across the street from them.  So that whole section that had been very kind of snooty, white neighborhood, became black very quickly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it the neighbors were black professionals too.
Speaker 2: Yes, Dr. Lynch [ph.], Dr. Casio [ph.] lived across the street, and Bertha Cotton [ph.], who had a funeral home were already in Montclair, and Dr. Leonard Savoy [ph.] who was a dentist, was close by.  And Reverend Barry [ph.] the minister, and several other black families, the Shirleys [ph.], Dr. Shirley another dentist, and Dr. Morris [ph.], another doctor, were all in Montclair before we got there.  And the whites were selling these big homes very quickly.  And for a lot less money.
Story_ID: 107222
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I went from--I remember Newark [New Jersey] so well.  That across the street was a bar.  And once they brought this man had been in a knife fight across the street, and he was bloody and bleeding.  And my father [Walter Darden] sent me upstairs, but I didn't wanna go.  And people were having fights and shouting and it was just crowded and, and, and my father had this schoolmate from Wilson [North Carolina] who'd opened a restaurant.  And every Sunday we would have to get all dressed up and go there.  No air conditioning, just one fan.  It was so hot.  And we would have soul food.  And he would be very supportive of everyone from Wilson who had come to Newark.  And then we got to Montclair [New Jersey], it was really a shock-a-roni because everything changed.  I had to see, to see anybody, I had to get on a bike and go somewhere.  And my mother [Mamie Jean Darden] had to drive us everywhere.  Before we could just walk.  And I had dance class, she'd have to drive me there.  And we had piano lessons, we had to drive there.
Story_ID: 107223
Speaker 1: And school seemed terribly far away.  I went to Nishuane Elementary School.  And although it was probably just six blocks away, it seemed awfully long walk when I was little.
Speaker 2: How, how do you spell that?
Speaker 1: Nishuane?  N-I-S-H-U-A-N-E.  It's still there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's in Montclair [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: What happened was somebody--the police heard that someone was gonna kidnap me.  In those days no matter what your economic status was, everyone lived together.  So the rich, the poor.  And after that happened, my father [Walter Darden] thought he'd better get me out of Newark [Jersey] 'cause they didn't want anything like going, happening in our family.  So that's when he got the idea to move everybody to Montclair.  And so my mother [Mamie Jean Darden] didn't want me to start school in Newark and then move to Montclair, so I had a chauffeur, can you believe this, who drove me to kindergarten every day from Newark to Montclair.  That was one way to set me apart from the other kids.
Speaker 2: Now did you, did you, did you finish at Nishuane?
Speaker 1: I went to Nishuane from kindergarten through sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then we had junior high school, which was Hillside [Junior High School].  So I went to Hillside from seventh grade to ninth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay, Hillside.  Now that was in Montclair.
Speaker 1: Montclair.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then after ninth grade, my mother had the idea to send me to private school.  So I was sent to Northfield School for Girls in East Northfield, Massachusetts.  And I went there from tenth to twelfth grade--
Story_ID: 107224
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna back up some here and I wanna ask you about growing up during the summers in Wilson, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now there should be some difference sights and sounds and smells from Wilson.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes, well when we would get to Wilson, it was like freedom.  There was no school and my Aunt Norma and my Uncle Ciell [ph.] were very--didn't have any children, so they were always so happy to welcome us.  And we lived right on the route that took you from Florida right up to New Jersey.  So at night there were buses and, and trucks and it was so noisy we couldn't even sleep when we first got to Wilson.  'Cause in Newark [New Jersey], although we had the bar across the street and the rooming house and there was the, the Jews with their caps and they were singing and almost like chants.  We had Father Divine and all the people dressed in white.  And we had all the diversity in Newark and the crowdedness.  When we got to Wilson, it was a whole 'nother thing.  The rituals were entirely different.  In Newark you put on your shorts and you went out and that was it.  Then you went to bed.  When you got to Wilson, you had on your play clothes during the day.  Then you took your showers, then you got dressed up and you went calling.  So you would go visit a neighbor, and my aunt would take us.  And then we went to the movies.  My mother [Mamie Jean Darden] and father [Walter Darden] weren't much on movies.  But there was the black movie [theater] in Wilson, and--or else you could go to the white movie [theater] and sit in the balcony.  And my aunt went to the movies every--at least three times a week.  So we had movies.  And then coming home, we walked through the black section and we would go to Shade's [ph.] Drug Store and we could get pineapple ice.  And that was the most delicious thing I could ever wanna eat.  And in Wilson we just saw black people.  We really didn't interface with any white people at all, except if you went to a department store.  We went with our Aunt Norma to Missionary Society at the A.M.E. Church with her meetings there.  And then she taught Sunday schools on Sunday.  And we always had company for Sunday dinner.  And we were always dressed up in Wilson, whereas we were not dressed up in New Jersey.  And there was this overwhelming smell of tobacco in Wilson.  That was the big thing there, tobacco, tobacco, tobacco.  And the people calling tobacco, and the tobacco warehouses.  And there was churning.  My aunt made homemade root beer in the backyard.  She also cut up her own chickens.  She would take them by the neck and ring 'em around and chop their necks.  And it was--oh my God.  That was just, you know in Newark you went in the grocery store and got a package of chicken.  You didn't have to fix your own dinner quite that literally.  And she was just fearless.  And we'd take the eggs out of the inside of the chicken and put 'em in her gravy.  And she was extremely organized.  In the mornings, breakfast was ready.  Then Uncle Ciell would go to work, and then she did her housework in her housecoat.  And then when dinner came, everybody had their bath and we dressed for dinner.  And we either went to somebody's house or had dinner at home.  And we had no television there for a long time.  Whereas we had television in, in New Jersey.  But it was really a different existence, entirely.  And everything was segregated, even the library.  So I had almost read everything in the library for children in that children's section.  And whereas in Montclair we had, you know, huge library.  We--nothing was separated like that.
Story_ID: 107225
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you started at Nishuane [School, Montclair, New Jersey], that's right, Nishuane?
Speaker 2: Nishuane.
Speaker 1: Nishuane, Nishuane, okay school, Elementary School now what, what, what did you like about school?
Speaker 2: Well I liked my classmates for one thing, that was fun.  And liked my teacher.  A lot of the teachers at that time, you know if you were a schoolteacher, you couldn't get married.  So a lot of the teachers were unmarried at that time.  And they were a lot older.  But they liked me and I liked them.  And I liked reading best of all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: I liked Ms. Sullivan [ph.], she was very strict, but I learned a lot with her and she was very organized and I always liked that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So okay, so now were you involved in, you know, school ac--did the school have activities like plays and--
Speaker 2: Yes, we had soccer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember playing soccer.  But I was never good with anything with baseball or anything like that, although my father [Walter Darden] tried so hard to get me to be a softball player.  'Cause I would always strike out.  I could never get the ball and the bat together.  I never was very good at sports and they thought I'd be good at basketball, but I couldn't get the ball in the hoop.  I've never been good at sports, but I loved dance.  And I had Ms. Kemp [ph.] at the Y [YMCA] who taught us dance lessons.  And then I--when I was in the sixth grade, I would start going to Newark [New Jersey], and I went to dance and acting classes, and I ended up being on Channel 13.  And that was very big to be on television back then.  And I did a tap dance to "Bye Bye Blackbird."  I never will forget it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now in middle school when you're back in your--now, now did your--did the children at, at Nishuane like get on your case for showing up in a limousine?
Speaker 2: Yes, well it wasn't a limousine, but it was a Cadillac.  And it was strange.  I was the only person showing up with a guy driving me to school.  That was very unusual in that neighborhood.  'Cause Montclair I just read recently, the black community had come there from the South to serve the wealthy people in Montclair.  So there I was standing out like a sore thumb, and they did get on my case.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now so when, when it came time for middle school, you went, you went to school in Montclair.  Now was this a integrated school, or, okay.
Speaker 2: Nishuane was integrated then, then it turned all-black and then they got busing going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Nishuane was integrated as well.  I didn't realize that, okay.  But Hillside [School] then was integrated.
Speaker 2: Yes, as well.
Speaker 1: Right.  What was the, what, what was the percentage of blacks do you think in Nishuane?  Just a guess.
Speaker 2: I would say about, at that time maybe 30 percent black.  But that neighborhood as I say, kept changing and changing and changing until it ended up 90 percent black.
Speaker 1: 'Bout, 'bout when did it become 90 percent black?
Speaker 2: Long after I was grown, but I heard my friends talk about their children going there, and it became so lopsided that that's when they initiated busing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Hillside, now what, what percentage of blacks were there would you say?
Speaker 2: About the same percentage because all of the Nishuane people went to Hillside.  But then the white people we noticed, started going to private schools, to [Montclair] Kimberley [Academy] and other schools.  So we lost a lot of our Nishuane white students whose parents put them in private schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: And at that time believe it or not, the blacks weren't allowed in the private schools.  That's why they existed.  But now blacks are going to [Montclair] Kimberley [Academy] and all the private schools as well.
Story_ID: 107226
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what kind of dance did you--would you be studying modern dance or ballet?
Speaker 2: And tap.
Speaker 1: Tap, tap.
Speaker 2: Tap and ballet.
Speaker 1: Tap and ballet.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you thinking in those days about becoming a dancer?
Speaker 2: I wasn't thinking about anything, but I enjoyed it.  I wasn't--then, then of course I went away to boarding school, to Northfield [School for Girls, Northfield, Massachusetts] for three years and at Northfield we weren't allowed to be in the drama department.
Speaker 1: Now, now was there a drama department in Northfield?  But you weren't allowed to--black students weren't allowed in it?
Speaker 2: And not only that, black students had to room with other black students.  And this was a religious institution.  So when Diane Kenney came along to go there, Dr. [John A.] Kenney's granddaughter, she had to room alone 'cause there was no other black student for her to live with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you feel when your parents told you you were going to, going to Northfield?
Speaker 2: Well I was a little bit excited about it because [HM] Clarice Dibble [Walker, IV] and the Dibble girls from Tuskegee [Alabama] had gone there.  And, and, and Clarice had gone to Northfield.  And my mother [Mamie Jean Darden] was very excited about it.  So she took me up there to visit and I visited in the summer.  And I saw Chinese people and white people and black people there and I thought this is wonderful; I'm going to enjoy it.  And so when I got there and it was that segregation going on there, I was a little surprised.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't want my sister [Carole Darden] to go there.  So she went to Oakwood [Friends] School [Poughkeepsie, New York], which was a Quaker school.  And all the younger Kenneys went to Oakwood too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now at Northfield was there, were there any teachers or any students that reached out to and tried to make you feel--
Speaker 2: Well my second year they brought in two black teachers.  And one was Arden Sheldon [ph.], who's in New York and a friend to this day, and the other was Marsha Chapman [ph.], who's also a friend and lives in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  Both of them married doctors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Arden was my gym teacher.  They didn't have dance, but they had gym.  And you had to pass the swimming test, and I didn't wanna swim because my hair would go up.  And there were no black hairdressers in Northfield, so my hair was a big problem to me there.  Those were the days pre-afro.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  So this would have been in the early '50s [1950s], '53 [1953].
Speaker 2: Late '50s [1950s], yes.
Speaker 1: You started in '53 [1953] or--
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], okay, '54 [1954], all right.  Now so, now this is the year the Supreme Court decision, Brown versus the Board [of Education].  And your father [Walter Darden] was involved in NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and all that.  Did, did they talk about that in Northfield at all, in your classes, or anybody discuss--
Speaker 2: No.  There was no black history whatsoever, and we were so isolated, we didn't know what was going on.  We had no TV there.  So very little went on at Northfield except there were two things you had to do.  You had to work one hour a day, it was called dummy [ph.].  And you had to attend, attend church every day except Saturday.  And you had a half an hour for meditation because this was founded by Dwight Moody, who was a, an evangelist.
Speaker 1: I guess the founder of Moody Bible Institute [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Maybe so, I don't know that part.  But he certainly founded Northfield School for Girls and Mount Hermon School for Boys.  And from the beginning, he had black students there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm certain that's probably the Moody--
Speaker 2: And it was a Christian institution all the way.  'Cause when Jews came, they, of course they tried to convert them.  And they weren't too fond of Catholics.  There was a real Protestant morality.
Speaker 1: Now did the religious emphasis contradict or clash with what you had already learned at home?
Speaker 2: No, I found it pretty interesting because I studied religions, comparative religions, and I myself taught Sunday school in New Hampshire to Latinos who had been brought there to work, primarily.  And we were encouraged to do missionary work.  And actually I, I enjoyed learning about the different religions.  And we had ways of keeping ourselves amused, amused doing all the hymns we had to sing, we would change the lyrics.  And it was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Would change the lyrics to what?
Speaker 2: The hymns, and we'd put in secret codes so we'd be singing about something else.  'Cause after a while, my goodness, you know you're teenagers after all.  And it was contra-cultural to be going to that much religiosity.
Speaker 1: Can you give me an example of what you would change the lyrics to?
Speaker 2: We were putting in bed.  Sometimes we'd put in bed after every line, and it would come out hysterically funny on some of the lines.
Speaker 1: What for instance is there a line?
Speaker 2: Boy, I can't even remember a hymn.  But it--we, and we would give it a kind of naughty slant.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I guess that's--I get the picture.
Speaker 2: Yes, and we'd be laughing and chuckling and no one would know why.
Story_ID: 107024
Speaker 1: All right so now were, were you a good student at Northfield [School for Girls, Northfield, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was a good student I would say.  I'm not brilliant or not, you know, A-plus, but certainly enough to get me into Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York], which is where I went to college and where I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And which was really diametrically opposed to Northfield.  That was total freedom at Sarah Lawrence.  I was in New York.  I studied dance, acting.  We were going to the village, we call ourselves Bohemians.  And we were, you know you didn't need permission.  It was almost like Simon Says at Northfield.  You couldn't do anything without parental permission and the headmistress' permission.  And Sarah Lawrence was the total opposite.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1954 I guess you started at Sarah Lawrence?
Speaker 2: No, 1958.
Speaker 1: '58 [1958] okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, 1958.  No it wouldn't be '58 [1958] right, if you were born--in
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess it--yeah, you're right, you're right, okay.
Speaker 2: And I finished in 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite course of study in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school I Liked Spanish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had a wonderful teacher, Ms. Rice [ph.].  And I also liked history, I loved my history teachers.
Speaker 1: Who was your history teacher?
Speaker 2: I liked all of them.  But I had a--I think her name was Ms. Carpenter [ph.], not sure anymore.
Speaker 1: Now do you--when you look back on the history that you were taught, do you think it was pretty, you know--I mean why were you so excited it do you think?
Speaker 2: Well I--we didn't have black history in those days at all.  So I knew very little about black history till I got to Sarah Lawrence where you could elect to study whatever you wanted to.  But I, I enjoyed medieval history, I liked European history and, and I've just always liked going back to the past.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Sarah Lawrence is in New York?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In New York City?
Speaker 2: Bronxville, New York.
Speaker 1: Bronxville, New York.
Speaker 2: A half an hour away.
Speaker 1: Half an hour away, okay, all right.  So did--so I, I take it you frequently, you know, came into New York?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and they brought us into New York.
Story_ID: 107025
Speaker 1: All right.  And now did you ever--at, at this juncture in life, did you ever consider modeling, had you thought about modeling?
Speaker 2: Well actually that's how I got started in modeling was Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York], because Sarah Lawrence nominated me to be in 'Mademoiselle' Magazine, to represent the college, which was a very big deal.  And I remember putting on a gray suit and I had a red coat with a cape and DeLiso Debs shoes and gloves and I came to the city to be interviewed at Vogue, the Vogue headquarters here in the Graybar Building.  And when I walked in for my appointment, the receptionist asked me did I want to go to the back door.  And I said no, I'm here to model.  And she says no, modeling is a white woman's prerogative.  And I went, but I was sent by Sarah Lawrence College.  And the receptionist didn't let me through.  And my college had a fit.  And they called 'Mademoiselle' and they complained.  And sure enough, they used--they got the first black co-ed that year, but of course it wasn't me.  The one that complains is never the one.
Speaker 1: So, so they didn't let you model.
Speaker 2: No, and that's what--probably--
Speaker 1: They didn't call back and say we made a mistake?
Speaker 2: We're sorry, none of that.  And Sarah Lawrence, they were really surprised and shocked.  And nobody had stopped to realize there'd never been a black model, a black person in 'Mademoiselle' Magazine, ever.
Story_ID: 107026
Speaker 1: Now these days, in these days, in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] would, would you say that black people were largely invisible in the mass media in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes, we were in 'Ebony' and 'Jet,' but we were not in 'Seventeen,' we were not included in 'Vogue' or 'Harper's' [Bazaar], unless it was someone who was passing and nobody knew.  But while I was at Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York], [HM] Audrey Smaltz had modeled in my father [Walter Darden]'s fashion shows.  And she called me up and said let's picket.  Everybody was picketing together.  So Audrey formed a little team of us and we went down and we picketed 'Harper's Bazaar' to have inclusion in 'Harper's Bazaar.'  So we were all models who did it, but of course the ones who picket, never get in.  So--
Speaker 1: So 'bout, 'bout what year is this that you all did that?  When you were still in high school?
Speaker 2: This had to be about 1961.  No, I was in college.
Speaker 1: College by now, okay.  Yeah, at Sarah Lawrence.
Speaker 2: And after that, they did use a black model in 'Harper's Bazaar.'  The first one came.  And I say today I don't think if Audrey Smaltz hadn't formed us to go down and picket, I don't think we ever would have gotten in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's 'Harper's' they pick--picketed, right?
Speaker 2: 'Harper's Bazaar.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 1961, okay.
Speaker 2: And at the same time people were picketing to get more shows on Broadway.  And Lou Gossett [HM Louis Gossett, Jr.] and other actors got together and I joined that picket line to picket for inclusion in Broadway shows.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The bad thing about that little group that formed, they gave jobs to the top three people, our executives.  And after they got work, the whole thing fell apart.
Speaker 1: So the executives didn't come back to pull you all--
Speaker 2: No, once we accomplished it, they started their careers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know Lou Gossett was in--on Broadway.  He got his start when he was a high--or middle school, middle or high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But he--there wasn't enough work I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause he was part of the committee.  I don't think he was an executive, but he was part of the committee.  I remember him being there.
Story_ID: 107027
Speaker 1: Now, now do you remember how you first met [HM] Audrey Smaltz?
Speaker 2: She modeled for my father [Walter Darden]'s fashion show in Montclair [New Jersey].  That's how we met.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And your father would do this every year as part of fundraiser for NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and she was one of the young models in it.  At that time I was at Northfield [School for Girls, Northfield, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you remember a group called the Grandassa Models in, in Harlem [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, the first group I remember are the Grace Del Marco Models.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Elena Brooks [ph.] had her own agency.  And then Black Beauty came along.  And Black Beauty was a white-owned agency that had nothing but black models.  And then after she put us in 'Life' magazine, all of the major white agencies picked off all of her talent.  I went to Stewart, and the Wilhelmina, and then the others went to Ford and we all got absorbed.
Speaker 1: Now this still while you're in college?
Speaker 2: No, this is when I finished college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well this, let's gets you all the way through college.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 107028
Speaker 1: So when you were in college, would--so you had some aspirations to become a model since you were sent by--
Speaker 2: Yes, once I, once I was sent to be a model and couldn't be a model, then that made me a little annoyed.  And that's when I decided to spend a little time doing that.  Also, I was studying acting at Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York].  And because of my height, I was having a hard time finding any work during the summers or in summer stock.  I was always taller than everybody.  And so someone suggested to me that I become a model, get that patina from modeling and then, then come back to acting.
Speaker 1: It seems to be, you know, okay.  I always wondered why the female actors always seemed to be taller or as tall as the male actors.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Maybe they come from modeling, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well it was harder in those days 'cause it wasn't many people who were a lot shorter than the leading men who were not particularly tall.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  So when, okay so when did you get your first big break as a model?
Speaker 2: I guess with Black Beauty.  With Black Beauty there was the first breakthrough was 'Life' magazine.  And once I was in 'Life' magazine, then there was more demand.  And then the--all of a sudden, there was a big surge of black designers.  There was Jon Haggins who used me in a show that was quite successful.  And Rudel [Briscoe] the hairdresser, put on a show where Jon just found me.  Then there was Willie Smith and [HM] Stephen Burrows and Scott Barrie.
Speaker 1: Well we're galloping through, probably too fast.  I want to go back to--now when you were at Sarah Lawrence, did you get any kind of break at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right, so you didn't get anything like that.  So this is the break you got with Black Beauty, just judging from the name, that has to be probably after we started calling ourselves black.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which would have been--'cause at a certain point, black people would have been angry if they were called black.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there would have been a fight, you know, for calling people.
Speaker 2: Well there was colored.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Negro, and when those things became outmoded, then we went to black, I'm black, I'm black, I'm proud.
Speaker 1: Yes, so this starts happening in the late '60s [1960s] and by '68 [1968] it's pretty much, or '69 [1969], people are black.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, so at Sarah Lawrence then you didn't get a chance to really model.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And now, now what, what was your major at Sarah Lawrence?
Speaker 2: Well then I went into drama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And by my senior year I had directed a play by E. E. Cummings.  And I had some solid work as an actress with Charles Carshon at Sarah Lawrence.  So I came with a picture and a resume to New York City to try my luck.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what was the play that you directed?
Speaker 2: It was 'She' by E. E. Cummings.
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: S-H-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, the 'She,' okay.
Speaker 2: Or was it 'Her' ['Him'?]?  My goodness, such a long time ago, I don't remember.
Story_ID: 107029
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so well what happened when you were trying to find work as an actress?
Speaker 2: Well that wasn't easy at all.  So I ended up having to work.  And my first job was at Bloomingdale's selling gloves.  And then Bloomingdale's offered me to do--to take their training program and become a buyer.  So I worked at Bloomingdale's and I sold towels and sheets and then I decided I really didn't want to be a buyer anywhere.  And I studied with Lee Strasburg, and I studied with Sandy Meisner [Sanford Meisner], and Uta Hagen, and my teachers all encouraged me to stick with acting.
Speaker 1: So is this all at the Actor's Studio?
Speaker 2: This was all over town.
Speaker 1: All over town, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Meisner was with Playhouse [The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre], not at all the interested in the--there were different methods.  And Uta Hagen and Herbert Berghof had their own studio [the HB Studio] in the [Greenwich] Village.  And Stella Adler had her own set of lessons.  And I sampled a little bit of everybody and ended up with Wynn Handman who came back and produced me in a one woman show six years ago, called 'Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine.'  So it was very interesting that after all my travels, I ended up off-Broadway, produced by Wynn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the American Place Theatre.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what, what year was the play, 'Spoonbread'?
Speaker 2: I have the program here.  It was about, I guess eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So 'bout, okay.  In 2004.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can get you a more precise date when I stand up.
Speaker 1: Okay, well we'll get to it.  We'll get to it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 107030
Speaker 1: All right. So, so you were in, in New York [New York] taking acting lessons from a variety of different teachers and luminaries and--
Speaker 2: And I was dancing with Martha Graham and Alvin Ailey.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you can dance, you can really dance by this time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I got invited to join Martha's fledgling company.  She was starting a new group.  And at that time I got discovered from, for modeling and I dropped out of the dance scene 'cause I couldn't make any money as a dancer.  That was really poverty time.
Speaker 1: Now Alvin Ailey at the time had not emerged as a, as a big star.  He, you know, before he passed.
Speaker 2: No, no he wasn't.  No, he worked at--he taught at the Y [YMCA] at that point.  And I took classes with him at the Y and we became friendly.  And then he got in a play and I remember going to see him in the play and he was very uncomfortable in the play and he grabbed me aside and he said Norma, what do you really think?  And I was so surprised that I--as a student he valued my opinion enough to ask me.  But I, I just felt he was so uncomfortable acting.  Very uncomfortable.  And he was very, very comfortable dancing, teaching.  But he was uncomfortable with the words.  But I didn't have the expertise to tell him how to fix it.  So I didn't tell him.  And I told him no, you're fine, just keep doing it.  And I always regretted I just didn't tell him because sometimes things click like this if you just hear the truth.  And I knew what the problem was and I never said it 'cause I'd been taught to be so polite.  And you know I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.  And I traveled through life for a while.  Now I'm much more honest.  And if someone really wants my advice, I try and give them the straight truth, unvarnished.
Story_ID: 107031
Speaker 1: Now when you were taking--so in, in 19--this is--we're in like the late '50s [1950s] now in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: No, '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Sixties [1960s], early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I didn't come to New York until '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], okay, all right.  Now by this time there were already been a wave of black actors that--from the New York area that started making movies.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Like Sidney Poitier and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But there was like only one, you know.  It was back in the days when you had one of this and one of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so did you work for the Wilhelmina [Models] agency at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was a Wilhelmina model.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know they hired--it says here they hired Naomi Sims in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: No, Naomi was never with Wilhelmina, she was with Ford [Modeling Agency].
Speaker 1: Okay, I got a mistake here.
Speaker 2: No, maybe I'm wrong.  I thought Wilhel--but anyway, I, when I came along, it was a little after Naomi.  Naomi went and did her wig business.  But I don't--if, if Naomi was with Wilhelmina, she wasn't there when I was there.  I think she was at Ford, but I'm not certain.
Speaker 1: So when did you start there?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I don't even remember the year, but I do know right after I started there, Wilhelmina [Cooper] died and I was shocked because Wilhelmina had this habit of smoking and she was so graceful.  So I started smoking.  And I had never smoked.  And when I heard that Wilhelmina they said was a little sick, they said send her a card, send her a card.  I heard she's gotten a little worse.  But what--then I heard she died.  She was only thirty-nine years old.  I never touched a cigarette after that.  I threw out the pack because she was a chain smoker and she made smoking so attractive.  I remember saying you have such long fingers, you look so graceful smoking.  And you know how you follow your, your inspirational people?  And so I got the longest cigarette and she was smoking Gauloises, which was a French, Gauloises cigarettes, which were French, no filter.  And I threw that cigarette out and never touched another one after that, ever.
Speaker 1: Now during this period of time when you--were you interested in cooking at all, or--
Speaker 2: Not at all because I tended to be--the models were a little thinner than I was, and I had to stay a size six-eight, so I wasn't interested in cooking at all, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were eating very sparingly.
Story_ID: 107032
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  Now so, so did you know some of the, the early black models?  I guess--
Speaker 2: Certainly.  I knew them all from my father [Walter Darden]'s fashion shows.
Speaker 1: Who, who were the ones that you knew and kind of tell us a little bit about 'em.
Speaker 2: Dorothea Towles [Church] went to Paris [France] and became the first black model in Europe that we knew of, and she came back and would put on her own shows at the--my aunt used to call them "Ashen Shows" because my aunt worked on Seventh Avenue, Aunt Alice.  She wasn't a real aunt, but a good friend of my Aunt Norma's from Talladega [Alabama].  And--
Speaker 1: Can you spell her name for us--I mean the model, Dorothy--
Speaker 2: Dorothea, D-O-R-O-T-H-E-A, T-O-W-L-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, Dorothea Towles.
Speaker 2: And Dorothea was always written up in 'Jet' and 'Ebony.'  And she came back with like a million-dollar wardrobe.  And she would put on these fashion shows at the churches.  And you could go see them.  This was before 'Ebony,' of course.  And so I joined a group of models that included Lois Bell [ph.] and her--and in those days you just went out and bought clothes and you modeled your own clothes.  I mean it was a far cry from professional modeling.  But it was always a big seller in churches 'cause people wanted to see modeling.  So black modeling went on at black churches and gyms and everybody was putting on a fashion show.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So could, could you make money at a church fashion show?
Speaker 2: No.  They would sell tickets and then the person who put it on took all the money and you got a few little ducats for your time and travel.  But you really were just doing it for the experience.  And then came that huge breakthrough at the end of the '60s [1960s] where the black designers came to the fore.  The [Jon] Haggins, Scott Barrie, [HM] Stephen Burrows, and then we were really into real modeling with real shows for real buyers and magazines.  And black modeling became extremely popular.  It was the--the gates just opened.
Speaker 1: So what was the first event I guess that you--can you tell us?  I mean I, I remember looking at the--at 'Jet' Magazine and seeing the 'Ebony' Fashion Fair.  Was that the first big attempt I think of, you know, to have black fashion shows on a national scale?
Speaker 2: I'm sure that was, but I'm talking about international.  The New York fashion scene that, that was not--the 'Ebony' model was a glorification of the church kind of things.  Where you were just out there in costumes.  Costume-y kind of things.  But real modeling is to sell clothes.  So you're working for your Calvin Kleins, Ralph Laurens, and the people who are making the wheels of fashion roll in Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy in Paris.  And making those kinds of rounds.  And that was never allowed to--even Dorothea was kind of a specialty item when she was in Paris.  So those kind of clogs and wheels didn't really move until the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107033
Speaker 1: And was there, there any one big event that caused black designers and black models to get attention?
Speaker 2: Well they got it all on their own, on their own merit.  And they were doing their own shows with their own showrooms, and they had backers and they were getting their clothes throughout the country.  But the show that really put all of us on the map was the Versailles show [The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show] in Paris [France] where Josephine Baker sang and was presented by Grace Kelly.  And where we presented the fashions not only of Stephen Burrows, but of Bill Blass and Anne Klein and Oscar de la Renta and the American fashion houses went to Paris and captured the hearts of the Parisians and we got standing ovations.  And we were the--it was mainly the style of the black models internationally who broke that ceiling.  And now you find black models in Japan and in Milan [Italy], London [England], Paris, working the whole world.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1973, November 28, '73 [1973].  This is--was, was there a, a--I hear that yourself, [HM] Pat Cleveland, [HM] Bethann Hardison, Billie Blair, Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, Charlene Dash, Barbara Jackson, China Machado, Ramona Saunders and Amina Warsuma were there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And anybody else?
Speaker 2: No, now China Machado was an editor at 'Harper's Bazaar,' and she was a special guest of Halston's.  And a special friend of his.  But the rest of us were working black models, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that show as organized by a collective of black fashion designers, or--
Speaker 2: No, that was the white fashion designers.
Speaker 1: White, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, there was Halston, Anne Klein, [Hubert de] Givenchy, my goodness, the list is endless, Yves Saint Laurent.  No these were not black people.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: The only black designer in that show was Stephen Burrows.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so this put black models on the map, basically.
Speaker 2: Yes, and it put American fashion on the map because up until that time, all the people world over were buying French, French houses were the exclusive houses.  And this took our American designers to Paris and suddenly people wanted to wear blue jeans, they wanted to wear American fashions.  So it was a great breakthrough not only for the black fashion models, but for American fashion.
Speaker 1: So it's interesting now that American fashion achieves its breakthrough basically on the backs of black models.
Speaker 2: And not only that, the music was black.  They were playing Barry White for us to walk through.  And the French people came down with their little numbers and did a turn or two and went back the regular way you model in a fashion house to sell.  And we came out and we moved.  And we really were doing our thing.  And they were playing Sly & the Family Stone, black music.  And so the fashions were just tremendously colorful and bright and simple, and easy to wear.  And the opposite of what the French had been doing with their frilly kind of things where you have to go for twenty-five fittings.  And only the really rich can afford it, and the rest get the copies and imitations.  This was the real deal for all women.
Speaker 1: Okay, so kind of democratized--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that's why when you travel the world over, you don't know who's rich or who's poor.
Speaker 1: Very interesting, okay.
Story_ID: 107034
Speaker 1: Now, now did you know Beverly Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Beverly came along a little bit after we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know they said she was the first African American to be featured on the cover of 'Vogue.'
Speaker 2: 'Vogue,' she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And nowadays I guess there wouldn't be people listening to this in the future wouldn't think this is a big deal.  But in those days--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a very big deal when she got the cover 'cause we had all been on the inside, but she got the cover.  And that was really wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're gone pause--
Speaker 2: And Donyale Luna was the first to get the cover of 'Harper's Bazaar.'  That's the one that [HM] Audrey [Smaltz] and group picketed and they used her on the cover, but only in profile and you couldn't really tell she was black.  So the Beverly one was a real, real coup.
Story_ID: 107035
Speaker 1: All right, now it, now we're in the mid '70s [1970s] and so what are you, are you modeling throughout the mid '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are you doing some acting too, or--okay.
Speaker 2: You ready?
Speaker 1: Yes, we're rolling.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well yes in the '70s [1970s] I was doing my modeling and then I got hooked up with La Mama [Experimental Theatre Club, La MaMa E.T.C.], and I did some Ed Bullins plays and I started my acting career.  And I started a company with Edgar White and Walter Jones called the Cornbread Players.  And we were at The Public Theater with Joe Papp [Joseph Papp] and they were dramatists and Walter wrote a play called 'Nigger Nightmare' and Edgar wrote 'La Femme Noire' which Novella Nelson directed us in.  And we had a little home there for a minute.  And then--
Speaker 1: This was at the Joseph Papp theater?
Speaker 2: Mh-hmm. The Public Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is--it's called the Cornbread Players.  And what year is this?  Is this early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: I guess about '75 [1975], '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975],'76 [1976], okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I kind of stopped modeling and started just working as an actress.  And I got some parts on "The Nurses" and I started getting commercials, and I did El Producto Cigars and Sealtest Light and Lovely and I got a, a bunch of commercials with speaking parts.  And I was--then I started doing more runway modeling.  And I worked for Ralph Lauren, I worked with Donna Karan.  I worked at Halston, Steve Burrows [HM Stephen Burrows], Anne Klein, it's endless.  We were going from show to show to show to show.  And then I got very sick.  Very unexpectedly.
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Gosh, this is about I guess the, the very end of the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: This would be, what '77 [1977] or '76 [1976], '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: No, actually it had to be the beginning of the '80s [1980s] now that I think about it 'cause I modeled up until then.
Speaker 1: So 'Spoonbread [and Strawberry Wine]' came out in '78 (1978) from what I have here.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was this before 'Spoonbread' came out, or--
Speaker 2: No, I was modeling, waiting for that was taking forever, so I was still working as a model.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got sick and-
Speaker 2: Very sick.  Ended up in the hospital, and I had acute peritonitis and was touch-and-go for a minute. And when I came out of--in fact I lost a day; I was knocked out.  My father [Walter Darden] said "Daughter, I don't think there's too much future in running up and down in an evening gown."  And I realized it was time to push myself to another career because modeling is a rainbow, I mean is a butterfly career; you don't expect to do it for life.  Or at least I didn't expect it.  Some of the models seem to be doing it.  But I knew it was time to do something else I just didn't know what.
Story_ID: 107036
Speaker 1: Now let's go back a little bit to the writing of 'Spoonbread & Strawberry Wine.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now what--now this is something different from modeling or acting.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did you get--how did you--were you inspired to do this and--
Speaker 2: Well I had no intentions of writing a cookbook, but the food editor who was Maxime McKendry [Maxime de la Falaise] at Vogue came along one day and a couple of black models was sitting together.  And she asked what as our ethnic origin.  And one model who was from Harlem [New York City, New York] said "Oh, I'm Arabic."  I went what?  This is news to me.  And the next was saying well I'm part Swedish, I'm part this.  And everybody just jumped into this I'm--someone in my family was Indian.  So when they got to me, I said I guess I'm the only nigger here.  And everything shut up.  And I never use that word, it's not one of my favorite words.  But it was just--it's just that everyone was being so evasive.  And I said my grandfather was born a slave, and I have--so I guess I'm really homegrown.  So she zeroed in on me and she said I bet you have an interesting cookbook.  I went cookbook?  That was the last thing on my mind.  I was barely eating.  So she said yes.  I mean if you, if your family goes back that far, you must have very interesting recipes.  And I said well we do.  And I thought about the homemade ice cream, the pineapple sorbet that I'd had in the South and the homemade root beer Aunt Norma had made.  And how she used to make her own rolls and, and Aunt Lizzie [ph.] made biscuits.  And she was right.  I did have a lot of recipes in my background that I hadn't even thought about and couldn't make myself.  So I told my sister [Carole Darden] about this.  And she said that she'd had a dream that we were working on a project together.  And I told you she's Taurus and a social worker and I'm Scorpio and, and all over the place.  And she said I dreamed we were doing a project together.  She now claims this was her only prophetic dream.  But we forgot about that.  And then Maxine called me up at my house and she said I have a publisher for you and his name is Mr. Garden.  And he wants to do your cookbook.  So I called Mr. Garden and he told me to bring him a proposal.  And the proposal would be a couple of recipes and how we would knit them together.  So we wrote all of our relatives and asked them to send us recipes and we got from Cousin Em in Kentucky.  We got a molasses pie from Ruby.  And we got Aunt Norma to send us her magnificent eggplant.  And then the rest of them didn't even write us.  So we only had three recipes.  And then out of the blue the 'New York Times' called me and said we understand you're writing a cookbook.  Well we think that would be fabulous.  Model writes cookbook.  So they came to my apartment and took a picture of me and my cat with me making Aunt Norma's eggplant.  And I only had three recipes, mind you.  And they ran it in the 'New York Times.'  So once they ran it in the 'Times,' Mr. Garden called me and said he was doing Pearl Bailey's cookbook and he couldn't possibly do two black cookbooks.  So he wasn't interested.  But he had us write up the proposals.  So I had a proposal and I had the 'Times,' and another company called Liveright [Publishing Corporation] called and said they wanted to publish the cookbook.  And they paid me five thousand dollars.  So that was big money to get all at once on advance. So my sister and I got on Greyhound buses, planes, everything, and we went back south to interview our relatives and to find out what they liked to cook.  But in finding out what they liked to cook, they told us about their lives, and they shared their photographs with us.  And we came up with the first memoir cookbook.  And that started a whole trend.  'Cause now you don't get a cookbook without pictures.  And, but we were the first to do a memoir cookbook going back to slavery.  And that set a trend for cookbooks.  And we had not only the pictures and the stories and what the person was known for and the recipes.  And Liveright went bankrupt.  And so we got passed along to Doubleday.  And our cookbook has been in print for thirty years, over thirty years.  And we're now on [Amazon] Kindle.
Speaker 1: And that's a--that is quite a story.
Speaker 2: Well it's certainly true.  I couldn't have made that one up.
Story_ID: 107037
Speaker 1: No, but this kind of speaks to the cookbook's time was here, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, we were very disappointed when the book ['Spoonbread & Strawberry Wine'] first came out, they [Doubleday] only printed five thousand.  And it was Christmastime.  And they thought it would be a little seller and that would be it.  And we sold out, and we made the best seller list in several cities.  And those days you didn't have the technology you have now.  And it took weeks to reprint a book.  So we lost our first initial sale.  But because we did, and we've had a long, long run with the book that we probably wouldn't have had, had they been in stock and ready to go the first time around.  But we've had a tremendously long stay.  And people are still buying the book and still enjoying it, and they're now buying it for the next generation.
Speaker 1: That's right.  It's always seen in bookstores.
Speaker 2: And the hard copy is now a rare edition.  And it cost you almost three hundred dollars to get the first printing.  So we've become a collector's item.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so this book--now it was published in '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is before you got sick and after you got sick, then you talked to your sister [Carole Darden] about--
Speaker 2: Well I had talked to my sister before, 'cause Maxime McKendry [Maxime de la Falaise] came along when I was fully modeling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, but that was just an idea.  And then we had our publisher and then we didn't.  Then we had a new publisher [Liveright Publishing Corporation] and then we didn't.  So we were still both working and finally we got it together for--and came out in '78 (1978) with Doubleday.
Story_ID: 107038
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now but, but after you got sick, you had [acute] peritonitis.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You said and af--and your father [Walter Darden] had a conversation with you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A new career.  Gotta do something else.  And so--
Speaker 2: And that transition wasn't easy.  So my first job was working in a showroom with a designer Jon Haggins who was very popular at the time and had his clothes in Lord & Taylor and, and some of the other stores that were around.  And I worked there as his assistant and helping him to get orders and to sell and, and editing his line.  So I made transition out of modeling to the back of the house.  And then Jon did a show and asked me to do some food for it.  And I still have that picture of, of the food my sister [Carole Darden] and I did for his fashion show.  And people ate the food and loved it.  And that kind of started me--a friend who was there had done a documentary on Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.].  And she was up for an Academy Award and was being honored at Channel 13.  And she asked me to bring some food to there.  We brought a quiche.  Very simple quiche, so we thought, and Channel 13 loved it and they called us up and hired us to do a party at Channel 13.  And we said well we don't know anything about catering or not at all.  And the woman there was so kind.  She said but I love your food; I'll tell you what to do.  She told us where to get our rentals.  She made the menu.  And that started our career as caterers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: This is in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, this is before you went into Spoonbread, Inc., or--
Speaker 2: This is before we incorporated.  But actually we had finished the book.  But the book, I don't know if it had--
Speaker 1: So this was maybe--sot it'd be between--
Speaker 2: It was after the book because the book had come--
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: So this is the early '80s [1980s] after the book came out.  That's when people started calling us to cater.  And that's when Channel 13 found us.  And the book had come out.
Speaker 1: So this is about, you think about 1981, '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: Yes, had to be in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Channel 13 was our only client, but from there we got to Westinghouse, and word of mouth.  We never advertised.  And suddenly people were calling us everywhere 'cause it was kind of unique to have home-cooked catering.
Speaker 1: So were you--what facility were you using to cook?
Speaker 2: Our house.
Speaker 1: Your house, okay.
Speaker 2: Our homes.  My sister [Carole Darden] would cook something at her house, I'd cook something.  And then we were using our father [Walter Darden]'s house in New Jersey.  And then we would drive it and we would serve it, and we would do everything.  And it was so funny 'cause when she first said can you cater for me?  We don't do that.  We don't even know how to do that.  And she said well the budget is five thousand dollars.  We'll do it.  We'll be there.  We'll work it out.  So that was--she, she tempted us with the money.  And we worked with her until she retired.
Story_ID: 107039
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so now you started and you formed Spoonbread, Inc. in 1983 as a catering business.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And now it says here in 1985 you were part of a delegation that traveled to Gabon in central Africa, whose mission is to cultivate a strong economic and trade relationship, and--it's part of a delegation meant to cultivate a strong economic and trade relations with African countries.  Is this--did--now did this impact Spoonbread, Inc. in any way?
Speaker 2: Well I was invited as the guest chef, so that was a wonderful outing.  And when I got over there, I went to Ghana and I set up a trade with some sisters who had settled in Ghana who were from Detroit [Michigan].  And they were going to supply me with African goods, and I was selling them in New York.  And that was a very good learning experience.  It brought me right back to catering because although I gave them the money, I never got the goods.  So you know you have to learn these things along the way.  So that ended my export/import business, which I had studied in the World Trade Building.
Speaker 1: So you studied in the World Trade Center.
Speaker 2: Import/Export.  So as a New Yorker, that's why that bombing impacted me terribly.  That was a wonderful place.
Story_ID: 107040
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now, now in the '80s [1980s], well okay so you were--were there, was it, was it much competition, you know, in terms of catering in those days?
Speaker 2: There were quite a few companies out there.  Oddly enough, the same companies are still out there.  But yes, there was.
Speaker 1: For the genre of food that you were cooking, like southern style cuisine, Sylvia's [Restaurant] was out here in New York, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They were doing a similar kind of--
Speaker 2: But I didn't cook southern food.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My catering is not--oddly enough, my catering is not southern food.  My restaurants are southern food.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so the catering is not southern?  I mean it's--
Speaker 2: No.  The basis is not southern, it's New York chic.
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought with the name Spoonbread, you know--
Speaker 2: Well it was named for the cookbook ['Spoonbread & Strawberry Wine'].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But not, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, but it's only lately since I've had the restaurants that people will call on me for southern food.  But at that time we were mainly doing hors d'oeuvres, cocktails, and of course weddings and bar mitzvahs, the same thing everybody does in New York, funerals.
Speaker 1: So there wasn't a particular style you were noted for?
Speaker 2: No.  In fact I was noted for being able to do everything.  We just did a Russian wedding with real Russian food.  'Cause I've traveled to Russia, and I love the food.
Speaker 1: So did you cook the food yourself?
Speaker 2: Well I have seven chefs now.  I do the recipes, but rarely do I do any cooking.
Speaker 1: Well in the beginning, and if--
Speaker 2: In the beginning I did all the cooking with my sister Carole [Darden].
Speaker 1: All right.  Now you have seven chefs that are hired and--'cause it took like a, a while to develop the business on that level, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When it started, it was just Carole and me and a car.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now there's seven chefs and how many--
Speaker 2: Yes, or more, forty-two employees.
Speaker 1: Okay, forty-two employees.
Speaker 2: I never thought I would stay with catering.  I just thought it was an interim thing.  But I have people who have been with me so long that their children are going to college.  So suddenly you have the responsibility for families when you have that many people working for you and who are that loyal.  And so I found myself--and I never will forget when we were working at 13th, I had a little actress working for me.  She said I'm glad I'm not the owner, 'cause I know if you're the owner, you have too much responsibility and you won't get back to acting.  And I said that won't happen to me.  Long story short, it did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107041
Speaker 1: All right now so you didn't embrace the southern style of cooking until just recently, right?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't embrace that until we opened the restaurant.  And when we opened up Miss Mamie's [Spoonbread Too], we were cooking the kind of food that people liked to eat in the kitchen.  And there were no restaurants around me at all.  So talk about no competition.  And now there's sixty-eight restaurants around me.  And we're still going, though.
Speaker 1: Now, now when did you form the first restaurant?  Now that--the first one--
Speaker 2: Thirteen years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, thirteen years ago.  Okay, so 1999?
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the second one came two years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 2002, we opened Miss Maude's [Spoonbread Too].
Speaker 1: Okay, you've got Miss Mamie's and Miss Maude's.
Speaker 2: Yes, Miss Mamie's named for my mother, and Miss Maude for John's wife Maude Darden, who is like a grandmother to us because we never knew our grandmothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so I know in the '80s [1980s] or the '90s [1990s] Verna Mae Grosvenor [ph.], Bev Smith's.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: B. Smith, rather, and some others were you know doing the southern black cooking on television.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Got [HM] Leah Chase in New Orleans [Louisiana] was (unclear).
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: So and of course Sylvia's [Restaurant] here in New York.
Speaker 2: New York, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you, I mean so was your family basically--your family food the inspiration for the dishes that you cooked in, in your restaurants?
Speaker 2: Yes, of course.  That's what we were eating.  That's what families were eating.  We don't know anything about restaurant food, so our food is homemade, home-cooked food done from scratch.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So yeah, do you have a philosophy about what you will serve basically in your restaurants?
Speaker 2: Has to be good, has to be fresh.  And no, no particular philosophy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do people give you recipes for new things?
Speaker 2: Now and then someone will say try my recipe here or try my recipe there.  And I always do.  You know, if it's interesting.  Some recipes don't come out, though.  For years I never got that molasses pie from Ruby in, in Kentucky.  I don't know how she did it.  And she didn't either, 'cause she didn't write it--or at least she knew how she could do it, but she didn't know how to write it down.  And that was--that's the chief problem with getting recipes from the old-time cooks, 'cause they did it by sight, by smell, and color and intuition.  And the recipes were very, very vague, if at all.
Story_ID: 107042
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what's the toughest part of starting a catering business do you think?
Speaker 2: The laws and regulations.  'Cause as I said when we first started, my sister [Carole Darden] cooked something at home, I cooked something at home, then we'd get together, put it all together.  We didn't even know that you couldn't do that.  'Cause we had not a clue.  'Cause we always got, you know, this one would come cook something at our house, that would come cook.  So we didn't really have a clue about how to start that, that when you do a business, you do a business plan.  You have to have a place to cook it.  You have to have a place to get it inspected.  All that, we learned from hard knocks 'cause we had no intentions of going--we had no intentions of writing a book and it happened.  And we definitely had no intentions of going in the food business, and it happened.  And then you have to know your corporation rules, the state rules, the federal rules, labeling rules, traveling rules, temperatures.  And there's a lot more to it than you think.  And you have to be very good at math.  'Cause somebody might say I have a party for a hundred and then they call you back and says it's gone down to fifty.  So you know, you've got to know.  Otherwise you lose money if you don't know how to buy properly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So does it take, take time to figure out the proportions of what you're gonna buy.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yes, or else you end up with too much and God forbid, too little.  That's the worst thing.  You'd rather have too much any day than not enough.  And in the beginning a lot of people would tell you I have fifty people coming when they knew they had a hundred coming.  And that--then they'd say the caterer didn't bring enough food, you know.  So we had to get contracts that reflected if you're gonna have more people than you say you're gonna have, you still have to pay.  And then that made people a lot more honest.
Speaker 1: Okay. So would, would people--would this be like for a buffet situation or something?
Speaker 2: For any situation. They would do it repeatedly.  We had people who would--we'd get to the party and here they're expecting two hundred and we'd go we only have food for one hundred.  Our contract says one hundred.  And we'd go up and not everybody's gonna show, kind of thing.  And then they'd get even more than that.  And so you know we learned the hard way how to avoid the pitfalls.
Story_ID: 107043
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Is there, is there a favorite dish that you prepare that, that people you know, ask for the most?
Speaker 2: Well our deviled shrimp is very well known, and also we do a filet mignon with a bourbon barbecue sauce that people love.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What about desserts, is there any--
Speaker 2: My sister [Carole Darden] does all the desserts, she's in charge of desserts and baking of breads and pies and cakes.  And she's very good.  And she has her little staff of three people in the baking department.  And we had for Mother's Day we had apple pie that was just divine.  And we had a double chocolate cake with raspberry frosting, very beautiful.  And we had strawberry tarts.  And our standards are banana pudding, coconut cake, red velvet cake, which we make green velvet cake for St. Pat's Day [St. Patrick's Day].  And chocolate cake, lemon pound cake, and caramel cake, pecan pie, peach cobbler, peach and blueberry cobbler, and strawberry rhubarb pies.  I'm leaving out a lot, but that's the gist.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now do--would you, would you say it's like North Carolina-inspired cuisine or, or Alabama, or--
Speaker 2: Well it might have started that way, but we have a lot of vegetarians.  So we have string beans with no meat, which is highly un-Southern.  And candied yams that are not terribly sweet, which is not like any place in the South.  And we have fresh-squeezed lemonade and mint iced tea that are not as sweet as sweet tea in the South.  I think we've pretty--modified a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are you health-conscious in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes, and so is the audience in New York.  And that's why we have modified some of the restaurants--recipes don't have as much sugar.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have--
Speaker 2: Or none at all.  Sometimes we'll cook with orange juice or something--sugar substitutes.  Not fake sugar substitutes, but natural juices.
Speaker 1: Okay, like acai or, or something else.
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: Honey or acai or--
Speaker 2: Yes, like--honey's kind of sweet too.  But like an essence.
Speaker 1: Okay, an essence of--
Speaker 2: Of like using orange juice or apple juice and boiling that down so that you have the sweetness, but not refined sugar.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  To sweeten something that's supposed to be orange or apple, you can boil it down to the--okay.
Speaker 2: And we use brown sugar a lot too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107044
Speaker 1: Now has the, the increase of tourism in Harlem [New York City, New York] helped you out in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well here's the funny part.  When we opened Miss Maude's [Spoonbread Too], we had tourists coming from everywhere.  And that's why we opened Miss Maude's, 'cause we were so naive when we opened Miss Mamie's [Spoonbread Too], we only had forty seats.  And you can't get a tour bus in there.  You have to have fifty-five seats.  So that's why we opened.  The whole reason for Miss Maude was for tourists, it holds seventy.  And we opened Miss Maude's and two months later was 9/11.  There was not a tourist to be seen, not even from New Jersey.  People were afraid of the tunnels and the bridges.  And we almost went under immediately because we had opened for tourists, and there were none.  And I remember John-Claude [Baker] who owns Chez Josephine, telling me that he sent a ticket to his niece to come to New York and she wouldn't come.  And he sent her a free ticket. That was the story of tourism after 9/11.  We had a Japanese bus that would come, then it became a van.  And then last I saw him, he had two Japanese tourists in a car.  So tourism just vanished. And we had a private school in New Jersey that was studying Harlem, and they were coming for lunch.  After 9/11, the parents didn't want them to cross the George Washington Bridge.  So it was tough, tough times in New York after 9/11 for us at Miss Maude's.  We thought we would never recover.  And then the locals weren't coming out of their homes after dark either.  So it was really hard.  But now Miss Maude has fought for its little space uptown.  And, and it pays for itself.  But it was never the hit Miss Mamie was.  But we still--tourism has come back, to answer your question.  And we are getting more tour buses and tours in there.  In fact we have a big party coming in from Maine on, on Thursday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year did it kind of turn around.  Can you think about--
Speaker 2: Well what was so wonderful I thought was when [President Bill] Clinton came to Harlem.  And when Clinton opened his office in Harlem, Harlem opened up tremendously, and tourism came back a great deal.
Story_ID: 107227
Speaker 1: All right.  Tell me about the show, now you were in a--the play that you were in recently, within the last--when was it?  You said the one that you did--
Speaker 2: About eight, nine years ago.
Speaker 1: Eight or nine years ago.  And, and this was about--this play was about--
Speaker 2: This play was called 'Spoonbread [and Strawberry Wine].'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was the brainchild of Wynn Handman who'd been one of my acting teachers, and he has a--he had The American Place Theatre.  And he took me on as a project, I went once a week until we had something that was playable and producible.  And in this, his idea was that food is universal.  And everybody has a story around food, and reminisces.  So he took the genesis of our book and he had audience come in and I told my story.  And then I cooked a meal for the entire audience.  And we took the meals around so that everybody was eating.  And after they ate, we would pass a bowl around and they would look into the bowl and they would see an experience that they had hooked to food and they would share it with the audience.  And it was amazing the stories that came out of that little production.  And when Rex Reed wrote his review, he said I was one playwright who could eat her words.  And he got a wonderful student of his to help me put it on, Jed.  And we ran in New York and we ran in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and in Maryland.  So I was running around with my one-woman show that had one musician and Susan [Claasan] at the Invisible Theatre brought me to Arizona and I did it there three times.  But while I was running around, my catering company was having some unusual issues.  And so I had to come back and take care of that, and that kind of ended my run with the play.  But it was great fun.  And some of the stories I remember, I remember a woman who was from Idaho, who looked in the bowl and she saw that when she was a young child she was gonna creep down and surprise her grandfather, who was a lawyer, a judge.  And when she came down the stairs and she was gonna have milk and cookies with him as she always did, she saw him sitting at his kitchen table in a white robe with a white pointed hat.  And what was unusual to me about the story was you don't expect to find the Ku Klux Klan in the North.  And here was her grandfather, an honorable person in his community, who actually was hiding behind sheets at night.  And she was so stunned.  And it was the first time, and she shared it with the audience, her stories.  And I remember another young man, very thin, who looked in the bowl and he saw when his father died, that the community had come to him in West Virginia, and they had brought chicken and beans and potatoes and--in a salad for him.  And it was the first time he had ever eaten chicken.  They were so poor, the main thing they had was biscuits and gravy.  And he just marveled at all these foods because he had never tasted any of these things.  And it wasn't until death visited the home and they were young children, that they got all of these delicacies of pies and cakes and things that he had never had in his whole life.
Speaker 1: So this play consisted of a, a talk, cooking of food and then sharing from the audience.
Speaker 2: Sharing from the audience.
Speaker 1: About what--a story about food.
Speaker 2: Yes, they could share any story about food they wanted.
Speaker 1: Interesting.  So this is almost like performance art.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we ran in New York for about seven months.  And in--all total in Tucson, Arizona for about six weeks, and for over a month in Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 107228
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now in 2011, the, the remaining African-American models who were originally part of the historic models of Versailles show [Battle of Versailles Fashion Show] in '73 [1973], were feted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were part of that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well that was amazing that having done something so long ago, that people remembered and came back and celebrated us.  And it was wonderful seeing all the girls I hadn't seen for many, many, many, many years.  And to have Oscar de la Renta and Donna Karan and [HM] Stephen [Burrows] all, and praising us for what we done way back in the day, was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did anything surprise you about that gathering?
Speaker 2: No, there weren't really any surprises.  Well the surprise was that Ramona [Saunders] was deceased.  I didn't even know that she wasn't with us.  We'd all sort of drifted so into different aspects of, of life and in culture and in cities, that we really hadn't kept up.  Some had kept up with others better than I had and better than others.  But it was interesting to see what everybody was doing now.
Story_ID: 107229
Speaker 1: Okay.  When--when you look back over everything you've done to this point, I mean is there, is there anything that, that you want to do that you haven't--that you still want to do that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: There's lots of things I'd like to do.  Lots of places I'd like to go and see.  I haven't been--I've been kind of bound to the business and I used to travel everywhere and I really miss travel.  So I miss that.  And there're lots of goals and things, I never know where I'll end up.  I didn't know I would up here.  And it's not over.  I don't know what my next mission will be, but I'm looking forward to new adventures.
Story_ID: 107230
Speaker 1: Okay.  When, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is, was, is there anything that you would do differently if you would go back and change it?
Speaker 2: Everything, probably.  Yes, I think I would have not started the catering.  I didn't know how intricate and burdensome it would be.  I think I would have just stayed out there a little longer with some of my more artistic endeavors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably that's the only thing I would change.  But I've enjoyed the catering; it's brought me into people's lives in special moments.  Weddings, christenings, baptismals, I've been a part of a lot of people's lives in very strategic moments.  And that's been very rewarding.  And I've enjoyed it.  But I think I would have made more room for the other things.
Story_ID: 107231
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back again at everything you've done, what, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I have a legacy.  I guess the book ['Spoonbread & Strawberry Wine'] would be my legacy.  The fact that we've written a book that was typical, not only of our family, but of so many other families and that we were able to articulate it with pictures and stories and recipes.  I think that book would have to be my legacy.
Story_ID: 107232
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, dear.  Well actually, almost all the children of my friends have married other expressions, as the old folks used to say.  And I just wonder if they will carry the black legacy or--and they don't seem very committed to the body mass of black people.  And that concerns me deeply, that the people who have been striving to get somewhere, have gone somewhere else and I don't know if they're gonna extend that helping hand.  I think that's of a grave concern.  We wanted an open society where everyone was free to do whatever they wanted to do, but I worry about the impact that's now gonna have on future generations.
Story_ID: 107233
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about your family.  Now do you have children?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever marry?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what would you consider your family today?
Speaker 2: Well I have my life companion, Joshua Givens.  And we've been together twenty-two years.  And I have my sister [Carole Darden] and her husband.  And their son Jason is one of my chefs.  And he has a wife and a, and a new son who's a year old, little Raphael [ph.].  So that's good to know he's here.  And that's my immediate family.  Of course I have my cousins, Jean Marie in North Carolina and Artelia in North Carolina and Thelma Ann in North Carolina.  And, but from such a huge family, we're very small.
Story_ID: 107234
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we haven't talked about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well I think we've just sort of been swimming through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Goodness.  Well just for being myself.  Somebody who was independent of spirit.  And I hope people will think that I was kind and fair.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 107235
Speaker 1: Okay, I was very privileged to do the welcoming party for [Nelson] Mandela when Man--Mr. Mandela was freed and was given a tickertape parade.  We were--we did the catering event for that.
Speaker 2: That was '92 [1992], '91 [1992], '92 [1992]?  Ninety-two [1992] I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we also did the wedding for Naughty By Nature and Salt-N-Pepa, Pepa when they got married.  So we went from high esteem to popular arts.  And we've also done the movie.  We did the food for the Hudlin Brothers' movie that still gets shown on TV from time to time.  And now you know--
Speaker 2: 'House Party'?
Speaker 1: No.  I'm blanking out on the one where Grace Jones, Robin Givens and, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eddie Murphy was in that.
Speaker 1: Eddie Murphy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's 'Boomerang' I think.
Speaker 1: 'Boomerang.'  Yes.  And we've also catered for the Emperor of Japan.  And we've worked for, we've worked for President [George W.] Bush.  We worked for [Al] Gore's campaign when he came to New York.  We've worked for [HM] President [Barack] Obama's book party.  We've also worked for Hillary Clinton and President [Bill] Clinton.  So we've worked for almost every president since Clinton.
Speaker 2: That's--this is all worth mentioning.
Speaker 1: Yes, and we've worked for every mayor in the city of New York.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So the company has a--we've gone from hip hop to royalty.
Speaker 2: Where's the--what's the furthest you've gone from New York to cater?
Speaker 1: Washington, D.C.  We worked for Reggie Van Lee [HM Reginald Van Lee] in Washington, DC and we're very hopeful that the First Lady will come.  We have Obama's signature, Clinton's signature, Bush's signature, Gore's signature, and whom have I left out?  I'm leaving somebody out.  Who was it--we did not work for [President Richard] Nixon.  We have worked where the Carters [President Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter] were present.  And then we've worked for every major president since.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right well, well thank you.
Speaker 1: Not, not bad for a little spoonbread.
Speaker 2: No, not bad at all.  Not bad at all.
Speaker 1: And you know I can't even remember our other clients.  But we've worked for Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, most of the major--American Express.  We've worked for most of the major corporations in New York.  So that's a good thing.  Now I'm finished.  But I forgot to add that.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you didn't ask me any of my clients.  And I can't even think of who they--Citibank, Chase.  We've worked for major banks.  We've worked for Booz Allen [Hamilton], we've worked for Goldman Sachs.  So we have quite a nice track record.  We worked for Whitney Houston when she first met Bobby Brown.  So we've gone from the pop stars to the politicians and we did [HM David] Dinkins' inauguration too.  That was my first big party, when he first became mayor, was the Dinkins' inauguration.  And we're doing Dinkins's granddaughter's graduation tomorrow.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Well, well thank you.  That's--
Speaker 1: You're welcome.
