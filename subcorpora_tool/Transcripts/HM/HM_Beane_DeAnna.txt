Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewing today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is DeAnna Banks Beane, D-E-A-N-N-A, I capitalize the first A, B-A-N-K-S, Beane, B-E-A-N-E.  My maiden name was Easily, my middle name was Easily before I got married. E-A-S-I-L-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, now there's got to be a story there, so can you tell us the story?
Speaker 2: Of Easily?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All I know is my grandmother's name was Bessie King Easily, and her last name would have been--her married name would have been Williams.  Her maiden name was Moore.  I have no idea.  When I asked about it, I think back in those days they must have looked at the map and found some interesting sounding places and used that for names.  I have no--I don't know who Easily or King was or why she was named King Easily, but I was given the name Easily as a middle name.
Speaker 1: Well the way it's spelled is different cause there are lot of Easleys and Beasleys but you don't, you don't see Easily.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you can do something easily.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's the, that's the story and I, okay, and also the with the DeAnna with a capital A.
Speaker 2: There is a story there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In trying to figure out what to name this new baby, my father wanted my mother to name the baby after his mother, her name was Anna.  My mother didn't like the name Anna.  Her best friend said try DeAnna.  At the time DeAnna Durbin was a famous movie star, this was back in 1940.  So they named me DeAnna, but it was spelled with a small A.  So it was D-E-A-N-N-A, small A.  And I had a seventh grade teacher who could not remember that my name was "DeAnna."  And she kept calling me "Dina."  And one day I decided I'll fix this.  I'll capitalize the A, and I never had the problem again.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born January 25th, 1940 in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], in Freedman's Hospital, which is now Howard University Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I guess at this point I would be considered a consultant, an advocate for science education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: February 12th, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the law offices, I said law offices in Washington, D.C., Skadden.
Speaker 1: Skadden Arps.  Now this is oral history, I always ask the person what, what day it is and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25268
Speaker 1: So all right now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask that are like a warm-up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Salmon, baked salmon.
Speaker 1: Are you sure?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: The rainbow.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: Someplace warm, on the water in the winter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: A favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: That one I thought about and I'll just have to--I should read it to you.  So it's, it's a--I have two, but I can use either one.  I should have brought them with me.  They're over there in the bag.  But they're by--one is by Margaret Mead [cultural anthropologist] which is--I can't quote it, I'd have to read it.  But it's the only thing--never doubt what a small group of people can accomplish in terms of changing the world.  In fact it's the only thing that has ever been successful.  So, but that's not her direct quote, that's my paraphrase.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the other one is by Mary Budd Rowe [science education innovator] who was a, a really giant of a science educator, and very committed to high quality science education for all children, especially children of color and low income children.  And she has a quote in which she talks about the power of science education for children when they're young; that it is such an empowering experience that can help them have control over their own fate.  And it's just a really nice quote.  I can't quote it, but--so I would give you one of those in writing if that's helpful.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right well those, those are good.
Story_ID: 25269
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll start with your mother's side first so we don't get the two sides confused.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Do you want her maiden name or her married name?
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: Okay, her maiden name was Buena, it was pronounced Buena Vista, that's her first name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Spelled B-U-E-N-A, V-I-S-T-A, which I later learned was "beautiful view" in Spanish.  And her middle name was Marie, and her maiden name was Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then her, her married name would have been Banks?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the story I found, I finally figured out for her name, Buena Vista, it's a place on the map in the state of Virginia where she was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's what Walt Disney's Production Company was--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yes it is.
Speaker 1: Buena Vista, yeah.  Now when, what, what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh dear, now that's harder--she was born in Newport News, Virginia, and I think the date was 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I knew her mother.  She was very much a part of my life, and I knew her grandmother who was a part of my life until she died.  And that's as far back as I can go.  I know that my grandmother used to speak of her grandfather as Dr. Pollard[ph], who apparently from the pictures she showed us, which she treasured, was a white man.  I have no idea where Dr. Pollard [ph.] lived.  I could not, you know, I haven't been able to find out any of that.  After a while, it no longer was important to me but--and I, I--it seems as though in, in my effort to try to make the connections and, and just doing things online, I think I looked at Brunswick County in Virginia as a possible location, but I don't know because my grand, my great-grandmother settled in Newport News, so--and I knew that her family name was High, H-I-G-H.  So her name was Mary Frances High.
Speaker 1: That's your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: It would be my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So her father would have been Dr. Pollack.
Speaker 2: Yes, but I never heard any of that from her.
Speaker 1: Okay, only from her father.
Speaker 2: Or the other thing it could have been was--I mean it never occurred to me, but Dr. Pollack could have been on the other side.  It's probably more likely now that I think about it, and I just never thought about it before when I was doing my searches.  Dr. Pollack was probably my grandmother's grandfather on her father's side, which makes a lot more sense.  But I just never--that's something I'll have to--
Speaker 1: Okay, it could, yeah.
Speaker 2: Look into it, yeah.  Because he was never--he wasn't alive when I was, you know he died before I was born.  It never--he just didn't enter the picture.  But I'm, I'm now thinking about that.
Speaker 1: Now these are at least clues for you or other family members to follow up on if they want to know.
Speaker 2: Right, right, and her father's name was Shirley Moore.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your, your--
Speaker 2: My grandmother's father which would have been my--
Speaker 1: Great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Great-grandmother, yeah my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: His name is Shirley Moore.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay and what did he do?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know that my grand--when he died, my grandmother, my great-grandmother used to call him Mr. Shirley.  When he died, my grandmother married, my great-grandmother married again and this time she married, I think his name was Robert C. Williams, who worked at the shipyards in Norfolk [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right, so now what was your, what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Bessie, B-E-S-S-I-E, King Easily, and her maiden name would have been Moore.  She was married twice, so her first husband, my mother's father, was David Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother's father, your grandfather's name is David Williams.
Speaker 2: Right, he was, he was--it's very interesting.  Her second husband really became my grandfather in reality.
Speaker 1: Even though he wasn't blood related, but--
Speaker 2: No, but he was, he was my grandfather.
Story_ID: 25270
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now, now did your mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] grow up on a farm or did she grow up in the city?
Speaker 2: She grew up in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean if you can call Newport News [Virginia] a city.  I mean it was a small town then and, and actually when she was five years old, her parents moved to Washington [District of Columbia].  So she would spend all her summers back in Newport News with her grandmother, but she lived in, in Washington.  Her father, David Williams, was the caretaker for an apartment building.  For some reason I think it was on G Street, kind of on the edge of Georgetown.  I want to think it was in the '20s [1920s] or the 19--, you know, somewhere around in there.  And so they lived in that building and she went to, dear, I can't believe the name of the school is escaping me.  It's now a historical landmark and it's used as--but it's at 15th and M, an elementary school.  Was that Sumner [unclear], Sumner School.  It's now called Sumner School, and that's where she went to elementary school.
Speaker 1: It wasn't called Sumner when she went there?
Speaker 2: I think it may have been called Sumner-Grooter [ph.].  I think it was a hyphenated name, but it's Sumner School now.
Speaker 1: Okay, probably named after Charles Sumner I would guess.
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: The abolitionist.
Speaker 2: Probably, probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now did your mother have some stories of growing up?  She grew up here in D.C. [District of Columbia], right, basically, and then summers in Newport News.  Did she talk about growing up and what was going on when she was--or what she wanted to be, how she had fun and--or if there was things that scared her, or--
Speaker 2: It, it's--the things that stayed with me would be you know her friends.  You know she had some very close friends who though their lives went in different directions, they stayed friends, you know throughout their lives.  So one family lived at 1839 Swan Street, it's amazing I can remember the address because I loved to go and visit them.  That family had the mother and my mother were very close friends.  And so she would--and they, my mother, my mother's family eventually moved out of the apartment and bought a house on Caroline Street.  All of this property has now been re-gentrification, you know gentrified, so but Caroline Street was very close to Swan Street.  So the girls just hung out with each other and I can remember my mother telling me--I mean one of the stories I remember had to do with an--I don't even remember the, the circumstance, but I remember her describing how weird she thought it was to see the next door neighbor on Swan Street with a five year old coming home to nurse, you know still breast feeding with its mother.  I'm trying to remember other stories.
Story_ID: 25271
Speaker 1: Another story which I--story that's important to our family was my [maternal] grandmother [Bessie King Easily Moore] had not finished high school.  So she went to high school while my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] was going to school.  While my mother was in high school, my grandmother was in high school and she may have finished after my mother.  I don't know the, the years.  My grandmother worked as a charwoman.  She began working in the federal government as a charwoman, cleaning floors and cleaning bathrooms.  And she had this incredible valuing of education.  It breaks your heart when you see how for granted we take education today.  But she was determined that her daughter was going to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and she's scrubbing floors.  But she saved and saved and saved and went to school herself so that she could move out of the role of being a cleaning woman to being an elevator operator, and then she kept going to school and going to school and she went to Cardozo [High School, Washington, D.C.].  Back in the olden days when Cardozo was the business high school, and she learned shorthand and typing so that she was able to continually apply for new positions within the federal system which was a godsend to many black families.  My mother finished Dunbar, Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.], and went on to Howard University.
Speaker 2: Did your mother now, okay so your, your grandmother attended--was she in Dunbar when--
Speaker 1: No, she went to Cardozo.
Speaker 2: She went to Cardozo, okay so they weren't in the same school.
Speaker 1: No, and in fact for some reason I think my grandmother--I know she worked at night for many years.  And I don't know when the night work stopped and she began working in the day.  By the time I came along, she was working in the day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So when my mother graduated from college, then--
Speaker 2: Well does she have any stories about Dunbar?  I know it's a celebrated place here in D.C. and people, I mean like the alum of Dunbar really revere.  The time, time your mother was there was when it was in its heyday.
Speaker 1: I have from--I have the--a souvenir.  I was cleaning out something and found a souvenir from the anniversary of her high school class, which would have probably been, I don't know, maybe 1920.  I, I don't remember when she graduated from Dunbar.  It may have been in the early '30s [1930s] or late '20s [1920s].  I don't remember, you know--
Speaker 2: About 1930, 1929 I guess.
Speaker 1: Somewhere around in there.  I, I--
Speaker 2: So seventeen [years old] or eighteen [years old] I guess.
Speaker 1: I have it at home, but I, you know haven't--it was just when I came across this souvenir and I was throwing out stuff and I thought I can't really--because we went, my sister and I went to the celebration.  The, the son of one of the graduates was Freddy [Frederick D.] Gregory, the astronaut.  So you know his mother was there.  So it was a really big celebration, and this had to have been like in the early '80s [1980's], probably, maybe '83 [1983], something like that.  I--they just enjoyed high school.  I mean she never, she never--she didn't have--she enjoyed her friends.  Mother was a very social person, so she doesn't have--I probably have more school stories than she did.  I think my mother was smart, but I don't think she was a nerd.  So I don't think she spent all of her time you know, looking at books.  She was a very smart woman.  She knew her mother was not going play, so she was going to get her education.  And she had ambition.
Speaker 2: Now what did she project her career as being when she was in high school?  Did she have an aspiration that, you know, maybe she--I don't know if she reached it or not, but did she, you know, talk about what she wanted to do in high school?
Speaker 1: I never--I'm not aware of that.  You know part of it is the United States was between wars at that time.  And by the time I came along, we were into or heading into World War II.  Before I was born, so this must have been after she graduated, actually I should know this.  She worked in--I don't remember the sequence, but at one point she worked in adult education.  And this may have been in the early years of the war.  Working, yes I guess it was.  So I don't know which sequence, but I know that temporarily she worked for the U.S. Treasury Department, Bureau of Engraving, I'm sorry; worked for the Bureau of Engraving temporarily, as did a lot of other black women during that time.  And then I think she must have gone into adult education, particularly focusing on parenting and nutrition and child-care.  During that time, she must have met some other ladies in that situation, either they were working with parents or they were working with women, and they said to her we all have babies.  If one person stayed home and took care of the children, they could actually start a, a business, and that is what she did.  She launched one of the first black nursery schools in the city, in D.C.  It wasn't the very first, but it was perhaps the second or third.
Speaker 2: What was the name of her school?
Speaker 1: The Toddlers Socialized Nursery.
Speaker 2: Toddlers Socialized Nursery.
Speaker 1: Toddlers, T-O-D-D-L-E-R-S, Socialized Nursery School.  I don't remember whether she was an education major or a history major in college.
Story_ID: 25272
Speaker 1: She [Beane's mother, Buena Vista Marie Williams] went to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] now there's--that's another bank of stories, you know, probably.  I mean I just don't know the, the people at Howard.
Speaker 2: Yes, there are some, some Howard stories but I don't, I--
Speaker 1: Now she would have been there when Mordecai Johnson [first black president of Howard University] was the president?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, and so many factors--
Speaker 2: I have a Mordecai story.
Speaker 1: Well go ahead.
Speaker 2: You want to hear my Mordecai stories?
Speaker 1: What now?
Speaker 2: You want to hear my Mordecai stories?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: In our family Mordecai, well Howard University was just very special.  It was assumed that we would go to Howard University.  My parents met in Harold Lewis's history class at Howard.  Every year Howard has a Baccalaureate Service that is in the week preceding commencement and it's usually on a Sunday afternoon, and every year the entire family went to Howard's Baccalaureate, even though we had no graduates in the family.  But every year it was an expected activity.  So my earliest, you know memories would be going to, going and playing on the campus while my parents sat and listened to Mordecai.  When I was in seventh grade at Banneker Junior High [School, Washington, D.C.], which is now Banneker Senior High [School].  But Banneker is located across the street from Howard's campus.  And we were living with my grandmother [Bessie King Easily Moore] and grandfather off of North Capitol Street.  So one of the great joys was when my parents finally decided I could walk home from school because I had a couple of girlfriends who lived also on the other side of Howard's campus.  So we would cut through Howard's campus to get home.  And one day we were running down the lawn in the valley, which is next to the chemistry building.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's what the students called Death Valley I think.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I spent a lot of time in Death Valley, but that was the beginning of my experience in Death Valley.  And we were running down the lawn trying to get down 'cause we had to get all the way down to the bottom to the next street and on over to get home.  And Mordecai came strolling along and he always wore a black overcoat and a black bowler hat.  And he said little girls, don't you know if you play on the grass and walk on the grass now, there won't be lovely grass when you get to come to Howard.  And one of my little friends looked up and said who wants to come here?  You have explosions in the chemistry lab.  There had just been an explosion the preceding week in the chemi--chemistry lab.  So she said that to him.  And he said something I have never forgotten.  He said don't ever let fear keep you from taking advantage of opportunities.  You could slip in your own bathtub and break your neck.  And that has stayed with me.  I was so struck that he took the time to say that to us, that I held onto it.
Story_ID: 25273
Speaker 1: The other Mordecai [Johnson; first black president of Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] story, Mordecai Johnson, was we went to a Baccalaureate Service shortly after he had returned from a trip to Africa and it was the first time in my life I'd ever heard anyone talk about how beautiful black women were.  As I was a little girl and we weren't really paying that much attention except it got my attention and it stayed with me that he talked about his trip to Africa in a way that was so different from the way Africa had been presented to us through books and through movies and through people making fun.  He, he just brought to Howard University, or to those of us who were in that room--for some reason I think that may have been the year they had to hold the Baccalaureate in the gym.  But it was an extremely important experience because later when I got to Howard and every girl was required to take physical ed [education] under a colleague of Mordecai, and her name was Mary Rose Allen.  She ran the physical ed department with an iron fist.  And she carried out through the curriculum his vision for black women who come through Howard believing that they are beautiful, knowing that they are beautiful, and knowing how to take care of themselves.  It was quite remarkable, you know when I was going through the experiences with Mary Rose Allen, I didn't particular appreciate it.  But in, in later years and in retrospect, I see how important it was for him to have someone on that campus who could understand his vision and believed in it and reinforced it.
Speaker 2: Well tell--now would Mary Rose Allen do that, that you know reinforced his--
Speaker 1: Well the sequence of courses we had to take.  You had to learn to understand your body, understand your body type, understand--although I don't look like it, I did go through makeup experiences.  We had to actually go down to the department store and request makeup made for our skin tones.  She made sure that the physical ed department had in essence a place where women could do their hair.  You could never leave swimming and go out looking like the way I look now.
Speaker 2: That was, okay that was part of the vision.
Speaker 1: Natural hair was not part of her vision.  We were to comport ourselves as Howard women.
Speaker 2: This is interesting cause what we're talking about I guess is, is idealized, I mean a positive vision for black women, but based on notions of inferiority in some ways.  That you would have to straighten your hair out, you'd have to do those things.
Speaker 1: For the most part, I would say that it was probably less there than in other places.  You know Washington, D.C. was a very color conscious--you know the black community was pretty color conscious in terms of skin color.  So Mary Rose Allen went to great lengths to make sure she lifted up the rainbow of skin tones in black women.  That was pretty advanced, you know in, in this culture.  And I, I just can't remember anyone with natural hair being--you just, you know I have no, no memory of, of that.  So I think the hair issue really--and I don't know about Howard, I wasn't there then, but I think generally in the black community it was the '60s [1960s] before we began to just accept our hair the way it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there are, there are a few people that--Dr. Margaret Burroughs [writer and artist] who passed away two years ago--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --in Chicago [Illinois] when she taught school in the '30s [1930s]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --had a natural, which is--everybody, I mean her students that I've interviewed talk about how unusual that was.  She didn't care.
Speaker 1: No, we had a--there was a young lady who moved into D.C., into our high school with natural hair.  And that was just who she was.  I never even thought to ask her why she wore it like--it was just who she was.  So but for the most part, Howard was a very middle class school and they were determined to turn out students who would fit into a middle class world, a professional world.
Speaker 2: So, so did your mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams], back--your mother, did she major in education at Howard?
Speaker 1: I do, do not remember.  She must have majored in education but she took a lot of history classes.  And so that's where she met my father [Howard Percell Banks].
Speaker 2: And who, who's class was it?  It was a--
Speaker 1: Harold Lewis.
Speaker 2: Harold Lewis, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 25274
Speaker 1: Well let me go to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then we'll catch up, have them meet.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Howard, H-O-W-A-R-D, Percell, P-E-R-C-E-L-L, Banks, B-A-N-K-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Dear, October 26th, probably 19--I've, maybe 1902.  I'm just, I--
Speaker 1: Do you think he was about ten years younger than your mother?
Speaker 2: No older.
Speaker 1: I mean older, yeah older than your mother.
Speaker 2: At least.  For some reason I think he may have been twelve years older, so maybe it was 1900.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Glouster County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it G-L-O--
Speaker 2: G-L-O-U-S-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: All right, Glouster County, Virginia.  And where is that, you know I guess--
Speaker 2: Tidewater, Tidewater area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Near the James River.
Speaker 1: Near Norfolk [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Not--I think it's on the other side of the James River.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your father's ancestors?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I can only know that his mother's name was Anna Burrell, and she worked as a domestic.  She moved to Baltimore [Maryland] and then Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and worked as a domestic, sending money back to her parents who were raising my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he didn't move, he stayed in, in Glouster County?
Speaker 2: With, I mean until he was ready to go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Glouster County did not have a high school for black students and therefore when my father reached high school age, his grandmother and grandfather did for him what they had done for his uncles; their other children, and that was sent them to Saint Paul's, which is now a college or maybe a university in Lawrenceville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now that's an Episcopal coll--yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Black Episcopal college.
Speaker 2: Yes it is, yes it is.  It was a school--and I don't know, I mean do you want me to talk about that, or--
Speaker 1: Well yeah, so now--
Speaker 2: Or do you want to go back to--
Speaker 1: Well before like are there any stories about his ancestors at all?  I see you did a little bit of research about him, right?
Speaker 2: His grandmother's name was--dear--Whiting, Whiting.  I think her name was Laura Whiting, and grandfather's name was Banks, no, no, no.  It wouldn't have been.  This is terrible, I can't remember grandfather's name.  But grandfather was a--we did go through the archives and found out that his grandfather was listed as a waterman, but he was also a farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they lived on a farm.  Actually maybe they didn't call it a farm, cause maybe they just grew vegetables.  I never remember him--hearing him talk about animals.  So they may have just been a vegetable farm, I don't know.  My grandchildren once interviewed my father about transportation and he talked about how they would take the horse and buggy to go to church on Sunday and they took--grandmother went in one horse and buggy and my father, grandfather went in another because grandmother did not want to be tied to their sched--she had her own schedule of things that she wanted to do with church people.  It was country, you know, so they went to a country church and--but it was grandma--his grandmother's side of the family that had had property, the Whitings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know anything about them.
Speaker 1: So you, you don't know how they acquired property?
Speaker 2: I know nothing.  The thing I do know is they left property to their children.  So Laura Whiting and her husband left property to the sons and they had a daughter, their daughter was my father's mother, that was Anna.  And what I do know is when we went to the court to look--we were looking at property records.  She had owned property, which was very interesting.  And we saw papers that she had filed on her own behalf which I thought kind of interesting in Virginia back in those days because that would have had to have been in the early part of the 20--, of the 19--, of the twentieth century, yeah.  But I don't know, you know anything about, you know their lives or--I know that my father learned so much about growing plants, land, land use, soils, seasons, all of that, from those years in, you know growing up in the country.  And then when he reached, as I said when he reached high school age, the uncles who had gone before--each time an uncle went off to school, then as he moved through the school and got out, he then sent money to help the next one go to school.
Story_ID: 25275
Speaker 1: Now the interesting thing about Saint Paul's [Normal School, Lawrenceville, Virginia, where Banks' father, Howard Percell Banks attended school], which I have a tremendous respect for, Saint Paul's had a philosophy and I didn't see it in writing, but I learned this from listening to my father.  You will be able to earn your living with your head and your hands when you leave here.  So students had vocations, vocational projects that they worked on and in doing that, they developed vocational skills.  But they took all the academics needed because Saint Paul's was a normal school.  So theoretically, you could graduate from Saint Paul's, and I don't know whether you stayed an extra year or two, and go into teaching.  But you could graduate from Saint Paul's and go into college, or you could graduate from Saint Paul's and become a bricklayer, a mason, a carpenter, whatever.
Speaker 2: It's sort of like a community college today in terms--but the, the emphasis was on teaching as a normal school, yeah pretty much.
Speaker 1: I don't think--I don't know what a community college is like.
Speaker 2: A two year college.
Speaker 1: No, this was, this was longer than--I think they were there longer than two years.  I just never thought to ask.  They were long enough there for his class to build the Chicago Building, which has been renovated and is still being used on the campus today.  But when I think about the academics they took, I mean he came out of there being able to enter Howard and do well.  So they had to have taken, you know, some pretty--he was a history major at Howard.
Speaker 2: Okay so he was in--he wanted to be an historian, or did he?  Was--
Speaker 1: No, I don't know what he wanted to be.  My suspicion is that he probably wanted to be a teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's my suspicion but I'm not sure.  You know, I mean you're asking about what that generation was aspiring to be.  My-I-it would be curious to find out how many families at that point in their history had career notions.  I think more than anything they had a notion of upward mobility and wanting to have a place of their own and finding a job and particularly, if they were coming out of school, you know during, in between wars or during war time.  But I have no idea.  Anyway I--
Speaker 2: Okay, well at any rate, so he--at--after he graduated from Saint Paul's would you--he goes there for high school and--
Speaker 1: No, then he came to Howard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, then he goes to Howard, okay.  And so at Howard he's a history major.
Speaker 1: He was a history major and I suspect it may have taken him longer than four years because he worked to put himself through.  He worked as an elevator operator back in the days when elevators were not self-service.  So he worked in an apartment building for some wealthy, you know, apartment dwellers here in town, which enabled him to study in between apartment rides.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25276
Speaker 1: Now this is an interesting story because we found it very-he [Banks' father, Howard Percell Banks] must have worked at night and then went to school [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] during the day.  So he appeared at Howard in a morning, morning, I guess back in those days there was formal attire for men during the day or--I keep wanting to call it a morning coat.
Speaker 2: They had something to do with--did it have some, something to do with the job?
Speaker 1: I think it had to do with the job [as an elevator operator for an apartment building], except that on campus it just made him look elegant.  So, so I think that was part of the intrigue that my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams]--
Speaker 2: A morning coat is some sort of--yeah I, I think it's got gray stripes in it or something.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: But it's some sort of rather formal looking attire.  And so it made him quite striking to my mother and my mother's girlfriends, so--
Speaker 2: Okay, so now is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think he sat in the front of the class and my mother being the busy body that she was, she and her girlfriend sat in the back and played.  And my mother's girlfriend who later became my godmother, said he's really handsome, go talk to him.  I think she had a crush on him.  But anyway, my mother didn't and they teased each other and so finally my mother must have said something to him and, you know, they began talking to each other.  My mother, my mother had a number of gentlemen friends and my father was very quiet and very persistent, and he would actually go to visit and if she said well I'm going out and he would say that's fine, have a good time.  This is amazing to me--and he would sit on the porch and wait.  So I guess persistence paid off.  But yeah, they had a--my daughter and I were talking about this recently.  They had a really good marriage, a long marriage.  They probably were married for fifty-five, fifty-six years, maybe a little bit longer before, you know, one of them died.
Speaker 2: Okay, now well so your mother was at Howard when they, when they got, they met and your mother was--so he was like ten years older than your mother?
Speaker 1: I think so, I think so.
Speaker 2: So he had been--had to be--been going to school for a while off and on, or--
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened in the interim.  I don't, I don't know--
Speaker 2: Did he ever finish his history degree?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, I didn't--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, yes he finished.  And I--he may have worked a couple of years.  I don't know when, when she met him he was talking about going to Panama because I think that was when the Panama Canal was being built.  So he had this little sense of, of, of you know risk taking and adventure.  But that was not my mother.  She was not interested in going to Panama.  So I, I never asked him what he did in the interim, you know from the time he left Saint Paul's [normal school; Lawrenceville, Virginia] to the time he got to Howard.
Story_ID: 25277
Speaker 1: Did he [Beane's father, Howard Percell Banks] teach school after he finished Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Actually when he finished Howard, the jobs that he could get--the first job was not teaching school.  For some reason I can't remember if it was a health inspector, it was something like that.  And then he taught in Cheltenham [Federal Law Enforcement Training Center], which is still a school for boys who've gotten into difficulty with the law.  And it was my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] who encouraged him to apply to D.C. [District of Columbia] schools and he began in the D.C. schools as a math and science teacher.  And, and then when the opportunity arose to go into vocational ed [education] at Phelps [Architecture, Construction, and Engineering High School, Washington, D.C.], he went into vocational education and taught masonry and blueprint reading and bricklaying at Phelps for the rest of his career.  So that was basically where his career was based.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 25278
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' [Buena Vista Marie Williams and Howard Percell Banks] personalities and their disposition, sense of humor and how they walked, how they talked, how they looked, what they were interested in, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my father.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm more introverted and I am fascinated by nature, I'm probably more methodical and I like peace and quiet, yeah.  From my mother I got an appreciation of people, you know not just from the intellectual perspective because my father was much more intellectual.  Just because they're human beings.  I definitely got my civic involvement, civic involvement, interest in politics, interest in changing the world, calling people when they're, you know calling it when it's a bad move, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: You, you say you got that from, from your mother?
Speaker 2: From my mother, yeah.
Story_ID: 25279
Speaker 1: Now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: And, and where do you fit in--can you name them all and, and put yourself in the order?
Speaker 2: I hope I can name them all.
Speaker 1: Or will you, rather.
Speaker 2: I am the oldest.  And two and a half years behind me is my sister Sharon, Sharon Percellyn, P-E-R-C-E-L-L-Y-N Banks, and next comes my sister Patrice Banks who was born when I was eleven [years old], so she's leven years younger than I am.  And actually her name has my mother's first name, we just never use it.  Buena Vista, B-U-E-N-A, Buena Vista Patrice Banks.  She has Down Syndrome and has been an important part in our lives.  And then the youngest one is my brother, Howard Percell Banks, Junior.  And he was born when I was I guess twelve [years old], yeah.  So in a sense my parents had two sets of children.
Speaker 1: Okay, some years in the middle between you and the second one and the third one--
Speaker 2: So we got to be very spoiled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25280
Speaker 1: So now comes to the spoiling part.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Probably the earliest one is when my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] was in the hospital giving birth to my sister [Sharon Percellyn Banks] who is two and a half years younger than I am.  And I woke up and called for my daddy [Howard Percell Banks] to come and take me to the bathroom.  And I'm yelling Daddy, I want to go to the bathroom.  Well he's at the hospital with my mother and my great-grandmother's there taking care of me.  And she had white hair, so she was, you know to a little kid sometimes that's scary.  And I would not let her touch me.  And she said to me all right, you can wait for your father if you want, but you'd better not wet the bed.  I did not wet that bed, but I waited till my daddy came home.  So I remember that and then I remember the day I learned my sister could talk.  And that was when she said a full sentence.  I remember where I was standing, I remember where my mother was and she said she hit me.  It was an entire sentence.
Speaker 1: And you were being blamed, right.
Speaker 2: Well there wasn't anybody else there who could have hit her.  And I had hit her.  So yeah, so those are my earliest.  I remember having scarlet fever and I probably was about four [years old].  That was pretty--she had to stay isolated.  My mother had a nursery school and I had to stay isolated, you know, in a closed up bedroom and I could look out the window and see the children playing but I couldn't, couldn't leave until I was well.  So those are my earliest memories.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 25281
Speaker 1: Now did you grow up in the same place in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] or did you move around?
Speaker 2: My parents [Buena Vista Marie Williams and Howard Percell Banks] were living in an apartment when I was born and they moved into a house shortly thereafter.  This was during the war [World War II] and two things I remember about life during the war, three things.  One, rations and I remember rations--you had to have rations even to get shoes.  And I was very young, but I guess I must have overheard my parents talking about it then or later.  But things like bacon which I loved, required rations.  I never understood how rations worked.  But I just remember that they made tremendous sacrifices giving up their share so that they could keep me happy.  The other thing I remember about the war, the blackouts when there were times when everything and every light in D.C. had to be out.  The city had to be totally dark.  And because my father had two young children, he was exempted from the [U.S.] Army, but had to serve as an Air Raid Warden.  So when the air raids were called, then every house had to be dark and his job was to patrol the streets to make sure.  And of course--and we had black window shades and of course whose house would have to have a light on because I had to go to the bathroom?  His in that block, you know I would have to turn the light on and get to the bathroom as a little kid.  The third thing I remember about the wartime was that in order to make ends meet, another couple lived in one of the upstairs rooms in the house so that they were--they paid rent.  They became, they were good friends of my parents and they paid rent.  And I think that was what helped them make ends meet during that time.  I remember when the war ended.  By that time we had moved over to my grandmother's and we were living with my grandparents and the entire building, home that we had been in, was turned into a nursery school.  So we just expanded.  Eventually my mother had two more buildings.  But during that time when the war, the day the war ended, I remember my father taking me up to the corner of North Capitol and Florida Avenue and celebrating on the corner with all the other neighbors who were so excited that World War II had ceased.
Story_ID: 25282
Speaker 1: All right now we always ask this question and I guess you have to consider like where you were living and what you were doing, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Okay, for the years that we lived with my grandparents right off of North Capitol Street, the fire station was at the corner.  There was a fire station at the corner of North Capitol and Quincy, or North Capitol and R.  There was a street car line that ran down North Capitol or ran up and down.  Obviously there were automobiles.  Children playing on the block.  I think the neighbors had cats.  The neighbor on one side had cats in the outer lot, and during the war, the neighbors in back of us across the alley had chickens.  And that was a great fascination to us to see these chickens running around those people's yards.  Meat was hard to come by.  My grandparents would go to the farmer's market which was off of Florida Avenue on Saturdays and get a live chicken and bring it back, so that was really exciting to us.  Then we had a live chicken running around in our back yard temporarily until my grandmother broke its neck and got it ready for dinner, all of which was pretty amazing to us.  Other than that, I don't know--I mean if you walk up to the corner and looked down North Capitol Street, you can see at one end you can see the [U.S.] Capitol.  If you take the streetcar to the other end, you end up, you would end up at what was Soldier's Home which was a huge, lovely park in addition to the housing for the soldiers, which we never saw.  But where Washington Hospital Center is now and where Children's Hospital is, all of that was green, greenland, trees and, and all of that.  Sights and smells.  I don't know, does that--there was a corner store.  The neighbors on one side of us were, was an elderly white couple and on the other side there was a young black couple that had younger children than we were.  And then a house down there were--family with many children and many people, was black.  And then the next house had a, a little white girl lived there with her mom I guess.  I never saw her mom but I'd seen the little girl outside playing.
Speaker 1: Was your neighborhood mostly black?
Speaker 2: I think it was sort of mixed.  I mean judging by, by those two families, the stores on each end were owned by white people.  So I think it was becoming mostly black, or maybe it had already become mostly black and, and the families that were still there, you know weren't able or didn't want to move, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Was there a name for your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Now it's probably called Eckington.  Back in the old days all the neighborhoods didn't have names.  That's, that's part of gentrification.
Speaker 1: So now it's--it's what now?
Speaker 2: I think it's Eckington.
Speaker 1: Eckington.
Speaker 2: That's what I think it is.  It's right off of North Capitol and Florida Avenue, north of the intersection of North Capitol and Florida Avenue, but it's on the northeastern side.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 25283
Speaker 1: Now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was definitely a big part of growing up and our church was a downtown church, the 11th and K Streets Northwest, Asbury United Methodist Church [Washington, District of Columbia].  My--when my grandmother [Bessie King Easily Moore] moved to Washington [D.C.] with my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams], they had come from an AME [African Methodist Episcopalian] church in Newport News [Virginia].  The closest Methodist church to them was not AME, it was Methodist Episcopal which is now United Methodist, and that's how because they were living downtown.  That's how they came to go to church at 11th and K.  So my mother grew up in that church and my siblings and I grew up in that church and I'm still--even though I moved away and lived away for twenty years, when I came back, I came back to that church.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 25284
Speaker 1: Now let's see.  Now, now what did you like to do as a little girl growing up?  You say you liked nature and--
Speaker 2: Well in the summers after we finished our chores we'd go around the corner to the McKinley Public Pool.  There was a public swimming pool, outdoor pool called McKinley.  It was on--next to McKinley High School.  My sister [Sharon Percellyn Banks] and I loved to play.  We loved to play travel.  My grandmother [Bessie King Easily Moore] loved to travel, so she would insist every year that we take a family vacation.  So in between family vacations all year long, we were pretending we were on a train or a bus or a car going somewhere with all our dolls.  By the time I was about nine [years old] maybe, I got my--got a chemistry set which was really fabulous and a microscope that never worked very well.
Speaker 1: Now is this the Gilbert Chemistry Set they used to sell back in those days?
Speaker 2: Probably it was, probably it was.  But you know the name didn't mean anything to me at the time, it just meant I could make a mess.  I remember making invisible ink.  I can't remember anything but the invisible ink.  We learned to cook, that was another thing.  When my great-grandmother would come and stay with us in the summers while my parents [Buena Vista Marie Williams and Howard Percell Banks] were working, she would let me cook and she would teach me to, you know, make biscuits the way she made them.  Let me make donuts which was amazing that anybody could make a donut.  During those, I mean that was like my early childhood.  As I got older, number one, we moved into a larger house so that--it's different when you live with your grandparents because they're stricter or something.  So we had more freedom and also by this time my mother had had three children so we needed a larger place.  So then it became more of, of going to be with friends, riding our bicycles.  We moved into I guess what is now called the Petworth area of the city.  It was a large house, a colonial that a CBS news commentator I later found out had grown up in that house.  I think Charles Collingwood was his name or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah the radio, mostly radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But we loved the house, we loved the spaciousness of it, we loved the yard, it was huge in the backyard.  And my father actually converted the lower portion of that house into a nurse--one of the nursery school buildings.  As a high school student during the summers, ride my bike--well all with--from the time I moved there I discovered the public library was just three blocks or four blocks away, on my bicycles I would spend summers at the bi--at the public library and but bike riding was a big thing in those days.  And then as I got older, some of us girls would get together and play Canasta, which was a big game back in those days, card game.  We went to the movies, had parties.
Story_ID: 25285
Speaker 1: I went to high school.  I was sitting in math class I think the day the [U.S.] Supreme Court made the Brown versus Board of Education decision [in 1954].  And our principal thought it so important that she interrupted classes, which she never did, on the public address system to tell us that something momentous had happened and it might affect many of our lives.  And she told us that the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of desegregating the schools, and that we would have an opportunity to choose, more choice about where we went to high school.  Well we were all pre-registered by then, this was May, we were pre-registered for Dunbar [High School, Washington, District of Columbia].  And --
Speaker 2: You were in eighth grade.
Speaker 1: I was in the ninth grade.
Speaker 2: Ninth grade, okay.
Speaker 1: May 17th, 1954.  I was in the ninth grade.  And I went home and I told my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] this means I can go to that big, fancy school around the corner, and she said what?  I said that school, it was Roosevelt, Roosevelt High School.  And she said well I don't know, I mean it really--we went back and forth.  Dunbar had been her alma mater, so Dunbar was known, Roosevelt was unknown.  But by the fall I was still wanting to go to Dun--to Roosevelt.  So I just wanted to walk to school.  I had no idea what went on in Roosevelt High School.  I had no idea the quality or anything.
Speaker 2: So Roosevelt was in walking distance from your house.
Speaker 1: It was three block, two or three blocks away from my home.
Speaker 2: But it was a white high school basically.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And Dunbar was--
Speaker 1: All black.
Speaker 2: But it was--how far away was Dunbar from where you lived?  I'm not from D.C., so I'm trying to think--
Speaker 1: It was across town.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean I had to take a streetcar and a bus, or at least two streetcars to get there.  So it was a transfer.  And I went for--I went to Dunbar for probably two or three weeks when school opened in the fall because the school system said they were not ready for the Negro children to go, you know to the school closest to them.  You know they weren't ready to desegregate the schools yet.  But when they said they were ready, I transferred and I got to walk to school.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  So your mom gave in and let you go.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For many years I said those are the three years of my life I would never want to live over again.
Speaker 2: Three years at Roosevelt?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, those were rough years.
Story_ID: 25286
Speaker 1: Now let, let me pause here.  I don't want you to get into them yet cause I've got a--we haven't even taken you through grade school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I--just go back and recap the other schools.  So where, where did you first go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Well first I went to my mother's [Buena Vista Marie Williams] nursery school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I graduated with a diploma from Toddlers Socialized School [Washington, District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And at five [years of age] I think I entered first grade at Monroe Elementary School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And the--so you, you entered at five?
Speaker 2: Or six.
Speaker 1: Six, okay six for first grade, okay.
Speaker 2: Whatever first grade--
Speaker 1: Cause usually six, but okay.  Now and I take it you liked school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved school.
Speaker 1: Were there any favorite teachers at Monroe or any experiences that you remember that--
Speaker 2: I think probably the one--I mean there were a lot of experiences, but I think one that had a real impact on me.  We had a--most of the teachers--well the teachers knew your mother and your father.  I mean it's a small town and--but we ended up in a fourth grade classroom with a teacher who was very strict, very strict.  She had very high standards.  But we had had teachers with high standards before.  But they weren't rigid.  She was rigid.  And it was very upsetting to me because I felt like I couldn't please her.  And I used to feel sick going to school.  You know I would just--in the car as my--as I'm getting closer I'm getting sicker and sicker.  So finally my mother decided to come to school to see what was going on.  I, I really appreciate the fact that my mother just knew her children so well that even if we couldn't articulate, she could figure out and take action.  So she went to see the teacher and the teacher said I wasn't finishing my work, cause I'm very slow.  And there was just one student in the classroom that the teacher praised all the time.  And all the rest of us, I guess she thought we were dummies or something.  But you know we were all bright little kids so we never encountered anything like this before.  But my mother took it on.  So she said to the woman all right show me her work.  And she pulled out the folder and mother said she may not have finished but everything on here is right.  And the woman looked at it and she said you're right.  And I--it's always amazed me how from that day on, that woman treated me and the rest of the class so differently that ultimately we became so close that when I told her some years later--I mean we stayed in touch.  She took me to my first ballet performance.  When I told her that my mother was expecting the fourth child, she asked to be his godmother and she was his godmother.  So it taught me a lot about relationships and teacher expectations and, and how important parental involvement can be and what happens if you don't, if someone doesn't intervene in a child's life in a situation on behalf of a child.
Speaker 1: And your mother was the only one of all the parents that showed up to--
Speaker 2: She was probably the one who picked it up first.  I mean maybe I'm the only kid who was showing signs, you know.  I mean maybe it didn't bother the other kids the way it bothered me.  And plus mother's nursery school was just down the street, so it was no big deal for her to come into the school, you know whenever there was a problem.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story cause, yeah--you know the kind of ways amazing little stories, but it's, it's such a big consequence for you and probably other students.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Just a word at the right time.
Speaker 2: And years later I had to do the same thing for my son.  You know it's, it's--somebody's got to be paying attention to the children and what's happening to them.  No matter how busy we get, somebody's got to be watching over them and speaking for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25287
Speaker 1: So, so let's see so you were at Monroe [Elementary School, Washington, District of Columbia] through the--
Speaker 2: Sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Sixth grade, okay.  Now did you have any science in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I remember two excursions into science.  The first one grew out of the fact that our second grade teacher was the milk teacher.  And what is the milk teacher?  That's the teacher who's in charge of the school milk program.  So the milkman every day would deliver little cartons of eight ounces of milk to her room.  We had no refrigerator in the school, so at 10:30 we all stopped and had milk and graham crackers as a snack.  Well there grew to be cartons of milk left over and she decided we should learn to make cottage cheese.  I think many of us never learned to love cottage cheese until many years later.  But that was a science lesson.  The second and, and real science lesson came in sixth grade with a student teacher from Miner Teacher's College [Washington, D.C.] and she introduced us to astronomy or introduced astronomy to us.  And because it was one of her model lessons, she worked very hard to make it interesting and took us on a trip to the Naval Observatory where we got to see a real telescope, a serious telescope.  We did all of our field trips in those days by public transportation.  All thirty of us and one teacher on buses and streetcars and whatever.  Buses and streetcars really, but all we had.  There were no school buses that we knew of.  So those are my two science experiences that I can remember in, in elementary school.  Our textbooks came from white schools.  They were secondhand and they'd been used by a number of other children.  Some of them were kind of raggedy.  They were not first edition, but we had excellent teachers, just stellar teachers.  They taught us the academics and they taught us the social skills, yeah.
Story_ID: 25288
Speaker 1: Most of your teachers black in the black schools [in Washington, District of Columbia], or all-
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: All of them, okay.
Speaker 2: D.C.--Washington, D.C. actually was so segregated that we had Division One schools, those were white, and Division Two schools, those were black.  Some schools were only a block apart, school buildings were only a block apart, or two blocks apart but they were either all white or all black before desegregation.
Speaker 1: So D.C. I take it was not the city that had like a rigid geographical segregation like some cities, like the one I grew up--the West Side was the black side of town, and you know, East Side was white.  And you know so everybody knew, you know.
Speaker 2: We had--which is still the pattern.  We had housing patterns.  So their sections, there were sections of D.C. in which no black people moved into.  There were sections of D.C. that were all white.  There were sections of D.C. that were all black.  When we bought the house in Petworth [neighborhood in Washington, D.C.], it was on Cardington Street.  We were the first black family in that block.  The U Street corridor which is well known now as the you know, hangout place for young professionals, large--many of them white, that was the main street of black Washington in those days.  So the movie theaters, those were the movie theaters we could go to.  The eating places, the ballet school I went to was three blocks off of U Street.  I could take the, the streetcar and get off at 13th and U and walk down to my, you know my ballet class.  It's interesting 'cause I was thinking about this last night.  We had places that we knew we were not supposed to go.  Places that we knew we were not welcome, and places where we knew we'd be okay.  Now parents taught us those places, you know, they taught us the rules.  But I was also thinking about Mary Church Terrell [civil rights activist and women's suffragist; daughter of former slaves; one of the first African American women to earn a college degree] who if I'm not mistaken in back of my childhood I seem to have this memory of her actually appearing at a restaurant downtown and demanding to be served in an attempt to break that, that segregated system.  We could not go downtown to the movie theaters.  We could not go to Glen Echo [Park, Maryland] which was the amusement park that they advertised on television.  By the time we had television, I had a little brother, my little brother.  And he asked me to please--he saw Glen Echo advertised, it looked like so much fun.  Rollercoaster, a merry-go-round and he said DeAnna take me to this place.  And I had to tell this precious little boy we can't go there, colored people can't go there.  I can't take you.  It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do in my life was to tell a child that we don't have access because of what we look like.
Speaker 1: What about the [national] mall in, in D.C.?  The, you know the Smithsonian [museums]--
Speaker 2: They were open, they were open, they were open and you know my earliest memories of museums would be the Smithsonian and my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] taking us, you know, several times a year.  Getting together with another mother and her daughter who was a close friend of mine, we grew up together, and taking the children down to the Smithsonian.  So yeah, the monument was open.
Story_ID: 25289
Speaker 1: The public performances where they are now, you know, musical performances and readings and that sort of thing, you know, as part of the culture of the mall in those days.
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware of them.  I wasn't aware of them.  Now my dancing teacher every year put on a big recital where we all had to wear fancy costumes and dance.  I was a klutz, I remained a klutz.  But that's all right, she let me klutz my way across the stage.  And in the beginning she held the recitals at the Howard Theater which had been closed down for many years and has recently reopened as a venue.  I have not been since it reopened, but eventually she began using a public space which was called the Watergate.  Before they built the Watergate housing, you know hotel, condo complex, there was a barge on the river and it had a stage, it was a performance venue.  And it had a stage and so the Jones-Haywood School of Dance [Washington, District of Columbia] held their recitals on the Watergate barge, barge.  And the, the audience sat on the, the steps.  So that's a vivid memory.  All the weeks and months of rehearsals and the fancy costumes and the spotlight and the makeup and all that.
Speaker 1: Did any well known dancers come out of your school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Chita Rivera [actress, dancer, singer], actually one of them is featured in [The] HistoryMakers, Lewis, Lewis Jones, Lewis Johnson.  This is terrible, I can't--
Speaker 1: This is Lewis you said?
Speaker 2: His name is Lewis.  He went on to become a dancing choreographer.  The young woman who--she's much younger than I am, the woman who danced her last performance last week with Alvin Ailey doing--I think she did Revelations.  She was a product of that school.  Sylvester Campbell who danced with the Royal Danish Ballet.  There were a number of others.  I would, you know they actually had a, a reunion and a program and I guess I must have seen it online.  I, I guess I did so it's--and then you can see all the--
Speaker 1: So who was your teacher, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Doris Jones.
Speaker 1: Doris Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: Doris Jones [also a HistoryMaker] and Clara [Claire] Haywood.  They taught all the classes.
Speaker 1: I believe I interviewed Doris Jones before she passed.
Speaker 2: You probably did.
Speaker 1: She lived over near where the D.C. Black Rep used to be; in that neighborhood, but I--
Speaker 2: Was she at George Avenue and Decatur?
Speaker 1: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's where the school is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's where it is now.  But it was at 13th and S I guess, between R and S when I was growing up.
Story_ID: 25290
Speaker 1: All right, so leaving Monroe Elementary School [Washington, District of Columbia].  Let's see, so you leave Monroe in about 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty one [1951].
Speaker 1: '51 [1951], okay.
Speaker 2: No, yeah that's right, '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: About 1951, now this is before Brown and the Board [of Education; U.S. Supreme Court Ruling to desegregate schools, 1954] and all that.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And so [Dwight] Eisenhower is the president and so you go from Monroe to a middle school?
Speaker 2: Banneker Junior High [School].
Speaker 1: Banneker Junior High School, okay.  That's the one right across from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]   .
Speaker 2: They didn't know about middle schools then.
Speaker 1: Okay, Banneker Junior High, and that's right across the street from Howard.
Speaker 2: Howard.
Speaker 1: And that's where the Mordecai Johnson [first African American president of Howard University] story took place during that era.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so what are your some of your memories of Banneker?
Speaker 2: My homeroom teacher for eighth and ninth grade was A.J. Houston.  Her husband Charlie Houston, had been the civil rights lawyer.
Speaker 1: Charles Hamilton Houston.
Speaker 2: So you know she was no-nonsense, but she was a very fine teacher.  That was for eighth and ninth grade.  Seventh grade--well I can give you a funny incident.  Seventh grade was that time when kids were kind of exploring how to be different and my girlfriends and I had created a code, a secret code.  And we had written--we would write notes to each other in the secret code but I was very slow at it.  So somebody passed me a note written in our code and we were in history class which is very boring; U.S. history, it was terrible.  And so I was sitting there trying to decode the message.  And I didn't really notice you know, a lot of what was going on, but it did appear to be that there seemed to have been some coughing.  Well by the time we got back to our homeroom at the end of the day, apparently the teacher, the history teacher had reported that the class coughed at 10:30.  So everybody who coughed at 10:30 was then in trouble, their parents had to come to school.  Well I hadn't deciphered the note until 11:00.  It took me until 11 to decipher the code that said cough at 10:30.  So that was the only reason why my mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] didn't have to come to school.  But that's how strict school was, you know our classes were at Banneker, that that was an infraction, you know.
Speaker 1: But that's, that speaks also to a high level of organization and cooperation on the part of the class on, on something dumb, yes, but--
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: It was a--
Speaker 2: Of course, and by the time we got to eighth grade, that homeroom teacher was really smart because she told us from the first day the motto for our class was esprit de corps, we worked as a body.  If one got in trouble, everybody was in trouble.  And so we were expected to conduct ourselves as perfect ladies and gentlemen or we'd have to face her at the end of the day.  So there weren't anymore of those cough at 10:30 events, but junior high school was--the skills, it was probably the time when the most crucial academic skills I would gain, the foundations and really the body of them were gained during those years.  I had excellent English teachers.  And years later as a professional, I would run into the--one of them I ran into at a conference out in Wingspread, and I think Wisconsin, and I said to her I never thought I would earn my living with the skills you taught me.  Thank you.  I would have never thought I'd be writing as, you know to earn my living.  Charlotte K. Brooks was her name, and she went on to become president of the, whatever you--the National Teachers Association, whatever their professional organization; she was excellent.  And then another one, I later saw her when visiting her church and I told her the same thing.  Our math teachers were excellent.
Story_ID: 25291
Speaker 1: We did not have a strong science program at that time [at Banneker Junior High School, Washington, District of Columbia].  We didn't have any equipment and I remember the day our science teacher put a microscope on the front desk and said get in line and come up and take a look.  It was mind blowing.  It was wonderful.  He could see I was hooked.  And he later asked me, told me he wanted me to talk to my father [Howard Percell Banks] and ask him to help me prepare a project for the city-wide science fair.  And we did that and then so that was my excursion into a broader world of people who enjoyed science.
Speaker 2: Now what was your project?
Speaker 1: That first project was on landscaping a home.  It, it did not reflect what I later came to appreciate about, you know, what science projects needed to do, but it did well in the science fair, so--for seventh grade.
Speaker 2: Now were you competing city-wide against all the students?
Speaker 1: City-wide, city-wide, yes.
Speaker 2: I mean and the white ones too?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  So the science fair was my first excursion outside of my warm cocoon of the black community.  The fair was held in the gym of American University [Washington, D.C.], which was in a part of town I didn't know existed.  That first year my father took me.  The second year my parents [Howard Percell Banks and Buena Vista Marie Williams] allowed me to take public transportation.  So on the bus I got to the bureau, and the National Bureau of Standards used to be here in town.  I got to pass the National Bureau of Standards, it was just amazing.  As a result of my years of participation, one year I did a project--we had visited Grand Canyon, which is really impressive.  So one year I did a project of a cross-section of Grand Canyon which clearly with my father's help because I wasn't getting the help at school, but it brought me into the world of geology.  And then when I got to high school my, my project was different.  I had a, a really good biology teacher and she you know, encouraged me to just explore something I wanted to know more about.  But those years in junior high with a teacher who's field was not science, and I don't think he really loved science.  I think he was assigned to teach science.  But he opened the door for me to participate in the science fairs and I was elected to the Washington Junior Academy of Sciences.  And as a academy member for some reason it seemed to have been on the governing board or something, I don't even know how those things happen.  But I was exposed to other young people who enjoyed science and it wasn't seen as weird, you know to do that.
Speaker 2: Now were, were your interests, do you think your interests were considered weird by your peers in those days?
Speaker 1: No, not weird.  I don't think they were weird.  I mean one of my peers was Gertrude Branson, whose father was head of the physics department at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].
Speaker 2: That's Herman Branson.
Speaker 1: Herman Branson, so and Gertrude died this past summer.  But not all the, not all the kids in our group were into science fair projects.  But having each other and going to those meetings made it kind of, you know, special.  And then seeing, seeing kids who were very serious.  One young woman who always won the national prize, had terrible allergies, so she did all of her projects on research, on allergies.  Which is just astounding to me.  I didn't have any of that in my world, so--
Speaker 2: With the allergies or any--the whole--
Speaker 1: I didn't have the, the concept of you can pick a problem and work on it and study it and try to understand it and get to the core and make recommendations, come up with hypotheses and reach conclusions and you know, that kind of dogged determination to solve a problem in an area of science was a new experience for me.  So the science fair was broadening and participating cause once you're a member of the Junior Academy, then you had to help put on the sci--the city-wide science fair so you had to help set up, hostess, all the--those kinds of activities.
Speaker 2: So let me just, okay now, now being--your proximity to Howard put you in touch with--you said your best friend's father, Dr. Herman Branson [physicist and chemist who worked on the alpha helix protein structure] who's a scientist and he became the president of Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] later on and some other things.
Speaker 1: Right of Lincoln [University, Chester County, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Central too, he was president of Central State in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I know him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But he--so you got a lot of, you got like the Howard Medical School over there, you got like physics department over there and chemistry department over--did, I mean so black scientists were in the community.  Were you aware of, of--
Speaker 1: No, no, not only that.  I mean it's interesting you, you ask that question because I began--I mean yesterday I was thinking about what did I know about careers?  I knew nothing about careers.  I knew nothing about what people did with science.  I, I mean I went all through high school not knowing what you could do and my thought was I'll become a doctor.  I'll be a pediatrician.  It wasn't until I was probably halfway through college or three quarters of the way through college before it occurred to me you might be able to do something else with this, you know.  You have this--but it, it took a lot.  It was probably my senior year before I found that there was something I enjoyed doing enough right within the science itself to pursue it.  But that was pretty, pretty late in the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And also we didn't have any--unlike now where you have bridge programs, you have programs in the summer that are science rich.  The only thing I had was the [Washington] Junior Academy [of Sciences].  And the Junior Academy would arrange for us to visit science rich places in the summer.  I saw my first cadaver on a, on a trip to--was it GW's [George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia] Medical School with the Washington Junior Academy of Sciences.  Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, they took us on a trip there and where they have a--they still have it, an icon.  It's a giant model of the heart that you can walk through and feel the beats and go through the, the various segments of the heart, auricles and ventricles.  So I would say probably more than anything, the Junior Academy served as my support system.  But I didn't have any, any mentors in science per se.
Speaker 2: So you were able to get involved in the Junior Academy because of the teacher at Banneker?
Speaker 1: Because of the science fair.
Speaker 2: Science fair, okay.
Speaker 1: I had--I got awards for two of my projects and so that then meant I guess you're invited to join the academy or something like--or maybe the teacher recommended, I don't know.  Fortunately, the teacher had great faith in me.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is the one at Banneker [Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 1: At Banneker.
Story_ID: 25292
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so now we were at this point and then we backtracked to pick up the rest of the school.  But when you were in the ninth grade, Brown vs. the Board [of Education; U.S. Supreme Court decision ruling for desegregation of schools] was announced, right?  And, and D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia] at least on paper, was supposed to integrate the schools the next, the following year, right.  I guess to set a tone for the rest of the country.
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Of what deliberate speed could be.
Speaker 2: I have no idea what--I mean I wasn't interested in the politics.  I was fourteen [years old].  I just wanted to walk to that school, that big, pretty school around the corner.
Speaker 1: Did any of your girl--girlfriends want to go there too?
Speaker 2: No, my, my whole circle stayed at Dunbar [High School].  I made new friends once I went to Roosevelt [High School].
Speaker 1: Now you had implied that these were tough years, three years at Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now so what, what was tough about being the only black student?
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't the only black student, there was sixty of us.
Speaker 1: Sixty.
Speaker 2: Sixty, I think there was sixty, maybe there weren't sixty but in the end there were.  I, somehow I think there were a sizable enough number.  Maybe there weren't sixty, cause that would have been a pretty large segment of the tenth grade class.  But let's say by the end of my first semester there, I had at least twenty-five black friends, some of whom had gone to [Banneker] junior high school with me and were in my homeroom and I knew them, but most of whom I had not known but we were--we, we figured out how to coalesce pretty quickly.  The first day we were there, I was so excited.  One of my friends and I, we were excited because there was a sign-up that said come to the Harvest Ball.  So that night on the phone we talked about what we were going to wear.  Well the next morning the sign was gone, all the signs about the Harvest Ball were gone.  So we asked this one black girl who had been there from the beginning of the school year because she'd come from outside of D.C., she transferred from another city.  We asked her what happened to the Harvest Ball signs?  And she said well the day before we came, the principal called an assembly of all the students and she said we don't like it, but we have to let them come here.  She was talking about us.  And there'll be no social activities from this day forward.  So we had three years of high school with no social events that were school sponsored.
Speaker 1: Of course this didn't endear you in the minds of the other students because of your presence, there's no social activities.
Speaker 2: And actually I'd have to say that I do not remember any problems with any students.  It was the faculty.  And not every faculty member.  But the faculty--there were--if you think about having a principal who sets that kind of tone, then you can imagine how people lined up behind her to stay in her--how the faculty would line up behind her to stay in her good graces, you know.  Of course we don't want them here.
Story_ID: 25293
Speaker 1: She [principal of Roosevelt High School, Washington, District of Columbia]--at the end of the--I guess we'd been there a year when she was--I don't know whether she volunteered or was called to testify before the McClellan Committee [United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management] on school desegregation in Washington, D.C.  And she testified--I'm going to back up a minute before I tell you her testimony.  Before we went into that school, our parents pulled us together and said to us you are representing the black race, the Negro race.  You will conduct yourselves accordingly.  Now mind you, we'd come out of Banneker so we knew how to behave.  So this woman went to [U.S.] Congress and testified that we urinated in the halls, we wrote on the walls, we spat on the floors.  I'm sure you can find in the Congressional record.  It was reported in the 'Evening Star', which was the evening newspaper.  That would have been my second year there because by that time I was on the Student Council.  And of course that morning we had a Student Council meeting.  And I was very quiet, as I said I'm an introvert.  I was very quiet.  I never said anything in meetings.  But that morning the Student Council president said we need to give our principal a vote of confidence.  So somebody said what for?  And she said because she testified on the [Capitol] Hill.  And somewhere from inside of me came a voice.  I never knew I had a voice.  I just couldn't believe.  And I said I am sorry, I don't see how we can give a vote of confidence when many of us black, negro, colored children, are very upset at what she said because it's not true.  And everybody got very quiet and there was one guy in the back of the room who had moved there from Arizona and he said DeAnna is right.  And it took me until last year to process what happened in my life after that day in that school.  By that time I had already been elected as the first black student in the National Honor Society there.  And it wasn't so much I wanted to be in the Honor Society as it was I loved the ceremony.  When I first--my first year there when I saw what the induction was like, it was just an incredible induction ceremony in which the whole student body gets involved in.  And I said I'm going to be the first kid in there, first black kid in there.  But anyway, so I was already in the Honor Society, but the wheels of that administration were so angry, the admin--the Student Council leader, you know, advisor and the pri--and she must have told the principal what I had said.  And it took me till last year to put all the pieces together cause I could never understand how things changed so dramatically for me at that school.  But it was probably that particular experience.  So needless to say, we didn't give her a vote of confidence.  And needless to say, they set about sabotaging much of my future endeavors, scholarship opportunities.  I think I wanted to go to Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts].  My mother [Buena Vista Marie Williams] later found out that they were giving--whenever anybody inquired about me, they were giving them information--I graduated fifth in my class, they were giving them information that was wrong about my status in the school.  So anyway I, I finished and graduated and moved on.  My sister [Sharon Percellyn Banks] in that same school two years later, was a very different person.  She enjoyed her high school years.  She did not care what they expected of her and when it was time for her to graduate, my father went to the school and asked for her transcripts.  And the vice principal said she's not college material.  And my father [Howard Percell Banks] said--no, we don't recommend her for college.  My father said that's not your problem, just give me the transcripts, I'll take care of it.  And I tell people that story because my sister, at the time I first decided to tell a group of educators that story, my sister was Dean of Students at Howard's [University, Washington, D.C.] Law School.  You know, and so that whole idea of you can--as an educator you think you can decide a child's future and close doors is so erroneous.  My sister probably had a healthier school experience than I did because she didn't internalize any of the craziness, you know of, of the--and not all teachers were that way.  Many years later I met Mrs. Blackburn who was the--I mean I met her again.  I had known her in high school.  She was a history teacher.  She was the wife of Armour Blackburn for whom Howard University's Armour Center, I mean Blackburn Center is named.  And Mrs. Blackburn said to me, this is probably about fifteen years ago, she said DeAnna you have no idea how hard we worked.  There were about a few black--two black teachers that first year, how hard we worked to try to protect you all.  She said it was incredible.  And I think, I think she was right.  So that's why I say those are the three years of life--about thirty years ago I ran into somebody who'd been in, in the first year of school desegregation at Roosevelt [High School] with me.  And I said Roosevelt and she started crying.  This is a grown woman.  You know she was in her forties and just the word Roosevelt, and she told me, she said I couldn't stay, I had to leave after the first year.
Story_ID: 25294
Speaker 1: But I had a wonderful biology teacher there [Roosevelt High School, Washington, District of Columbia], Mrs. Segal.
Speaker 2: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 1: Segal.
Speaker 2: Segal.
Speaker 1: Bernie Segal.
Speaker 2: S-E-G-A-L?
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: Or S-E-I-G-A-L, one of those, okay.
Speaker 1: I don't remember.
Speaker 2: All right, okay, she taught biology.
Speaker 1: She taught biology, she was fair, she was from New York.  She was fair, she encouraged us, she encouraged our interests, she encouraged me to be her, her lab assistant when I had a, you know my one free period where I could have taken something else, I worked for her.  But she encouraged my interest in biology.  You know I went on to eventually become a zoo major, zoology major in college.  But she was an excellent teacher and treated us all fairly.
Story_ID: 25295
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were graduating from [Roosevelt] high school in what, '58 [1958]?  Now this is--
Speaker 2: Or fifty, no I graduated '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah, from '54 [1954] to '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay 1957.  When was Little Rock [Arkansas; school integration]?  Was that--that was around '57 [1957], wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Probably, probably.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just wondering--so many things in Montgomery [Alabama].  Bus boycott was going on, Little Rock Nine, all that was hitting around the same time.
Speaker 2: The first days of, of desegregation in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia], that first week my father [Howard Percell Banks] had to come and get me out of the school, you know, crowds were forming around the schools.  But it was nothing like the craziness in Little Rock, but he just left his school and came and got me because he heard through the system that there were crowds forming.  But we never had the--at least I wasn't aware of the problems that places like Little Rock had.
Speaker 1: Now by the time you graduated, was there a significant black population in the school?
Speaker 2: I--yeah, I mean I don't know what significant is.  I would say I don't think the school was anymore than 30 percent black, but maybe, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know as kids you don't pay attention to things like that.
Speaker 1: I think there's a--I guess I mean by significant I think this just from hearing a lot of these stories.  I've heard a lot of them and observed some of them, you know that there's a certain mass--once the black people reach a certain mass--
Speaker 2: Critical mass.
Speaker 1: The--those who are trying to get rid of you, stop cause there's no, no use anymore.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: There's no use.
Speaker 2: I don't know when that critical mass was reached at Roosevelt because I never went back.  I never went back for anything.  I never went, I never went to any reunions until a year ago.  And I went to a reunion because a girlfriend called and said you're retired now, let's go to a reunion.  And believe it or not when I got to the reunion, I said where are the black people?  They were like five of us there.  And then I realized that what the principal had done in keeping us apart socially had carried throughout our lives.  So the black kids, black alum have their reunions, and the white alum have their reunions.  Whereas if she had encouraged us to become friends and know each other, we would, you know reunite at the--you know as one body.  So I think it was our loss as a whole in terms of developing the social skills and awareness and appreciating diversity.  But the--because of the tone that she set in the school.
Story_ID: 25296
Speaker 1: All right so at the time you were, you were on the verge of graduation [from Roosevelt High School, Washington, District of Columbia], did you have any--not that you needed it because I think your parents [Buena Vista Marie Williams and Howard Percell Banks] already knew what to do in terms of getting you into college, but did you have any counseling at all from the school?
Speaker 2: From that school?  No, they didn't even tell us what the SAT [Scholastic Assessment Test] was.  They just told us go take this test.  I'm saying well what do we have to--it's required.  Here are the forms.  I had no clue and my parents went to school before there was the SAT, so and I don't know if it was called SAT, but basically it served the purpose of that.  It wasn't on--
Speaker 1: So you had no sense of the importance of it or what it was for.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  And as I--I had been given the Radcliffe Book Award as a junior, but in my senior year, I wasn't interested in Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  For some reason I was interested in Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts].  My sister [Sharon Percellyn Banks] says I got admitted to Wellesley, I don't even remember.  I just have no clue because my parents said if you don't get a full scholarship, we can't send you.  So it was moot.  And Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] gave me a full scholarship.  I knew they were going to send me to Howard no matter what, you know, they would see that I got to go to Howard, so I got a scholarship to Howard and that's where I went.
Story_ID: 25297
Speaker 1: Okay, all right Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia], this is 1950--
Speaker 2: Seven, '57 [1957]
Speaker 1: '57 [1957], okay, '57 [1957] at Howard.  Now, now you're pretty familiar with Howard I guess, having gone to school [Banneker Junior High School] across the street, but well I guess--well tell, tell us about your experience at Howard.
Speaker 2: You get as a freshman, they have freshman week and you get to stay in the dorm, which was a new experience for me because I was going to live at home.  I did not permanently stay in the dorm.  I fell in love my freshman year, which then doesn't make a very normal freshman year for you.  What else?
Speaker 1: Now did, I mean did it work out all right, this falling in love?
Speaker 2: For twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Good, that's the kind of falling in love that most people need.
Speaker 2: Well no, probably it lasted for, with some work maybe eighteen or twenty years with some work, took a lot of work.  One of the things that I found interesting when I got to Howard was they do English Placement Exams.  So they would place, I don't know if they still do it, it's a good idea.  They would place you in your freshman English class according to how you scored on the English Placement Exam.  And what surprised me was that I placed in the highest level, whereas some of my friends who didn't go to Roosevelt [High School, Washington, D.C.], didn't place at that level, they were a level below me.  Now inasmuch as what I remembered best about [Banneker] junior high school [Washington, D.C.], one of the things was the really strong English teachers and background that we got and I have very little memory of, of excellence in English teaching at Roosevelt.  But I must have learned enough to place, you know, where I did.  And Howard, you know many of your freshman year courses--in fact the liberal arts program was pretty rigid.  So you may have taken, you know, a course in your major, but you had so many requirements in the, you know in the humanities and social science and all of those the first couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so even though you were--had you declared a--were you a science major?  Okay, so you were majoring in what aspect of science?
Speaker 2: Originally I was majoring in chemistry and by the time I got to organic chemistry, I knew I'd better get out of chemistry because I was having difficulty and I did not want my, my average to drop.  And so I switched to zoology and my minor became allied sciences, which means I took botany and physics and chemistry and a number of zoology courses or courses in the Zoo Building.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had to take a lot of liberal arts courses first, the first two years.
Speaker 2: No, it seems as though it--that's the way it is now.  They just had this curriculum that everybody had to make sure they, they took.  I mean so you had to take so much--we had a year of social science and the U--Columbia University's [New York] books, History of Western Civilization, I think that's what it was called.  Two, two books per semester, very thick books.  But they had readings.  So what you were doing, you were learning the history of western civilization through the historical presentation, but also through the writings of the philosophers and the leaders of, of those periods.  So it was a really deep grounding in western civilization.  And the second year everybody had to take humanities, so you read endless works.  Interestingly enough, all of them veered to western civilization, European, you know, writers.

Speaker 1: Now your father [Howard Percell Banks] had done, he was a student at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  Were any of his teachers--did any of his teachers teach you?
Speaker 2: No, but one day my father--I asked him to go with me to a, a lecture my freshman year and I think C. Wright Mills [sociologist] was lecturing, the man who wrote 'The Power Elite'.  But anyway we were walking into the chapel where the lecture was being held and bumped into Harold Lewis.  And my father said Professor Lewis, how are you?  And they greeted one another.  I had no idea whether Harold Lewis remembered my father or not.  And when my father said how are you?  He said I'm doing well considering the vicissitudes of life.  And I had to find out from him what is vicissitudes?  What is that he's got?  So I never--I was really not interested in history.  I fell asleep in U.S. History.  It has always bored me, and bored me at Howard too.  And that was probably my junior year or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, was any, any black history being taught on occasion at all?  Cause--
Speaker 2: My--the, the man I married was a history major and a French minor.  And he studied--I cant even remember, was it Hansberry, it was Hansberry.
Speaker 1: William Leo Hansberry, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He studied under him and I remember one day I was waiting for him in the hallway outside of his classroom, and he came out and he said I now know the name of our first daughter.  And I said well what is that?  And he said Songhay [ph.] because he had just heard about this Songhay Kingdom and the Songhay empire in North Africa.  But I never took any African history classes, so--
Speaker 1: So did your child--did you have a child named Songhay?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now in the song he wrote, William Leo Hansberry [scholar and songwriter], tribe of African, studies of African History and the first one to do it on a black school, you know--
Speaker 2: Solid scholar, solid, yeah.
Speaker 1: And now there was a theologian Howard Thurman was there, E. Franklin Frazier, you know the place is filled with people, Sterling Brown, I don't know, Lorraine--
Speaker 2: Williams.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: My father had a course under Just, Ernest [Everett] Just [biologist], and it appeared, if I remember correctly, Just himself found it beneath him to actually teach the course, but had somebody else.  He would come in, that had somebody else, you know, doing a lot of the work.  And my father remembered going to hear George Washington Carver [scientist] speak.  And he said the thing that surprised him the most was he had a very high pitched voice, very high pitched, tiny voice.  So yeah there were great people at Howard and at--it was an interesting time, Leo Ferguson.
Speaker 1: Dr. Lloyd Ferguson?
Speaker 2: Lloyd Ferguson [also a HistoryMaker].
Speaker 1: Yeah, right he just passed last year.
Speaker 2: I didn't know he'd passed.  He said to me see how easy it is to get into organic?  Now watch how hard it is to get out.  Freaked me out, freaked me out.  He was excellent.  I graduated just deciding to get out of the organic thing, as I said before.  When I graduated, I went to American U [University, Washington, D.C.] and enrolled in organic there.  And the teacher almost every day referred to Lloyd Ferguson as the authority in the field; so interesting.
Speaker 1: And you know the story is they said he integrated the South even though he never went there himself cause it--they were using his textbook but they didn't know he--it was written by him.
Speaker 2: Interesting, yeah, yeah I can believe that, I can believe that.  And we had to use his textbook, but it was in mimeograph form then.  It had not been published so yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a scary teacher you're saying?
Speaker 2: Actually he wasn't scary.  I mean and that--I guess he thought it was funny.  It just wasn't funny to me because I was already terrified and then my difficulty in chemistry I think stemmed from never having really had chemistry before high school.  And being--and so I had no concept, I had never heard of an atom or a molecule until eleventh, twelfth, grade.  And I mean I guess I, you know seen--I never had any concept of a system.  And I remember in, in chemistry class in high school my girlfriend and I said to a couple of the white kids, have you all seen this stuff before, and they said yeah.  Where'd you see it?  Well we had it in seventh grade at McFarland.  That's when I knew boy, I'm in trouble because I had so much--I could never do the catching up because I needed to be able to think conceptually, not memory.  But I needed to be able to conceptualize the ideas and then I'd be able to hold on to the facts.
Story_ID: 25299
Speaker 1: Who was your advisor I guess in zoology [at Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I had an advisor.
Speaker 1: Or who was the major?
Speaker 2: David Ray was, I think Ray was head of the department.  I think his name was Ray, he was a nice gentleman.  And then Harvey Clark, Mr. Clark, he and, and they taught it together.  The General Zoo classes.  I can't remember who I had for physiology.
Speaker 1: Do you remember W. Montague Cobb?
Speaker 2: He was in the medical school.
Speaker 1: Right, I think he taught like anatomy and other things--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't have any classes under him, but I certainly did remember his name, yeah.  And his daughter, I think she was probably Amelia was the--probably a year ahead of me, yeah.  Of the zoology courses I had, the one that really excited me was one that I was failing until I just said let me dig into this for myself.  And it was cytology, the study of cells.  And that was just really exciting.  I probably would have--if I had known of a career path into research, I would have taken it.
Speaker 1: But now you were saying that you didn't have any idea of these career paths, but did your teachers not even, not ever discuss like what you could do with zoology other than use it as a pre-medical course?
Speaker 2: I never heard any of those discussions, or maybe I wasn't paying attention.  The one person who did--I have, I took a course in botany under Marie Taylor, she was head of the botany department.  And she told us a very interesting story about being--the Police Department contacted her and asked her to come over to a corner a couple of blocks from Howard's campus.  That they wanted her to identify some plants that were growing.  And she got there and found pot growing on the corner.  And I thought gee that's really fascinating, but usually you didn't--I don't remember, they may have talked about careers, I just don't remember it.  And I think because a lot of us were thinking in terms of medical school, that's why we were down there in the valley.  You know that was what we were going to do, so the career stuff, you know.  But by the time I had been a year or so out of Howard, I knew I wasn't going to medical school.
Story_ID: 25300
Speaker 1: So what, what turned you off from medical school?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well I got married at the end of my second year [at Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] and by the end of my third year, I had my first child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but I was determined I was going to finish college if I had to drag that baby to every class.  Because I had to prove my parents [Buena Vista Marie Williams and Harold Percell Banks] wrong.  They felt I would never finish school if I got married and had a child.  By the time I had been married even less than a year, no probably it was after the first year and we had the child.  And we agreed that with a family, I would stay home and raise the children, I would not try to go to school.  So this was before the women's lib [liberation] days.  And mind you, that was not my mother's philosophy, but this was what my husband and I decided.  And that I wouldn't try to do medical school.  At that point he had decided he wanted to go to graduate school.  So, and he wanted to go into--he was a minister so we had already been assigned a church and he was pasturing.
Speaker 1: What kind of minister was he?
Speaker 2: United Methodist, or Methodist Episcopal then.  And so by the end of--by my third year in college, I was a mother, a student and a minister's wife.  So trying to figure out how I was going to do medical school was getting increasingly difficult.  And then when he decided to apply you know to graduate schools, then you know I just shifted.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so did you, so did you finish--okay, so you, you finished Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] in '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: The year behind my class.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause you--
Speaker 2: Cause I had the child.  I missed a semester and had to take fewer classes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you decided you wouldn't pursue--
Speaker 2: Medical school.
Speaker 1: Okay, medical school.
Speaker 2: Well I didn't decide that really for sure until I had enrolled in American U [University, Washington, D.C.] and I started organic in American U.  And was preg--became pregnant with my second child and had to drop the lab.  Organic labs were toxic in those days.  And I didn't realize how toxic, but I was becoming sick so after a stint of illness, then the teacher and I decided I should just, you know, drop the lab.  But it was at that point I realized medical school was going to be impossible.
Story_ID: 25301
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't get back to graduate school until the '70s [1970s], right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I waited until he [Beane's husband] had finished his graduate work and then I started.  And by this time we had moved to New Jersey where he had taken a job.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--it says here that you taught at a New Jersey middle school.
Speaker 2: Well what I did was when he applied for graduate school, he was accepted at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], which is where he wanted to go.  So we moved to Chicago and after that first--probably after we'd been there about three years, the baby was about three [years old].  I enrolled him in a nursery school and I began teaching, no wait, no that's--I know.  During those first two or three years what happened was there was a period when I moved back here to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] and stayed with my parents [Buena Vista Marie Williams and Harold Percell Banks], I had the children with me, stayed with my parents and that was where I got exposed to teaching.  A friend of my mother's called.  She was looking for a math and science teacher.  She was the principal of a special project school for pregnant teens.  And I said well I don't know anything about teaching.  She said sure you do.  And she said it's just for the semester.  I tried it and I loved it, I loved it.  I'm trying to remember.  At first when she called I had already gotten a job in the [unclear] pathology lab of the dental school at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And I was working with cells and I was learning to identify cancerous tissue from the mouth.  But it was so boring.  There were no people.  And so when she called and it was the same salary, but I would be off at the same days that my children were off for holidays.  I said I'll take it.  And I just loved it.  The--it was--that, that's when I learned that you can love science and enjoy just sharing it with others and helping to build an interest in others.  And those girls taught me so much because I was so new.  It, it was a wonderful experience.  No equipment, no facilities, the girls said Ms. Beane this is boring, can't we do something?  Cause I'm using the textbook.  That's all we had.  I said we don't have any equipment.  She said can't we cut up something?  And I said like what?  We don't have any equipment.  She said well I can stop at the fish market tomorrow and bring some fish heads.  I said but we don't have any dissecting kits.  And she said I can bring a butcher knife.  I said never mind, you bring the fish heads and I'll find the equipment.  And that was the beginning of hands-on science for me.  That was the beginning.  Those girls taught me that and they taught me how valuable enrichment experiences are outside of school.  We would walk down to the Smithsonian [museums] on holidays so that they could get the museum experience and see, you know, the objects, the collections, the--you know just have those experiences, so--in, in that one semester we had a great time.
Speaker 1: They actually told you what was happening, this is boring, let's go.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So as a science educator, I think this is like--of course I've heard a lot of science educators say this, a lot of people say this.  You need to do something.
Speaker 2: Right.  But see I hadn't had any education courses at that point.  Remember all my courses were in you know, liberal arts preparing me to think about medical school.  So I had no clue.  I had taught young children at my mother's nursery school, but I wasn't teaching them science.  So--
Speaker 1: Is it really so important for students, I mean not just, I mean--can, can good students sit and listen to a lecture in science and not have to do anything?  Is that, is that okay for them?
Speaker 2: I think it depends upon your learning style.  I think--and that's one of the things that teachers have to be cognizant of.  There are some children who will happily absorb like sponges from a book or from a lecture.  But many of our children need to be physically involved in their learning.  And when you neglect that, you lose them, you just lose them.  And being physically involved in your learning I think gives you the opportunity to experiment a little bit.  What happens if I don't do it this way, but I do it that way?  You know so you become more in charge of your learning.  Even if you have a set of directions you're supposed to be following.  But yeah, no I--John Dewey [philosopher, psychologist and educational reformer] said learn by doing, and I think he's right.  And, and fortunately those young ladies taught me that because then after that I went back to take education courses and science teaching methods courses.  But they gave me my grounding.
Story_ID: 25302
Speaker 1: Okay, now when were you at American University [Washington, District of Columbia]?  When did you go?  Was that, that when you were still in--before you went to New Jersey, or--
Speaker 2: Right after Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in September of '62 [1962] I was, you know, taking organic chemistry at American for that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you go to the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: No, my baby was, my baby was--he was, he wasn't six weeks old, he wasn't a month old.  So I couldn't go.  My former husband went.  So I was not able--we were glued to the television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a big event.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you were, okay about the same year doc--JFK [President John F. Kennedy] was shot.
Speaker 2: That November.  We had--we were in the car driving through Indiana on our way to Chicago [Illinois], moving with the babies and the, all the stuff when we heard on the radio about the bombing in Birmingham [Alabama] and the little girls being bombed, that Sunday.
Speaker 1: I guess that's September.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then that November--
Speaker 1: '63 [1963], then November JFK was shot, right, okay.  So, so in Chicago, so you, you left Chicago while, while your husband was still in school.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: To come back to [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then--and so during that time that's when I started out working in the lab and then switched to teaching.  And so when we went back to Chicago, then I applied for a position in the school for pregnant teenagers there because I'd already had the experience.  And Chicago was desperate for teachers at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your husband complete his, his graduate degree at University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes, he completed his doctorate.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I guess in theology?
Speaker 2: History of religions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess Chicago was where the activist in me began to emerge.  No I guess it emerged before then.  Hadn't thought about it but when we lived in Arlington, that was during the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement.  And Arlington, Virginia was very segregated.  That's where our church was, very segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay, now wait a minute.  I want to try to follow chronology.  I'm not sure where--so after you left Chicago, after he got his Ph.D. [degree] in Chicago, you all moved to New Jersey first?
Speaker 2: Yes, but what I want to say is I missed a piece of life.  I don't know if it's, if it doesn't matter.  I mean we can leave it out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When, when I was--those years when I was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and I was a minister's wife, our church was in Arlington, Virginia.  So we were there four years.  And in that four years, the Civil Rights Movement came to Arlington.  And we were asked what do you want to change in your community?  I can't remember if it was my husband's influence or what, but the group decided we want the movie theaters open to our children.  And so that's what we did.  You know we picketed and demonstrated.  And the American Nazis party had its headquarters about a half a mile down on Lee Highway from our church.
Speaker 1: Now this is led by the infamous George Lincoln Rockwell.
Speaker 2: Rockwell, yes.  I had the pleasure of being tormented by him and his Nazis.  They would picket opposite us with signs that said Niggers go back to Africa and all sorts of things.  And then the state legislature in Virginia passed a law saying picketing was illegal.  And we decided to test it.  I'm trying to remember if we were working with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], I cannot remember, it was one of the two.
Speaker 1: So do you--now this would have been in 196--what?
Speaker 2: '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Two, okay, now I'm, I'm wondering if--now who actually came to Arlington to represent the movement?  Was it someone from--is that what you're trying to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was either SNCC or CORE, and I--
Speaker 1: I'm thinking it sounds like CORE to me, but I don't--
Speaker 2: Okay, I, I just cannot remember.  They asked what is it we wanted to change.  And once we told them, then they told us the strategy.  And the thing that I was trying to remember was who helped us.  I was arrested.  They had--we had to pick a couple of people from the community to test the new law.  And they decided the minister's wife would be a good candidate.  She had some credibility.  And there were a couple of us, another woman and I think two or three men.  And so we were arrested while we were picketing, treated very kindly by the police.  Fingerprint--taken to the station and fingerprinted, all of that.  And the, the organization that was helping us said don't worry, we'll have a good lawyer.  And I, I'm drawing a blank on his name.
Story_ID: 25303
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a labor lawyer, well known man.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But we didn't know that.  I didn't know how famous or well known he was at the time.
Speaker 1: And this was a white person.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was a wonderful white gentleman and, and I was still in La La Land thinking oh well, this is not a big thing.  Now mind you, I should back up and say the day we were arrested, it was in the newspapers and all night long we got hate phone calls.  My parents [Buena Vista Marie Williams and Howard Percell Banks] had not known anything of my activities up to that point.  So they get to find out that I've been to jail by reading the Washington [District of Columbia] newspapers, although I'm just across the river.  I just hadn't filled them in on those details.  So we, we go to court and we're in court and the judge decides to continue the case, but he says to us that we could have up to a year in jail if we're found guilty.  Well I was stunned.  I had not realized that that would be the consequence of my action.  And I remember the, the lawyer saying.  He took my hand, he said don't worry, mother, you won't--because I have this young baby at home.  You won't be away from your baby.  You won't go to jail.  And true to his word, when we went back--and he told us, he said no judge wants to issue a ruling that will be overturned on appeal.  And that law is unconstitutional.  It infringes on your freedom of speech, that anti-picketing law.  And sure enough when we went back, it was, you know, we were released and the theaters were open to the kids.  And I never went to a movie theater there.  I never saw a movie, but--so that was my, my entre into activism.  So moving to Chicago [Illinois], things are speeding up in the Civil Rights Movement.  So there were many more opportunities to become involved between that and then later the Peace Movement.
Speaker 1: So were you involved in the Civil Rights Movement in Chicago?
Speaker 2: In Chicago I was involved in, you know obviously the marches.  But testing for open housing and a white friend and I would go into a real estate office after a white couple had gone in.  So, I mean we were all working together.  They would go in and request an apartment, or they would come after us.  We would, we would go in first and request an apartment.  And then we'd be denied.  And then they would go in and request an apartment and they would be, you know, their application would be reviewed and they were promised some follow-up.  So that was the way we identified communities to be targeted for Martin Luther King's work when he came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now the organization--and there's one that still exists in Chicago, at least it did when I lived there about five years ago, a venerable organization in downtown Chicago that does, that still does that.
Speaker 2: Wow, they still have to do that?
Speaker 1: And I think 20/20 even did a segment--
Speaker 2: I missed it.
Speaker 1: --on this where they had like a white guy and a black guy who both have similar--
Speaker 2: They're still doing that.
Speaker 1: Similar backgrounds, sent them in--about the same result.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The black was charged more for a car, more for an apartment.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Or was denied the keys to the apartment.  It's--followed in a store where the white guy can go where he wants.  It's a, you know it's still--
Speaker 2: Well I think that's everywhere, I know it's here.  The, the following in the store thing.  But for Chicago it was just a very exciting time to be living in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, you remember Bill Berry?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't--I really, I really don't remember any of the people's names.
Speaker 1: But you were involved in the housing agitation primarily.  I mean around the fair housing.
Speaker 2: That and then to some extent the schools, you know concerned about the schools, but not that much.  I remember with the housing thing there were protests, you know, trying to get Mayor [Richard] Daley to give some attention to the conditions in, in some of the public housing and--
Speaker 1: Right.  I know the Contract Buyer's League in Chicago--
Speaker 2: That part, I didn't know about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah it was a lot of [unclear] Chicago.
Speaker 2: Hyde Park was a great place to live because no matter what issue you wanted to get involved in, there were other people, you know working on it, so--
Speaker 1: Now the school Superintendent, Ben Willis was in trouble.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Willis Wagons and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was at that time he may have gone by the time I--when I moved back to Chicago [Illinois] I applied for a job in the school system with pregnant teenagers.  And they had an opening and assigned me as a temporary teacher because I didn't have any of the courses.  And so that was when I began taking education courses and methods courses.
Speaker 1: So where did you go to school there to take courses?
Speaker 2: I think at one point I went to three schools at one time.
Speaker 1: Chicago Teachers College, or--
Speaker 2: And Loop College and a TV [television] college, I took a course by TV.  I did, you know cause I wanted to get past that--I wanted certification.  I don't even think some of, some of the schools have changed names in the interim.
Speaker 1: [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College is now Kennedy King [College].  Did you take courses there?
Speaker 2: I don't even think they had the--was that school there then?
Speaker 1: Wilson Junior College was there.
Speaker 2: I didn't know about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah Chicago Teachers College.
Speaker 2: That's the one.  That's where most of them were taken.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, so you're in Chicago through I guess now--
Speaker 2: I think I left in '60 [1960], maybe '69 [1969].  I think we left the year Martin Luther King was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay, '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: '68 [1968], or maybe it was the year, maybe it was a year later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so six, you think it's '69 [1969].  So you were in Chicago when Dr. [Martin Luther] King was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were living in Hyde Park [neighborhood in Chicago], that's not where the, the riots took place on the West, West Side where they burned up great portions of Madison Street.
Speaker 2: Well that's because they had [U.S.] Army tanks on our corners with guns, driving through, rolling through Hyde Park, yeah, yeah.  It was terrifying.
Speaker 1: Did you hear Dr. King speak when he came there in '60 [1960]--were you there, were you there in '66 [1966] when he spoke?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah and when he would leave marches.  Once they turned violent, my former husband was very opposed to participating.  You know when people started throwing things.  You know King was hit with a brick in Cicero.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: And that was a march--we actually had an argument about my going.  And he said under no circumstances could I take our children, which I'm glad I didn't go.  But my, my friends who you know were my partners in this, they both went.  I think the wife was hurt but not the husband.
Story_ID: 25304
Speaker 1: All right so '69 [1969] you came--did you come back to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: No, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: New Jersey, all right now it's New Jersey.  And that's where, where you finished your, finished your master's [degree] at Rutgers [University, New Brunswick, New Jersey], right?  In education.
Speaker 2: Right, Urban Education to be specific.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they were actually focusing on what urban children needed in science because it was a science education program that I went through.  It was very good.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any teachers there or mentors that you remember that stand out?
Speaker 2: At Rutgers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mike Pieburn [ph.] and George Pallrand.  I think Mike was a geologist.  In fact I know it was cause I took a course under him called 'The Geology of the Moon and the Planets'.  And George, I wasn't sure--well both of them must have been scientists because they had actually developed a curriculum called 'Time, Space and Matter'.  But they were good.
Speaker 1: And the other one was George?
Speaker 2: Mike Pieburn and George Pallrand.  I think it's P-A-L-L-R-A-N-D.
Story_ID: 25305
Speaker 1: So what did you do after you got your [master's in urban education] degree [at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey] in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Well leading up to that point because I didn't, I didn't start school right away when we moved to New Jersey.  I actually had, had to figure out how to get my children grounded in a new community.  And one of the things I did when I found out they couldn't eat lunch in school, which meant I couldn't find a job cause I had to be home every day to give them lunch, was to work with a couple of other moms to start 'Parents for Progress' which we actually got a 501c3 [non-profit] status from the state of New Jersey for.  And convinced the school system to let us hold a lunch program in the school building during the day.  By the end of the first year, the school system said never mind, we'll take over.  The kids can eat lunch in school.  So that--but in the process, I learned that in that middle class, upper middle class community of Highland Park, there were families, parents who called me to say please let my child eat lunch in school because I think you could feed him more, better than I can.  I don't have much money.  So that's when I learned that even in that community there were poor people and their needs were not being met.  Later while I was living there, I helped revive a community organization called 'The Community Betterment Association'.  You know when we were talking about the geographical segregation in towns, well all the black people, or most of the black people lived on the south side.  I guess that was the--well one side of town.  And so in that--in the community, our community was very small there.  And we formed a, an organization to kind of take on some of the issues around our children and our children's wellbeing which was a terrific experience.  It was great training for me in terms of community organizing and learning what it meant to be in a community where most people didn't have a voice and didn't know how to get one.  And we went to see a community organizer, a great one over in New Brunswick.  His name was Kwame McDonald.  And we said you know nobody comes out.  It's about five of us.  We're trying to, you know, change some things in town.  And he said if you have five, that's enough.  And he said just get the agreement from the rest of the community that when you need them, they'll back you up.  It was terrific.  It was wonderful advice because he said generally with an establishment, if the establishment sees five of you show up at a meeting, to them that's an army.  So you know we were able to be advocates for the children in that community and do some things and when the community was slapped with a desegregation order because the schools were segregated the way--because the residential patterns were so locked in, in terms of low income and people of color living on one side of town and upper income living on the other that when we put out the call, the community turned up and we met in somebody's basement and came up with a strategy to keep from closing the school in our community, but making sure we had diverse experiences for our children, you know at the middle school levels.  So it was interesting.  It was interesting, I was appointed to the Board of Education.  Served a, a stint there.  Decided not to run when the, you know when the election time was up.  So all of that was on the civic side, and at the same time then I was pursuing graduate school and teaching part time and then full time teaching.
Speaker 1: What would be the name of this Board of Education?
Speaker 2: Highland Park.
Speaker 1: Highland Park.
Speaker 2: Board, Board of Education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is before you finished your education, all this was going on, before and during, or--
Speaker 2: Graduation?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is, this is before or during 19--that you got your degree in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Mo--the, the first part.  Part of it happened before.  The Parents For Progress happened before cause I had to be able to get out the house.  So Parents For Progress happened before, and then I started substituting in the schools there in Highland Park so I could get a, a feel for schools and earn a little bit of money.  And then I went to graduate school and as soon as I finished, by then my oldest child was in middle school and that was when I began the, the community organizing work.  In part using some of the skills I learned in my graduate school program because part of what we were required to do was community work.  So they trained us to some extent to do some community organizing.  And that was really helpful when I transferred it to the community that I was living in.
Speaker 1: So who, who trained you to do organizing?
Speaker 2: Part of my Urban Education Program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had practicums.  So it was a year-round program.  One summer my practicum was to set up a science center in the neighborhood.  A place where kids could come and just mess around in science.  A storefront.  So that was, you know one summer's project.  And then during the school year I was assigned as an intern to a community based organization.  They gave me an assignment once I got there, now I'm a science teacher.  My assignment was to go help organize a girls' drill team, get them prepared to march in the Martin Luther King Day Parade in Newark.  Do you think I have any rhythm?  No.  Do I know anything about drill teams?  No.
Speaker 1: You were a dancer, you were a dance student.
Speaker 2: That has--ballet has nothing to do with being on a drill team.  So, but it was okay.  I learned from the girls, I learned from the community, I learned from the parents, you know the, the mom who, who, who helped out.  So it was an incredible experience.  And so I just transferred it to my own community.  And we had a drill team within, by the next year.  As soon as I graduated, we--I did that.
Story_ID: 25306
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so all this is--now so throughout the '70s [1970s], the balance of the '70s [1970s], you were living in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I moved from New Jersey in '80 [1980], I think '81 [1981], '82 [1982].  I moved back to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia]. So I was teaching in the middle schools of New Jersey, one middle school of New Jersey, of Plainfield, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For ten years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so was your husband reassign, was assigned to a church here in D.C. or--
Speaker 2: No, that's when we separated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I moved back because of that.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So this is 1982 or so and I have a note here that--if something comes before this, let me know but it says you became a research and writer for the InterAmerica Research Associates, right?
Speaker 2: Association, yeah.
Speaker 1: Association, okay.
Speaker 2: It was--actually I guess it was the first job I was able to get when I moved back here.  I was happy because I thought it would--it called on me to use so much of what I had learned as a classroom teacher and I was designing the television, I mean the teachers' guide for a television series that was designed to encourage I think nine to twelve or fourteen year olds to consider careers in science.
Speaker 1: Okay so this TV series is called 'SPACES'?
Speaker 2: Called SPACES.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Called SPACES.  All capital letters I think.  And the--when I took the job, apparently someone else had had it and hadn't done anything in a year.  So the book needed to be produced in five months, four--I took it in January.  The book had to be done by May.  But the films hadn't been shot yet.  So it was--the story boards weren't even all you know, done.  But it was a challenge and you know I, I enjoyed doing it.  I mean I--it expanded my horizons tremendously.  It was--and I'm glad, I'm really glad I did that one because that was the beginning of a whole new set of experiences for me.  It was my first experience in publishing, you know writing and publishing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25307
Speaker 1: Now in--also in '83 [1983], you worked for the Mid-Atlantic Center for Race Equity.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So name self explanatory, but what kind of things did you do?
Speaker 2: Well actually I need to say that that's a federally--that was a federally funded desegregation assistance center.  So its mission was to help school systems in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia], confront and address issues related to equity, desegregation of classes, of school buildings and particularly equity within classes, within the school building.  Helping people to understand that equity and equality are not the same thing.  That with equity you do whatever you need to do to level the playing field so that all children have a fair chance.  It was a tremendous learning experience for me because there I realized that one had to be focused in terms of if you were concerned about equity, and my, my concern grew in terms of the area of--areas of math and science, then you needed to develop messages that people could hear and think about.  The, the best assignment they gave me shortly after I got there, was to produce a tool that would help schools think about the equity issues in math and science education.  And so out of that came the publication 'Critical Filters, Mathematics and Science, Critical Futures for the--Critical Filters for the Future of Minority Students.'  And to put that together, to, to put that publication together, I probably spent a year reviewing the literature, reading whatever I could find that had been published and just sort of tracking down information.  Trying to understand what some of the factors were that contributed to the under participation of children of color, particularly African American, Latino and American Indian children.  Their under-participation, underperformance in math and science.
Story_ID: 25308
Speaker 1: When I finally got it all together, I had voluminous notes.  I sorted them out into affective factors, which have to do with feelings and cognitive factors, which have to do with what's happening in the classroom in terms of the learning experience.  And some of the affective factors involved attitudes towards science.  And I based this on what I could find in the research.  And at that time, I don't know what it's like now, but this was based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, that was the first national assessment that was done in science.  It was at the end of the 'up's [1970s].  At that time, African American or black children ex--at a young age, nine years old, expressed a higher interest in science than their white counterparts.  Well who knew that?  Nobody would know.  So as I found these things out, then I thought it would be really important to help teachers know that because it gave them something to build on.  So the whole idea about attitudes in science, the kids liked math even though they weren't excelling in it, at least they had a positive attitude toward it.  The influence of significant others, parents, the impact that parents, teachers, peers, siblings can have on a child's feeling about themselves as a science student, their interest in science, very much influenced by the people around you.  The people who serve as role models.  The whole idea of seeing people who look like you who are doing science.  That's another one of those affective factors.  Persistence, the ability to hang in there and not give up.  When it gets hard and you don't understand something, not getting frustrated and saying can't do it.  I learned about--in preparing, in doing that work, I learned about an area called locus of control.  And to this day I am still wrestling with that concept.  Whether I have an internal child or whether I have an internal locus of control whereby I feel that I can determine my fate, I can change the outcomes of things.  Or I have an external locus of control whereby you did that to me.  You didn't give me this opportunity.  You didn't let me do this.  Or I need you to tell me what to do.  I need you to solve the problem for me.  So this whole issue of locus of control to me is still a central issue that needs better understanding.  And we need tools for addressing it.  But it was one--for me it was one of the most important of the factors that dealt with the affective or emotional component.  Another one was, which affected my work thereafter, was prior experiences.  If you've had no experiences in science to build on and you get into a chemistry class, you know but the research was showing that our kids did not have sufficient prior experiences to really take full advantage of what was going on in the classroom.  By prior experiences, we're talking about the kinds of experiences that middle class children take for granted.  They go to summer camps.  They go to museums, they go to zoos, botanical gardens.  They have all of these science enriching experiences as a norm from early childhood on up.  And our kids were missing those things.  And that helped shaped you know my, my career thereafter, those, a lot of those factors.  The cognitive factors had to do with academic deficiencies, had to do with teacher expectations.  You know what kinds of attitudes did teachers come into the classrooms with?  What did they expect of children of color?  Had to do with teachings, or learning styles as we talked earlier.  Had to do with how teachers felt about science.  We're all looking at--I'm only looking at elementary schools and the fact that it was a challenge for many elementary schools to have teachers who enjoyed doing science and who were comfortable with mathematics.
Story_ID: 25309
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about your work on the 'Mathematics and science: Critical filters for the future of minority students' [publication] and the different things that minority students--different issues that affect minority students in terms of their approach to science and why science education is not working as well, you know, in minority communities.
Speaker 2: One of the things I didn't mention as an affective component, a factor, would be perceived usefulness of mathematics and science courses in terms of every day life and careers--so--and education choices.  Basically, mathematics had been identified earlier as the critical filter because without mathematics, so many doors are closed to young people.  But based on when, when the publication, the 'Mathematics and science: Critical filters for the future of minority students' was published, we introduced it to seven, eight school districts here contiguous with [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia], and went on to form a project based on it out of three school districts that wanted to take it on and do something about their elementary science programs.  So that--it was called 'Minorities, Math and Science K [kindergarten] through 8 [eighth grade]' and that began as, became a set of professional development experiences for teachers and counselors, principals, teachers and counselors from selected schools in D.C., Prince George's County [Maryland], Montgomery County [Maryland], and the first year Alexandria, Virginia, so there were four.
Story_ID: 25310
Speaker 1: I moved on and moved on to the National Urban Coalition to be the director of the 'Say YES to a Youngster's Future' Program.  It was just being launched.  My job was to organize it, launch it and make it work.  And the Say YES Program under the direction, you know the vision of M. Carl Holman [civil rights leader] who was the president of the National Urban Coalition.  And the Coalition itself was an interesting concept because these were civil rights organizations and labor organizations that came together after the riots to rebuild the cities, to help rebuild the cities.  But the Say Yes to a Youngster's Future Program was designed to bring mathematics and--awareness of the importance of mathematics and science to inner city communities, schools, and it was based on a concept of community, home and school working together around math and science education.  We had about twenty-eight schools when I left we had--during the time that I was there we worked with about up to twenty-eight schools in three cities.  Here in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], Houston, Texas and New Orleans [Louisiana].  In addition to that, we did family math training, 'Say YES Through Family Math' using the University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California] curriculum, a wonderful curriculum, for all the elementary schools in Baltimore [Maryland].  Trying to use that as an opportunity to get the word out to parents and community organizations about the importance of mathematics and the importance of science experiences for children.  In designing the Say YES Program, I tried to incorporate as many of those factors that I mentioned a few minutes ago, those factors having to do with persistence and perceived utility of math and science and significance.  All those factors we tried to build in, the affective domain factors, we dealt with the schools to some extent, but not to the extent I would have liked if I'd had ten years to do that.  But the really interesting part is the number of families that would turn out for a field trip on Saturday, a Say YES field trip on Saturday to go to a science rich institution was just wonderful.  Parents valued those Saturday Say YES experiences where they came to the school and did activities, or went on a field trip to zoos or the museums they'd never been to before.  And the kids were getting some of those missing pieces.  And we usually worked with a community organization as well so that they could provide that access to communities.
Story_ID: 25311
Speaker 1: I moved on from there [National Urban Coalition] to eventually, after some year--a couple of years of consulting, I moved--and much of the consulting was with school districts; it was really interesting helping them to look at the equity issues in mathematics and science education, what's going on in their schools, and strategies for intervening.  Then I--that's when I went to the Association of Science-Technology Centers [ASTC] which is based here in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].  It's an organization comprised of well over 300 science museums and science centers and science rich institutions all over the world.
Speaker 2: Now this is 1991.
Speaker 1: It's 1991.
Speaker 2: And just for the record, the 'Say YES [To a Youngster's Future]' program [National Urban Coalition], 1989/1990.
Speaker 1: No, Say YES preceded that.  Say YES was probably '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: To, or maybe '87 [1987] to '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I was consulting for the two years in between.  During that time my father [Howard Percell Banks] was dying of cancer, so I was able to be--work from home most of the time and I didn't accept any consulting--most consulting engagements I had to be back in by nighttime, and usually it worked.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right so, so it's '91 [1991] that you joined the Association for Science-Technology Centers, Incorporated.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Association of Science-Technology Centers, yes.
Speaker 2: And how do you pronounce the acronym for that?
Speaker 1: ASTC.
Speaker 2: ASTC, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, ASTC.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And I, I went there to direct a project that they had just gotten funded.  It was called 'YouthALIVE!', Youth Achievement Through Learning, Involvement Volunteering and Employment.  And the Wallace Foundation, which at that time was the Dewitt Wallace Reader's Digest Foundation, but it's now the Wallace Foundation--they were interested in reaching many more--they had been funding a couple of I think children's museums and maybe a science center.  And they wanted to reach more, and wanted to reach adolescents.  Wanted us to work with adolescents.  So we developed the program.
Story_ID: 25312
Speaker 1: It was an incredibly rich experience for me, for the adults working with the kids, and for the young people themselves.  By the time we--and we served as the re-granting entity.  So the Wallace Foundation granted the funds to us for ASTC to then grant to its members.  It was a competitive process.  We had to send out RFPs [request for proposals] and we had reviewers come in and review the proposals.  The proposals were pretty, pretty concrete about what was expected.  So the expectation would be that we would provide youth, through this program we would support young people developmentally.  The programs would be not only developmentally appropriate, but they would offer young people opportunities to become fully involved in the life of a cultural institution.  You know in the life of a museum or zoo or botanical garden or children's museum.  They would offer the young people an opportunity to become employees.  They would learn pre-employment skills and get stipends or, or small salaries.  But they also would get a sense of possibilities for themselves.  And I guess over the eight year period of the grants, at least--more than 7,000 kids went through the program and we were, we had programs in 25 or 30 cities.  What has fascinated me has been the number of programs that have continued.  So a number of them have continued.  But it was an opportunity for the museums to bring diverse audiences in.  Traditionally museums have not been places where low income people and people of color, particularly teenagers, hang out.  So we were offering them a safe place to hang out and grow, making that transition into productive adulthood.  So--and I would say out of that experience, probably, and maybe it's because I was able to stay in contact with the adults who worked with the kids.  I've been so struck by what the professional development of Youth Alive meant to the adults who worked in the museums.  Number one, it brought many more people of color into the museum field.  But I've been very pleased with the number of people who were Youth Alive program leaders who've gone back to school, gotten doctorates, a couple of them became museum directors.  You have no idea how phenomenal that is.  You know to become a museum director is really not easy.  But a couple have, have moved to that level, or very high in the hierarchy of the museum world, so--
Speaker 2: Well this once again is--bounces back to what you said in the beginning of the interview about one you know, action reverberating out.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, exactly, and, and I would say that my contribution, my contribution probably has been to help people see what's possible for themselves and go for it.  You know just--it's almost like giving them permission to be all that they could be.
Story_ID: 25313
Speaker 1: Now when you published--2000 you published 'Museums and Healthy Adolescent Development: What Are We Learning From Research and Practice?'  Is this a reflection of 'YouthALIVE!' [Youth Achievement Through Learning, Involvement Volunteering and Employment; Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC)] or 'YouthALIVE!'--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  And probably, probably I have some stories that probably are a nicer way, an interesting way of getting at some of the things I learned.  I actually wrote a chapter in a book with an alumni from one of these programs.  She is now an elementary school teacher.  But she was interviewed, probably while she was still in college.  She was interviewed and one of the questions was did working in the science center have any affect on your achievement in science?  And at first she said no.  And then she thought about it and she said well, come to think of it, when I took the ACT [American College Testing]--she's in Minnesota, when I took the ACT--so that's what they used instead of the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test]--I expected to do poorly in science but well in reading and writing because I excelled in those subjects.  When I got my scores back, it blew my mind that my top score was in science reasoning.  And she said I couldn't figure that out.  And then she thought about it and she said the questions on science reasoning section were all about pendulums.  She said we never studied pendulums in school, but when I got to start--when I started working in the science center, there was a whole exhibit on pendulums.  And part of what they taught us at the science center was to play.  She said I had to learn how to play.  They would just give you stuff and say play.  When I was talking earlier about the need for kids to manipulate.  So many of our kids don't have opportunities to manipulate with permission.  And she said they assigned me to the pendulum exhibition.  And I fooled around and fooled around in there.  And when she came out with that score, then she understood the value that informal learning experience--but and so that was one of the lessons that I was hoping to learn.  That that informal learning experience with science can have a lasting you know, impact on our kids.  Another story involves a pair of twins in Tampa [Florida].  They were ninth graders when they started, they started in the first year of the program, one of the first grants.  And the, and they were doing well and the museum director came to the program leader and said so how are the boys doing, and she said they're doing fine.  And he said how are they doing in school?  She said I don't know.  And he said go find out.  And she went to the school and the guidance counselor said well we're expecting for them to drop out, so we're getting ready for that.  And she said what?  So she made an agreement with them, with him, with the guidance counselor that the counselor would get the teachers to sign a weekly statement that boys have come to class every day and done their homework.  Those two young men graduated on time from high school.  One of them when I was down in Tampa was teaching science in a middle school.  The other one went on to start a youth development--I mean he's just done incredible things in terms of taking what he experienced in the museum and trying to build larger experiences for children.  He actually had the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa build a building for the youth so they had a safe place to come on the zoo grounds after school and learn and study. And prepare for their jobs that they do out on the zoo grounds.  So those are two stories.  We learned that the kids bring diversity to the museums.  We learned that the--that they bring a level of energy that is just priceless, you know to the museum floor as they engage with visitors, ask them questions as they encourage visitors to participate in activities or explain what's going on.  And we learned that, that the community based organizations that partnered with the museums to do this would bring the kids back and have them teach science in many cases to the little kids.  So there were a lot of lessons we learned, but developmentally, those kids found that there is a place in the world that needs me.  I can be somebody.  I can contribute.  I begin to learn my talents and my skills.  All those things that we need as adolescents to develop healthily.
Story_ID: 25314
Speaker 1: Now also that in 2000 you wrote 'After School Hours: A Time for Children and Science Centers', which is, you know, further development of the same idea.
Speaker 2: Right, and particularly the idea of the teenagers being part of the staff for after school programs.  I visited a school in--this wasn't after school, but I learned a lot from this experience.  I visited a school in Salt Lake City [Utah] where our youth program students, eighth graders, were going to fourth, third or fourth graders and bring objects from the museum.  And they would work with small groups of kids, asking questions.  Not teaching, but asking questions and then letting the kids learn about the object.  So--and they were different.  I mean all kinds of things, bones and scatinel [phonetic], the poop from animal that had been fossilized.  At the end when they came back together again from these small groups and the lead kid who's really hyperactive, but he was cool with these little kids, he said is there any question you want to ask us?  And all these little kids had been fidgeting around.  They all got very still because one of them said how can I get to do what you do when I get to be big?  So that taught me how important a role these teenagers can play in the lives of making science alive for younger children.
Speaker 1: Okay that's profound, actually.  So--
Speaker 2: It was profound for me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--is it, is it difficult to get teenagers involved in the, the--
Speaker 2: What I learned the first year, I was the first--the first year we were actually giving out the, the implement--grants for people to design and implement a program.  There were eight institutions that already had programs and they, they were given a set of grants to help shepherd the others.  We ended up after four years coming up with a better system, actually after about two years.  But what I learned when the leader from Franklin Institute [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the program leader from Franklin Institute in Philadelphia called and said I can't get any kids.  And I said are you offering pay?  And he said no.  I said your grant allows to pay them.  These are kids from low-income communities.  They need summer jobs.  And so I'm not aware of anybody who had trouble recruiting.  Now the issue was it's better to recruit through a community based organization because they do the filtering to make sure that the kids can make the commitment, and also they can kind of benefit from what the teenagers are learning.  So it's just great to have an im--an advocate for the program based in the community from which the kids are coming because the museum is generally not based right in the heart of their community.  So the recruitment was not an issue.  Transportation could be an issue in some cases because often the museums are, are far away from where the kids live or you know there were some of those kinds of issues.  The kids weren't driving, they didn't have cars.  So in a couple of places, cases, the museum had to work out something with the bus company so there would at least would be transportation.
Story_ID: 25315
Speaker 1: In 2001 you were promoted to director of Partnerships for Learning at ASTC [Association of Science-Technology Centers], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As our grant was winding down for the 'YouthALIVE!' [Youth Achievement Through Learning, Involvement Volunteering and Employment] program, a couple of things became clear.  One was that the museum field needs much more work in diversity.  Not just diversifying the audiences, but diversifying staff and diversifying upper levels of staff.  So through Partnerships for Learning we did two things with the permission of the funder to use any remaining funds.  We set up Promoting Dialogues on Diversity Conference Fellowship Program so that staff and they had to be mid-level staff or new staff, to [unclear] and people of color could come to the annual conference which usually, you know you have to be really long term member of an organization to get your way paid to go to conference.  But we brought these young people to conference and gave them a special set of workshops and tools so that they could navigate well their way through the, the conference and interacting and networking with other conference attendants.  But also we wanted them to get on a career trajectory.  We wanted them to meet people in the museum field, people of color who had gone up; who had become assistant directors, or vice presidents or directors, education directors.  So that was one program, one, one--a major part of what we did under the Conference Fellowship, under the Partnership for Learning.  The other thing we did--and keeping those people networked so they had each other, a support system.  But the other thing we did with the board, with ASTC's Board of Directors, was to launch an equity and diversity initiative in which we encouraged our members, whether they were here in the United States or abroad, to look at some of the critical equity issues and think about what needed, what would need to happen in order for them to achieve true diversity in their institution.  So the institution--who came to the institution and who worked in the institution, represented accurately the communities that they were serving.  So that was the Equity and Diversity Initiative, which I have no idea whether it's still going on, but I'm sure it's still needed, some version of it is still needed.

Speaker 1: Okay, in 2002 you published 'Leveling the Playing Field Through Object-Based Service Learning'.  You probably defined it already, but object-based servicing learning is?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I gave the example of the eighth graders going into the fourth grade classroom, now that happened to be an in-school experience.  But they were using objects, so it's object-based learning.  And they were providing a service to the younger children.  Sometimes this happens in after school programs or summer day camps or--but it's the--or a number of our programs, the teenagers would go to community festivals, fairs, any event that was being staged community-wide, and they would take the objects to engage people in science experiences.  So that would be where optic-based science learning.  And it's interesting, service learning, the story I told about the young woman in Minnesota and the pendulums, that story came from that article--that chapter.  She wrote that with me.  We co-authored it, where I had her words from her interview and then I went on you know with the discussion.
Speaker 1: So this is Ms. Pope.
Speaker 2: Yes, Myla [ph.].
Speaker 1: Myla Pope, okay, all right.  So something like a pendulum, or what, what other object would you give a teenager to go into a classroom to discuss?
Speaker 2: It may be magnifying glasses, it might be balloons, it might be magnets, it might be--I mean all sorts of things.  I mean it's, it's--because I'm never there, you know, doing it with them.  But almost the whole idea of, of surface tension and drops of water, density and different liquids, the densi--you know, different densities of liquids when you try to mix them together, what happens?  There's just so many activities.  I mean you could actually bring in from your--a set of, of gym--rocks, from your, your geology department.  Some of the more interesting rocks; crystals.  Generally those things don't travel, but I'm trying to think of things that they would take, the activities they would take.  The whole idea of, of building things.  Not necessarily with museum objects, but creating things.  Mixing liquids, mixing you know, various liquids.  What dissolves, what sinks, what floats?  Friction, you know how do you speed up your car and how do--how do you make a car, how do you build a little car, how do you speed it up?  What difference does the kind of surface it is on make?  So there--creating batteries, batteries out of lemons.  There's a wealth--actually you just go, now you just go on the Internet and type in hands-on science activities, it's endless.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25317
Speaker 1: Okay, now in 2005 you published an article in the 'Curator: The Museum Journal' entitled 'A Focus on Youth, Science and Museums.'  And this is on, you know, is developing the same theme I would think, but so the 'Curator' I guess is the--one of the important magazines for--
Speaker 2: It's for museum educators.  It's published by the--it's the 'Journal of Museum Education.'  No, actually it's a different magazine, it's a different publication.  But it is a publication for museum educators and they decided they wanted to devote one issue to youth in museums and I was asked to be the guest editor along with Judy Diamond.  And we did--so that piece that you referred to was the introduction and the, the journal contained a number of articles by people in the field describing their programs.  They weren't necessarily programs that I had worked with, but they were all programs that involved youth in various ways, some of which were quite rich, you know science rich.  I mean where kids were engaged in you know, exploration of the intersection between science and culture, you know their particular culture, so--but a number of different ideas were explored.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what museums are getting this right?  Are, are doing the--providing the best example for you know, I don't want to get you in trouble, we got Science and Industry in Chicago [Illinois], COSI Columbus [Ohio], you got Detroit Museum of Science [Detroit, Michigan] and you know, Franklin Institute [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  All these different-Smithsonian [museums, Washington, District of Columbia], you know, so who's, who's getting this right?
Speaker 2: Well because I'm not in the field right now, I can't really speak for, speak accurately.
Speaker 1: Well who did get it right?
Speaker 2: Okay, all right I can tell you some of the exciting experiences I had, and then some that I've known of.  The St. Louis [Missouri] Science Center had a stellar program.  I hope it still does; I know they still have a program.  New York Hall of Science [New York City], the Museum of Science in Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], Philadelphia Zoo [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  The New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences, which was once the New Jersey State Aquarium, but it's now the Academy, the education wing of it is the Academy for Aquatic Sciences, the Exploratorium in San Francisco [California], the Explora in Albuquerque [New Mexico], the Miami Museum of Science [Miami, Florida], the--I have, I have to think state-by-state.  I'm not sure what's happening at Discovery Place in Charlotte [North Carolina]--.
Story_ID: 25318
Speaker 1: But I guess what I'm, what I'm really--are, are, are museums really--do you think that--are they, are they getting it?  I mean do you think they are?  Are they--
Speaker 2: A number of them really got it.  The thing that really surprised me was at one point you know five years after the grant ended, five or eight years after the grant ended, I knew of at least thirty that were still continuing even though the grant from the Wallace Foundation had ended.  Now part of it was the last four years of granting they--in order to receive a grant, they were called Independence Grants.  So they, they had to design their, their budgets so that the grant funding each year from us decreased and they had to raise the money themselves.  So they had to keep increasing the amount they were raising as their grant money--and that was so that when the grant, when our grant ended, they wouldn't be without funds; they would have developed new partners.  Franklin Institute I think still has a, a, a fine program.  I think most of the places I named still have a fine, you know fine youth program.  Chicago Museum of Science and Industry was not part of 'YouthALIVE!' [Youth Achievement Through Learning], but a YouthALIVE staff person transferred to Chicago and helped them build their youth program.  The Brooklyn Children's Museum was our model in a lot of ways from the very beginning.  They had one of the most stable, solid programs that really was used, was centered on youth development.  It was a joy to be standing there when the little kids came running in right from school.  It was probably one of the few museums from the beginning that allowed children to come unaccompanied by adults.  So they came right after school and I was standing there a little girl, two little girls came in and they weren't any higher than this, they were like kindergarteners.  And they said to Troy who was the director of the Youth Program, he said well--he called their names.  He said aren't you staying?  She said no, I just brought my friend in because she needs a Band Aid.  He gave the child a Band Aid and she said we have to go home now and they went home.  But the kids all knew how to sign in for the afternoon and all of that.  I'm trying to think of--I'm trying to do it geographically, Franklin Institute, the Newark Museum had a good program.  Some of the programs were younger than others, so I had the joy of seeing them be born and grow.  The Louisiana Arts and Science Center down in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] had an excellent program.  I don't know what it's like now, but they had an ex--the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans [Louisiana], Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa [Florida], Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa.  On the west coast, California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.  How could I not name--I don't know what their youth program is like now, but at one point it was stellar.  The California Science Center in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], yeah there were probably a couple more in California.  Lied Discovery Children's Museum in Las Vegas [Nevada].  They had, they had a, a wonderful program.  It was small, but I remember meeting a kid from there and I remember meeting his mother.  And she told the story and later the young man wrote about it.  And he wrote about how he had been a special ed [education] student and the school always told him what he couldn't do.  And he got to the museum and they told him what he could do.  And he was there for four or five years.  And he said they had him learn this big stuffed doll called Stuffy.  He hated Stuffy.  He said he didn't like it.  He'd take the organs out and the little kids learned what's inside their body.  It's all, you know stuffed, you know, soft sculpture.  The heart, the lungs and stuff.  And he said but it really helped him.  When I next heard about him, the program leader told me--I was out to Las Vegas for something much later, like years later.  And she said--I asked her about him.  She said I was taking my father in--he was having a heart attack and I got to the emergency room and this young man was working in the emergency room.  His goal is to become a surgical nurse.  So you know, he said the museum taught him what he could, taught him what he could do.  So there, yeah, programs all over that--the Chicago Botanical Gardens, they had a wonderful program.  The--what was the Chicago Academy of Sciences became the--now is the Peggy Notebaert Nature Center or something, but they had a stellar program and I think they have continued their youth program in some form.  So, but it's been interesting to see the number of other places that have started youth programs subsequently.  And, you know our whole thing is you focus on the needs of the young person and the ways in which the needs of the museum can overlap, you know so that it isn't all one way, but it, you know the two are helping one another.
Story_ID: 25319
Speaker 1: Now you retired in 19, in 2005,
Speaker 2: Six, 2006.
Speaker 1: ASTC [Association of Science-Technology Centers].  And what have you been doing since?
Speaker 2: Well the first thing I had to do was to write the handbook for youth program leaders, which I've been promising to write all the time I was working, so that was a major project for me and I wrote it so that it could be online.  I don't think it's still there, I don't know cause I don't go to the web site anymore but for a couple of years it was online as a resource to help people who were starting up.  So everything we learned from 'YouthALIVE!' [Youth Achievement Through Learning] we tried to capture, you know as, as this handbook.  And since that time I've done, you know, some consulting, not a lot but working with some programs that you know wanted further assistance; new programs, newly funded programs which are not happening that much anymore.  You know as fund--as, as budgets get tight, the funding for new programs--and by new programs it's, I'm really talking about projects within youth programs.  So like one museum had a project in which they were funded to have teenagers create science learning spaces for younger children.  They could do it in the community centers, they could do it in the housing projects.  Wherever the community partner said here's where we want you to design the space.  So you know that was a really great program to work with.  But the other--my, much of my other time is devoted to work with my church and family, you know, a number of family issues that need support.  And then taking care of myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25320
Speaker 1: Well, now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your major accomplishments or your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think probably the 'Mathematics and Science Critical Filters' [publication entitled 'Mathematics and science: Critical filters for the future of minority students'] was a major accomplishment because it provided in one place some concrete information that educators, I and other educators could use in program design, curriculum design.  It was simple and easy to use.  The second I think major--the projects that I worked in after that, the programs that I designed and set up once I had finished that publication, all sought--in each case I was attempting to address some of the factors that I identified in doing the research for that book.  So I think lastly would be--first major thing would be Critical Filters, and the second major thing would be 'YouthALIVE!' [Youth Achievement Through Learning Program; Association of Science-Technology Centers] and the Professional Development Network.  It was so powerful working with those young professionals and to see the energy and passion that they brought to their work; and to encourage them; to help them learn from my experiences and for me to learn from theirs.  But I think that professional development work was probably more important than the re-granting because it created a whole new cadre of young professionals who saw teenagers differently; who saw teenagers as resources as opposed to nuisances.  So I think that's the best I can say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25321
Speaker 1: Now when you look back again at everything you've done, is there any major thing that you'd do differently or go back and change if you could?
Speaker 2: Well I'm sure there are things I would do differently.  Yeah, yeah I probably--I mean there are probably a lot of things I would do differently.  I'd probably--yes, one thing I probably would have done, would have figured out how to go take courses in fundraising so I would learn how to raise lots of money so that I could continue working at the level that I was working when I had the large grants.  I found out money does make a difference.  We wouldn't have ever been able to achieve what we achieved without you know enough money to encourage people to take risks, to encourage institutions to take risks.  One of the institutions [unclear] mentioned, it has one of the finest science programs and I, youth programs, and it has continued.  It's the Science Museum of Minnesota [St. Paul, Minnesota].  They are relentless.  You know they're just excellent programs.  So fundraising would be one thing I would, you know just anybody who's interested in program development, figuring out how to be a, a good development person, financially, is extremely important.  I mean there are, there are a lot of--I made a lot of, you know, mistakes along the way.  I mean you make some staffing mistakes, but then you have some great staff.  I had the pleasure of just working with wonderful people for the most part.  People who shared my passion, you know for the work and, and who were willing to rise to a level of excellence in what they produced.  I would probably--at one point there was a question on--among board members about whether YouthALIVE! [Youth Achievement Through Learning Program; Association of Science-Technology Centers] should be its own separate organization, which is very interesting cause it was very hard if you think about it.  I'm a staff employee.  I'm an employee and yet I'm responsible for the granting process to our members and our board members.  And that was problematic, you know at one point early on I think for some people but we moved past that.
Speaker 1: Did you think it was a good idea that they--
Speaker 2: I didn't at the time because I felt it really helped to have a mother organization.  It helped to be grounded in the culture and understanding of the professional organization for the field.  I don't know how sustainable it would have been if we'd have been a separate organization.  And I think now when I think about it in terms of sustainability, it would have been much more difficult.  It would have been harder to embed these programs into the life of the museums to the extent that many of them are or were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think by it being all a part of who that organization is, that organization is an ASTC member, so being a part of YouthALIVE! for many of them was part of that ASTC experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25322
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask too, is what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  I'm so concerned about our children.  I'm concerned about the little ones and the big ones.  I'm concerned about parents not feeling that they have safe places for their children to go every day.  I'm concerned, I'm sorry but this is just--it's the wrong question to ask me.  I--it's--I'm concerned that African American children may not be leaving, coming out of school with the skills and the knowledge and the determination needed to sus--to survive successfully in this century.  I'm concerned about the unemployment rate, part of which is tied to education and part of which isn't.  You know when, when people with Master's and law degrees are walking around looking for jobs, you know the African American who does or does not have a high school degree but that's their terminal, you know, level of education, I, I, I get really worried.  It's more than concern, it's almost panic.  I'm concerned about the children in foster care.  What's happening to them in foster care and what happens when they transition out, and it isn't even transition, it's just you're out.  You're eighteen [years old] in some states, in other states it's twenty-one.  See that's been one of my interests since I retired.  I'm working with a young man who is twenty-one and has transitioned out of foster care.  So and I see how hard it is for kids who've had none of the supports growing up, you know they had a house, I mean they had a place to sleep at night and food.  But the, the academic you know support system, and also the emotional supports.  When you're snatched out of your home and we have thousands of kids in foster care that are invisible to most of us.  So that's--I'm concerned about you know the young mothers with babies and, and not being able to have a vision for their children that they actualize.  Schools, what's happening there, what needs to happen.  I don't worry about the older adults, isn't that interesting?  I don't worry about my age group.  I, I'm concerned about the young ones and what kind of lives.  I have great-grandchildren, I have grandchildren.  I don't think--it'll be difficult for my--either of my grandchildren to live as well as I have lived although they're working very hard.  But I'm more concerned even about those who haven't had the advantages that my grandchildren have had, and that my great-grandchildren will have.  It wont' be easy, but they have a path that, you know we've cut the weeds down so that they have a path.  And I worry about those that there's no path.
Story_ID: 25323
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your children and, and your family today.  You said you, you're helping to raise a young man.
Speaker 2: My children do not want me to talk about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just take it like it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--I'm not raising the young man, I'm sort of mentoring him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and I don't know that he would want me to talk about him except to say that you know, moving, helping him to move from being homeless to setting goals and, and I told him before my family responsibilities escalate any higher, I want to make sure that he is enrolled in the community college so that he can proceed on, on his path.  But I also see how much is needed with what it takes in terms of learning how to manage finances, learning how to negotiate the work world, time management.  So many things we take for granted because all our lives we were building them.  My--I have two grandsons, they're identical twins.  And they are--bring me great joy.  They are young men now in their early thirties.  One is in law school here at Georgetown [University, Washington, District of Columbia] and the other one is a social worker in Atlanta [Georgia], working with adjudicated youth.  And he has three children.
Story_ID: 25324
Speaker 1: The one thing I didn't say with the jobs that I've had after publishing Critical Filters [publication entitled 'Mathematics and science: Critical filters for the future of minority students']--done a lot of public speaking trying to raise the issues.  And initially asking people who will pay your Social Security?  If you don't educate these children now, who's going to be paying Social Security in the twenty-first century?  And helping people understand the demographics were going to change.  So it has been one of the most interesting things that I've lived to see the demographics change so rapidly and the implications of that are just now beginning to sink in, you know to the public.  So--but I can't--I think you've taken care of everything.
Speaker 2: So in other words you're saying we're all in the same boat and we can't let part of the boat--if we let part of the boat sink, you're going down too.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: But it'll take a while longer.
Speaker 2: People don't necessarily realize that.
Speaker 1: They have not realized it yet, but I think those people who went through those training sessions with me, I know that they're--they thought I was crazy, but I know they're thinking back now to remember that lady and what she said, one third of a nation?  We have passed one third of a nation, so yeah, so a lot of that advocacy has been--continues to be important for somebody to be doing.  AAAS [American Association for the Advancement of Science] and Shirley Malcolm's [also a HistoryMaker; science education advocate] office has just been a wonderful leader in, in keeping that advocacy piece before appropriate audiences.
Speaker 2: I get the feeling that you think it's not enough, not enough.
Speaker 1: No, in fact what's happening now, it's very interesting.  I don't know that people are actually--there's a big push in our country now for STEM [Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics] education, science technology, engineering and mathematics.  The president [President Barack Obama] is big on it.  So there's a big push, but I don't hear people talking about who's actually benefitting from the push?  I don't know because I'm not doing the research now.  But we need to look at where are our children in this push for STEM?  And what kind of STEM education are our children receiving and what is needed in order for them to have maximum options as they move through the education pipeline and out into careers?  I'm trying to remember--I was so stunned in, in church.  We were having a meeting Saturday planning for Women's History Month and they announced that the theme was to be Women in Science and Technology.  Well for that in my church, that is like okay, the message is beginning to get where Carl Holman [civil rights activist] was trying to get it to be all those years ago when I was with the [National] Urban Coalition, the 'Say YES' Program.  Churches--Shiloh Baptist Church here in Washington [District of Columbia] was one of our partners to establish, we established our first Say YES Computer, Science, Mathematics Learning Center at Shiloh Baptist Church, it was an after school program long before after school became popular.  We were not able--they were not able to sustain it after you know, I don't know maybe, maybe it went on for about five years.  But it was a wonderful model.  But yeah, it needs to come from pulpits, it needs to be in beauty shops, it needs to be in liquor stores.  In our communities there has to be a unified message and push to say that our kids are going to be there too.
Story_ID: 25325
Speaker 1: All right, the last question is similar to legacy.  In fact it's almost identical.  But ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I'd like to be remembered in the form of a quote that one of our 'YouthALIVE!' [Youth Achievement Through Learning Program; Association of Science-Technology Centers] project leaders sent to me.  It's a magnet on my refrigerator and it says, "Every blade of grass needs someone whispering to it grow, grow."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Story_ID: 25326
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right this is graduation from the Toddlers Socialized Nursery School [Washington, District of Columbia].  I am the second person from the right on the third row, standing next to the young man.  All the way--right there.
Speaker 2: Right here, okay.
Speaker 1: And that was my mother's [Buena Vista Marie Williams] nursery school and my mother is standing behind, on the far end on the left.
Speaker 2: And your mother's name?
Speaker 1: Buena Vista Banks, she's the third person going back.
Speaker 2: This one's [unclear]
Speaker 1: That is my graduation from elementary school in June of 1951.
Speaker 2: That is a picture taken probably ten or fifteen years, ten years after the three of us taught science at Maxson Middle School in Plainfield, New Jersey.  So we were the eighth grade science department.
Speaker 1: Can you name the other two?
Speaker 2: Ann Davis and Willa Adams.
Speaker 1: That is a farewell event organized by the--for me, organized by the Community Betterment Council members and in that picture standing with the box is Carol Allen and next to her, Brenda Saddler.  Those were members of the Community Betterment Council for Highland Park, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That picture is, was taken probably at a 'YouthALIVE' Professional Development Network Meeting with one of the Network members.
Speaker 2: The National Urban Coalition set up a booth at the Black Family Reunion, very first black family reunion and subsequent ones that Dorothy Hite organized down on the [National] Mall here in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: That is a picture of the 'Say YES to a Youngster's Future' table at the Black Family Reunion on the Mall in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: The same [unclear].
Speaker 1: The same, it's a different picture, but the same event.
Speaker 2: [unclear].
Speaker 1: I think we did that one.  Well then we don't--
Speaker 2: [unclear].
Speaker 1: That's a picture with Warren Moon.  Warren Moon was one--was the Houston--was the spokesman for the 'Say YES to a Youngster's Future' Program in Houston, Texas.  So he was with us for the National Urban Coalition's annual dinner, and that's when that was taken.
Speaker 2: He was quarterback of the Houston Oilers [football team] [unclear].
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  He was a hero in Houston.  And that would have been probably 1988, maybe no probably was '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: That is my father, Howard P. [Percell] Banks and my mother, Buena Vista Banks.
Speaker 1: My father helped me with my first science fair project, which was about design, landscaping a home, and that's what we're working on, a model for landscaping a home.  I was in the seventh grade then, so--
Speaker 2: And that is my sisters, Patrice and Sharon, and we are baking a cake.  And that was probably 1952, no or '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: That was probably 1953 and my two sisters and I are greeting my father when he has come home from work.
Speaker 2: And here I am model--that would have been 1954 probably, and I, or '53 [1953], same set [unclear], '53 [1953], I'm modeling a new dress for my parents.
Speaker 1: This is my wonderful family.  My--on the far right is my sister, Buena Vista Patrice Banks, and then next to her my sister Sharon Percellyn Banks and then my brother Howard P. Banks and in the front one of my two grandsons, Taurek [ph.] Barrett.
Speaker 2: That would be my prom picture from I guess June of 19, 1957.
Speaker 1: High school, Roosevelt High school [Washington, District of Columbia], it's on the steps of Roosevelt High school, and that probably was 1956.
Speaker 2: And that was probably 1950, '56 [1956], '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Probably 1954, '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: Okay so that's while I was teaching at Maxson [Middle School], so that was probably 1976.  Just guessing.
Speaker 1: This is '88 [1988], I know that one.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: My engagement picture, 1990, 1959.
Speaker 2: And that would have been probably 1946, school play, Monroe Elementary School [Washington, D.C.] play.  I think that's a train station.
Speaker 1: And this was 1999, that is the Network, the Professional Development Network comprised of youth program directors from science museums and children's museums around the country.  And the children had made that quilt.  Each program sent a patch.
Speaker 2: I would say that is probably my birthday party.  It is my birthday party when I probably was turning five [years old].  And I have no idea who those children are, actually I know who they are, but I don't know where they are.
Speaker 1: We had a social group that my mother and some other parents organized of children who had gone to her nursery school and they had kept us together as a social group all the way through elementary and junior and senior high.  So that's one of our parties, one of our social activities.
Speaker 2: And that was our Spring Dance when I was a senior, so that had to been 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's my mother's--that's the parent, some of the parents' group from my mother's nursery school.  They were celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary--they were planning the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the nursery school.
Speaker 2: This is 1967.
Speaker 1: 1967, I'm sorry, I forgot to say that.
Speaker 2: The science department.  That is the science department of Maxson Middle School, which was probably 1980--I mean 1974 or '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: I think it's on the book, no it's not.
Speaker 2: Is it--I don't know there's a date anywhere in it.
Speaker 1: You want me to take that sticky off?
Speaker 2: No that's all right.
Speaker 1: All right, that was 1992.  Just one of those pictures I had to pose for for something.
Speaker 2: That's with Gloria Steinem.  I was receiving the Groundbreaker, Groundbreaker of the Year Award from the Educational Equity Concepts Organization in New York.
Speaker 1: We need to get a shot of this page.
Speaker 2: The Educational Equity Award Concepts, that was 1991 and I just noticed I have on the same blouse.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's the same blouse.
Speaker 1: We're going to have to cut now and do this all over again [unclear].
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, okay.  Thank you.
