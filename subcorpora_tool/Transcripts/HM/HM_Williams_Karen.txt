Story_ID: 532050
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family. Tell me your mother's name, if you would spell it for me and tell me where she was born and when if you know.
Speaker 2: Her first name was Beryl, B-E-R-Y-L, Lockhart was her maiden name L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T, Hastie, H-A-S-T-I-E [Beryl Lockhart Hastie]. She was born in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, in 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about your mother.
Speaker 2: She was the second daughter in a family of four children. She had two sisters and one brother. They lived and she grew up in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Her father was a, a businessman and an entrepreneur on the island. He owned a number of businesses and over the course of his lifetime acquired a good bit of real estate. She went to elementary school and high school in the Virgin Islands and went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] for her college work.
Speaker 1: Okay. Her, tell me her father's name?
Speaker 2: Her father was Herbert, H-E-R-B-E-R-T, Earnest, E-A-R-N-E-S-T, Lockhart, L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T [Herbert Lockhart, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And your grandmothers name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Katherine, spelled with a K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, Ingeborg I-N-G-E-B-O-R-G, Lockhart [Katherine Ingeborg Lockhart].
Speaker 1: Did you spend time with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I did, when I was growing up we were living Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And I, most summers after I turned the age of ten, I would go down to St. Thomas usually my mother would be down there too. And work in some of the retail establishments that my grandfather had established. And we usually stayed with my grandmother at her home.
Speaker 1: What were some of the establishments, retail estab- establishments?
Speaker 2: There was at that time there was a department store, there was a gift shop, there was a lumberyard, there was a bakery. And during that time I worked as a, as a junior clerk stocking shelves and it was my first real introduction to entrepreneurship. And it's really been a seed in, planted a seed in me that is mushroomed into a number of things I'm involved in today.
Story_ID: 532051
Speaker 1: Do you know how your [maternal] grandfather [Herbert Lockhart, Sr.] acquired the land and the financing to have these businesses (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do it's a very, I mean it's an interesting story, his father [Alfred Harris Lockhart] had been a slave on a plantation in St. Croix one of the other U.S. Virgin Islands [Danish West Indies; U.S. Virgin Islands], C-R-O-I-X. When the weather patterns changed and sugarcane could no longer grow in St. Croix. He and his brothers, he had five brothers, got on a boat and went to the Dominican Republic, because they thought they could find work there, but he didn't like the Dominican Republic. He stayed there for two years, this was long before he got married. And decided to come back to the Virgin Islands and came to St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands]. When he had been on the plantation in St. Croix the overseer saw that he was very bright young man. And taught him his basic mathematics and had him keeping track of some of the crops that where being harvested. So when him got to St. Thomas he looked for a job as a, as a clerk with one of the companies that were importing rum into the Virgin Islands. And he got a job and started off and when the boats were being unloaded he would unload ten barrels and the eleventh barrel he would keep for himself. And the owner wasn't really keeping track of the number of barrels and so he basically started his own business on the side. And he keep the funds that he got with--from this business and eventually bought himself a storefront, where he started the first dry goods store, department store down there. Ultimately that mushroomed into the other establishments that I that I mentioned. And he used his money to acquire land. And at the midpoint of the 19th century and the 19--must have been the early mid-1920s there were five major landowners who owned most of the land on St. Thomas. And they met during, I guess the Depression [Great Depression] had set in and they were having a dinner party one night. And they decided that it was silly for them to be bidding against each other's tax sales. There were no antitrust laws at the time. And so they--the person who owned land closest to any plot that came on the block would have priority on bidding on that land and they would not bid against him. If he didn't want it then it was, it was fair game and that went on for a number of years. And so he acquired a good bit of property all over St. Thomas principally, but also land in St. Croix and land on St. John the other two American Virgin Islands. So he was a quite--my grandfather was an enormously entrepreneurial man, his father had been entrepreneurial and he just continued the in, in building the, building the companies and also expanding the land acquisition.
Story_ID: 532052
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Beryl Lockhart Hastie] share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was the tomboy in the family, she loved to ride horses. She had gone to elementary school and high school on St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands]. In fact she first met my father [William H. Hastie] when he spoke at her high school graduation. She then would have gone to Europe to study as her older sister did, but the war [World War II, WWII] had broken out by then. And so she came to Washington, D.C., and went to Howard University. And she, her younger sister also came up and studied at Howard as, as well. And she moved back to the [U.S.] Virgin Islands when my father was appointed governor by Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman], in 1941 [sic.].
Speaker 1: All right. Now tell me about, is there any other information about your mother's side of the family that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: I think it interesting, something I've really only sort of sorted through in my own later years. My aunt, for whom I was named, was her older sister, Karen [Karen Lockhart], was very smart and very entrepreneurial. And she worked in the gift shop and the department store, and assumed that her father [Herbert Lockhart, Sr.] would name her to run the business as he got older and decided to retire. But, in that day and age were talking about the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], women weren't active in the corporate life and commercial life, if you will. And so, her father named her brother [Herbert Lockhart, Jr.] who was the youngest and the only man as his successor in the, in the business. And it only came to me in recent years to piece that all together, because when she didn't get the position. She knew she really deserved it. Unfortunately that was the beginning and the end for her because she became very depressed and she was emotionally very fragile. And I think if, if my grandfather had had the foresight to recognize that she was really the right person with the right skills to put in the leadership of the companies, that things would have turned out much differently.
Story_ID: 532053
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your father? Tell me his name, and when he was born and where he was born?
Speaker 2: It's William Henry Hastie [William H. Hastie], he was born in 1906 in Knoxville, Tennessee. His mother was a teacher, his father was trained as a pharmacist. He went to elementary school in Knoxville. But, he always told me he walked to school and back every day. And in the, in the '20s [1920s] when you there really were no jobs available in Knoxville. His father moved the family to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Tell me his father's name, before you go forward?
Speaker 2: He, his father's name was also William Henry Hastie [William H. Hastie, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name, his mother's name was Roberta Childs, C-H-I-L-D-S, Hastie [Roberta Childs Hastie]. And when he came to Washington he was enrolled in Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]. He was an excellent student. He was a member of the track team. And math was his favorite subject, and his math professor had been in graduate school with a colleague who was then on the faculty of Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts]. And this friend had told the math professor at, at Dunbar that if he found any bright young men, it was then a single sex school. That he should refer them up to Amherst because they had scholarship money available. And so that was the way that dad got to Amherst College, it was through the Dunbar connection and that was at a time was Dunbar was graduating students who were incredibly bright who were very well prepared to be able to handle the discipline of a college such as Amherst College. I should back track and say when they lived in Washington, my grandfather--my great-grandfa- my grandfather worked for the pension--the federal pension building service [Bureau of Pensions] which is in what is now called the Pension Building [National Building Museum] in downtown Washington. And but he died quite young and so his--my father--my grandmother was a teacher and she taught in the Washington middle school, well I guess it was elementary schools then, for a number of years. She was also very active with Mary McLeod Bethune and Mary Terrell [Mary Church Terrell] in fighting for desegregation of facilities and of, of organization here in the Washington area. And we have pictures of, of him with his mother picketing out of peop- out in front of Peoples Drug Store [Peoples Drug Store, Inc., Washington, D.C.] when he was a very young age. So civil rights was part of his blood from a very early period.
Speaker 1: (Cough) Excuse me. Okay, so you really didn't have time spent with your grandfather on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, no I did not. And my, my grandmother was supposed to move in with us when our family moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] much later on in the early '50s [1950s], but, she died early, she had died in 1949 I believe and my [maternal] grandmother [Katherine Ingeborg Lockhart] in St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] who had been widowed at about the same time was also going to come and spend with us. But, she became blind really just before she was supposed come up and she didn't feel that she wanted to go into a completely new situation that she didn't know and she preferred to stay in her own house in St. Thomas. And so, we went down to, to visit her regularly as I said during the, during the summers.
Story_ID: 532054
Speaker 1: But, the, the time in Washington [D.C.], I was only--I born here in 1944 and Dad [William H. Hastie] was on the faculty at Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] at the time. And then he was named governor of the [U.S.] Virgin Islands by, by Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman].
Speaker 2: Actually before we get that far ahead, did he talk about, about going to college at Amherst?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, he, he, knew--he, he knew when he was in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] that he was, he wanted to go to college very much. And but he also knew that there were really no resources in, in the family to, to support the tuition. And he ta- he had talked at conversations with his math teacher to whom he was very close and it was out of those conversations that the opportunity that Amherst arose. And as it so happened two of his very good friends from that same class also went up to Amherst.
Speaker 2: Who, who were they?
Speaker 1: They were [HistoryMaker] Mercer Cook, C-O-O-K, and I'm drawing a blank on his name, he became a doctor, Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb] was the other person, M-O-N-T-A-G-U-E, Cobb, C-O-B-B. And the three of them got scholarships to go to Amherst. At the time there were no rooming accommodations at the college for African American students. And so they had to live off campus. And President Meiklejohn [Alexander Meiklejohn] view was that he was willing to have blacks in the classroom but he didn't want to have any social interchange between the black and whites students. So Dad and Mercer and Monty studied very hard and where very diligent about their studies, but on the weekend they'd take a bus into Boston [Massachusetts], where they had friends and where they could socialize with other African Americans. And I have no doubt that that experience was, well he loved the school and loved the learning, he was very unhappy that the president felt that they needed to segregate the African American students. Looking forward he became a trustee and ultimately a life trustee of the college. And in that capacity as a trustee he was also a member of the, the Folger Shakespeare Library here in, in Washington. And I've had the privilege to follow in his footsteps to be a trustee of Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts] and also a member of the Folger Shakespeare Library Board of Governors.
Story_ID: 532055
Speaker 1: Your father [William H. Hastie] graduates from Amherst in 1925?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what happens next?
Speaker 2: He wanted to go to graduate school, he thought he was going to go to engineer school, but he didn't have the money so he went and taught at a boarding school [Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth] for African American boys in Bordentown, New Jersey. He went to, then he was able to get a scholarship to go to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And he followed his cousin, Charles Hamilton Houston, who had also been at Amherst and then was at Harvard School. Charlie was the first African American to be a member of the Harvard Law Review and my dad was the second.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so they were cousins?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, they were, they were first cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charlie's family was here in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: All right, so when he leaves Harvard, is that when he comes to Howard?
Speaker 2: No, well, when he finished Harvard Law School, he came to Washington, and was teaching, and was teaching at, at Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He decided to, no I'm jumping ahead of myself. He did go directly from Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts] to Harvard Law School the two years in Bordentown were between the end of his Howard--his Harvard Law School career for his first degree. And then he went back and got a doctor in jurisprudence. And then it was from the time when he got the doctor in jurisprudence, which I believe was 1930 [sic.], that he then went to teach at Howard law school. He wanted to be near his cousin, Charlie Houston, who was then dean of Howard law school, and had begun shaping the strategy that ultimately led to the Brown case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 1: But, Houston also had a lot to do with the shaping of the law school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely, he Houston had also gone to Harvard Law School and he wanted Howard law school to be a strong a law school and a disciplined law school as Harvard was. And that's what he set out to do, that's why he encouraged my dad to come back and teach at the law school for him. And he brought in scholars from all over. And Howard at the time was really the, the cream of law school opportunities for African Americans interested in law.
Speaker 1: So what happens next, he's teaching at Howard and he's admitted to the bar and--?
Speaker 2: Right and then he was assigned he, he was asked if he would serve as a district court judge, a federal district court judge in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands. And he goes down there for two and a half years and that's when he spoke at my mother's [Beryl Lockhart Hastie] graduation. He'd been married to someone else at the time, when he came down to St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands]. But, went back up to campaign for Harry Truman [Harry S. Truman], because he saw Truman as a possible, his election as a possible opportunity to open new doors for African Americans.
Speaker 1: Well, did he work in private practice with the Houston firm [Houston and Houston; Houston, Houston, Hastie and Waddy, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: For a short period of time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Very short time, okay.
Speaker 2: For a short period of time he worked, he worked with them and it sort of overlapped the time that he was also teaching at the law school.
Speaker 1: At the law school, okay.
Speaker 2: They were both teaching as well as, as working in the private firm. And of course the crux of their of their practice were basically small cases, nothing like we see today, domestic disputes, wills, contracts that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, their principal focus was on developing the legal strategy to outlaw segregation.
Story_ID: 532056
Speaker 1: Now he's the, he worked as--in race relations for the Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] administration, were there any other blacks on that administration?
Speaker 2: No, he was the only one [sic.].
Speaker 1: All right, did he talk any about Roosevelt and his wife? Was his wife a friend to, to blacks?
Speaker 2: Yes, Eleanor Roosevelt was a very strong friend and supporter to the African American community. And she really, she march with Mary McLeod Bethune and, and others to try to undo segregation in places of accommodation in the retail stores here in the Washington [D.C.] area. I think that one of things that was very much part of the fabric of my father's life was seeing his mother [Roberta Childs Hastie] fight for the rights of others. And he, he--himself when he was in the Roosevelt administration and was assistant to the secretary of the army, wrote several impassioned memoranda about the need to desegregate the [U.S.] Army. And at the time he was the highest ranking black in the federal government. But, he resigned and a lot of his black friends said, "How can you possibly resign don't you know that the whole black race is gonna is, is depending on you to make a difference, to make a change." And his view was that he wasn't going to stay in there and be insulted and rejected by the people that he was working for, when he felt that his cause was very sound. And young black men were asked to go into war [World War II, WWII] to give their lives for a country that didn't want them to be mixing and have the same support, equipment that the white soldiers had. And there were big editorials at the time in the black press saying you know, "Hastie [William H. Hastie] will never be anything, he's just been, you know he should never have resigned." But, he resigned on principal and I respect that.
Story_ID: 532057
Speaker 1: Let's step back a little bit and talk more about your father as governor of the [U.S.] Virgin Islands. Did he share stories about his work there at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, when he was governor of the Virgin Islands I was five years old, my brother [William H. Hastie III] was born in Government House [Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands]. I went to elementary school at the local Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of it?
Speaker 2: Saint Peter's and Paul [Saints Peter and Paul Catholic School, Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Catholic school and stayed there through the fifth grade. When Dad came, this would be back to the islands because as you recall he had been there as a judge before he went to teach at Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]. And he was fairly controversial in the sense that he established the terms or had the legislature approve the terms of the Organic Act [Organic Act of 1936] which was the first major overall of the legislation that really guided the way things were going to be done within the government structure within the tax structure. And there were those particularly the editor then of the largest newspaper who many years later became his brother-in-law, were attacking him in stories saying you know, "Hastie's [William H. Hastie] trying to bring his stateside ideas to our little island. And you know wants to change the way things were done." Well his concern was that the laws were not clear, they were being interpreted by local judges giving favoritism to a lot of the big property owners. And the work force the, the men and women who were conducting their lives responsibly, were in many ways not being supported by the way the laws were being interpreted. So this went on for probably close two years, legislature ultimately passed his recommendations. And that is still the law in the Virgin Islands now. He was I think the first civilian governor after a string of [U.S.] Navy governors were the, the leader of the, of the islands. They, they were presidential appointees most of them were white naval officers. But, he had a very successful term, Truman [President Harry S. Truman] came down to the Virgin Islands and it was the first time that a president had visited the islands and this would have been probably in 1947 or '48 [1948] I believe. And my brother was born in Government House on St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] in 1947.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that in retrospect most Virgin Islanders feel that his tenure as governor was good for the islands.
Story_ID: 532058
Speaker 1: You talk about your broth- your brother [William H. Hastie III] being born there [St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands] and we talked a little bit about your father [William H. Hastie] spoke at your mother's [Beryl Lockhart Hastie] commencement. Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they met on the tennis courts my mother was a, was a big tennis player and dad was too. And I think they, they played tennis couple of times when they were, when she was in high school and he was, he was there as a judge. Subsequently when she went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], he was then dean of Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]. And so they resumed their relationship when, when she came to, to Howard, but tennis is what brought them together originally.
Speaker 1: Okay, what year were they married?
Speaker 2: They were married in 1943.
Story_ID: 532059
Speaker 1: So your father [William H. Hastie] comes back stateside after being governor, tell me what happens now in his career?
Speaker 2: He, as I said he was dean of, of Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], he decided that segregation in the states was only going to change if there was change in leadership at the top. So, he got involved in Truman's [Harry S. Truman] campaign, went through the South eating rubber chicken dinners at churches and talking about Truman, talking about his fairness in terms of how he treated African Americans who were on his staff and working with him. And I think really helped get those extra points that put Truman over Dewey [Thomas E. Dewey] and the, and Truman was very appreciative of, of that. And him named to the, to the governorship in the islands [U.S. Virgin Islands], and subsequently named him to the circuit in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: At this point tell me who are your father's friends?
Speaker 2: Well his closes friends are--originated in the group that went up to Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts], [HistoryMaker] Mercer Cook, Ambassador Cook, Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb] who was head of internal medicine I believe at Howard University Hospital [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.]. And also his cousin Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston], his--he was very much involved in the development of the civil rights strategy that lead to Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]. Thurgood Marshall was his student and also very close friend. And it was through their relationship that I got to know Justice Marshall, he had--my parents had asked him to be one of my godfathers. And he would when we were in Philadelphia after Dad left the governorship, and went on to the Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] in Philadelphia. He would often stop by and spend the night with us when he was on his way down to Washington [D.C.] to argue one of the cases, leading to Brown before the [U.S.] Supreme Court, or to meet with members of, of [U.S.] Congress. So they were his, probably his closes friends, were the individuals, the lawyers that he was working within the, in the Civil Rights Movement. Now bef- that was really before he became a federal judge, because he obviously he couldn't have any officially relationship with them, but certainly they were still very close personal friends, and continued to dialogue on, on issues that were of mutual concern.
Story_ID: 532060
Speaker 1: And Thurgood Marshall you said was one of your godparents.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was your relationship like with him?
Speaker 2: We had a wonderful relationship, he, as I said he I remember the first time he came to our house in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], he walked in to the living room and he was the biggest person I'd ever seen. He was very tall and he was very big. And I sort of cowered behind the sofa and was sort of looking out from behind the sofa, and that was my first recollection of him. And he certainly, he stayed in touch with, with the family as I grew up and went on to college and, and graduate school. And in my third year of law school [Columbus School of Law, Washington, D.C.] he called and he said, "Well, what are you going to do when you finish law school?" And I said, "Well, I think I'd like to do a clerkship," he said, "Well that's the right answer." And I said, "Oh is it?" (Laughter) He said, "Yes," he said, "because I want you to spend the year with Spotts," and this was Spottswood W. Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III] who was then on the D.C. Circuit [U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia], "and then come up and spend a year with me." And I said, "Well gee, I haven't even, I haven't filed you know a, a application or anything." He said, "That's okay," said, "just work very hard on your law review articles and I'll see you in two years if not sooner." So we had a very good relationship and he subsequently asked me to serve as chair of a small committee of four who screened his applications from young law school graduates who wanted to become clerks of the [U.S.] Supreme Court and we did that until he passed away.
Story_ID: 532061
Speaker 1: Was there much talk in your home about the boar- Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]? Did you hear a lot of talk about what they were preparing to go to argue the case?
Speaker 2: I, I did hear a lot, I'll tell you at the time I don't think I absorbed really the depth of, of what they were doing the momentous nature of the, of the, of the case. I know that they were, their conversations were always very intense. And at the time that Dad [William H. Hastie] was teaching at Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], before he became governor [of the U.S. Virgin Islands], he had argued several cases for them, in the [U.S.] Supreme Court including Smith versus Allwright [Smith v. Allwright, 1944], which was the case that overturned the segregation of races in primary elections. Primary elections leading to federal positions and, and several others he was involved in the, the Virginia case [Loving v. Virginia, 1967] that overturned the Virginia law that said it was unconstitutional for a black and white person to be married, to each other. He worked with Spottswood Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III] on a number of the school desegregation cases down in Virginia and in North Carolina. He would critique their briefs, he would be involved in moot courts with them, and would give them you know suggestions and terms of argument strategies, and, and workup responses to questions they knew would come from the opposing side. So while he was teaching at the law school he was, he was quite involved with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], and it's and it's cases. Once he went on the federal bench himself he obviously could not be publicly involved in the, in the cases. But, it didn't mean he had to give up his friendship with Marshall [Thurgood Marshall] or Spotts Robinson or any of the folks who had been working on, on the civil rights cases.
Speaker 1: Right, because he did a, a lot of work on those I guess you would say pre-cases?
Speaker 2: Right, the earlier cases the building blocks leading up to Brown.
Speaker 1: And also Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, Houston was very involved, and Houston (cough) excuse me, Houston passed away unfortunately several weeks before the Brown decision came down. And the, the team of lawyers that worked on, on Brown was a very close group of, of lawyers. And it was only one woman in the group and that was Connie Motley [Constance Baker Motley] who herself became a judge and just passed away a couple of months ago. But, they, they did work and offer each other suggestion they discussed tactics, they did role playing, all the things that you need to prepare yourself for arguments in the in the Supreme Court. And the strategy, which is the one that Charlie Houston really had crafted, was we start with the elementary schools and we show how African American children are being disadvantaged by being in segregated schools, then work our way up through college and through to the professional schools. And it was a very sound, it was a very sound strategy because each case built on the ones that were argued before it.

Speaker 1: And you as a child listening to all of this information what were your thoughts about what you would become?
Speaker 2: Well it's interesting because I, I listened intently to, to all of these discussions but I didn't really think of myself as, as becoming a lawyer. I thought that I was probably more interested in working as a international analyst at, in either the government or in the private sector. And in fact, worked at Mobil Oil [Mobil Oil Corporation; Exxon Mobil Corporation] in their international public relations department for two years, before I went to law school. And had also gotten a master's [degree] in international relations as well. I think probably in the back of my head I was thinking that I might want to go to law school at some point. But, it wasn't 'til I really got back to Washington [D.C.] and realized that this was the, (cough) excuse me, the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] years and there was no job for me in the Nixon state department [U.S. Department of State]. And I said okay that's a message, I think it's time for me go to law school. And I was I was very much interested in human rights issues, I was able to take the first course offered in women in the law at Catholic University law school [Columbus School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 532063
Speaker 1: When you think of a sound, or a sight, or a smell of where you grew up, what comes to mind?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Probably I think of the way the ocean smells, because my earliest childhood memories are really of the [U.S.] Virgin Islands when we lived there and lived in Government House [Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands]. And I used to love to get up early in the morning and go to the balcony on the family quarters level and look out at the ocean. And you could smell the ocean coming, the trade winds would bring the smell to you. So I think that's probably the smell that I would think of.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about sights and sounds?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds probably just a lot of traffic, (laughter) I, when we, when we were in Government House in the Virgin Islands, we--Government Hill [St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands] is just above sort of the center of downtown and there was always traffic going back and forth. There I remember when we in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], we lived in, in wonderful neighborhoods but I remember, before I could drive, my parents [Beryl Lockhart Hastie and William H. Hastie] taking me and my brother [William H. Hastie III] to school and always a lot of, a lot of traffic, a lot of, a lot of noise. There were quiet, there were quiet times too, but I, I think I'm a city kid so the city noises are the things that I probably remember best.
Story_ID: 532064
Speaker 1: Now you went through the fifth grade in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me what school was like for you, in those grades?
Speaker 2: School [Saints Peter and Paul Catholic School, Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands] was fun, I had I enjoyed school the, the nuns were very strict, we wore uniforms and you know weren't supposed to be talking unless talked to. But, I had a number of friends, I, my cousin who's only three years younger, three days younger than I am was in school with me. And she had been born and lived in the islands all her live so I sort of her friends and they became my friends as, as well. When I moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I was in a new school, my brother [William H. Hastie III] and I were the only African Americans in this elementary school, but it was a warm and inviting community and we made friends easily. And it was really my sixth grade teacher, this was at Ellwood Elementary School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], who was the first feminist I actually remember knowing in a sense that she said on a regular basis that you know women can do anything they put their mind to. And she made it a point to call on women, as well as, girls and boys in sixth grade, for you know special assignments to speak before the class to really help empower the women I'm, I'm not sure she was even aware that she was having that effect. About five years ago I got an email from her son who I'd sort of lost track of he was in my grade and it turns out he was professor at the University of Haifa in Israel [Haifa, Israel], but was in Amherst, Massachusetts teaching at the University of Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts Amherst] campus there. And saw on my name on a directory of Amherst trustees and called to say, "Are you the same Karen Hastie [HistoryMaker Karen Hastie Williams] who went to elementary school?" And he, he never he hadn't heard my perspective on his mother and he said, he said in reflection I was right, I was right that she really was ahead of her time. But--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Rose Stowe, S-T-O-W-E (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 532065
Speaker 1: So, what--how was the transition from leaving the fifth grade to come to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because that's where you moved to right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And, and the transition of coming to, to a school where you were only African Americans?
Speaker 2: You know to me it was not a difficult move because I had, I had lived in an integrated society for my early years in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands we had African American friends, Caribbean friends, white friends and so I didn't feel any kind of active if you will discrimga- discrimination, I think when I first entered the elementary school [Ellwood Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I was concerned when I looked around and realized you know I was the only African American student but I didn't have any feeling that there was any hostility to me. The teachers were terrific and very welcoming. And I made friends quickly and really didn't even look back.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was an honor student and was able to participate of a number of special activities that were organized for, for bright students. And--
Speaker 1: What were some of those activities?
Speaker 2: They were mostly cultural activities, we'd go to the symphony or we'd go to a ballet. We had, occasionally there would be different readings we would get when an assignment was given in class that was more difficult, more advanced maybe than the other members of the class, received. But, it was done in a way not to any way to demean the other students but to give us something extra to, to do. And from there I went to junior high school [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for two years, which was a much more challenging experience because A, the students were a little older, that those, those years are very difficult years seventh and eighth grade. And it was not a neighborhood school and in fact there were only two other people from my elementary school that went to that to that junior high school. But, from there I went to Girls' High, and Philadelphia High School for Girls [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is now the only public high school for girls in the country and it was, that was a, that was a terrific experience.
Story_ID: 532066
Speaker 1: And tell me more about the junior high school. What was the name of the junior high school?
Speaker 2: It was Wagner Junior High School [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay. And what year are we in?
Speaker 2: (Pause).
Speaker 1: Well tell me what year you graduated from high school and we can figure it out from there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated from high school in 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So Wagner what was the difficulties there? You said you know you were little older and you were out of your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, what were some of the problems or challenges, I should say?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, the challenges were that most of the students who were there were not very interested in, intellectual endeavors. There was you know, that's a difficult age, boys and girls are first sort of thinking about relationships and you know who's my friend and who's not my friend. And because I didn't come from the elementary school that usually is the feeder school for Wagner, I was sort of an unknown quantity if you will. And I didn't really make very many friends there.  I, I stayed in touch with my friends from the elementary school [Ellwood Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and ironically a number of them wound up being in my high school class at, at Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. But, it was, it, it just was not a very conducive for someone who's really interested in academic issues (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you said that most of the students didn't go to that school where did they go?
Speaker 2: They went to other junior high schools or they went to independent schools in that area.
Story_ID: 532067
Speaker 1: So, Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Everybody knows about Girls' High, my mayor, Shirley Franklin, went to Girls' High.
Speaker 2: Shirley and I were classmates.
Speaker 1: Were you?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, tell me who else were your classmates (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I try to see Shirley when I'm, when I'm down in in Atlanta [Georgia]. It--there were just an extraordinary group of, of young women. And there were I guess there were a class of about, I guess a class of about fifty girls, there were probably ten or twelve African Americans and we were all very close. And everybody who was at the school was really interested in getting a strong academic footing. And it was clear that everyone was going to go on to college. And people were going to graduate school because that was where they saw themselves and how they wanted to, to achieve success in their own, in their own lives. And the teachers at Girls' High were terrific, they were highly demanding you had to have a lot of discipline. And you know we wanted to be engaged in school activities as well as classroom activities so you really had to budget your time. That's the thing I remember most about, about high school is that I really learned how to budget time and how to focus on whatever the issue was at, at hand. But, the teachers really drew out of us a lot of excitement about learning and I think that's, that's, that's the greatest gift that I got from, from that. And I, I, I see Shirley when I'm in Atlanta. A couple of the other women that I, was in school with I saw in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] two years ago. I went up there for a meeting and they were involved in the meeting as well. So it's an interesting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who, who were they, who were they?
Speaker 2: They were classmates from Girls' High, Betty Jane Paine [ph.] and I can see her face Marilyn, Marilyn Brown [ph.] was her maiden name, I don't know what her married name is. But, it was a, it was I guess my first experience feeling the liberation that an all-girls school gives you to be smart. 'Cause you know when you're--one of the things in junior high school [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was a lot of girls sort of pretended you know when the teacher called on them they didn't know the answer. 'Cause they didn't want to seem smart because that wasn't cool. And I wasn't worried about be cool or not cool, I, you know I wanted to get the best I could out of my education. And Girls' High was very liberating.
Story_ID: 532068
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where you grew up?
Speaker 2: This was East Oak Lane [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and my parents [Beryl Lockhart Hastie and William H. Hastie] had looked in a number of different neighborhoods in, in Philadelphia. And they were looking for a house that would be big enough to accommodate both of my grandmothers. Because they thought that, that my Grandmother Hastie [Roberta Childs Hastie] would come from Washington [D.C.] to spend some time with them. And also Grandmother Lockhart [Katherine Ingeborg Lockhart] would come up from the [U.S.] Virgin Islands. Unfortunately, Grandmother Hastie died suddenly of a heart attack, just before they moved into the house. And then Grandmother Lockhart became blind and really didn't want to travel. So we have sort of this very nice big house with lots of lawn and I guess six or seven bedrooms in East Oak Lane. It was an easy bus ride or a walk on a nice day for Bill [William H. Hastie III] and I, for my brother and me to get to school. And that was the principal focus in selecting the, the neighborhood. Most of our neighbors were Jewish and we went to many bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs as we were growing up. There was one other black family a couple of blocks from us and they had children in, not at our elementary school [Ellwood Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] but another elementary school a couple of blocks away. But, my--there was a across the street was a girl and a boy who were just about our ages and, Barbara [Barbara Minsky (ph.)] and Randy Minsky [ph.] and they were probably my best friends in the neighborhood. And we'd go to school together in the morning, we'd play together on the weekends. And it was mostly professionals in the neighborhood, doctors, lawyers, teachers.
Story_ID: 532069
Speaker 1: Was your elementary school integrated?
Speaker 2: We integrated it.
Speaker 1: You did, okay. Oh, that's right you did say you and your brother were the only ones. Tell me about your brother?
Speaker 2: Bill [William H. Hastie III] went to Ellwood Elementary School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], went to Penn Charter [William Penn Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is a private school, for junior high school. Decided he really didn't like it and came to Central High School, which was the school for boys, the big public school for boys, the academic school, which was a block away from Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls] where I went. So we, when we were old enough to drive, we'd drive to school together in the morning and then I'd probably go home on the trolley car or the bus, because he usually had sports after school. And because the two schools, Girls' High and Central, were the principal academic high schools in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], kids in school came from all over the city. So I mean I met Shirley [Shirley Franklin] 'cause she grew up in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and we really met, at, at Girls' High.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about extracurricular, extracurricular activities for you?
Speaker 2: I was involved with the school newspaper, I was also involved in the athletic context- contest they had every year juniors and seniors and that required quite a bit of after school practice and preparation for the athletic contest. And I did some work on the yearbook as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, who were the teachers there that might have influenced you or inspired you?
Speaker 2: I'd say my Latin teacher, Miss Fisher [ph.], was probably the teacher that most inspired me, at, at Girls' High she was very strict but she also helped us to have an appreciation for language and particularly being sensitive to Latin roots, which certainly help me on my SAT exam, on my LSAT exam and also in, in learning foreign languages, because many of French, Spanish or both languages have Latin roots. And she was very determined that the girls that she was teaching were gonna go on to have careers. And she as a spinster herself but she said you know you can have a family and a career. And she was the first person who really sort of articulated that and she pushed us. But, I, I think that she probably--I was very well served by being in her class.
Story_ID: 532070
Speaker 1: How did you decide what college you would go to?
Speaker 2: Well it's interesting, I, I'd heard my father [William H. Hastie] talk about Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] for years and at the time I was ready to go to college it was not coed. I'm please to say that it is coed now. And my son went there as a coed college. So I was looking for a school, a small liberal arts school in New England. And I had looked at a number of schools and the--a young man who had been at Central [Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] who I knew who was actually dating my cousin. Started telling me about Bates [Bates College, Lewiston, Maine] and what a great school it was and how Benny Mayes [Benjamin Mays] had gone there. And it had African Americans for a long time, and it was very open. And I went up and looked at the school and sat in on a couple of classes. And decided you know this is probably as close to the Amherst experience as I was going be able to find in a coed institution. And it turned out to be really terrific, the other thing was they had a very strong junior year abroad program. And I, I wanted to study French and I said well this is a good way to put that into my college experience and it turned out that in fact I went to Switzerland for a year, my junior year to the University of Neuchatel [Neuchatel, Switzerland]. And not only took their course for non-English, non-French speaker but was allowed to take two courses in their law faculty. And in fact wound up doing my senior dissertation when I got back to Bates on the differences and similarities between federalism in Switzerland and federalism in the United States.
Story_ID: 532071
Speaker 1: When you go to Bates [Bates College, Lewiston, Maine], tell me about the experience, how was it different from living in New England and, and living in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: There really wasn't that much of a difference in living in New England, it was a lot colder than it was (laughter) in Philadelphia, but the biggest difference was that you had to be your own time clock. Your professors would give you assignments and you knew when they had to be in, and you had to figure out your time to do the research, to do the writing, this was long before computers. So you know you had to type it on the typewriter. And you had to sort of discipline yourself, there were so many other distractions at college that you know you'd rather than studying for an exam or drafting a paper. But, the classes were small so you really got to know your professors and that was something that I really liked about, about Bates. And in fact it was one of my, my government professors who recommended to me Fletcher School [The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Medford, Massachusetts] in, outside of Boston [Massachusetts] for graduate work I wanted to do in international relations. At the time I thought I wanted to become an international banker. And Allan Cameron was my, was my teacher at Bates, and he said look this is a great school, everybody talks about Johns Hopkins [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.] but this is really equally as good and better particularity if you were thinking about a business career with an international aspect. So that's how I, I moved from Bates, to, to Fletcher but I was, I was still in New England, Maine, and then came down to Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: The year, the years that you attended was '62 [1962] through '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966]. What was going on at on the Bates campus?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean everybody remembers were they were when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot. I was coming down the steps of Hathorn Hall when the bells started tolling. And it, I mean it was a sobering experience for, for all of us. The campus was, there were no fraternities or sororities, which was very good because it meant that you could participate in whatever activity you wanted to. And so I, I worked with the newspaper I and also participated in the, in the French club.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about religion you told me you went to Catholic school, was your family Catholic?
Speaker 2: No, we were Episcopalians but at the time there was no Episcopal high school there, there is one there now, but, but there wasn't any there. And the Catholic school had the strongest academic credentials, and so that's why I went to CU [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.]. But, I grew up as an Episcopalian and, and still Episcopalian. My husband [Wesley S. Williams, Jr.] was originally Baptist and then converted to be an Episcopalian couple of years after we got married, and is now actually in the process of becoming an Episcopal priest as well as a practicing lawyer (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, what else was going on, on the campus?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, there were, there were, there were lots of activities going on the campus. I mean whether you were interested in poetry or sports, there were just a lot of things going on. There were already, always visiting lecturers on any number of different, different topics. There were social events, over the weekend there were plays, it had a very activity drama department. So there were always plays going on and during the winter we'd often go skiing for the weekend or just go for the day 'cause there were a couple of places very close to campus, where you could go skiing. But the, the absences of fraternities and sororities meant that you really weren't any cliques and you know only things for one group of people versus another. So it was, it was there had been African Americans on Bates campus for years. Benny Mays [Benjamin Mays] went to Bates College and a number of distinguished African Americans did as well.
Speaker 1: All right, so you're preparing to get your degree and your degree is in?
Speaker 2: Political science.
Speaker 1: Political science.
Speaker 2: And a wonderful thing--that Dad [William H. Hastie] got an honorary degree, that same year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Say again?
Speaker 2: My dad got an honorary degree from Bates the year that I graduated.
Story_ID: 532072
Speaker 1: So what were your thoughts, you had, well actually yo- you already had the discussion about going to Fletcher [The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Medford, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right, I had talked with my professor, Allan Cameron, about graduate school and he said, "I think you really should apply to Fletcher." And he said, "I'll write a letter telling them that you've been a great student with me and that I think you're a perfect fit for Fletcher." I said terrific I didn't even have to ask him for it. And so I'd, I had spent three years on campus at Bates [Bates College, Lewiston, Maine]. My junior year I was in Switzerland [at the University of Neuchatel, Neuchatel, Switzerland] for the, for the year. 'Cause I wanted to be in French speaking country, to continue practicing my French. And also to learn something about the federal system of cantons in Switzerland. And that's what I wrote my senior thesis on the difference between American federalism and Swiss federalism.
Speaker 1: What differences did you find?
Speaker 2: Well, the principal difference is that the, the structure of the state verses the structure of the canton. While there very similar, the state, the American federalism system gives a great deal of autonomy to the states, less so with the cantons. The cantons have a governmental structure but at the end of the day, it's the federal apparatus that controls money, that controls standards for various different kinds of things, whether it's electrical watts or it's how taxes are, are dispersed among the population. And so it was an, it was an interesting comparison to, to make. And but there are similarities, I mean people who from the Canton Neuchatel [Switzerland] call themselves Neuchateloise they don't say Swiss. You know just like we say we're from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or you know you don't necessarily say I'm a Georgian you say you know I'm an Atlantan.
Speaker 1: I got it okay. So what hap- how do you make the transit?  Do you go directly to Fletcher?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I spent the summer between college and graduation school in St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] working at the, I think that was the summer I was working at the gift shop. And then came back up to Fletcher. I didn't have to worry about finding an apartment because they had campus housing for students there. And we'd already been assigned roommates and I had a terrific roommate from New York who was a interested in international organizations and I was too. So we really hit it off very well. And in the small world category one of my colleagues at, at Fletcher was the son of one of my father's [William H. Hastie] good friends from his days at Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], and that was Ralph Bunche who was head of the department of international affairs at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] before he went to the United Nations [UN]. And young Ralph [Ralph Bunche, Jr.] was my classmate and in fact I'm having a reception for him next month. Fletcher wants to start a Bunche fellowship program to bring governmental public servants from around the world together. To focus on how people can live together in peace. And I think that it's a, it's a terrific idea and I told Ralph that I'd do what I could to help. So we're having about forty people over to meet him to hear about his vision for, for this program as well as the deans.
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your experience at Fletcher?
Speaker 2: Fletcher was a really a wonderful place because a lot of time was spent in really in depth discussions of international issues that were then current as well as issues related to governments and how governments are formed differently and the dynamic that arises out of the way governments are, are formed. We did a lot study of history, studied international law it was, it was a, a fairly board discipline which I thought was very, very helpful. I thought I was going to go into, international banking was sort of what I thought my career path was going to be. A lot of discussion with colleagues, long lunch hour discussions or coffee after a class.
Story_ID: 532073
Speaker 1: And I guess the other important thing was that I met my husband [Wesley S. Williams, Jr.] through Fletcher [The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Medford, Massachusetts] because one of his classmates he had, he had been at Fletcher on a Wilson [Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship] two years earlier. And one of his classmates had done, gone to Brazil for two years working on his dissertation and was back finishing up the year I was there. And we were having lunch, we had lunch and we had one class together I think. And he said you know there's this guy that I really think you should meet. And he called him up and said there's this woman you really should meet. And so he came and had lunch with H. John [ph.] who was this, this, the friend who was working on his dissertation. And we went out a couple of weeks later.
Speaker 2: So, what year did you get married?
Speaker 1: We got married in 1968, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: When did you finish in, at Fletcher?
Speaker 1: I finished at Fletcher in '67 [1967]. I'm sorry we got married '69 [1969], I finished Fletcher in '67 [1967] and we got married in '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: And your degree in Fletcher was?
Speaker 1: Master of Arts.
Story_ID: 532074
Speaker 1: So what happens next?
Speaker 2: I then get a job in New York [New York] when I graduate from Fletcher [The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Medford, Massachusetts], it's a one year program. And my roommate's father worked, had been ambassador to Jordan and was working in Mobil Oil Corporation [Exxon Mobil Corporation]. And they were looking for some young people to work in there public relations and government relations department. And so I applied and got the position and worked with them for two years, it was just the time that oil had been discovered in the Bight of Biafra, the bay off of the Nigeria shoreline. And the people at Mobil knew nothing about Africa they knew nothing about governmental structures. They knew nothing the tribal relationships and they really didn't know what relationships our government had. So I, my task for one of my first assignments was to be in touch with the people at the state department [U.S. Department of State] get as information as I could about Nigeria, the government, the--it's stability, how it was structured, what the tribal conflicts were that existed. And so, I did a lot of research, met with people in, in Washington [D.C.] as well as talk to a good, good number of them. I wish know we'd had the Internet at the time I was doing it, I could have gotten a lot of information just on the Internet I'm sure. And worked with Christian Herter [Christian A. Herter, Jr.], who was then the head of the government relations department at Mobil. So that was in, that was really a very interesting experience. And after two years I decided that you know that I really I really wanted to move out of New York. And we were married by that time and my husband [Wesley S. Williams, Jr.] was getting his master's [degree] at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and also working for Walter Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy], who then vice chairman of the D.C. City Council. And when he finished his, his degree at, at Columbia, we decided to move down to Washington. And that's when I started law school [Columbus School of Law, Washington, D.C.].

Williams, Sr.] was a lawyer, he is a lawyer, his mother [Bathrus Bailey Williams] was an educator; she worked particularly with developmental challenged children. She had two Ph.D.'s, she was really quite a extraordinary person. And Wes [Wesley S.

They have a little boy and a little girl. And they have a, a wonderful home that looks in Brooklyn, looking back at the New York skyline. Our youngest Bailey Williams [Bailey Lockhart Williams] is in San Francisco [California]. He is not married. He works in affordable housing. He works with organizations that have been buying up the brownstones around Union Square [San Francisco, California], and make single room housing out of the upper floors, but, don't know anything about leasing the commercials space of the first floor. So his company, with whom he works, helps the nonprofits to rent out the space. They help build it out, they find them tenants and so he's learning about real estate from the ground up.

Speaker 1: You're getting ready to go back to school.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell--tell me, tell me what happens?
Speaker 2: I, I went I, I did some research on all the law schools in the area. I talked to a number of people and one of the schools that I kept getting good recommendations on was Catholic University law school [Columbus School of Law, Washington, D.C.]. So I went over and I had an interview with the dean. And he was terrific, Clinton Bamberger [E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr.] was his name and he said, "Well this is a very sleepy old law school. I am committed to turning it around. One of the first things I have to do is to get some really strong women in this school, because it's clearly the wave of the future. I've hired two women to teach the first course in women in the law and I really want you to come here." And I said, "Okay," you know it was a, I said they had a good repetition and they have a, a strong faculty and turned out one of the--my contracts professor is no my law partner here. And several of my colleagues here have gone to Catholic University law school as, as well. There were fifteen women in a class of sixty at the time. And Florence Roisman [Florence Wagman Roisman] and Marna Tucker [Marna S. Tucker] we, no Florence Roisman was on the faculty and Marna Tucker and Brooksley Born, who are both law partners in major firms here, were teaching this course on women in the law. And it was very exciting because they were teaching the law from a women's perspective. I mean they were you were learning property law but you were learning about what the rights of a spouse are if you have a divorce and you know do you get half of the house or how does that work. And you know how does the law support women and what does it do to under mind them as, as well. And that was something that, that Bamberger really thought that men and women should be aware of and should be part of the law school curriculum. So I was very pleased with, with Catholic University [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 532077
Speaker 1: So continue telling me about the Catholic [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.]--?
Speaker 2: The classes were quite small at Catholic I think there were no more than twenty-five students in any of my classes. It's gotten much bigger now, they have a whole new facility. I think I got a very good legal education there. I was the first but not the last CU law school [Columbus School of Law, Washington, D.C.] graduate to clerk on the [U.S.] Supreme Court. I've been back a couple of times, most recently I spoke to a group of women students and professors about women in major law firms and where that trend is going. And talked about experiences as, a panel of three of us, all now in different practice settings. But, we all talked about the importance of knowing yourself and having confidence in yourself, when you're interacting with other lawyers, or when you're acting, interacting with a potential hostile witness for example. And we talked about and we talked about the importance of continuing to build relationships, relationships across party lines if you're doing legislative work on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], and understand that at the end of the day that it is personal relationships that actually gets things done. And as lawyers, yes you've gotta know the law, but you also have to be able to communicate your point of view in a way that you can convince the other side or you can convince a jury, if you're in a jury trial, that your point of view is the correct one.
Story_ID: 532078
Speaker 1: So when is it that you being to clerk for Thurgood Marshall?
Speaker 2: I clerked first for Judge Spottswood Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III] in the District of Columbia Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]. And that would have been 1973, fall of '73 [1973] to the summer of '74 [1974]. And then in '74 [1974], I went up to the [U.S.] Supreme Court and clerked for Marshall from the summer of '74 [1974] to the summer of '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Tell me what the experience was like to clerk for Spottswood Robinson?
Speaker 2: The judge was extraordinary, he was the most thorough person I have ever known. He spent hours working on opinions. He devoted a huge amount of time to talking with his clerks, to reviewing materials that they had prepared to discuss arguments that might or might not prevail and get a majority of the panel that was on any given case. He was very dedicated to the law. I think he still holds the record for having the opinion with the most footnotes in the history, of the, of the court. As he said it's important to document everything and show that you have precedent for everything. He was a great teacher and I really learned a lot from him.
Speaker 1: And, and how was it different clerking for Thurgood Marshall?
Speaker 2: Well, the challenge with clerking for Marshall since he'd been such a close friend and mentor of my father's [William H. Hastie] was to do the best that I could do in working on assignments from him, to not inappropriately take advantage of the personal relationship. My two co-clerks who were terrific are now both federal judges. I didn't really want to be a federal judge, I could've, I had an opportunity to put my name in for a judgeship. But, I really wanted to have the freedom of being in private practice. And being able to at the same time to do a lot of work pro- with pro bono organizations, as, as well. But, I learned a lot from both the Doug Ginsburg [Douglas H. Ginsburg] and my co- and my other--and my other co-clerk Bill, Bill it'll come to me. Bill Bryson, William Bryson [William Curtis Bryson] was my other co-clerk, there were only three then, now I think there four or five for each justice. But, it was a very heady experience, but you had to keep your feet on the ground and keep focused. It was very demanding from the time standpoint but it was also very exhilarating. And it was an experience that so few lawyers get to have that I, I try to sort of make every minute of it worthwhile and to be supportive, of, of the justice. And you know people said, "Oh, it's going to be a really walk over for you, you're not gonna have to really work, 'cause he's your godfather." I said, "Look, no, I'm gonna have to work harder than everybody. 'Cause he's gonna be tough on me and I know it. Because wants me to be tough," and he was, he, he was a terrific person to work with and, and just to, just to hear him repeat some of the stories that I knew, that my co-clerks had never heard about the early days when he was representing people all over the South. And of course today young people don't understand why in his, at his funeral I quoted from something that he in fact told me. He said and then--'cause people said, "Well, why did you keep going back even with all that hostility?" He said, "It's because I, you know I knew there was no one else who was really going to help the people. And I knew that, when they knew that the lawyer was coming," because there was only one lawyer that they knew and that was Justice Marshall. 'Cause he was then the director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.]. And we think today about pro bono activities being done in all major law firms across the country. And all kinds of civil rights groups who have lawyers, but then he created the first public interest law firm. And what an enormous contribution that is if he hadn't done anything else. But, it was a, it was a, it was an awesome experience and he, he was, he was a terrific teacher.
Story_ID: 532079
Speaker 1: Compared to your father's [William H. Hastie] temperament, what were the differences?
Speaker 2: My father was much less mercurial than Justice Marshall [Thurgood Marshall] was. He always spoke in very even tones. He was, I mean they, they both were very diligent about the, about the law. But, but Marshall having argued cases and had to you know sleep with his shoes on, because you never when the lynch mob was gonna be coming down the street. And wherever they went, they always an alternate exit strategy if something like that happened. And having been firsthand in those kind of experiences I think gave Marshall a, a stronger perspective on his role. And what he needed to do, to help other African Americans have open opportunity to education, to housing, to services of, of all kinds. Dad was more of an intellectual and he and Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] both really provided the intellectual strategy and the logic of the strategy that lead to Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and clearly when I was, the year I was with Justice Marshall, he was clearly in, a minority on the court [U.S. Supreme Court], so we were writing a lot of dissents not very many major majority opinions. And one of my co-clerks said to him once, "Judge do we really have to write you know a full-fledged opinion here 'cause it's just a dissent." And the justice's response was, "Today's dissent may be tomorrow's majority opinion. You put every piece of detail in there you can to support our point of view."
Story_ID: 532080
Speaker 1: So what happens next for you, after law school [Columbus School of Law, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: After law school, I clerked for Judge Robinson, Spottswood Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III] and then for Marshall [Thurgood Marshall].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then after clerking for Marshall I went to Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Kampelman law firm [Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP] here in Washington [D.C.]. Patricia Roberts Harris was then a partner at the firm and she had known my mother [Beryl Lockhart Hastie] at, at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and had known my dad [William H. Hastie], knew Justice [Thurgood Marshall]. And she had called me when I was in law school and said you know, "When you finish clerking," she said, "'cause I know you're going to clerk. Why don't you think about applying here for a job?"  No, I guess it was when I was still in law school 'cause it was a summer law clerk position, which I did. And then when I finish clerking I called and spoke with her and Max Kampelman who I had worked with that summer and wanted to know if they were still hiring for, for the fall. And they said absolutely and so I worked with them for three years. And then I had a call from a former colleague of my husband's [Wesley S. Williams, Jr.] on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] who had just been promoted from general counsel to the budget committee [U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget] to be staff director. And he said, "I need a general counsel and I'd like you to think about coming up and working with us on the Hill." And at the time Ed Muskie [Edmund Muskie] who also was a graduate of Bates College [Lewiston, Maine], was the chairman of the committee. And I said, "Well let," I said, "I'm really delighted and thrilled that you thought of me but let me think about it and get back to you." So I had lunch that day with Max Kampelman, who was a senior partner in the firm. In fact they're in this building now, they weren't at the time. And he had been with Hubert H. Humphrey [Hubert Humphrey], for a number of years. I said, "Max what should I do? I'm just starting out my law career with the law firm, I don't want people to think I can't hold down a job. I'm jumping from one job to another, so quickly but this is a real opportunity." And he said to me, "Look you want to be a Washington lawyer, you're not gonna be a really good Washington lawyer until you've been on the other side of the table. You have to have government experience you need to understand the Hill, Ed Muskie is a very sound person," 'cause he had worked with Muskie when he was working with Humphrey he said, "I would jump on it in a nanosecond, the law firms will be here when you finish working up on the Hill." So I took his advice and, and went up and had two fed- wonderful years up there working on, on issues on the federal budg- on the federal budget, because the budget committee had just been formed a few years earlier to establish a congressional budget. And it was in the context of working there I got to know Jim Miller [James C. Miller III], who was the head of OMB [Office of Management and Budget], and he calls me one day two years later and says, "I've just lost the head of my office of federal procurement, the federal procurement system is in a, is in a swift fall, I need someone with new eyes to come down and look at this and make recommendations to me. Will you come down?" And I thought about and I said, well if I take Max at his word he said you gotta understand government. I've done the legislative branch I guess I have to go do the, the executive branch.
Story_ID: 532081
Speaker 1: So I went down to the White House to OMB [Office of Management and Budget] and spent a year and a half down there working as the head of the Office of Federal Procurement and Policy [Office of Federal Procurement Policy], which is an executive office located within OMB.
Speaker 2: And tell me what that experience was like?
Speaker 1: That was a very interesting experience because my, my job was really to put pressure on the federal--the major federal cabinet offices to do more with contracting out to women, to people of color. That was a real agenda item. And this was the Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] administration. And so I did that and I remember having a conver- a meeting with Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell], who was then the, I guess it's called the special assistant to the secretary of defense. And he said to me and I had not known him before, but I walked in, and he said, "Before we have a conversation I have to tell you that your father [William H. Hastie] changed my life." I said, "Oh my, how did he do that?" He said, "Well, he was the chairman of the Commission on White House Fellows [President's Commission on White House Fellowships] and he picked me out of a group of thirty candidates to be one of the people who was a White House Fellow. And I choose to come over and work with the secretary of defense," and here he is now back again on another tour. And he said, "I really want to help you, I know that the [U.S.] military should be doing better. But, I've gotta tell you when I run up against these three stars and four stars [four star general]," this was before he had all of his stars, "it's very difficult." I said, "Well I'm just looking for--I realize you can't change everything overnight, I'd like to just see some progress." And I, we talked about strategies that he might use. And I told him, I'd provide him some additional information as to what was going on in other agencies. So that was a particularly interesting time when I was in OMB, because I was interacting with a lot of senior people in government. And working also with people up on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.]. So I think that the two governmental experiences both at the budget committee [U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget] and at OMB were very instructive. In terms of building my experience level to be able when I went back into private practice, to be able to help clients negotiate within the federal structures.
Speaker 2: So you leave there in 1981?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 532082
Speaker 1: And then I came here to the law firm of Crowell and Moring [Crowell and Moring LLP, Washington, D.C.] and worked with the government contracts group here. And two years later became a partner.
Speaker 2: In two years?
Speaker 1: Now I had been, of course I'd had been at Fried, Frank [Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Kampelman; Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP] for three years and then had had the other work. And ordinarily the timeframe is six to, it's about six years to a partnership but since I had done all of these other things they decided to consider me at an earlier point in time.
Speaker 2: Why decide on this firm, it's a, it, it at that time it was a small firm.
Speaker 1: Well yeah, it was, it was about forty lawyers at the time. It's about six hundred now.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: And it, it had a very active group of lawyers who were involved with the American Bar Association public contract law section. And I had spoken to the public contract law sections a couple of time when I was at OMB [Office of Management and Budget], heading the Office of Federal Procurement and Policy [Office of Federal Procurement Policy]. And I knew that they had the kinds of clients that I thought would appreciate and would be able use to my expertise. And I talked to a number of other firms but I really liked the people here and Took Crowell [Eldon H. Crowell] in particular is just an extraordinary person a very good lawyer and someone who really energizes people. And I thought it would be, it would be a good fit.
Story_ID: 532083
Speaker 1: Now tell me about some of the other organizations that you work with and you're on plenty of boards. So tell me which ones are dear to your heart? I, gu- well I'm, I'm sure all of them are, but talk about the ones, that you would like to give us the information about?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm on five corporate boards and about a half dozen nonprofit boards. My corporate boards are extremely interesting and very challenging, they're in different sectors of the economy so I get to take to take lesson learned in one context and apply them to, to other companies as, as well. In chairing three audit committees in the new world post Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002] it means a lot of work and a lot of time. I'm on airplanes quite a bit, although we do a lot of conference calls, there's a certain need to be physically present for I think a good number of meetings these days. I am on the board of the Continental airline [Continental Airlines], the Chubb insurance company, the Gannett Company [Gannett Co., Inc.], SunTrust Bank [SunTrust Banks] and Washington Gas [Washington Gas Light Company]. And as I said they're each in different sectors of the economy which really helps me I think to have multiple perspectives on issues related to corporate governments, the role of the audit committee. I'm lucky to have five very good, very strong CEOs that I'm working with. Who are very conscious of the need to be in communication with their directors on a regular basis, 'cause the last thing any director wants to do is pick up The Washington Post, The New York Times and see your name splatter across the, the front page. So they, they keep me very busy. And the nonprofits I'm working with are also extremely interesting and, and are in areas where I really care a lot. I, I, I always knew that eventually get involved in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] and I now chair the development committee of the, of the board. It's a tremendous organization and it does great work and really is at the cutting edge of [U.S.] Supreme Court litigation where issues of race are involved. And since dad [William H. Hastie] was one of the original incorporators of LDF I thought gee I think I'm going to be involved, with them, as, as well. The Black Student Fund here in Washington [D.C.] is an organization that helps low income children get into and thrive in the independent schools, of the Washington area. And we've got forty-four member schools in the fund. We have counselors who review the report cards of each one of our students if there's a need for some tutoring we provide that. If the child's having difficulties reading the blackboard we get them glasses. If a parent can't pay the rent we'll pay the rent for a month or electricity bill anything to build a support system under that child, that a middle income or wealthy person is gonna in his or her family. And when we do something for one child, if one child needs a pair of shoes, we'll get shoes for the whole family 'cause we don't want them to feel that, that their brother or sister has something that they don't have. So the fund has been around for forty-four years, it's been quite successful. We continue to attract more people to support the fund, because of the good work it does and the, and the great track record that, that it has.  I'm also working with an organization called BOLD initiative, which stands for Better Opportunities for Leadership Development [sic. Business Opportunities for Leadership Diversity]. And we work with Fortune 500 companies to development strategies to bring more people of color into management at major companies. And more recently have been working on a work place flexibility program, that allows men and women to work together to develop a work schedule that meets their respective needs. And the results have been phenomenal.  We've increased productivity as well increasing the active work of members of the groups that we're, we're working with. They're happy in their jobs, they're being more productive. I mean from the employer's standpoint it's a win-win organization. And I'm involved in a number of other smaller non-profits as well.
Story_ID: 532084
Speaker 1: You were the chair for the Red Cross [American Red Cross] governance advisory committee (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you spoke before the House [U.S. House of Representatives], what--tell me what that was about?
Speaker 2: I got a call about four months ago from a friend, a lawyer who, who I'd known and we'd actually gone to church together and his kids were in my sons'--my husband's [Wesley S. Williams, Jr.] Sunday school class, John Olson [John F. Olson]. And John had been retained by the Red Cross to look at some of their organizational and structural issues. And he called and he said the Red Cross really needs help in completely revamping its governance process. It is an organization that is very unwieldy and there were clearly pressures coming from the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] as well, for reform. So I agreed to join this group of six people, several of whom were on other corporate boards. One was on the faculty of Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]. And we went through, I guess almost six months of reviewing interviews that had been conducted with all of the major players at the Red Cross, over a period of the last ten years. And basically what we did was we developed good governance procedures for them that they could use to more effectively manage their organization. And since I had been asked to chair the committee on government--governance, Congressman Lantos [Tom Lantos] asked me to come up and testify 'cause one of the things we recommended were changes in the charter to the Red Cross and the charter was created by [U.S.] Congress. So to amend it you have to go to Congress to, to do it. So he was holding a hearing and the provision is now passed, the bill has the House and the [U.S.] Senate and will probably by the president within the next two weeks. And they adopted really all of the recommendations that our committee recommended. And I'm, I'm very pleased for the Red Cross, 'cause I think it's a, it's a very important organization. And you know it sort of fell off the rails with some of the problems that occurred with Katrina [Hurricane Katrina]. But, I think they're really back intact. And they've just announced the hiring of a new CEO, who I worked with a little bit when I was on an oversight committee created for the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], about ten years ago, I guess. And he's gonna be the new head, the CEO of the Red Cross, so I think he'll do a very good job.
Speaker 1: The Red Cross did come under scrutiny during Katrina. Do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: I think that Katrina was such an enormous challenge for everybody. No one had seen a storm of that size and dimension impacting such a wide group of people. And you know it's like preparing for the Hundred Years' War, you're never really quite prepared. And I think that there was a lot of missed cues and you weren't quite sure who was taking the lead in a number of situations. I think what this reform legislation does is gonna make the Red Cross much more nimble and able to work in that kind of a situation. And another important thing it did was, and I hadn't even realized it, the Red Cross here before really had not worked with local organizations, churches, schools and other organizations. And now they've made a commitment that you know that, in a major catastrophe that they would, or even if it's just a local one. They'll use the resources and help the resources that are already in place, schools, churches and other large buildings that can hold people and keep them safe during any kind of, of a disaster.
Story_ID: 532085
Speaker 1: I think the Red Cross [American Red Cross] is a very important organization. I think it had gotten very top heavy and what this new legislation does is to allow, amend the charter to allow for the board to really have a policy role, but, also to create a CEO who actually is the day to day person, who runs the organization and manages the organization. And I think that the smaller board working with the CEO is going to be very effective, and provides a role for the chapters to be able to play in making recommendations, but, not actively trying to run the day to day operations, which some of the chapters felt they should be able to do. But, it's a, it's a good organization obviously it has--it's the international participant when the, things like the tsunami [2004 Indian Ocean tsunami] and the American government is asked to contribute resources that goes through the Red Cross. So it really has a very important mission and I think it will be able to, to carry it out well. And Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, who is the current soon to be retired head of--chairman has done a masterful job. And she worked very hard to get this legislation, to get all of her board members, they had a board of fifty people, in today's age you cannot operate with a board that large. It's very difficult to build a consensus and you wind up creating cliques among the, the organizations. I'm very lucky that Crowell Moring [Crowell and Moring LLP] is the kind of law firm that allows me the flexibility to be able to involve--to be able to be involved with things like the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] Oversight Board, like the work on the special governance commission for the, the Red Cross.
Story_ID: 532086
Speaker 1: My practice [Crowell and Moring LLP] is really focused on the legislative aspects of government contracts, so I spend a lot of time on, on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.]. In recent years however I've been involved in the firm's terror- practice in the area of terrorism, which sounds like a strange subject for a corporate law firm. But, we were approached, oh it's gotta be five or six years ago by Terry Anderson [Terry A. Anderson] who had been captured by the Iranians and held for six and a half years. And he wanted to bring a case against the Iranian government, and to get compensated for that. And two of my business crimes partners worked on the, the criminal side of the, of the case and actually got him a successful judgment under current law. But, the question was how could the judgment be enforced against Iran because the, the shah clearly was no longer there.  There's a different government there.  And so we started to look and see if there were any Iranian resources that might be available to provide compensation to not only Terry Anderson but a number of the other people who had been held hostage also came to us after Terry did, to see if we could help them. And fortunately, because of my experience on Capitol Hill and my experience in working in OMB [Office of Management and Budget] I can read between the lines in the budget that's produced every year. And in talking with people on Capitol Hill as well as the treasury, I was able to identify a fund that was holding money that the shah had sent to buy weapons the week before he was deposed, and the money had been sitting in a non-interest bearing account for thirty years (laughter). And so we negotiated with the state department [U.S. Department of State] and treasury department [U.S. Department of the Treasury], we worked with a couple members of [U.S.] Congress who had constituents who were involved, and were able to get legislation passed that allowed those funds to be used to pay these victims of terrorism. So, we now have a terrorism practice which is hardly the thing you'd expect of a corporate law firm. As a result of that, the family of one of the twelve Americans killed in the Kenya embassy bombings in 1998, came to me and said, "Can you help us get compensations for these families?" 'Cause in this case there's clear evidence that Al-Qaeda committed the bombing, in fact there was a trial in New York [New York] two years ago, but that the American government at the time knew that there was an Al-Qaeda cell operating in Nairobi [Kenya] and well as in Tanzania, that the ambassador had come to the United--had come back several times to the state department asking for additional security. And even temporary security if the money wasn't readily available to just get some barriers put up. Because there were intelligence reports and military reports that this cell was operating and that the embassy was a perfect target for a truck bomb. And she was told by Washington to go back and stop complaining and two days after her last visit the embassy was bombed. And there were twelve Americans who lost their lives. And the daughter of, of and sister of two of the people who were killed came to us and said, "Can help us to get compensation?" So I've been working on that for the last couple of years with the, with the families. And we're really close to getting something done for them so that they can have some closure. But, you never know when you're in a Washington [D.C.] law practice what kinds of really extraordinary cases are going to come into your, into your life. And this has been one where I'm determined that I'm going to see the, that these families have relief and can have some closure.
Story_ID: 532087
Speaker 1: When you think back over your life is there something that you have not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: I've been very fortunate that I've really been able to do everything that I set out to do, that I wanted to do. I've been able to have the support of a very strong family. And a family that understands the personal fulfillment that I get from being a lawyer, from working both with, with my companies as well with nonprofits. My kids are very well grounded and their expectations are, you know my daughter [Amanda Williams Calhoun] says of course I'm gonna have a career and have a family. As, as, as do my two sons [Wesley Hastie Williams, and Bailey Lockhart Williams] and that's, that's important to me that they, they see their life from that, from that perspective. But, I, I can't really say there's anything that I haven't had the opportunity to do that I really wanted to do.
Story_ID: 532088
Speaker 1: Because this information your, your story will be available for future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generation?
Speaker 2: I guess I'd say education is a key to success and it's important to get the most out of your educational experiences, to go through doors that you might not have expected to go through, have confidence in yourself and your ability to be a communicator, and take opportunities when they, when they come along. Learning English and learning about other cultures early on is very important. The world is getting smaller and smaller, instant messaging, instant communication, so it's important that you know something about Bangladesh or something about people who are of a different color than you are, a different religion than you are. Because you will encounter people from different backgrounds, and always look for things that you have in common than rather than things that are different.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything that you would like to add that we have not spoken about?
Speaker 2: No I think you've covered just about everything.
Speaker 1: All right, well I'd like to thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to share your story with us for The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Well thank you very much I've enjoyed the opportunity.
