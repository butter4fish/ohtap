Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Edgar Carey Lane.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I'm Clarence Maurice Mitchell the III.  C-L-A-R-E-N-C-E, M-A-U-R-I-C-E, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L, Roman numeral three III.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December the 14th, 1939, born in St. Joseph's Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm in business for myself presently, and a political consultant, presently.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you have been a--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: In the Maryland State Legislature.
Speaker 2: For twenty-four years I was a member of the Maryland State Legislature. I was--in 1962, at the age of twenty-two, I was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates.  At the age of twenty-six, I was elected to the Maryland State Senate, where I served for twenty years.  And that--by my participation in the political arena came from the exposure that my father gave to us to the governmental process, and the value of participation in the political system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is August the 6th, 19--I mean, 2004. (Laughter) 2004, right.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?  And, you don't have to give your address, but--
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  We are presently in my home in Baltimore [Maryland], which-- where I've lived for the last twenty-three years.
Story_ID: 192338
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type lightweight questions that I'm compelled to ask you, and they only require a lightweight answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, my favorite food is, I would have to say, steak. (Laughter) In fact, really, my favorite meal when I go to the better restaurants is surf-n-turf, steak and lobster.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I have grown up learning to enjoy all different times of the year.  I guess if I had to choose one time, it would probably be spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The beach. (Laughter) The water, any place where the water is, which would include the Caribbean.  I guess probably my favorite would be the Caribbean.  The Bahamas, Trinidad, that area.  Jamaica.
Speaker 1: And the final question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's a--it's really a poem that is my favorite, a short poem.  And it was written by Robert Blake, the movie actor.  And it goes, "He's an old blind bear alone in the winter woods, with only the smell of his breath for comfort.  Too mean to die, too old to care.  But show some caution.  He's still the bear."  And that has been a favorite.  I have used that in speeches all over the country in trying to convey that it is important that we not put our older generation on the shelf, and be reminded that we can learn from the older generation.  My colleagues in the [Maryland State] Senate nicknamed me "The Bear", and they call me The Bear because they said, when I was really riled up, they could hear my voice all the way across the hall in the [Maryland] House [of Delegates] chamber, even though I was in the Senate.  And I have been blessed--was blessed with a booming voice, and I would use that on occasions when I was in heated debate on the floor of the Senate.  And I got their attention.  And one of the greatest tributes that one of my colleagues, who was a conservative member of the Senate was quoted, newspaper report--I was conducting a filibuster against the death penalty.  And this senator was rushing to get back to the House--to the Senate floor.  And they said, but why--the reporter asked him, but why are you rushing to get back to the Senate floor?  He said, "I understand [HistoryMaker] Clarence Mitchell's [III] coming up next, and I don't want to miss anything he has to say."  Well, that was due to the fact that I didn't just conduct a filibuster and read from phone books.  I did research and I made the content of my filibuster educational, so that my colleagues would--under normal filibuster circumstances, the floor is empty.  But whenever I was on the floor, conducting a filibuster, the maximum number of senators would be in there, because they figured they'd pick up something they could utilize.
Story_ID: 192339
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I know we've interviewed [HistoryMaker] Michael Mitchell [Sr.], he's covered this, a lot of this in detail, real real detail.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker Dr.] Keiffer Mitchell, too.  But it's good to get your perspective on it.  I want to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family, and we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's full name was Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell.  J-U-A-N-I-T-A, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.  And then Elizabeth was her middle name.  E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H.  And Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.  Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in January 2, 1913 in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how far back can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we can trace that side of the family actually back to Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.  My mother's mother was a descendant of Charles Carroll of Carrollton.
Speaker 1: This is Carrollton, Virginia?
Speaker 2: No, Carrollton [Buckeystown, Maryland], here in Maryland.
Speaker 1: Oh, ok.  Carollton, Maryland.
Speaker 2: It was the Charles Carroll family was one of the English families that originally settled in Maryland.  And Charles Carroll was a U.S. senator from Maryland when the government was first formed, and he was also a state senator.  Held both offices.  He had an illegitimate, or had a child by one of his slaves, who was my maternal grandmother's [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] great-great-grandfather.  And so it was my grandmother who went back and traced the roots.  So we could go back that far on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's back to the 1790s, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, I don't know the exact years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a signer of the--
Speaker 2: Declaration of Independence, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So-
Speaker 1: That's 1776, and you're not--you're really not sure when your ancestor was born, are you, or--
Speaker 2: No.  I'm not sure, the date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And brother Michael would know that.
Speaker 1: Somewhere in the late 1700s.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  Late 1700s.  He--then on my mother's father's side of the family, they were--they went back to Mississippi, Carrollton, Mississippi, back to my grandfather's father, who was Scott.  And his mother was half-African American and half-Cherokee Indian.  They lived in Carrollton, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Carrollton, Mississippi, too? Or--
Speaker 2: Carrollton, Mississippi, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we had two Carrolltons, here?
Speaker 2: Well, there's no, there's--there is no Carrollton town in Maryland. There's no--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Carrollton was, Charles Carroll of--Carrollton was the plantation that he owned.  Carrollton Plantation.
Speaker 1: So, Carrollton Plantation.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: That's still ironic, though, that they both--
Speaker 2: It is very ironic, that they would have come--(Laughter)
Speaker 1: So these are Jacksons from--well, they're not Jacksons yet, or are they?  From Carrollton, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, they were Jacksons--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Carrollton, Mississippi, which was down in the Mississippi Delta.
Story_ID: 192340
Speaker 1: My grandfather [Keiffer Albert Jackson]--Mississippi was so mean, and he looked white, but he was so upset over the treatment of African Americans because he always knew what his roots were.  He was African even though he looked white.  And he walked out of Mississippi to get away from the treatment of his relatives.  And he wouldn't even go back to Mississippi for the funeral of his brother, who he was very close to.  But he was--he had such hatred for the racism and the meanness of Mississippi.  And he, therefore, I am convinced, pushed my grandmother [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] to become a civil rights leader.  And he stayed in the background, and he felt that he--from my conversations with him, he felt that he was too far from--that there would be no credibility 'cause they would look at him as a white man trying to--on some kind of agenda.  That was not--people used to ask my grandmother, "Is your husband white?"  And my grandmother's reply always was, "He's too colored to be white, and he's too white to be colored."  (Laughter) She said, "He's just my husband!"  And that was how she would respond to the inquiries as to what race he really was.  He was perfect--I mean, he washed the clothes, he helped to do all the--he was a "Mister Mom" in those days, so my grandmother could be free to be out front on the--as a civil rights leader, president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the state of Maryland for some thirty-five years.
Speaker 2: Just another word on him.  He was a--he was unique and special in the sense that he was producing film, was he?
Speaker 1: Yes.  He was a film exhibitor.  And basically what he did, he would--developed all the equipment, bought the equipment, that sort of thing, and he would travel in the rural Southern communities, where the movie theater would only accommodate whites.  He would set up in the churches, and he would show movies for the benefit of the people and charge admission.  And he also had a little added feature where he would come into the town several weeks before he had--he was to do his exhibit, and take movies of the people in the town, and develop them, and they were a part of his presentation.  So, letting them know, "Come on, see yourself on the big screen," which was an extra incentive for folks to come and pay admission to see whatever movies he was able to get from the big screen, but also see themselves on a movie.  And we used to see--he would show us these movies of these Southern towns where he had gone in, taken pictures of the local people, and that sort of thing.  One of the things that was really a great loss; he had had all these movies that he had stored.  When we went to try to revive them, they were the old mercury-type and had destroyed themselves in storage.  They were unable to take anything off of them.  He also was the one that felt it was so important to record events and family activities and that sort of thing for history.  We were able to get a lot of the history before us from the movies that he would show to us on various holiday occasions.  We would go to Grandpa and Grandma Jackson's home, and we'd have dinner, and then after dinner he would have his 16 mm projector and would show movies of the past, when he'd gone into these places and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 192341
Speaker 1: Is there any story about how he [Mitchell's maternal grandfather, Keiffer Albert Jackson] got started in the movie business back in those days?  He certainly would be like one of the early pioneers, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.  He was very early.  I don't know how he got into it.  [HistoryMaker] Michael [Mitchell, Sr.] may have some information on that.  But I know that he just--oh, also, once he met my--he was doing this, which is how he met my grandmother.  But then after he met her and they married, he then continued to go on the road and he would take his wife [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] and his children with him and had a performance.  They would sing.  My mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] was held up to be kind of in the realm of the supernatural, like she could guess certain things about people that made it appear that she had these supernatural powers, but what it really was was my grandmother had taught her, certain words meant certain things.  For example, she would say, "What am I touching now?"  And the touching meant, a man with a bald head.  So she would say out to the crowd, "Oh! You're touching a man, an old man with a bald head." And that would--crowd would get--those kinds of things were--they did a family show of entertainment along with the exhibition of the movies.
Speaker 1: It's interesting, there's a picture--I know your brother showed me--that we haven't recorded yet, but--of your grandfather sitting with a suit on, on an ox.  And the ox is pulling a cart.  I mean, a wagon.  You know, one of the old medicine show-type wagons.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: That must have been quite a spectacle, with him coming to town.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And the thing is, he's in a suit, he's riding an ox!
Speaker 2: Oh that's--he was a showman. My grandmother, too. They knew--they worked in concert.  My grandmother had a beautiful voice, was quite a singer.  And she would sing and the children would sing and, I mean, they just did--I've talked to people when I was growing up who were around when they did these presentations, because they didn't just do them in the South, they did them around Baltimore [Maryland], and in Maryland, different rural parts of Maryland, and Delaware, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: We had a former president of UDC--University of the District of Columbia, [Washington, D.C.] whose name I can't remember now, we interviewed him, black man--remembers from when he was a kid.  He didn't know the name, but he said a man came around with an oxcart showing movies, it was a husband and wife.  And I said, I said--I jumped up out of the seat.  I was listening the interview to evaluate it, you know, and I jumped up out of my seat, and I said, "That's the Mitchells"--"That's the Jacksons!" rather.
Speaker 2: The Jacksons.  And I--you know, the--it's interesting, Ebony magazine did a story on the Jackson-Mitchells of Maryland in the early '50s [1950s].  At that time, of course, I was young.  My mother and grandmother were the activists in the community and of course my father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.].  But in that article they did, part of the--they were suggesting that this family would be making greater contributions to upward mobility of the African American community.  And sure enough, I ended up being elected to the Senate, my brother [HistoryMaker Michael Mitchell, Sr.] was on the city council, my uncle [HistoryMaker Parren J. Mitchell III]--U.S. Congress.  From these various positions we were able to definitely make a difference in the lives of people not just in the state, but all over the country.  Because the number of elected officials were so small that those of us who were around--and of course I was in Ebony and Jet all the time, so people would call on me to come speak.  I helped [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond set up his first campaign, I helped Maynard Jackson set up his first campaign in Atlanta [Georgia].  I went to other states where African Americans were planning to run and gave them the benefit of my experience.
Speaker 1: Now--and the roots of this experience go back to your grandfather and your grandmother, experiences with people on the road, meeting them, and that whole--the presentation. Because from what I understand, from what I've heard others say, too, is they always have a spiritual or moral content to their productions, even though it was a, you know, you had the mind reading thing going.  But it was--the whole of their presentation of the movies and what they had to say brought the communities they came to closer together.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Where people would recognize themselves in their communities; see themselves in a different light.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And certainly with that technology they saw themselves in a more powerful position than they--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: They see themselves on the screen.
Speaker 2: And it was inspirational.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was definitely that foundation that gave all of us, even my father--my father was--came from a poor family, eleven kids.
Story_ID: 192342
Speaker 1: --I just want to talk about Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson--
Speaker 2: Lillie Mae Carroll.
Speaker 1: And she--her political organizing, and then your mother's [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] history, and then we'll get to your father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.], and bring all that in.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, my grandmother, Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, was a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland].  And a doc went in for an operation, the doctor made a mistake and severed the mastoid muscle in her face.  In order to cover up his mistake, he had wheeled her out to where the cadavers were and pronounced her dead.  He left the hospital.  An intern came by, and her arm moved.  And the intern said, "Oh, this lady's still alive!" and had her wheeled back into the operating room.  And she said, and used to say quite often, "As I lay on that operating table, I made a commitment to the Lord.  I said, if you allow me to live, to raise my children, I will work for you on behalf of my people and I will serve the people."  And that was her commitment on a hospital gurney after she had been pronounced dead and was given another chance at life.  Her face was twisted and that's what it came from.  So she, in raising her kids, also was involved in the community and that sort of thing.  And then Dr. Carl [J.] Murphy, who was then the head of The Afro [Afro-American Company], met with her and asked her if she would revive the Baltimore [Maryland] branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  That it had been faltering, there was no activity.  And he committed that, "If you'll take the leadership, I'll back you up with my newspaper, with The Afro.  The Afro will be there for you."  And she agreed to do that.  And as a result, through her labor, she organized an NAACP branch in every county from the State of Maryland.  She had--the Baltimore branch for many years was the largest branch in the country, even though there were other cities that had far greater black populations.  She had a network of membership recruiters in every church, every community organization.  And she would go tirelessly from church to church, checking in with the NAACP membership committee of the church, and our--now, most pastors, they don't want no outside committees raising money in the church.  So for her to have been able to persuade so many pastors to have an official NAACP membership committee in the church was a tribute to her sales ability.
Speaker 1: Talk about that some.  I think you talked about what her method was.  There was a certain sweetness that she applied to these things and was able to get great results.
Speaker 2: Oh yes. She was always about sweetness.  Like I said earlier, you know, she always told us, "It's nice to be nice."  And she would say to us, when she wanted to get us to do something that we really didn't want to do, she done that grandma sweet-sugar "Come on over here.  I gotta get you to do this."  Well, she had that same kind of--not those exact words, but that's how she treated the pastors.  She would say to the pastors, "Now, you know I need you on this.  Now, we gotta put this in place."  And, you know, she would play up to their egos.  And those preachers, when my grandmother was finished with those preachers, boy, their chests would be sticking out they'd give her anything she wanted.  My grandmother would go into churches on Sundays, I'm not talking about what somebody told me.  She used to take us along with her.  And she would go into churches.  She would hit three or four churches a Sunday, and go right up to the front of the church, sit right up on the front row, get the pastor's attention, and eventually the pastor would say, "All right, now we have Dr. Lillie Jackson here.  We're gonna give her about five minutes, Mrs. Jackson."  And she would stand up, when she'd finish she'd have about ten, fifteen minutes but she had made her appeal for NAACP memberships, or made her appeal for attendance at a big rally, civil rights rally.  My grandmother had thousands of people at her rallies.  But it was hard work.  A lot of folks want to sit back now and you know, issue a call through the media and expect people to show up.
Story_ID: 192343
Speaker 1: I look at the way [HistoryMaker Minister] Louis Farrakhan mobilized those folks.  I mean, that wasn't the something that he just issued a call through the media and that's what.  He had committees working in every state.  He had committees in cities.  There were all of these Million Man March committees that were all over, that were grassroots organizing.  Unfortunately, we have leaders today who want to issue edicts and expect the community to respond to the edicts because of who they are.  And that doesn't happen.  You know, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson certainly is very good spokesperson, but he is certainly not a leader in that--
Speaker 2: Not in an organizing sense, right?
Speaker 1: Right, because he doesn't have an organization.  So they look at Jesse and they say, "All right, well here's a guy, okay, he said a few things," and there are folks out in the communities, "Oh yeah, Jesse said something nice," but it passes on because there's no additional follow up.  I don't know whether you've ever been to a--one of Jesse's annual conferences of the--I forget what he called it.
Speaker 2: PUSH, Operation PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] /Rainbow Coalition.
Speaker 1: Operation PUSH.  Rainbow Coalition.  PUSH/Rainbow Coalition.  And he's been through several names.  But--and don't get me wrong, he has a role to play, but he could be so much more effective if he were willing to sit down and organize and have chapters in states, that were doing meaningful things.  The reason the NAACP is still around in spite of the lackluster leadership that they have presently with [Kweisi] Mfume and with [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond, I mean, they are spokespeople, but they are not leaders.  They are not willing to do the hard work.  My father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.], my late father used to go to the branches consistently to let them know what was going on in Washington [D.C.] and to show them how they could be effective in their community in influencing their elected officials.  None of the goes on with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] today.  You know, the NAACP has--I know the founders and the old warriors of the NAACP are probably turning over in their graves today to see an NAACP today that is identified as being so heavily partisan toward the Democratic Party, when in fact the NAACP was not to be a political organization, it is a civil rights organization.  And, therefore, NAACP should be giving the record of each of the candidates, not speaking on the worth of the candidates, but giving the record and educating their membership as to, based on the record, who would be the best.
Story_ID: 192344
Speaker 1: I went over to the East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland], and helped them to get organized and get their folks elected to office.  I went to other counties, I went to other states, because I felt I had been privileged to sit at the feet of Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], of Bill [William] Dawson--who, whatever you thought about his politics--had an organization.  I saw the precinct organization that he had; high rise by high rise, floor by floor in the high rises.
Speaker 2: This is Congressman William Dawson of Chicago [Illinois] back in the--
Speaker 1: Yes, Congressman William Dawson, who was an African-American congressman from Chicago, served in the [U.S.] Congress about thirty-five or forty years.  He and Adam Clayton Powell, and Bob [Robert N.C.] Nix [Jr.] from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] all were the three U.S. congress people that were African American.  Now. Adam Clayton Powell was all the black folks' congressperson.  Because folks could call on him from all over the country, and he would respond, and he would do what he could to be of benefit.  But I remember the experience of going to visit with him.  My father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.], he and my father, were very close friends and when I decided to run, he let me come up to Harlem [New York, New York] with him and spend some time with him.  And this one day--Adam was very flamboyant, and he had--well, he knew my family.  My mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] had stayed in his mother and father's home when she first went to work for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], so the Mitchells and the Powells had a long-term relationship, and he was willing to mentor me since I had decided that I was going to run for the [Maryland] Legislature.  And this particular day, he had on one of his white silk suits, silk shirt, white silk tie--I mean, he was sharp; white shoes, and riding in a white Cadillac convertible.  And one of his staff guys, this guy named Winstead [ph.] who I knew, was driving, and we saw this crap game going on on the sidewalk.  And Adam said, "Winstead, pull over, next street," and he turned the corner.  Adam took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves and said, "Winstead, give me a couple hundred dollars."  Winstead gave him a couple hundred dollars.  He said, "[HistoryMaker] Clarence [Mitchell III], come on, go with me."  I went around the corner.  He got in the crap game, purposely lost his $200 in the crap game.  Of course when he got to the game, everybody said, "Oh, here comes some fresh money.  Oh, hey, it's our congressman!"  And he said, "All right, fellas," he said, "I'm goin' take your money now!  I'm gonna," you know, "I'm gonna win this money!"  And he lost.  And I saw the way he was playing, that he was purposely losing.  Well, he said, "Well, y'all beat the congressman.  I thought I was gonna make it but you all beat me."  And he walked away, and we got back in the car around the corner, and he said, "They will be talking about how they took my money for the next ten years."  And he said that was an investment in them knowing that I can take a loss, and even though I'm their congressperson, but also I can get down and shoot a little crap with them and that sort of thing.  And it was a learning experience for me in knowing that--don't look down your nose at people who might be out there hustling or who might be into other kinds of lifestyles that you don't approve of, but they're human beings, too.  And they're voters, too.  And part of the strength of our organization was the fact that we had people who were into illegal activities, we had people who were prostitutes, working in our organization and who were leaders, and precinct leaders.
Speaker 2: Those are people that live and work in the black community, they're doing all kinds of things to survive, right?  So yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure, exactly.  And the thing that it taught us along with my grandmother [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson], that people have to survive, and those people are survivors.  And the people who become homeless, who don't have anything are there because they're not willing to do whatever it takes to survive, "by any means necessary" as Malcolm [X] used to say.  But I heard that from street hustlers when I was growing up--talking about "any means necessary."  I like my Cadillac, or I like the lifestyle I'm living--can't get no job?  Got to hustle.  And they would be out there hustling a living, running numbers, hot clothes, whatever it took.  Hot equipment, stuff that had been stolen, goods, that sort of--I mean, these folks were making a living hustling.
Story_ID: 192345
Speaker 1: But a point we were making off-camera before we started.  I just want you to make it on camera--is that we have, as a group of people, as black people, African American people, an organizing tradition that is not dependent upon the liberal elements in the white community or--I mean, take Saul Alinsky, for instance, and his organizing, which is wonderful stuff.  But there's a train of thought these days in some of the organizing--organizations around the country that organizing people is something that comes from a liberal white tradition and has nothing to do with us.  I just want to make a point of that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. It's, I mean--
Speaker 1: Your story, the story of your family, like, sort of is a contradiction.
Speaker 2: If you go back and look at the black church, that was a magnificent example of black folks' ability to organize and mobilize through a spiritual vehicle.  We--the church was not just the church for our religious worship.  The church was a gathering place for us to get information.  The church was a mobilization vehicle to speak out, to rally against injustice.  You go back historically, we have as a people,--we're able to organize and mobilize on our own in terms of our own survival.  The North Carolina Mutual [Life] Insurance Company, the Mutual Benefit Society [ph.], these were institutions that were put together through organization and going around and getting little pennies for people to--
Speaker 1: There's also--important here in this story is probably the story of Harvey Johnson of Union Baptists, who organized people as a predecessor to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I guess.  I mean, according to [HistoryMaker Reverend] Vernon Dobson--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --who was telling us.
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: So he put to gather a meeting that preceded the Niagara Movement and--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --'cause [W.E.B.] Du Bois was not known as an organizer.
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't.  And if you look at the--you know, for example, the youth councils of the NAACP.  My mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] founded the NAACP youth councils [NAACP Youth and College Division].  It was the organizing skills that my grandmother, Lillie [Mae Carroll] Jackson, had imbued in my mother and all her children that made her the right person to put together a youth division of the NAACP.  And my mother traveled all over the country, but her organizing skills enabled her to bring in youth.
Story_ID: 192346
Speaker 1: Let's go over your mother's [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] educational background, 'cause she went to law school--tell us about some of her accomplishments before she even got to the youth movement.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My mother graduated from high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] at the age of fourteen.  She went to Morgan State, now the University, but then Morgan State College [Baltimore, Maryland], which was a small Methodist college.  And my grandmother [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] didn't feel she was getting the level of college education that my grandmother wanted her to have.  So she took her up to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and my mother was entered into the University of Pennsylvania at the age of sixteen.  She was eighteen when she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and the people at Pennsylvania said, "Coming from Morgan State University?  She's not going to be able to finish this."  But my mother was quite an academician.  She at eighteen--and by nineteen she had her master's degree.  And then she went to work for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  She became the youth first--she was the first youth secretary of the NAACP and put together what are now the youth divisions of the NAACP [the NAACP Youth and College Division], youth councils, all over the country.  She met my father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.], they married, and my mother then--my grandmother decided that she was difficult to getting black lawyers to handle civil rights cases.  Black lawyers, you know, they wanted--there was no money in civil rights cases.  They wanted to focus on where there was money.  And so my grandmother convinced my mother she should go to law school.  And she entered the University of Maryland Law School [School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] and finished in three years, was on the [Maryland] Law Review, which is like the honorary position for the class that she was in, and went on to get her law degree and then began to try--her focus was constitutional law.
Story_ID: 192347
Speaker 1: She [Mitchell's mother, Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] began to represent people.  She represented people for divorces and that sort of thing, but her priority was constitutional law.  And she worked with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther [King, Jr.]--with Thurgood Marshall, and Bob [William Robert] Ming, and Jack Greenberg, and those were names that we knew from seeing them in our home as they sat around our dining room table strategizing for legal assaults in the courts.  And my mother in those days Baltimore [Maryland] was, of course, racially separate, and you couldn't eat in the restaurants and stay in the hotels.  So my mother--they would start working in her office which was a half a block away, and then my mother would leave and fix up a big dinner and then tell 'em all to come on over, and then they would come over and finish their deliberations over--my mother was one heck of a cook.  In addition to all her legal skills and all her academic achievements, she was a dynamite cook.  And as a result, of course, I used to tell folks, "If you don't believe my mother was a good cook, you look at all of her sons," who are not under 250 pounds each. (Laughter) But she used to always say, "My men will never leave my house without a good meal."  And she would fix these heavy breakfasts for us, and we'd get these great dinners in the evening, even though she was a practicing attorney.  But the, the--to have been able to sit in--and of course we didn't pay full attention to all the details, but to know that here's an environment that we're growing up in, where people are strategizing to change the way all of us black folks live, and are marching through the courts.  And to hear Thurgood Marshall say, "Oh, no, this is something else," but then there was Bob Ming, who was as competent as Thurgood Marshall; Thurgood Marshall was just a little better known.  But, you had--oh, boy.  There were other lawyers.
Speaker 2: [Charles Hamilton] Houston.
Speaker 1: Charles Hamilton Houston, but he died later, and you know--he died too early unfortunately.
Speaker 2: Spottswood [William] Robinson [III].
Speaker 1: Spottswood Robinson.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Oliver [W.] Hill.
Speaker 1: Oliver Hill--oh, definitely. Oliver Hill, he--who's still alive, interestingly--95 or 96 years old.  He's partially blind, but my brother, [HistoryMaker Dr.] Keiffer [Mitchell], was with him recently, and he's still in Richmond [Virginia], living in Richmond and his son [Oliver White Hill, Jr.] gets him around in terms of places he wants to go and that sort of thing.  But he's been up here about six, eight months ago.  He moves around, amazing guy.  But those were the--those were the bulwarks of the legal assaults on racism in this country.  And we had a chance to know many of them, because they--some of the strategy was planned in our dining room.  And at my mother's law office across the street.  So, and then to--my mother also was a support for my grandmother's [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] NAACP activity.  Whatever my grandmother, my mother would follow up and do the legwork as my grandmother began to get older, but in terms of keeping the branches, the various chapters of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] going in the state, traveling.  We got to travel all over the state.  There were people that knew us as little boys in counties on the Eastern Shore [Maryland], counties in Western Maryland.  I still--as I travel the state now, I run into people who knew me when I was the kid traveling with my grandmother or my mother--because they would personally visit the branches.  They didn't just organize a branch and say, "All right, you're out there."  They continued to give all the follow-up necessary, so they would always be on the road.  One thing I remembered about those travels was that, always we knew at the end of the travel there was gonna be a good meal, because you couldn't go in the restaurants, no such thing as McDonald's, all that sort of thing.  But these folks, when they knew you were coming, they would fix up some good eatin'. (Laughter) And we would eat--on the way home, we'd come home with full stomachs.
Story_ID: 192348
Speaker 1: It strikes me as being critical about your family's involvement in all this, is that you got like two streams of things going on in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I know I've always--I've heard, like, most of my life I read the story of the NAACP and the legal struggles that--there was some conflict between the legal strategy side and the activism side, the agitation side.  But in your household, you've got the--almost the roots of both of those strands going on.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: You've got the legal deliberation going on over there, as a seed of all that kind of activity, plus you got the root of the agitation and the troublemaking side of the NAACP, particularly with the NAACP youth that goes right back to your grandmother's [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] activism.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And NAACP youth all over the country were the ones doing the first sit-ins, they were doing that grassroots agitation--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --not only in this part of the country but down south, too, in Mississippi and these other places.  [HistoryMaker Ronald] Ron Walters talks about NAACP youth in Wichita [Kansas] that had the first sit-in in the country--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --preceding the one in North Carolina.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And the thing is that theirs was not--a lot of stuff is timing.  Sometimes things have to build up to a point.  But, certainly, NAACP has been on the forefront.  It was the NAACP people, leaders that were the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  But the NAACP had been banned in the state of Alabama, so that's why they put together this different organization, 'cause you couldn't operate as the NAACP.  But the makeup of the--Rosa Parks was an NAACP leader.  All of these folks--
Speaker 1: E.D. Nixon.
Speaker 2: E.D. Nixon, NAACP.  So that--yes, but the legal and all of that was born out of first organizing and putting together an army.  My grandmother used to talk about "Freedom's Army".  "We're soldiers in Freedoms Army."  Well, you know, that, man that was a rallying cry for everybody who wanted to be in some army.  "We' in Freedom's Army." they say, "What army are you in?" "I'm in Freedom's Army. I'm a soldier in Freedom's Army." And we grew up soldiers in Freedom's Army even as little kids.  Here we are ten, twelve years old.  "We're soldiers in Freedom's Army."  And, yeah, okay--"The Army's being called down to city hall."  Several thousand people would come down to city hall.  Freedom's Army.  And that was the kind of orientation that led us then to look at, well, what else can you do with Freedom's Army?  Hey, you can get some folks elected to office with Freedom's Army.  I mean it's just another step in that direction.
Story_ID: 192349
Speaker 1: My father, I never knew--
Speaker 2: Now, now let's talk--let's, give us his full name--
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.
Speaker 2: --and let's just go through the process of doing him.
Speaker 1: My father, my late father, was Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.  C-L-A-R-E-N-C-E, M-A-U-R-I-C-E, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L, Junior.  And he was born March the 8th, 1911.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Now, he came from an impoverished kind of background.
Speaker 1: He came from a poor family.  They were dirt poor, had eleven kids.  Three of his sisters died in their youth from lack of medical care.  Some kind of plague or disease had come through Baltimore, and he lost three of his sisters in that plague.  And he said they used to refer--they were poor and they lived in small streets, which were called alleys.  And they were called "the alley kids".  And the kids--the people who lived on the main street, when they came out of the alley, they would say, "here come the alley kids, they're not gonna amount to anything.  Those alley kids are not going to amount to anything."  And he said that they were constantly being told that they wouldn't amount to anything.  Their father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Sr.] was a waiter, and he had--his desire was that one of his sons would one day become the head waiter at the Rennert Hotel [Baltimore, Maryland], which was a small hotel in downtown Baltimore, which of course is no longer in existence now.  But he was a waiter there, and did not--had a dispute with my grandmother [Elsie Mitchell] over his sons not going to college, because it was alright for the girls to go to college, but he wanted his sons to start working as soon as possible, as waiters.  That was his vision for their success.
Speaker 2: So this is Clarence Mitchell, Sr.?
Speaker 1: That's correct, Clarence Mitchell, Sr.  Well, he ended up leaving my grandmother and moved to Annapolis, Maryland and he was a waiter down there.  And my father and my uncle George [A. Mitchell], who was the next oldest brother to him, and everybody in the family had to hold jobs, and that sort of thing, in order to keep the family going.  So that--my father went to college on a boxing track scholarship.  He was a boxer and he was track star.
Speaker 2: He was a pretty good sized man, from what I understand.
Speaker 1: Yes he was, he was 6' 1''.  He was, of course, in his younger days he was slim, but very muscular, extremely muscular.  And of course, he was a good athlete.  He was able to get scholarships to college.  He couldn't have gone to college without the athletic scholarships.  And he was able to graduate from Lincoln University in [Lincoln University] Pennsylvania, and then went and got his master's degree from Clark College [later Clark Atlanta University] in Atlanta [Georgia].  And then his first job--well, he worked as an Afro reporter, for the Baltimore Afro-American [The Afro].  He covered a lynching, the last lynching in Maryland on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  The [George] Armwood Lynching, where this black man was accused of having raped a white woman, and that night the crowd came and dragged him out of the jail and hung him and after he was dead, they set his body on fire.  And my father said, when he got there, as an Afro reporter to initiate his coverage of the lynching, he said, "White folks were poking in the ashes, trying to get one of the bones of Armwood as a souvenir."  "I got that nigger's bone!" you know?  It turned out that he was a mentally diminished person, and they'd put it on him but he had not done it.  And that, I guess, kind of sparked my father's commitment in terms of eradicating racial injustice.  And he got a job, he was head of the Urban League in St. Paul, Minnesota.  In those days, you had to go where the job was, so he was--he became the head of the St. Paul, Minnesota branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--I mean, of the Urban League.  And I was born while he was out there.  He then got another job back home, and so he was able to leave Minnesota and come back to--
Speaker 2: Now, had he finished law school by this time?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.  He didn't go to law school until he was fifty.  People thought he had a law degree.  My mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] went to law school first.  She got her law degree, and then my father ultimately--it was amazing how he was able to get a law degree and still do the work that he was doing as head of the Washington [D.C.] Bureau of the NAACP, which put him in charge of all of the lobbying efforts to get legislation passed in the civil rights area.
Story_ID: 192350
Speaker 1: He [Mitchell's father, Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.] traveled from branch to branch to branch [of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP], building support for legislation, much of which he had drafted the language for.  And he taught us that, you know, he as a person really didn't have a whole lot of influence over a senator from Kansas or a senator from California.  But if he got to the people who were the constituents of that senator, and had them contact, so he put together a whole network all over the country where he could make phone calls.  My father had been a counselor to Medgar Evers and his wife [Myrlie Louise Evers-Williams] when they were having problems.  He mentored up-and-coming civil rights leadership all over the country.  They knew him because he had been willing to give them the benefit of his advice, he'd been willing to--he was unselfish in sharing whatever he could share with potential leadership.  And during so much of our experience as a people, there have been so many folks who took the position, "I got it, you get it the best way you can."  If we had had more people like that, we would be a lot further along the way, because, you know, you wouldn't have this mentality out there.  "Well, I ain't worried about him, he lives down the street; he lives in his house, I live in my house, I ain't worried about that."  It's, you know, it's been said on occasion, that one of the worst things was the laws that broke down discrimination in housing, because in the past we were forced to all live together.  So we had to be concerned about each other because we were neighbors of each other.  And then when the laws were passed against discrimination in housing, we would move anywhere we wanted to move and that began to break up the fabric of community organization that we had.  It was forced upon us, we didn't have any choice. (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: And my father--I know, we were talking about my father.  My father went on to build this network and was able to persuade--he always used to say, the value of the NAACP was that it's a nonpartisan organization.  And, therefore, he was able to get Republicans and Democrats to vote for civil rights bills that were extremely beneficial to us as a people.  And he used to always say, "The NAACP should never close their doors to the Republicans or the Democrats, because it's always been a coalition."  He said, "If I had to depend on all the Democrats to get legislation passed, none of this civil rights legislation would have passed."  It was a coalition of the right-thinking Republicans and the right-thinking Democrats.  And, you know, unfortunately, the civil rights leadership has gotten away from that.  We are perceived by the Republican group as being in the hip pocket of the Democratic group.  So when the Republicans are in, they don't have to do anything for the black community and the African American community.
Speaker 2: Like when [President George Walker] Bush didn't show up at the convention this year.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, he said, "So what? I'm not gonna get any more votes, because the leadership is telling 'em, don't even listen to me.  Don't even think about what I might have to say."  And whatever Bush is, Bush has some qualities and some things that he's done that might be of benefit to us.  Democrats have taken us for granted. Everybody talks about [President William Jefferson] "Bill" Clinton, and Bill Clinton was, oh, "the greatest president that black folks ever had,"--that's a lie.  The greatest president that black folks ever had was [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson.  The second greatest was [President] Richard [Milhous] Nixon, 'cause Richard Nixon said, "We don't--I'm not for social programs and all that, but y'all want to start a business?  I'll make sure you get contracts."  The set-aside law was signed by Richard Nixon.
Story_ID: 192351
Speaker 1: Your father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.] was also known as the 101st senator, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  He was known as the 101st U.S. senator, and that became--that was an honorary title that was placed upon him by a bipartisan group of United States senators, Republicans and Democrats, who passed a resolution saying that he, more than any other person, had been able to influence the deliberations of the U.S. Congress in a way that most members could not.  And that he should be entitled to have the honorary title of being a member of the U.S. Senate.  And a copy of that resolution is on display at the main courthouse here in Baltimore [Maryland].  It was Howard Baker who then was Majority Leader--Republicans, when the Republicans were controlling the [U.S.] Senate.  It was Howard Baker who said to Denton [L.] Watson that Clarence Mitchell was a lion in the lobby, which is how the book ['Lion in the Lobby: Clarence Mitchell, Jr.'s Struggle for the Passage of Civil Rights Laws'] ended up becoming--the title of the book is Lion in the Lobby, on my father. He--my father was a gentle giant.  He knew how to use diplomacy, the same time he knew how to be firm.  He--you know, being able to be around him and to listen to him was a wonder to behold.  His genius in being able to put together coalitions and identifying, what does this senator want?  What does that senator want?  And pulling out the different things, and then putting together a scenario which meets the needs of those different senators which will cause them to come together.  I learned from him in that, my first term in the [Maryland] House [of Delegates], we were able to pass a public accommodations law which would allow black folks to eat in the restaurants and live and stay in the hotels.  As in Maryland--and when I was sworn into the [Maryland State] Legislature, as a legislator, I couldn't stay in the hotels in the state capitol [Annapolis, Maryland] and could not eat in the restaurants.  Couldn't join my colleagues in the places where they were really doing the business 'cause the business wasn't taking place in the chambers.  It was in the restaurants, and at the bars, and the hotel rooms.  So we were able to get a bill passed by seven votes, and it was because we put together a coalition of Republicans, put together a coalition of right-thinking Democrats, and then we finally got the governor [J. Millard Tawes], who was from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and who was definitely a conservative Democrat, but had made a commitment in the campaign that he would get this bill passed.  And we were able to get him to twist the arms of enough other legislators, who had said they were gonna vote against it.  And on the strength of him being Governor and making promises to them, they swung over and we were able to get that bill passed.  So, you know, when--again, what was confirmed was the importance of being able to--my father used to say, "Black folks cannot afford to be in the hip pocket of any party.  We need to only be focused on who is going to address the needs that we have as a people, be they Republican or Democrat."  Sometimes it's a Republican, sometimes it's a Democrat.  And, for example, here in Maryland, recently, two years ago--all of the years that I've been a committed Democrat, the Democrats have never had a black on the ticket for lieutenant governor.  And the Republicans have had--this was the third time that the Republicans put a black on the ticket, and I looked at this situation and I said, "Well, here we're asking for inclusion.  It's not the Democrats that are giving us inclusion, it's the Republicans."  And so we endorsed the Republican ticket and ended up getting our first African American lieutenant governor in the history of Maryland as a Republican.  Now, Mike [Michael] Steele is certainly no Clarence Thomas, he is a, a moderate African American Republican lieutenant governor, but he is focused on economic empowerment.  And his whole mission is to build a climate within the state of Maryland that is user-friendly to African American businesses.  And his approach is, we can solve a lot of the social problems if people can get their own businesses going and hire some of the people who are presently receiving public assistance, or who are--have been left out in terms of opportunities in employment.
Story_ID: 192352
Speaker 1: I just wanted to reflect back on the history just one more time.  I don't know if you know a lot about this, but I'm gonna ask you anyway.  About your father's [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.]--did he ever share with you, or do you know about his impressions of other NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leaders that proceeded him and worked along with him, like [W.E.B.] Du Bois, or Walter White, or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Roy Wilkins and people like that?
Speaker 2: Roy Wilkins.  Oh, yes.  My father was a team player, and there were people who tried to get him to disparage Roy Wilkins on a commitment that they would make him the new executive director of the NAACP, if they would help--if he would join with them to knock off Roy Wilkins.  My father was an intently loyal person, and he felt that, you know, nobody's perfect, but that all of the people; Walter White, Roy Wilkins, Du Bois--
Speaker 1: Was James Weldon Johnson still around when he started?
Speaker 2: No, James Weldon Johnson was gone, but--oh, boy--Gloster [B.] Current, who was Director of Branches, a guy that most folks don't know his name, but he was the one that put together the network of branches, along with my father, all over the country.  And my father believed in team, as I say, and he didn't--you could never find him criticizing any of his teammates.  He might pull them up individually, but he would never talk about it on the outside as to whatever resolution was achieved from whatever their differences might have been.  He felt we were all on the same boat that we're all moving on the same course, and it was a question of whatever differences we had, they should be internal.
Speaker 1: Now, he had a special relationship with Thurgood Marshall, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  They had been schoolmates.  It was my father who interceded with [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson to get Thurgood Marshall as Solicitor General.  It was my father who got Lyndon Johnson to appoint Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court.  My father was a behind-the-scenes guy.  And his--he never sought recognition for what he did, and he felt that what he did was--his contribution was, he was able to contribute what he contributed by not being identified, not being in the limelight and that sort of thing.  But when [President James Earl] Jimmy Carter gave my father the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which as you know, is the highest civilian award that the country gives--in presenting that medal to my father, Jimmy Carter had, in his statement, gave words of recognition that, here was a man that people will only begin to understand how powerful he was, and what a great contribution he made till years down the road in history, as they begin to enjoy the benefits of his work.
Story_ID: 192353
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your earliest childhood memories now.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And we'll--you were born in St. Paul [Minnesota], but you grew up in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: That's right, I was three years old when we came back here.
Speaker 1: So what are your earliest childhood memories?
Speaker 2: Well, basically, from the time I was able to understand, I knew that I was part of a family that was involved in the struggle.  The conversation around the dinner table, the conversation of people going out--my mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] had us walking picket lines when we were kids, picketing theaters that wouldn't allow blacks to sit on the first floor.  Ford's Theater, which was a playhouse here in Baltimore [Maryland], was one of them.  We--the Civil Rights Movement was our babysitter.  When my mother and father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.] or grandmother [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] were going to movement kinds of activities, we were there as kids.  And there were--we found out that there were other kids there, too.  And I think that one of the biggest problems that we have today as a community, is we've never included our kids in the struggle.  This generation of kids who are out there now, have no idea of what the struggle was about or the need for the struggle today.  They don't see the relevance of that, because we always--we wanted to say, "We don't want our kids to have it as rough as we did."  Well, you know, it might have been rough, but that was part of what made us achieve the things that we achieved.  And, no, I've never believed that black folks gotta be twice as good as white folks in order to be able to get a job.  However, as it worked out, if you are twice as good, it's a lot more difficult for them to turn their back on you or keep you out of a position, than--no, it ain't right, but it's the real world.  So you get out there and get the opportunity.  But I used to go to state agencies, and would say, because of the being able to be with my father and learn from my father, I would go to state agencies and say, you--"I got five black folks here, they don't have any skills, they need a job."  And they would say, "Well, they're not qualified."  I say, "You know, they're as qualified as them white folks you had over there. They didn't have any skills, you brought 'em in, trained 'em on the job, and then they became skilled."  I said, "You train these dumb black folks, just like you train those dumb white folks, and they'll all work together and everybody will be fine."  And of course I was able to do that because I was--I had access to the purse strings, their budgets.  And I would always go to the cabinet office, I didn't got to the little line workers, supervisors, or people like that, I went to the cabinet office in South and said, "You know, amendments can be offered to take your job out of the budget--to take your salary out.  So you need to find these people some jobs."  Well, today, we've got a group of politicians who go in and plead for things, as opposed to demand.  I mean, I told these folks--and, you know, it's not just my word, there are people still living today, who got jobs, who can tell you.  When I walked into it, I said, "Find them the jobs!"  I didn't want to hear no excuses as to what you didn't have--"Find them jobs!" and I walked out. And those people got jobs.  Today, I run into elected officials, "Well, you know, the mayor won't do so-and-so, the mayor won't do so-and-so."  And that's because they lack the courage to really be major players.  Their vote is just as important as council members' votes on a city council, for example.  So if they go in and say, "I want these people to have city jobs," tell the mayor, "Find them some jobs." It ain't no question--I just didn't come from a political school that where anything less was acceptable.  I saw how Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] used to say.  He used to talk about, "Seek audacious power."  And they worked to get rid of Adam Clayton Powell because he was about audacious power.  He would tell people, "No, you gonna do this."  And he was in a position of power, and he used that power for our people.
Story_ID: 192354
Speaker 1: You have to be in a position to say, "Do this, or else."  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, correct.  But the reason you're in a position to do that is because you're able to--you're organized.  You have a army behind you.  You know that so many elected officials out here, they just get out there and put out some ads and by the luck of the draw they end up getting elected to office.  I had a political organization my whole time in public office.  We met every month.  I didn't have to worry about how I was gonna get the vote out on Election Day, because we met year round and we had precinct organizations.  Because I'd seen Bill [William] Dawson.  If somebody moved into a floor in one of those high rises in his district, the first thing you knew, the precinct captain for that floor was in there and said, "Does he--are you registered to vote?" "Well, no."  "Well, you gotta be registered to vote if you wanna stay in here.  And by the way, the political meeting this week is at such-and-such a time, such-and-such a place."  And they were there.  "You like living in this housing?  Here's what it is.  These are what the rules are."
Speaker 1: Well, I know this doesn't have exclusive Irish origin, but I've read that that's the way the Irish took over a lot of the major cities, city governments.  People coming in off the boat, registering them to vote, telling them who to vote for, and your job track in city government starts there, at the precinct level.
Speaker 2: The Irish, the Irish, the Italians, the Jews, they all--as their people came in, they had organizations.  I mean, the Jews used to control the black political organizations, because they knew they didn't have enough in numbers.  So they had to pick up some numbers, by--since they had businesses in the black community, their business people could influence the black community.  You know, give 'em a break on the grocery bill.  "Oh, hey, John, you're kind of a leader and a mover and a shaker in the community.  Look here, your groceries will be half price.  But I want you to get out there and help get support for this Jewish guy who's running in this district."  And in most instances, the districts were a certain percentage Jewish and black.  But the Jews didn't have enough numbers for majority, so they were able to use the blacks.  And that was their--so when you talk about the Jewish-black alliance, that alliance was put together specifically for the purpose of benefitting the Jewish upward mobility and political power.  Same thing with the Italians in Baltimore City [Maryland]. Italians entered into--first mobilized themselves to the point where they had 95 percent turnout in elections.  That got the attention of the Irish, the Irish then formed a coalition with the Italians and then the Jews entered into a coalition with the Irish and the Italians.  They had the whole city under control because the Jews, with the black vote, their control of the black vote, were able to deliver West Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland], and Northwest Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland].  The Italians had Southeast Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland] and South--and East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland].  The Irish had Northeast Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland] and parts of Southwest Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland].  So the combination of the organizations enabled them to control the city.  They wanted an Italian mayor?  They got an Italian mayor for sixteen years.  They want a Jewish mayor?  They got a Jewish mayor.  They were able to call the shots as to who was gonna be, and they were able to deliver because they were organized.  They had ongoing political organizations.

Speaker 1: Let me take you back to grade school, (laughter) childhood.  Now, where'd you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to Booker T. Washington--I mean, I'm sorry.  Henry Highland Garnet Elementary School [P.S. 103, Baltimore, Maryland] and Booker T. Washington Junior High School [later, Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Garnett's named after the great abolitionist spokesman, Henry Highland Garnet.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  That's right. And--
Speaker 1: This is all black schools--
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington Junior High.  Yes, they were all black schools, up until the eighth grade, when my mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] and father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.] decided that I was not getting a quality education in the public schools in Baltimore [Maryland], because of segregation in the schools.  And studies had been done for court cases which showed that the black schools, "colored schools," as they were called then in Baltimore, were one full year academically behind the white schools.  So my mother and father then sent me to Gonzaga [College] High School [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: That's a Catholic--
Speaker 2: --a Catholic High School in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 192356
Speaker 1: Now, before we get to Gonzaga [College High School, Washington, D.C.] and get out of this, we always ask this question, so I'm gonna pull you back to childhood.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  So, give me a sense of the neighborhood [in Baltimore, Maryland], and the sights and the sounds and the smells of the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: All right.  The neighborhood we grew up in was a mix of professional blacks and low-income, blue-collar folks.  In those days, there was no such thing as welfare, so things folks found jobs and did all kinds of things.  But the professional blacks were, during the time that I was growing up, were in transition of moving out of the neighborhood, and Jewish speculators were coming in and taking the brownstones that they had and chopping them up into four and five apartments.  Take one big room, and make it a three-room apartment, and have a family of five or six living in that one room.  But it was the kind of neighborhood where you had your doctors within walking distance, because the doctors in the community had their offices on the first floor, and they lived--their home was the second and third floor of the brownstone.  And that's where they lived, and that's where they worked, too.  You could get a doctor in the middle of the night.  You could walk to your dentist.  The--it was a neighborhood where there was a mix of services that were available to you no matter what time, because we were forced to live together. You couldn't, you couldn't--you could only go within certain boundaries in terms of housing.  It was a really quite a--if you wanted role models, they were right there in the neighborhood.  You had the positive role models, and you had the negative role models.  You had the street hustlers, and they were right side by side.  But, yet, there was a drug store that was owned by an African American pharmacist that we went to.  But also as the neighborhoods began to disperse, you had a heavy Jewish influence that would buy the stores from the African Americans.  And, unfortunately, a mentality began to grow in my youth of the white folks' ice being colder than black folks'.  Like that the black stores really don't have the quality of the products that the Jewish stores have.  And the Jewish stores came in with credit.  They would let you run a tab, so that the kids could run into the store, go get what the parents needed 'cause they'd be working, and the grocer would put it on the tab.  Of course, he had a little interest in there, too.  And that little interest ended up being pretty substantial. They would do very well.  So I think that to grow up in that kind of environment was certainly stimulating.  It gave me a lot of confidence that I was as good as anybody else, 'cause I knew black doctors; I knew black hustlers.  I knew educators, black educators.  Everybody lived in the same general area.  Thurgood Marshall grew up in that same neighborhood that I grew up in.  His people were educators. There were other black lawyers who had their law offices right there in the neighborhood 'cause they couldn't go to the downtown office buildings.  They had to be in the neighborhood, because the downtown office buildings would not allow black lawyers to locate offices downtown near the courthouse.  So, all of the--in addition to that, it was a conscious environment.  I mean, everybody was about being somebody.  Even the hustlers were about, you know, a better life, and wanting their kids to have better than they had.  They didn't want their kids to be hustlers.  They were hustlers 'cause that was all they had to do.

Speaker 1: One of my proudest days was being able to get the governor [of Maryland] to appoint a young district court judge, who happened to be the son of the number-two numbers-banker in the city [Baltimore, Maryland].  And when--I had heard comment, they were saying, "how could this boy be-?" Now, he had gotten his son through law school and all that sort of thing, you know, to be able to move up.  And the comment among some of the district court judges was, "Old [HistoryMaker Clarence] Mitchell's [III] putting this numbers banker's son on the court."  And so I spoke for his investiture, and in speaking for his investiture, I said, "I am very proud to be here to support the elevation of this young man, whose father was an entrepreneur in the tradition of the Kennedys." (Laughter) Of course, everybody knew what that meant.  [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy's old man [Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy] was into illegal activities, and so his father [Patrick Joseph "P.J." Kennedy] had been, too.  But in he was an "entrepreneur in the tradition of the Kennedys", and the chief district court judge was Irish, you know?  Man, you coulda--it looked like I had shot him, when I said that.  Because he was one of the biggest ones talking about this kid, should not because of what his father was about.  And then the state ended up taking up numbers anyway and legalizing them and collected all the money.  But, you know, those kinds--one of the things that--growing up in the environment I grew up in made me understand not to sit in judgement of what other people do.  That in many instances in life, people are forced to do whatever they got to do in order to survive.  And when I got into the political process, I really saw how white folks sit back pontificating on whether or not black folks are being--following the rules, and that sort of thing, when they make rules to accommodate their illegal activity.  They, you know--they--if there's something that they want to do and it's not legal, they go ahead and pass laws to make it legal.  And that's what the legislative process, I discovered, was.  And I came back, everybody was saying to me, "Oh you're twenty-two years old.  You can't deal with the weighty problems of a legislative body."  And these were some of the older adults who were talking about me.  But after two weeks in the House [Maryland House of Delegates], I came back to the community for one of our community meetings, I said, "Ah, I thought this was going to be some kind of--this ain't nothing but a street thing.  And I came out of the streets, I can handle this." (Laughter).  The legislative process is a street thing.  You help me with what I want to get, I'll help you with what you want to get, and they're not sitting there thinking about the facts.  They're not sitting there thinking about the impact.  The bottom line is: they want to get what they want.  If you can help them get what they want, then you'll get what you want.

Speaker 1: Tell us about Gonzaga [College] High School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes, as I indicated, my parents [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell and Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.] decided I should go there because of deficiencies in the public colored schools in Baltimore [Maryland].  It turned out that the--a very good friend of my father's son agreed to be my mentor.  That was none other than Pat Buchanan--
Speaker 1: The current political commentator?
Speaker 2: --who is the political commentator, the right-wing conservative.  Pat Buchanan was, he was a sophomore at the time that I got there.  I was a freshman.  I was the only African American student in my freshman class.  So this was quite a transition for me, to be in an all-white freshman class, with a white mentor, coming from the all-African American public schools.  But Pat was very helpful and--but at first he was trying to help me to fit in and was teaching me to smoke in the locker room.  When the priests came through and caught us.  And we both were put in what's called "JUG" which is punishment.  It's kind of like the after-school prison where you have to sit in your classroom, do your homework, and you can't talk, and you have to get permission to go to the bathroom.  And in fact, Pat Buchanan wrote about the incident in his book, his first book, but what he left out was that they were his cigarettes, not mine.  He tried to say they were my cigarettes, you know.  That whole experience at Gonzaga was one that helped me to really look at the fact that whites had nothing over blacks, and that in fact if I was going to compete, these were the people I was gonna compete with. And (laughter) that was like a piece of cake.  Having come from the environment I had come from, where every day was a struggle to survive these were kids who had their own cars, who had all the advantages in life, 'cause they went to a private school.  And the experience at Gonzaga also enabled me to be closer to my father, 'cause I caught the train to school every morning and caught the train home every evening.  At the time Gonzaga was not a boarding school, so I would, in many instances, walk from school once I got out of school to my father's office, and then I would do my homework in his office, and then we would ride the train back home.
Speaker 1: So Gonzaga is in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Gonzaga is in Washington, D.C.  It's about seven--about seven blocks from the U.S. Capitol.  My father's office was about eight blocks from the U.S. Capitol, and so Gonzaga was a, certainly, an educational experience that helped me to understand the advantages that whites had over blacks, in terms of the educational opportunities, and therefore being able to compete better, because they had more.  Much of the work that I had in high school in my junior year--even white colleges--I went to the University of Maryland, College Park [Maryland] right after I graduated from Gonzaga, and in my freshman year I was taking work that I had had in my junior year at Gonzaga.  So it helped me to understand the advantages that whites had and therefore realized that the playing field was certainly not even in terms of our being able to come into the society and compete.
Story_ID: 192359
Speaker 1: What was your social life like at Gonzaga [College High School in Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, my social life, I didn't have much social life at Gonzaga.  My, I--I mean, I played athletics, and I was also on the debate team, but I didn't--there was--I didn't go to the dances, and that sort of thing, 'cause I was catching a train home.  And I did of course go to my prom, and I made a few of the social activities, but also it was a different kind of social setting, one that I wasn't really used to.  First of all, it was an all-male school, so of course we were in an all-male environment, and I'd been used to co-ed environments.  So there were a lot of adjustments that had to be made, but I was able to get through four years at Gonzaga and graduate, went on to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did you graduate from Gonzaga?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Gonzaga in June of 1957.
Story_ID: 192360
Speaker 1: So you went to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I went to the University of Maryland College Park.  I was there for a year, but I was not--I was so focused on all the extracurricular activities that I did not get my grades, and I ended up after the first year transferring to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] 'cause the thing that finally did it for me was, I went out for spring training--spring tryouts for the football team, and I was running up and down the field.  One of the coaches called me over and said, "What are you doing out here?"  I said, "I'm gonna try out for the team," 'cause I had played for Gonzaga.  And he said, there wasn't no--"You're wasting your time.  We don't have any black players on the team for Maryland."  And so that was enough for me to transfer to Morgan.  And as I say, I already wasn't doing that well on my grades anyway.  I was a C student, and I could have done better than that.  Then I transferred to Morgan where I could play football, I was on the football team, and then I also was on the swimming team, which gave me an opportunity to participate in athletics, but also I was so happy that I ended up going to a traditionally black institution, because that experience helped me to be grounded in who I was and where I came from, and the heritage that was behind me, the legacy.  Not just from my family and that sort of--but from other African Americans who had laid a foundation and had come through those historically black institutions [historically black colleges and universities, HBCUs].
Story_ID: 192361
Speaker 1: And also, had I not been at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], I would not have been able to become involved in the movement of the '60s [1960].  I ended up being one of Maryland's representatives to the founding conference of the organization known as SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which became the organization of the youth movement of the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Now this is 1960, '61 [1961]?
Speaker 1: 1960.
Speaker 2: '60 [1960], okay.
Speaker 1: Spring of 1960, we met at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina], on the campus of Shaw, in April of that year.  I have in a scrapbook a picture that was taken in May of 1960, when we had met with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, [Jr.].  We were doing the follow-up from the conference from Shaw, institutionalizing SNCC and making it an organization.  Martin King wanted us to be the youth division of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC], but after meeting with him, we decided, no, we were gonna be independent.  [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was in that meeting, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, several other young student leaders.  Marion Barry was the first chairman of SNCC. I was treasurer.
Speaker 2: A lot of people don't know that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that Marion Barry was--
Speaker 1: A lot of people do not know that, and they don't know that that was--that also was the year, 1960, of the presidential election where [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy ended up becoming the nominee.  But Marion Barry spoke at the Democratic Convention, which I believe was in Los Angeles [California].  And he represented SNCC in that--at that convention.
Speaker 2: That's something a lot of people don't know.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 192362
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you remember Ella Baker, I think that she--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ella Baker was our mentor.  Ella Baker was the lady that--and a very low-profile, behind-the-scenes kind of person, but she was the one that everybody could turn to for comfort, for wisdom, for courage, for commitment.  She was all those things.  She was--she was a real great lady and her story--I understand that there is a book that's been written about her.
Speaker 1: There are two now.
Speaker 2: Are there two?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are two now; one ['Ella Baker & the Black Freedom Movement'] written by a professor [HistoryMaker Barbara Ransby] at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--I mean, University of Illinois at Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and one ['Ella Baker: Freedom Bound'] written by--what was it?--Joanne Grant.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And I should know the other lady's name, too, I just saw her about a month ago, but she's a black professor at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: So there are two books now?  Okay, that's good.
Speaker 1: There are two books now, and there's actually a third one ['Ella Baker: A Leader Behind the Scenes' by Shyrlee Dallard] written, like on a high school level, it's thinner, maybe about a hundred pages with a lot of pictures, about Ella Baker.  I got all three (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well that's great, that's great.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a--it's a--yeah. 'Cause she's so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --really important that we--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was, she was--she should be very important to all of us, because she was a female [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  But as you know, in so many instances, the black women in the movement never got the recognition or the attention that the men in the movement got, even though they were contributing as much, and in many instances even more.
Speaker 1: The story is that she was--she came down to volunteer for SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and was basically ended up serving everybody.  She was a veteran organizer and thought that the youth could be better used, organized in another way, and so she was like a catalyst for calling the youth to that meeting that SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] grew out of.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And I don't think that she wanted you all to be the youth division of SCLC.
Speaker 2: No, she didn't, and she argued against that, and was a major influence in our not becoming the youth division.  And then she was volunteering in our office, which was two, three doors away from Martin King's office on Auburn Avenue [Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 192363
Speaker 1: There was some pressure on some of the ministers, I think, not to do certain things that needed to be--that she [Ella Baker] felt needed to be done, or that the students wanted to do, actually.  You know?
Speaker 2: Well, see, all the ministers were not fully in tune with [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  They would join the organization and a lot of it had to do with pressures that come from their parishioners,--"How come you're not out there with King?"--so many of them were out there not because they had a commitment, but because they didn't want to look bad to their parishioners, who were already committed to the movement.  And, of course, if you remember the 'Letter from the [sic. a] Birmingham Jail' that King wrote, I mean, those black preachers were basically telling him to get out of town, that he was a troublemaker.  And, "Why is he coming there disturbing things?"  And he did that letter from the Birmingham Jail [Birmingham, Alabama], it capsulized the dilemma that he was in with a lot of the black preachers.  Also, of course, many of the preachers were given certain kinds of favors because the white power structure knew that they had control over people, so they'd do some favors for them and help them with things that they needed to get done, in exchange for them not really putting pressure on for equality.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  They were told to be meek in the face of--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192364
Speaker 1: What were your activities in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?  Now, you were really involved in SNCC, I know that, so just--
Speaker 2: Well, basically, we were voter registration in southern communities, and also demonstrating during the day and early evening, we'd be demonstrating--I mean, getting folks to register to vote where we could, and then we would be demonstrating outside of restaurants and movie theaters and places like that to try to--picketing.  We were picketing outside of them, to try to get access for people in the community.  And I was like commuting between Atlanta [Georgia] and the South and Baltimore [Maryland], because we had our own movement going in Maryland.  And, of course, I was arrested a number of times for sitting in--refusing to move when the restaurant owner said, "Get out of here."  And I wouldn't move and, of course, as a leader in the movement, I mean--other students wouldn't leave either.
Speaker 1: Now, I think, like, SNCC, like, like, sort of cranked things up a notch by doing a lot of sit-ins, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Where they had been done before.  I think NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] youth started doing some of those, but SNCC--whereas other groups would carry signs and picket a lot, SNCC would actually go in and risk themselves by sitting down in these hostile environments.
Speaker 2: Correct.  And it was then, you know, I finally said to [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King, [Jr.], you know, I really want to be helpful to the movement, I said, "But I cannot continue to be nonviolent.  I am not--for you, nonviolent may be a philosophy.  For me it is a strategy."  And I can't deal with that strategy anymore, and I'm going back to Maryland, where I don't have to be nonviolent.  I'm gonna work in voter registration, and I'm gonna run for office.  Well, when I decided to run for office, Martin King came to Baltimore, spoke for me, supported my candidacy, and that sort of thing, and that was helpful as well, but the biggest benefit was I went out and knocked on seven thousand doors.  And when the older folks, who were critical of my trying to do this, and white folks who looked around, I had won a seat.  And the district was not majority black at the time, so I got a lot of white folks who voted for me and helped me to win the seat.
Story_ID: 192365
Speaker 1: There's a story too, around demonstrating in the--your brother, [HistoryMaker] Michael [Mitchell, Sr.], was telling us in his interview that he was severely beaten in Annapolis, Maryland, during the sit-in demonstration.  Did--were you around when that--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was 1962, '63 [1963], rather.  Everybody had come down, busloads of folks had come down to see me sworn in, and there was a restaurant within 150 feet of the [Maryland] State Capitol, called Barnes Restaurant [Annapolis, Maryland].  And this guy was--it was really a greasy spoon, a hole in the wall.  But this guy had had this place there for all this time, and he was a stone redneck.  So he had hired some thugs, so that if any of the blacks who had come down to see me being sworn in, and who had come to be a part of the opening day ceremonies, of the opening of the legislature, they would be able to keep them out.  So my brother, Michael, decided to go in with a group of his young folks.  Michael was my campaign manager, and Michael had led my street campaign effort with a bunch of his high school fraternity brothers.  And they would get out with me every day, knocking on doors and letting people know I was coming in the neighborhood, and passing out literature for me and that sort of thing.  And so they went into Barnes Restaurant, and these thugs were there waiting for them and began to throw them out.  There was a big picture in Jet magazine of Michael being thrown out of the front door of the restaurant.  He was like in the air with his mouth wide open, and there was a Jet photographer who was there and snapped the picture, and was able to get it to Jet.  There was a picture in to verify, of course, that they--in fact, the incident had taken place.  And the guy who owned the restaurant claimed, "Oh, no, it wasn't anything, some people came in here, were disorderly, and my patrons removed them because they were being disorderly."  And that was not so, they were trying to be served.
Story_ID: 192366
Speaker 1: Back to the campaign. You knocked on seven thousand doors?
Speaker 2: I knocked on seven thousand doors, a little over seven thousand.  Every day from early in the morning to late at night, I went out knocking on doors.
Speaker 1: Now, was your grandmother [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson] still alive, when--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My grandmother, my mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Carroll], they were all--they were helping me.  At first, they didn't want me to run.  But once they saw that I had got a campaign going--and my mother and father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell] found out that I was running by listening to the radio one night.  And they called me at home, I had just gotten married, and they called me at home to say, "Oh, is that true that you're running for legislature?"  I said, "Yes, I'm running!"  And so once I was in the race, then they jumped behind me.  And there's no question about the fact that, yes, I had these young people, I had the commitment, and the determination to win that seat, but my mother and my grandmother and their band of willing workers, freedom's army, got out and really helped to make that happen.
Speaker 1: How did you--how did you arrive at the juncture where you knew you wanted to run for elected office.  I mean, at that age?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, I guess, a combination of having seen my father be able to make some changes through the legislative process, and learning about the legislative process.  And the thing that I was quoted as saying is "I discovered--I left the sit-in movement because I found the quickest way to win our rights is to start sitting-in as members of legislatures."  Because that's where the action was, that's where we could change the laws that kept us out.  The restaurant owners and the hotel people could tell you, "All right, come in.  We'll admit you."  And then once you think you got them then you move to another place that's not serving African Americans, and then they go back to their old policy again.  There was no way of keeping anybody in line, except through passage of laws.  And so in that session of 1963, Maryland passed its own public accommodations law, and I say that the difference in that situation was that, as a student activist, I was now a member of the [Maryland State] Legislature.  And the appeal that I made to them was that I, as your colleague, cannot go where you go, and I'm a lawmaker just like you.  And even then, it was a close vote.  We only won by six or seven votes.  There was still plenty of--this was before reapportionment, and the rural interests ran the legislature in Maryland, even though, for example, a county like Garett County [Maryland], which had more trees than they had people, (laughter) would have a population of, maybe, four, five hundred people, and had their own senator, and members of the [Maryland] House [of Delegates], and yet, Montgomery County [Maryland], that had 250,000 people, had one senator and three members of the House.  Every jurisdiction in the state each had equal representation, even though they didn't have equal population.
Speaker 1: And the heavily--the heaviest populated areas of Maryland were the urban centers where black folks weren't they?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Correct.  Yep.  Prince George's [County, Maryland] and Baltimore [County, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Just guessing--right, right.  Absolutely.  Now, were you the first black official?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  There was--the first African American state senator was a man by the name of Harry A. Cole, who was a young Republican lawyer.  And the Democrats would not put a black on the ticket, so we supported Harry Cole and got a lot of folks to vote Republican instead of Democrat, and as a result Harry Cole won.  Well, once the white machine saw that black folks were gonna support a black candidate, four years later, the machine put their own candidate in the race, a guy named Mickey Jones [ph.], who was basically a hustler.  You know, one of these guys who would go along to get along, and that sort of thing but would do whatever they wanted him to do.  And so then once they put a democrat on the ticket for senate, then they--he won.  And unfortunately the community did not support Cole, and then four years later, we were able to break the back of the machine again with Senator Verda Welcome, who was the first African American female state senator in the country.  And I was elected to the [Maryland] House [of Delegates] at the same time she was elected to the senate.
Story_ID: 192367
Speaker 1: What were things like for you in that position [congressman, Maryland House of Delegates]?
Speaker 2: Well, basically, it was, as I said, I began--after I'd been there for a while, realized it was nothing but a street thing.  And all I had to do was position myself in a way where my vote would be important to my colleagues, enough of my colleagues, to get their support for whatever agenda I had.  And it was a question of lining up your votes.  My father had already taught me to line up votes.  He taught me how to--my father [Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Jr.] was one of the best I've ever seen in terms of vote-counting and putting things in position.  He always carried in his pocket a copy of the Constitution of the United States, and he also would have role-calls in his pocket, where he had checked off each senator that he had been to, each member of the Congress that he had been to, and what they--where they stood in terms of his agenda, the civil rights agenda in the Congress.
Speaker 1: Your election was in 1963?
Speaker 2: My election was in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: '62 [1962], okay.
Speaker 2: I was sworn in in '63 [1963]. January of '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.  January of '63 [1963].  That's right--yeah--[President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy is president then--
Speaker 2: Yes, Kennedy was president then, and we were--that was '63 [1963] was the year we had the March on Washington, there was some criticism that the black leaders had gone over to see [President Abraham] Lincoln's bedroom in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  Kennedy had invited them over.  But--and of course that was when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, [Jr.] gave his I Have a Dream speech--
Story_ID: 192368
Speaker 1: Is the sequence of events--I know I always, I heard--there's always the story that Malcolm X tells about the way the conference came about.  He said it was a SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] conference basically, but when the [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy administration heard about it, they called together the "Big 6," you know, civil rights leaders, and asked them to stop it [the March on Washington], and they said, "We can't stop it because we didn't start it."  So Kennedy says, "Well, I'll get in it too, then.  We gotta get in it, this is an election year, you know."
Speaker 2: Well, it was actually [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], and Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] that really started it, and SNCC joined in.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker Reverend] James Bevel says it was his idea.  It's--
Speaker 2: He--(laughter)
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know how much you know about James Bevel, but Bevel was certainly very much involved in leadership, but it's certainly--it was a collective idea.  King came to the conclusion--Diane Nash, whom he [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel] later married, was--felt that it was something that we ought to do.  And there was an assortment of activists, who all decided, "Okay, yeah, let's do it."  And King and the meek preachers were a good group to join with.  Of course, the others joined in, the whole leadership, when they--we were talking about how some of the leadership in the past would find out when the march was going to take place, and run, jump out in front of it. Well, you have a perfect example of that in the Million Man March around Washington [D.C.].  All those--[HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph] Lowery, and Southern Christian Leadership Conference, members of congress, all of them were keeping their distance from the march.  But we gotta believe that they were somewhere in a room overlooking the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.] when they saw all those folks out there.  And I was up on the stage with [HistoryMaker Minister Louis] Farrakhan, which was bereft of black leadership when we first got there.  All of a sudden, all these people started working their way through the crowd, 'cause they saw it was a success.  And they wanted to be a part of the success.  And Farrakhan made the decision, "Yes, we're gonna let them speak," because we want to bring about unity.  But none of them had even let Farrakhan know that they were even gonna be there, so their presence was a surprise.

Speaker 1: Basically, I--as I said, I left SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] to come back and run for office.  [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry continued to give leadership, and then when Marion left [HistoryMaker] John Lewis took over.  As I say, those who worked with [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King, [Jr.] will remember that he used to from time to time say, "I always want crazy people with me."  And some of those people, Hosea Williams and [HistoryMaker Reverend James] Jim Bevel.  And, I mean, he had people who were crazy enough to get out there and--
Speaker 2: And take big risks.
Speaker 1: And take big risks, and also--in danger to their lives.  And when he said "crazy", he really didn't mean people that were totally mentally off, what he meant was that they were crazy enough to be willing to be on the front lines.  I mean, there are people down there in Selma, you know, Alabama who were integral soldiers in the effort in the Selma to Montgomery March, that a lot of people have not given any attention to.  And I knew them because I was there, and then they began to get elected to public office down there, and they had been abandoned by the leadership.  I went down there and initiated a federal investigation of what was going on down there.  They had indicted half the leaders from the Selma to Montgomery March, who had themselves gotten elected to office.  And as a result of those efforts, they ended up dropping the charges against them, and that sort of thing, and if you go down there now, Selma is in the Black Belt of Alabama.  They've got state senators, they've got judges.  I mean, they have--it is easy to see why white folks wanted to keep black folks from voting.  Because they knew, if we ever started voting, then we would--we would be able to free ourselves, we would elect our own judges, we would elect our own state senators.
Speaker 2: You're right, there's quite a history in a town like Selma.  The churches were so organized down there.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.
Speaker 2: The A.M.E. [Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal] church [Selma, Alabama], and the big Baptist church down there.  I think [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Johnson is married to--his wife [Eunice Walker Johnson] is the daughter of the pastor of the big Baptist church in Selma, and whose pastor was the president of the National Baptist Convention for over twenty years before [Joseph H.] Jackson got it.  I found that out in Selma this spring.  I mean, there's a lot in Selma.  There are some real powerful people in the black community in the South in Selma, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  That was the reason Martin chose Selma as the starting point for--he was trying to pull them in.
Speaker 2: Yeah. The National Baptist Convention being so powerful, and with so many members influenced by that group.
Speaker 1: Right--
Story_ID: 192370
Speaker 1: Do you have any recollections of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of '64 [1964], and how--I know you were here in Baltimore [Maryland], but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wasn't here--I wasn't there, but I certainly remember it.  The fact that the--you know, literally what we had anticipated would happen happened.  Pulled in all these white students who came down to the South and, of course, with their presence, it also brought the power and influence of their parents. 'Cause their parents weren't gonna let their kids be mutilated or destroyed, so--
Speaker 1: What did you think about that idea?  Now, that's an idea, I think, that Bob [Robert Parris] Moses or some others came up with, but what did you think of that idea when you first--
Speaker 2: That was an excellent idea! Everybody did, I mean, we were doing it here in Maryland when the movement first started.  We had white kids--we went and recruited white kids from the private colleges and universities.  We knew the state colleges would probably be roadblocks to our being able to recruit, but these private colleges that we have here in Maryland, you know, their kids were kids coming from Massachusetts and Connecticut, and all these liberal areas.  And they wanted to be in the movement, but they weren't gonna go south, so we had a movement right here for them.  These white kids were getting locked up, same as we were, and their parents were coming down--"Wait a minute, what's going on?"--and using their influence.  So certainly it was a very sound strategy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Resulting in them taking a delegation to the Democratic National Convention of 1964.
Speaker 2: Yes, Fannie Lou Hamer, the Mississippi Freedom [Democratic] Party, Democrat Freedom Party.  And they were able to replace the Democratic delegation that had been selected through the racist system of Mississippi.  And Fannie Lou Hamer was--along with her other ladies, she had other women, too, who were involved.  And really, the, the, the Freedom Party effort was really--the leadership was women.  Men were mixed up in there, but it was the women that were--
Speaker 1: Ah, so, Victoria Gray [HistoryMaker Victoria Adams] was one, and I can't think of--
Speaker 2: Right.  There was also another lady [Unita Blackwell] that became mayor of a small town [Mayersville] in Mississippi.  Boy, I can see her face, I can't--she also became President of the Black Mayors Organization [National Conference of Black Mayors, later the Conference of Black Mayors (CBM)], eventually.  But she was part of Fannie Lou Hamer's effort and, I mean, they had really mobilized and done a job.  As I say, our focus by that point was in Maryland.  I would go down, I--like, [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond and Ben [Benjamin] Brown had asked me to come down and help them put together their campaign in Atlanta [Georgia].  They were running for the [Georgia] House of Representatives--the state House of Representatives.  Then, they--later on I went down to work with a group called Young Men On the Go [ph.], which was actually the first political organization that Maynard Jackson put together.  That group used to meet at Paschal's [Restaurant, later the Paschal Center, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a historic restaurant, black restaurant.
Speaker 2: We used to meet at the motel.  See, Paschal's has a restaurant had a restaurant, they built a motel next to the restaurant.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Paschal's Motor Inn [Paschal's Motor Hotel, later the Paschal Center, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 192371
Speaker 1: The group became Atlanta On the Go [ph.], and that was the group that first got Maynard Jackson elected as president of the [Atlanta] City Council.  Maynard Jackson then of course went on to be elected mayor [of Atlanta, Georgia].  We also kept a network going.  Reaching out to each other--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you seem to be active as a political consultant in a lot of other places, and--
Speaker 1: Unpaid--political consultant.  Nobody had any money, but we would figure out ways of scraping together plane fare, and I would get there.  And I would share--I was willing to share my experiences and knowledge I had acquired with everybody who was trying to make it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I remember in college you coming to Wright State University [Dayton, Ohio].  I don't know, this may be a historic sign; when you show up, people get together and do something, you know?  And, you know, kind of teaching from the legacy that you learned yourself.
Speaker 1: There was a black state senator from Chicago [Illinois], his first name was Dick [Richard Newhouse, Jr.].  And I think--I'm trying to remember his last name.  I can see his face, he ended up getting Alzheimer's and had to leave office.  But, Richard--anyway, he was a state senator who put together the first legislative group of black officials.  It was called the National Black Legislative Clearing House.  And, Dick, out of his private resources--
Speaker 2: You mean, in Chicago [Illinois], or--
Speaker 1: Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Chicago.  Oh, Dick Newhouse.
Speaker 1: Newhouse.  Dick Newhouse.  Oh, thank you.  Yes, Dick Newhouse was really the initiator of black legislators coming together to network with each other.  He formed this Black Legislative Clearing House, and we would meet in Chicago twice a year.  In those days, you could get all of black legislators in the country in, probably, half of this room that we're in.  But that was the beginning of the networking, and that led to a group of us forming the National Black Caucus of State Legislators [NBCSL] in 1979.  And when we formed that group, I was one of the founders, I was the first treasurer, and then they--I could have been president of the caucus, the first president of the caucus, but the older legislators were supporting the black speaker pro-tem from Michigan--oh, boy.  Anyway, they were supporting him for the position, and if I had run, I could have won, but a substantial portion of the group would have walked away, because they felt that the older guy should--so I withdrew and ran for treasurer for the sake of unity and getting us together.  Then, three years later, I won the presidency, and I was president for seven years.  And during that time, our constitution called for a president to serve no more than four years, but they kept suspending the constitution for me to continue in office because I think they felt I was trying--I was doing some things that were beneficial, in terms of laying a foundation that the organization--that would enable the organization to survive long after those of us who are founders were gone.  And that organization is still in place, they have an office on Capitol Hill in the Hall of States building [Washington, D.C.].  The president of the caucus now is a woman senator from Mississippi [Mary H. Coleman].  The immediate past president was a African American male [James L. Thomas] from Alabama, from Selma.  He represented Selma, and he ended up becoming president of the caucus.  The president before him was Lois DeBerry, who was a black woman state representative from Memphis, Tennessee.  So there have been a series of--basically, Southern domination of the group in a way that has kept the group on point.  But the media doesn't give a lot of attention to state legislators, whereas they give more recognition to the Congressional Black Caucus.  But the state--the most powerful black political organization in this country is the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, because they have a--most of the action now is at the state level.
Story_ID: 192372
Speaker 1: --Even federal funds are going to the states--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in block grant form, and then they're allowing the states to determine what the priorities will be in the spending of those federal dollars.  And so the place to be now is in the state legislature if you really want to be a part of the action.
Speaker 2: Yeah, some Chicagoans--there's a whole joke about--[Richard M.] Daley, you know, about this asking him, "What are you gonna do after you're mayor [of Chicago, Illinois]?  Don't you want to be a senator or--" and he said, "Well, that's just national."
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--And all politics is local.
Speaker 2: Right, because money is coming to his--is coming through a big city like Chicago comes right to the city government, or state government.  You know, state, then, you know, they catch all that before it gets dispersed.
Speaker 1: Have you been, like, found yourself torn between local issues here and national issues?  'Cause you consult in a variety of ways on a national level and always have.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but I--basically, it's a question of, the national outreach that I have can be beneficial and can be redirected back in this direction. I have--it's as important to be on the national level as it is to be on state level, but even more so on the state level, is what I'm really trying to say.  That more and more, the real decision making--we're getting back to giving the states more and more sovereignty.  And if you remember, it was the federal government that had to step in and take away sovereignty from the states because the states, under the cover of their sovereignty, were denying black folks any rights and doing anything they wanted to do.  And that--so, you know, it's going to be important for us to utilize a strategy that deals with that.  The effort to return power to the states to the extent that the states can then individually have different treatment of blacks and other groups based on their state sovereignty.
Story_ID: 192373
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that is very disappointing to me is to see that far too many of our black leaders are focused on empowering themselves and not focusing on empowering the community.  And it's very shortsighted on their part because then they become targets and can be picked off at any time.  I have in my files, the names of thousands of people that I got jobs for in the state when folks--the white papers used to excoriate me, and they would say that when I had no opposition, "Oh, we're stuck with [HistoryMaker] Clarence Mitchell [III] for another four years."  And of course, that was--[HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory used to say that, "If any leader that's not under investigation by white folks needs to be investigated by black folks."  And I have found that to be so true.  And what has happened, as I look around and I see--I mean, I used to go into state agencies and I wouldn't go to supervisors or lower-level people, I would go to the secretary of that agency, the cabinet officer, and take black folks in with me.  And say, "These people need jobs.  Find them a job."  And as a state senator, of course, they were gonna find them jobs.  And they found them jobs.  Those who weren't qualified, they trained them to do the work, and I knew from my previous experiences, that this is what--when they talk about, "Well, white folks had been qualified, and black folks weren't qualified."  That's nonsense.  White folks were made qualified once they got in the job, and we were fed this stuff about, you know, "the reason white folks got the job is because--"  They got the job because their senators told the agency, "Hire 'em, and train 'em."  And I learned that from my white colleagues, so I just started doing the same thing they were doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you commented off-camera once about--you've never believed in this "being twice as good" business.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I--that's nonsense.  I mean, if there are those of us who choose to twice as good for their own benefit and for their own fulfillment, that's one thing.  But I never told to any of the folks, I'd tell 'em, "Do the best you can," but I never said, "Try to be twice as good as the white folks."  No.  You become politically connected.  Politics runs this country.  I mean, we have had some inept leadership running this country for years, and they were certainly not qualified.  There's no way in the world [President] George [Walker] Bush, the present president, was qualified to be governor of Texas.  He had never run for any other office.  The only thing that qualified him was he had the money and got the votes, and he controlled the system. There's no way that he should be president of the United States, but he--they stole the election.  Well, of course, the Democrats didn't really jump up and down too much, because in [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy's case they stole the election.  [President Richard Milhous] Nixon should have been President, but the Democrats--
Speaker 1: This is the electoral vote count, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, but the Democrats, Kennedy's father [Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy] got to Dick [Richard J.] Daley, and Dick Daley held out the count until he saw how many votes was needed for Kennedy to carry Illinois.  I mean, that's the reality.  Whether they want to tell the truth or not, we all know what happened.  Kennedy stole the election, and it was a joke that Kennedy used to tell, when they would say, "How come your election was so close?"  'Cause, you know, he only won by 110,000 votes by the popular vote.  And Illinois, he carried something like fifteen [15,000] or 20,000 votes.  So they used to say, "How come your election was so close?" and he would say, "Well, my father [Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy] couldn't afford a landslide" (laughter).  Basically, suggesting that his father's money had helped to oil the wheels.  I don't say--I mean, I don't know, I wasn't there, as to whether any direct bribery took place and that stuff, but money was placed in the right places in order for Kennedy to be president.  That's it.  And it's--that's the system.  Well, the only way you change the system is to be organized.
Story_ID: 192374
Speaker 1: The only way you beat the system and its money is to be organized.  For example, we look at Florida, and we say, "Oh, all those people were disenfranchised."  Well, we shoulda seen that coming and prepared for that.  We shoulda had a strategy in place that said, you know Bush's [President George Walker Bush] brother [Jeb Bush] is going to do whatever it takes to deliver this state.  One way of his being able to do that is to disenfranchise all the black voters, or as many of the black voters as he can.  We should have had marshals.  When I say marshals, I mean, community deputized marshals, not U.S. Marshals.  But people in those precincts, to check each of the persons who was coming to vote, and to protest each of the efforts to disenfranchise voters who came through--none of that was in place.  [Al] Gore and them felt they were going to win, and they took for granted the black vote, and Bush knew that they were going to take the black vote for granted, so they said, "those are the ones that we'll disenfranchise."  And the difference in Gore's loss of Florida was overwhelmingly the number of black voters that were disenfranchised.  That was it--that was a smart strategy on their part.  Now, when folks say, "Who was elected president three years ago?"  Al Gore was elected president.  But the Bush people were smart enough to steal the election, and they had the courts certify their theft.  So--I mean, but that's politics.  Nobody jumped up and down about it.  Gore people didn't file other actions and take other steps to--even though he had won the popular vote.  And even though, if there had been a proper count of Florida, he would have been president.  Well, that's a--the question now is, if [John] Kerry is going to learn from their experience, or is Kerry going to cut a deal, too?  I mean, there's some question as to whether or not Gore just finally said, "I'll cut a deal," you know, "let me go ahead and get away from here."
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a curious segment of Michael Moore's movie, 'Fahrenheit 911', where black women are raising the issue of the disenfranchisement of people in Florida in the [U.S.] Senate, of which Gore presides, you know?  But it's a joint session of both houses of Congress.  As women raised these issues, he basically gaveled them down.  He said they didn't have the proper--
Speaker 1: Standing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  To be able to--
Speaker 1: To be able to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They didn't have the support of the single senator.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw that in there.  [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters was one of them, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you would think that of all the senators and--Democratic senators, there would be one that would step forward, but nobody.  Not Dick Durbin of Illinois--
Speaker 1: They cut a deal.  They cut a deal (laughter).  And see, the thing is that we need to understand that that's why we can't be in the hip pocket of any party because they have their agenda, too.  And if they get the bulk of their agenda, then they will abandon us in a minute.  And so we have to be just as fluid, and we need to position ourselves in a way where we can prevent the--the denial of our agenda because we were loyal to a particular party, and didn't--when we should be loyal to the agenda. And whichever party is willing to address the largest portion of our agenda.
Story_ID: 192375
Speaker 1: Do you have a formula--it's more complicated than that, but do you have a formula for black America, in terms of its political future in this country that you would recommend?
Speaker 2: When you say, a formula--
Speaker 1: Or maybe a prescription of things we need to do--
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing we need to do is to organize politically.  We need to organize precinct by precinct by precinct throughout this country.
Speaker 1: That means getting out in the street, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That means getting out in the street and actually putting together an organization.  One advantage we would have, is that the Democratic Party is not organized.  Republicans are not organized.  And if we get out there and put together our own organizations, and--for example, there are congressional districts where if we had 75 percent black voter turnout, even though the district is only 40 percent black, or 35 percent black, we would win that seat because of the low white turnout. 'Cause they ain't organized either.  So the one that's organized is the one that gets--when I first won my house seat in this Maryland State House, I didn't win because I had a majority black district, I won because I got a bigger black turnout than the white folks, who relaxed, and said, "Oh, you know, we got this made anyway.  They're not going anywhere, they don't turn out."  By going door-to-door and asking people to come out, and then doing the follow-up afterwards; getting people on buses and getting them to the polling place; checking the voter participation at noon to see how many voters had already turned out, and how many more had not; finding from the voter lists who has voted, and who has not voted.  Those are the nitty-gritty kinds of things that you put together an organization to do.  And if you do that, you're going to succeed.  It's not that I'm so smart.  I learned from the old NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] organizers, I learned from the movement organizers, the people like Ella Baker and Floyd McKissick.  These were people who went in and organized and mobilized people.  And I understand one thing.  In this country, the only thing that gets you respect is numbers.  The most respected leader, African American leader, in this country is [HistoryMaker Minister] Louis Farrakhan.  They're not going to admit it, they're not going to tell you that, but nobody else has brought more than a million men, black men, to Washington, D.C.  Nobody.  And that's what they look at.  This man brought more than a million in numbers.  And they turn around and look at [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson], and all the black leaders together, who can't even get 200,000 blacks in the [National] Mall [Washington, D.C.].   A highly respected woman is [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height.  Why?  Dorothy Height has more than a million people down there--this is men and women.  I talked about Farrakhan bringing more than a million men.  Dorothy Height has more than a million people at the family picnic every year on the Mall in Washington.  They don't give a whole lot of coverage to that, but guess where--you look around to see where Dorothy Height shows up and is invited in all these different places.  The Republicans and the Democrats are fighting over her because she started this black family picnic that had something like twenty-five thousand people and grew into over a million people, not just in Washington [D.C.], but also began to have a family picnic in cities all over the country.  Very quietly, you bring together all these people, there's an opportunity for dialogue, an opportunity for mobilization, and that sort of thing.  Now, Dorothy is in her--almost ninety now, so she's not really able to capitalize on what she's done, but they sure respect the heck out of her.
Speaker 1: And people represent power.  It's not just money, it's--
Speaker 2: Money is utilized to get people.  If you can get the people, you don't need the money.  The money will come.  The money will follow the crowd (laughter).  You'd be surprised at how many people you--if you held a rally here in Baltimore [Maryland] down in the mall, in front of the city hall, and had 15,000 people, the business community will be coming to you, "Who are you?  We need to know you.  Come have lunch with us at the business club downtown."  You know, "It sure would be nice if you would be able to join us at the opening of the Walters Art Gallery [Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, Maryland]," and that sort of thing because you had fifteen thousand people down there.  I learned that from my mother [Juanita Elizabeth Jackson Mitchell] and grandmother [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson].  They had numbers of people at their rallies.
