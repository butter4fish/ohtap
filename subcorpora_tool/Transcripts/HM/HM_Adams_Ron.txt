Speaker 2: My mother's name was Laura, and the last name was Wortlaw [sic. Laura Wordlaw].
Speaker 1: Can you spell that please?
Speaker 2: W-O-R-T-L-A-W [sic.].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about your mother. Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: No she didn't. I don't know too much about her side of the family at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me about her.
Speaker 2: My mother was a housewife, stayed at home, did domestic chores et cetera, and other than that being, raising three kids at the particular time, which was myself, my older sister--
Speaker 1: What was her name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) whose name was Edmona [Edmona Adams], the second one was Sandra [Sandra Adams], and Betty [Betty Adams].
Speaker 1: Do you know about your mother's education?
Speaker 2: High school education in Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Do you know if she had any other pro- profession or job before she got married?
Speaker 2: Domestic work that's about to the extent that I know about her.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your relationship with your mother.
Speaker 2: Somewhat distant I would say. I wasn't as close to her as I feel as though I could have been, because one of the problems my mother did have a drinking problem, which I didn't care much for and was kind of difficult to live with.
Speaker 1: I see, okay. All right is there anything else that you'd like to share about her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a very wonderful, sweet, sensitive kind of person and she was always there and willing to help people, et cetera, and I really can't think of ever, I don't remember any harsh punishments or anything negative that I could really say other than the drinking problem, which did cause a problem between her and my father [William Adams] who was teetotaler. So, there, there was a lot of conflict which eventually drive through divorce and separations.
Story_ID: 623773
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents on your mother's [Laura Wordlaw] side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, yes.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Lina Belle Paterson [Lina Paterson].
Speaker 1: And tell me about your grandmother.
Speaker 2: My grandmother was more of an old stable within the family, and she was on my mother's side, and she was a very wonderful person in a lot of ways, and we spent a lot of time with her when I was a kid. She was--some of the stories about her--my grandmother was very fair and quite often she was mistaken for Anglo [Anglo-Saxon] and it would upset her quite often. But, there are certain curious things I wondered about my grandmother, which caused certain questions I don't know about the family, because my grandmother was very fair and she introduced me once, I remember as I was a kid, to one of her brothers who was extremely dark. And I never thought about it until I got to be older, because I just accepted grandmother, and I never thought about well why--until I got older--how come her brother is so dark and she's damn near white? And for some reason, I found people in my generation, I had a lot of other friends whose family don't like to discuss the various heritage issues because I don't know if it's an embarrassment or shame or whatever. I mean they don't want to talk about it, and I find that as a big problem within the Afro American community because I have a lot of friends who say their folks, they don't wanna talk about certain things.
Speaker 1: Well do you know, did you know or find out about your grandmother's parent, parents?
Speaker 2: I never did. It was one of those secrets. I did have a couple of--most of the old relatives they're dying off, and like I'm saying they weren't very forthcoming why grandma (laughter) looked like she did. So, I mean you know we questioned it, but they don't talk about, they don't want to talk about that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: All right, well tell me some of the things--you said you had a very good relationship with your grandmother. Tell me some of the things that, that you did with her or what you remember most about her?
Speaker 2: Well, some of the things like, a lot of things we would take for granted regarding grandmother. One of the funny things, for some reason--she came along in an era where I guess it was illegal, I guess back in the '30s [1930s], to have booze and that sort of thing. But even after I got to be an old, a grown man she would, she always kept a barrel under the sink for, she had a habit of putting canned goods, saving them for hard times in case something happened. And also in that barrel she'd keep her little stash of booze and every so often she'd call me, "Hey grandson, come here," (laughter), "come in here. Want a little nip?" You know. She'd look around like she was stealing something you would think, and she'd go into this barrel and bring out this little bottle of whiskey and look all around like somebody was watching and, and give me a little taste of whiskey, and she thought she was doing something, being very liberal (laughter). So, I mean that was one of the stories I know about grandmother. And she was just always dependable and always there and a kind word. I don't, I can't think of any--I never remember being disciplined or anything by her or anything negative, and she was just grandma.
Speaker 1: Was she married?
Speaker 2: To my knowledge, I don't remember the grandfather, I mean he might have, he passed some years ago. So, I do remember my mother and my aunts and that sort of thing, but I don't remember anything regarding a grandfather at all.
Story_ID: 623774
Speaker 1: So how many siblings did your mother have?
Speaker 2: She had two sisters, so it was three of them altogether.
Speaker 1: And what were their names?
Speaker 2: One was named, my mother's name was Laura [Laura Wordlaw]. She had a sister named Maggie or Margaret [ph.], and then she had one named Dorothy [ph.].
Speaker 1: And did you have a relationship with them; is there a story about them?
Speaker 2: Not too many. We would go and visit, but the younger one, the Dorothy one, she died when I was very young of tuberculosis, so I didn't, I wasn't around her that much, but she had cousin, I mean my cousins and so forth, first cousins, I did get to know them.
Speaker 1: All right is there anything else you wanted to share about your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not really. The greatest question that I wanna share is, why was grandma [Lina Paterson] so, (laughter), why wouldn't they tell me anything about--more about her background? And I think it was just a matter of embarrassment that she was so unlike her brothers and sisters. Now how that came about, whether she's a mistress or whatever I, I don't really know because I mean those are certain things people don't discuss and that seems to be a problem on both sides, my mother's side as well as my father's [William Adams] side.
Speaker 1: Well your, your grandmother's brothers and sisters did you meet just that one brother? Did you just meet him?
Speaker 2: I, I only remember seeing him once.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seeing him once.
Speaker 1: What about the other brothers and sisters did you remember?
Speaker 2: No, I, I don't, I, I wish I did have a better knowledge of that side of the family, but I'm sorry I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Well one just before we go to your father's side of the family, you said that your grandmother used to hide or, or store canned goods, you know under the sink along with that barrel, but do you think that she stored these things because she had been through the Depression [Great Depression] and--?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think so, I think so. Saving, she says saving it for hard times. She would keep it full of canned goods and things like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 623775
Speaker 1: So now tell me your father's name and when and where he was born if you know.
Speaker 2: My father's name was William Ned, N-E-D, Adams [William Adams], which he was more known by Ned. My father was one of these people who was a extremely bright person, and he worked most of his life as an electrician doing everything from--he started out when he was a kid doing crystal sets and later on, I mean he could do house wiring or whatever, like I'm saying he was, he was a troubleshooter for a lot of electricians because he was just that bright. And at that particular time he worked at a lot of the department stores where there were not blacks hired doing electrical work. I guess that was when I was a kid, so I mean and, but he was a very social person and he has one trait that, which I find myself in and it's positive in a lot of ways and negative--he's one of these people that he attracted people. He always had a group of people hanging on, and sometimes a lot of this did affect his obligations as far as a father is concerned. I mean he always had a bunch of friends, and I mentioned the fact that he was nondrinker, but my mother [Laura Wordlaw] was an alcoholic, which did cause a lot of problem, but he had his problems too. My father was a hell of a womanizer, so therefore I question maybe that caused my mother to drink. But, I mean he was, like I'm saying, he was definitely into the ladies to the extreme, which did cause a lot of problems when we were coming up as kids because there was constant breakup and living with this relative and that relative, and they'd go back together, so therefore it caused a hardship where I mean I guess I'd gone, by the time I got out of high school [Northwestern High School, Detroit, Michigan], I'm sure I'd been transferred seven or eight times to different schools and bounced around, staying with different relatives because of the problems between my mother and father and being--taking over, stay with this relative for a couple of weeks, the other one for a couple of weeks or something, then back home, change schools and that sort of thing. So, I mean most of my life was pretty much like that.
Speaker 1: Do you know when your fath- or where your father was born?
Speaker 2: Evergreen, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Have any idea of what year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did, is he still alive?
Speaker 2: No, he passed.
Speaker 1: Do you know when he passed away?
Speaker 2: Not really, those dates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My sister probably could inform you of all that information.
Speaker 1: And his education, do you know how he came to become an electrician? How did he get the education to become an electrician?
Speaker 2: More or less it started off as a hobby I would assume because he started long before I was born, you know, into electronics and that sort of thing, so before I was born I guess and possibly during that time radios and everything was possibly rather new because he started out with crystal sets and sort of thing.
Speaker 1: What, what is a crystal set?
Speaker 2: Oh it's some kind of little device or something where you can pick up radio signals or something with that.
Speaker 1: So do you think he was self taught or did he go to school?
Speaker 2: No, he's self taught, self taught.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what about your relationship with him, your relationship, your personal relationship.
Speaker 2: I felt as though I missed out a lot because like I said he was more involved with friends and that sort of thing, and as far as his son, quite often I reflect he never, he, he taught a lot of people electronics and everything, but he never spent a lot of time with me. And I do feel somewhat--wondered why he never invested that kind of time in me.
Speaker 1: Were you interested in electronics at all at any age?
Speaker 2: No, because the fact is, is there was always radios or whatever. So, if one died or something I'd just get another one, so I had no interest in trying to find out what made it tick. It didn't work, get another one, so I mean there was always plenty of them around.
Story_ID: 623776
Speaker 1: All right, well let's talk about his [Adams' father, William Adams] parents. Do you know who his parents were?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was my grandmother. Her name was Laura Welch [Laura Welch Adams], from the Welch side of the family, and she died, which was my father's mother, she died when I was a baby. So, therefore, I don't know a lot about her. I must have been about a year old when she died. So, there wasn't very much to say about the interaction between her and myself. But I had started to talk about the fact that I was, during my stay in New Mexico I did come to Atlanta [Georgia] for various art festivals, but returning to New Mexico I went down through Birmingham, or Alabama, and I happen to run into this small town, which I have asked many people in Alabama, "Have you ever heard of a town called Evergreen, Alabama?" And most people said no. But, I was driving, returning to New Mexico, and I was driving down some road going through New Orleans or Louisiana, and I saw this little town called Evergreen, Alabama. So, I pulled over and went to the hall of records there figuring this must be it. And the man recommended, over at the hall of records, that I go over to the library, they could give me more information. And I was kind of surprised because they had books there with, went all the way back to slavery because they had different people's names in these logs who could read and write, black and white. You know it was a slave owned by this, and it was really interesting. I was there trying to just find out something about the family and I happen--the lady in the library came over and asked me, "Well, you've been here for a couple of hours, something I can help you with?" I said, "Yeah, I was just trying to look up something regarding relatives." And she said, "Well, what were their names?" I said, "Well, the last name is Welch." And she says, "Well, there's a lady here who goes to church with some Welches, here in this little town."
Story_ID: 623777
Speaker 1: And she introduced me to the lady, and the lady said, "Well, let me call 'em." So she called and come to find out it was an old aunt of mine that I remember seeing when I must have been two years old, but I do remember that lady. And so I went by her house and talked to her and everything and asked her about the family, and like I'm saying it got into one of those things, like from what I understand that her grandfather was mixed also. And it was one of those things I was inquiring about that while--, "Well, he was an outside baby." "What, what do you mean outside," (laughter), "outside of what? What are you talking about?" "Well, your granddaddy was an outside baby." Well what--because what I found out, you see now his father was Anglo [Anglo-Saxon], but he did have brothers and sisters who are white. But the fact is, is that there was one tale, which my aunt told me, that he was coming back in town because his father had sent him to school to be a school teacher. Now in Alabama, and from what I understand he was one of the first school teachers in Alabama. So, he was coming home from somewhere, a town or something and some white guy or something tried to run him off the road with his buggy or something, and he hit the guy with his whip or something, and they started a big thing and he came home. And this guy was gonna go back to town and get the Ku Klux [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] after my grandfather. But, then he had some half brothers say, "Don't you--no, no, no, don't mess with him." So, they actually defended him from this sort of thing, but yet in still they--the dad did think enough to send him to school and get an education and that sort of thing. And like I said I, I, I asked this aunt that I was talking with, "Well, that side of the family, I only know--they must have been okay if they looked out for my grandfather; well who are they?" Well, nobody wanted to give up that information on that side of the family. He was an outsider and that side of the family--I figured, well they may be as curious about me as I am them, and I mean that doesn't necessarily have to be all negative. I mean I didn't do the stuff. You know I wasn't into it. Now, if they did something that they were ashamed of I didn't, I just wanna know were, who these people were and they'd probably as interested in meeting them as you know I'm meeting them. So, anyway. But like I'm saying within the older families--and like I said I've talked to other people with mixed heritage and the older people don't wanna acknowledge, well what happened or who was involved in it, because I met several friends with the same problem.
Speaker 2: Okay let's, let's just clear up who we're talking about. You, when you say your grandfather, are you talking about Laura Welch's [Adams' paternal grandmother, Laura Welch Adams] father?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's your great-grandfather?
Speaker 1: Great-grandfather, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and do you know what his name was?
Speaker 1: Does it say on that one paper, General Welch?
Speaker 2: General Welch, okay yes.
Speaker 1: That might have been him.
Speaker 2: General Welch, okay. And his name was General?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's not a title (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, he wasn't a general (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, so General Welch married, what was, what was your great-grandmother's name? Can you remember it? Jennie, was it Jennie Ann [sic. Johnie Welch]?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right that's fine. Okay so do you remember the aunt's name that you talked to in Evergreen [Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Sara.
Speaker 2: Was there anything else that she shared about your great-grandfather? Is she the one that helped you find the article about your family?
Speaker 1: No, no that was at the library. It wasn't an article. She happen to go to church with this Welch, Sara Welch.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was talking about the article that you showed me that had General Welch and the whole family tree on it. Where did you get that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't really know where that come from.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: I really, I'd have think about it. I don't know where I got that from.
Speaker 2: Was there anything else that your Aunt Sara shared with you about the Welch family?
Speaker 1: No, it did arouse my curiosity as to who those other, that side of the family.
Speaker 2: Who the white Welches were.
Speaker 1: They weren't, now they weren't Welch though. I don't know what--
Speaker 2: Oh you don't know what the father's name was okay.
Speaker 1: No. Now I do know that he owned a store there, and I think in Evergreen.
Speaker 2: Okay. I know that the article did say that General Welch was born in 1882.
Story_ID: 623778
Speaker 1: You gave me your siblings' names. You wanna tell me what they do?
Speaker 2: Well, my older sister, named Edmona [Edmona Adams]. She was a beautician. The second one was Sandra [Sandra Adams], who was a domestic worker, and then the younger one, Betty [Betty Adams], was a social worker.
Speaker 1: Where do you fit in? Are you the youngest?
Speaker 2: I was the second to the oldest. My sister and then myself and then the other two sisters.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about your early years, and you grew up in inner city Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) The earliest?
Speaker 1: What can you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's dream or fantasy, I remember riding down or going, my dad [William Adams] taking me somewhere in a wagon, and I remember passing some man or something on a goat, with a goat on a cart or something and that's as far as I, maybe I was two years old. I don't even remember what that was all about. Like I said I don't know if it's a dream or something that was implanted (laughter) in my head. I do have that memory though.
Story_ID: 623779
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your, your neighborhood in which you grew up. Did you all live in a house or an apartment?
Speaker 2: We lived in a house when I was very young, and that was in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Do you remember the street address?
Speaker 2: It might have been Mullett [Street], and I do know there is a huge cemetery at the end of this particular street and it's still there. I don't know the name of it. It's very huge, and I do remember as a kid we used to go over there and play in this old cemetery and they had a pond or something. We used to go over there and catch frogs and that sort of thing, and I don't think we were afraid of ghosts or anything. I didn't have any, but we used to go over there and play in this big cemetery.
Speaker 1: If you were to take me on a tour of a square block of where you grew up, what would I see? Who owned the stores at that time? Who were the people in the neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Well, we have to skip some years until I got I guess about ten or twelve years old that I do remember. I stayed in, my dad [William Adams] bought a place in Detroit on Northfield Avenue and I remember some of the fellows in the neighborhood. I know if you need me to list their names.
Speaker 1: Sure, you can tell me their names.
Speaker 2: Well one was Sam Lathan [ph.], Sonny Watts [ph.], Clarence Smith [ph.], or the Smith brothers, and down the street were the Heglers [ph.], who were twins, and I think those were most of the--Arvist Swanson [ph.], yes, and those are the names that I can remember, are the closest friends.
Speaker 1: So what did you used to do with your friends? Now we're talking, you were born you know during the Depression [Great Depression].
Speaker 2: Slightly, I was born in '34 [1934], so I mean like I'm saying I wasn't aware of the Depression 'til after.
Speaker 1: After okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when we were possible coming out. I do remember my aunts and things, staying with them, coming home, and I think they were working as domestic workers, always bring shopping bag full of food home and I don't know where they got them from and so forth.
Story_ID: 623780
Speaker 1: Now, regarding activities of some of the things we did as a kid, I do remember we used to play various games like, one was called hands drop feet no move. It was one of those things where you'd sit on the steps or something and the first person who makes a move or something he has to be tagged, whoever is up. I don't remember all the rules, but anyway the person asking the questions, when he saw a person move or something this person, if you could tag this person before a particular incident. And sometimes we would hide and that sort of thing, but one of the most interesting things is, is when I was a kid we used to enjoy the summers when all of the fruit trees were blooming and blossoming. And being a city kid, I mean, the only place we could get that fruit and that sort of thing, other than buying it in the store, was to raid people's cherry trees, which was kind of adventurous because sometimes we'd have to climb on the garages. There were dogs and so forth in the yard or somebody would come out and maybe shoot at us or something. So, we used to get a great amount of fun out of doing that, (laughter) raiding people's trees, but nothing malicious or stealing or anything. And I do remember some of the, one of the things, that we could go for about three miles in the City of Detroit [Michigan] without hitting a major street because we knew every shortcut through every yard. So, if anyone ever was chasing us, we could be across town (laughter) in ten minutes. So, I mean that was one of the things that we did as a kid, but I mean I don't think we did any awful things like breaking in or stealing or robbing. One of the things I do remember as I was a kid, my dad [William Adams], like I'm saying, and my mother [Laura Wordlaw] were divorced, and so therefore we predominately stayed with my dad and he was generally working. But, I never, he told me, "Well, now if you see any of these other guys doing something that was illegal or they shouldn't be doing, remember if the police comes here and you're with them, whether you're involved in it or not, you know you're caught in that net. So, if they're doing something and you don't want to be a part of it, it's better to go." So, I, I was very fortunate I don't have--but being brought up in a rough city like Detroit most of the friends that I was brought up with I'm sure most of them are dead or junkies or something. But, I managed to escape all of that, and to this day, I mean I've never really done any jail time or been busted for--I was arrested once for--someone borrowed a car of mine and had a ticket on it, and that was the only time I was put in jail--was I didn't know it had tickets on there, so I was arrested for that. But, otherwise I got a pretty clean record in the United States that is. But, which is further down the road when I was--yeah.
Story_ID: 623781
Speaker 1: How old were you when your mother [Laura Wordlaw] and father [William Adams] divorced?
Speaker 2: It, it varied because see they were breaking off, off and on most of my life. You know I mean they'd get together, stay two months or six months and then next time--moving in with some relative or something because they were going through some of their--between my mother's drinking, my dad womanizing and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go back to the neighborhood that you grew up in, and you had alluded that really you were a little more stable when you were about ten or twelve years old is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. In that neighborhood you just listed some of your friends. Do you know whether they lived in two family, I'm sorry two parent households and do you know any of the professions or jobs, occupations that their parents had?
Speaker 2: Well, my closest buddy was Sonny Watts [ph.] and I know his mother was a school teacher, very well educated. It was very, it was one of the haves, as his mother was a school teacher and so forth. I think his grandparents were even, his grandparents were even teachers. And his dad, I do remember was a manager at a bowling alley called Forest Club [Detroit, Michigan]. And so they, they, they were the haves more or less, and he always seem to have most of the things that a lot of other kids in the neighborhood would dream to have. And, but he was one of those people, he and I were very close, but I think he, we parted ways after we got to be teenagers, and I heard he was into drugs quite a bit. I don't know whether he is dead or alive now.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me more about the people in the neighborhood. Who owned the stores?
Speaker 2: That I don't remember. I remember the, one particular store, I think it was Charlie's [ph.], and we'd always go in there and get our little cupcakes and things like that. But then next door was the barbershop. Now I do--that had some memories to remember. There was a lady named Ms. Vernerbol [ph.], and she was a barber, and that lady, she had a mean streak in her because she had those little hand clippers, I don't know, and if you moved she'd jab you in the head with those damn clippers you know (laughter), and the only time we could get back at her is during Halloween we'd put wax on her windows and things. But, that old woman was mean, you know, but she was the only barber around (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and do you think that that's something that was unusual to have a woman barber? Or at that time that was the only thing that you, you knew.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do remember going to her. I never thought about it at that particular time. It probably was as a kid, but I never, I don't remember having that as a stigma, whether or not she's a woman or not. I remember she was meaner than hell, you know.
Story_ID: 623782
Speaker 1: All right, tell me about your elementary school. What was the elementary school that you went to?
Speaker 2: Called Sampson Elementary School [William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about Sampson?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess it was an average school, and I wasn't much of a student because like I said by being consistently transferred from one school to another, but I think I do remember spending more time at that particular school and I, like I had no special teachers or anything, except when I got--I guess about in the fourth or fifth grade there was one art teacher who seemed to taking a liking to me. And that was about it for grammar school.
Speaker 1: Were you showing signs of artistic ability at that time? Do you think that's why--?
Speaker 2: I think so because that's the only thing I've ever stood out or was--as a kid, and this one particular teacher, his name was Mr. Berg [ph.], and he was a tall thin looking person as I can remember, and he kind of reminds you of Ichabod Crane or somebody. But for some reason he took me, or thought that I had a little more going for me then most of the students. And from this, I do remember there was a special program that they had at the art institute in Detroit [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan] that I was one of the few students in the whole school selected, because there was a special program that the art institute in Detroit had, and I still think it may go on, where they would actually come to the schools or your home and pick the kids up and take them to the institute and give them various drawing lessons and deliver them home, and I was selected to be one of the students. And at that particular time I was staying with my uncle and aunt, and he would not sign the papers for me to go to this school. You know, "Boy, that's sissy stuff. You don't need that. I've been working at Ford [Ford Motor Company] for thirty-five years and never missed a day," and I mean he would hand you one of those raps and therefore, I mean to even think about art at that particular time was foolish. You know you're not gonna get a job as an artist or whatever. Like he'd constantly, he's been working at Ford for thirty-five years and never missed a day, and that was all he believed in. So, therefore, I mean I was denied the opportunity to go to--and that, I've always carried that around to go to that particular art school since like I said it was the only thing that I shined in.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about the other activities. Were you involved in any other activities either in school or outside of school?
Speaker 2: I loved swimming, and I've always been very active going to the parks. And I remember in one particular park, called River Rouge [River Rouge Park] in Detroit [Michigan]. We had a, we found an old, it was like a tub that they mix cement in and we happened to find one and we decided we would take this tub, which some construction workers had and we confiscated it, we didn't steal it, we borrowed it, and we would get this and use it for our boat going up and down this river [Rouge River]. And I do remember my dad [William Adams] bought me an Easter suit for Easter to go to church in. I went to church and then we decided we'd go out to the park after that church, and when I came back that suit was just awful. I just ruined the suit, and I do remember being my--figuring if I could get home, get in the bed and go to sleep before my dad came home (laughter), I was safe. And I've never woken up to such an ass whipping in my life (laughter). That suit was gone.
Story_ID: 623783
Speaker 1: Did you spend any time reading or even thinking about what you'd like to be when you grow up?
Speaker 2: I, you see one of the things about Michigan, I was never an athletic person. My dad [William Adams] bought me ice skates, hockey, and everything, well I hate winter. I do not like winter. I hate it and that's one of the main reasons I got out of Michigan, and so therefore by me staying in the house most of the time, I would love to sit by the stove, we had big old stoves in the living room, and draw. And my dad was like, I'm saying he, he could draw as well as, for an amateur he's extremely good and I think I was encouraged by that. I mean he was better than the average person, and so anyway that's possibly where I was first introduced to art because like I said, "No, I'm not going out there and play in that snow. I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna sit in the house and draw." And so I mean I, just one of those things I took for granted and I didn't think about possibly at that particular time of a profession or anything because it was just never even considered, you know. People weren't, people were really just coming out of the Depression [Great Depression] and people didn't think about getting into art and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Well, not necessarily that art would be your profession, but did you ever think about what you would do--
Speaker 2: Other than that.
Speaker 1: --other than you know being an artist (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no I was taking it just one day at a time. I had no vision of the future or what I wanted to do or, you know like I said I wasn't brought up where your folks encourage you, well go to college, do this or reach for certain goals. I never had any influence or anyone to implant any ideas to try and rise above my, the situation I was in.
Speaker 1: When do you remember first picking up a pen or a pencil or, and just beginning to draw? Did you--
Speaker 2: No, I don't have any recollections of attempting to copy anything, or anything of that nature. No, I don't. I just simply, like I said I've always done that, it's just you know when it started or why it started or what influence me to me, it's just natural as breathing. It's just something, hey that's what I do.
Speaker 1: So when you would begin to, to draw, to pick up a pencil and, and begin the draw, what were you drawing?
Speaker 2: I was primarily, I used to copy a lot of the things out of the Sunday paper, and I do remember this one artist I really like. His name was Hal Foster. He used to do illustrations of Prince Valiant. I don't know if you remember those, in the comic books about knights and that sort of thing. And I drew, I loved his work, and I do remember copying a lot of those things and yeah, et cetera.
Speaker 1: So did you, was comic books one of your hobbies or you just used it to just draw?
Speaker 2: Just, no it was more, more newspaper at that particular time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Newspaper.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It would come out in the Sunday paper, all the nice beautiful color illustrations and so forth.
Story_ID: 623784
Speaker 1: So after elementary school [William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], what--did you go to junior high school or straight to high school from elementary school?
Speaker 2: I dropped out after--I went to high school and dropped out and then I went back to school.
Speaker 1: What high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Northwestern [Northwestern High School] in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your days in high school. Why, why did you drop out? Was that a school--did you start there at that high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and you said you dropped out. What year did you drop out?
Speaker 2: Yeah for a while.
Speaker 1: What grade were you in when you dropped out?
Speaker 2: I was about in tenth.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did you do during that time that you were not in school?
Speaker 2: Played basketball. That's all I can remember doing then (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why did you drop out?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I just think a lot of it is, is that I, I felt a lot had to do with like I'm saying my attire. I didn't have the right shoes or something. I just felt kind of like well I didn't, you know couldn't keep up with the other kids and so therefore I felt embarrassed, so I didn't go for a while.
Speaker 1: And, and who encouraged you to go back to school?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I was out for a year or so and then I went back and then after that, finishing up, then I decided I would go to I think California. So, I left Michigan because I didn't like, like I said I didn't like the cold in Michigan. And another friend of mine and myself, the three of us, he had an old '48 [1948] Ford, I think, we drove from Detroit to California and I did have re- relatives there in California.
Speaker 1: Okay so do you know what year this was that you finished school and went to California?
Speaker 2: In California, let's see now.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you finally finished high school?
Speaker 2: I was about seventeen.
Speaker 1: After being out for two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm just thinking that you might have been a little older if you were out for two years and then went back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I possibly was. It might--
Speaker 1: It might have been about nineteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 623785
Speaker 1: So who did you stay with when you got to California?
Speaker 2: My dad's half brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Okay, I went there with two of my friends from California [sic.] and we just decided we would go to California from Detroit [Michigan], and we went there and stayed awhile, and then they decided to go back to Michigan for some reason, and I went back to Michigan, and then I stayed there for a short period of time and then I went back to California. I don't remember what caused us to go back. I don't remember exactly why we turned around and went back after a certain amount of time in Michigan. And after staying in Michigan, I don't think it was very long I stayed there, then I went back to California.
Speaker 1: Did you go back with the same friends?
Speaker 2: No, I remember primarily going back alone. But then one of my friends did join me. I don't remember when or where, but I do remember my other buddy that originally went there went back to Michigan and then I came back alone and then I remember he was there. I don't remember how or what situation was.
Speaker 1: What did you do the first time you went to, to California? This, this had to be in the '50s [1950s], like '53 [1953] somewhere around that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Somewhere, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you do when you first got there? What were you hoping to, to do when you made that change?
Speaker 2: Well, just trying to think of the various goals I had then and I, I, I think I was about, I wasn't twenty I don't think. I was pretty young. And other than doing those things a teenager, chasing girls and that sort of thing, I don't think I had any particular objectives, but because that side of the family, which my father's [William Adams] side of the family, there's a much more stable environment. Most of them were, you know they were factory workers, but most of them were supervisors or whatever they were doing. And so they got me a job there working at one of the places that they were working.
Speaker 1: Do you remember where it was, what--?
Speaker 2: Yes it's called Litton--no, no Mission Appliance [Mission Appliance Corporation] was where they started, the first really full time job I had and I was working on the assembly line, and then I was there for a couple of years, and then I moved up to a forklift operator and I think I was about, I don't know I think I might have been about twenty-one or something because that's when I got married [to Mary Adams (ph.)] when I was twenty-one.
Story_ID: 623786
Speaker 1: How did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: In church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where all the action was really (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, we, we, didn't talk about religion when you were growing up. Were you active in any church when growing up even though you had, was kind of unstable, so you didn't go to church then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, your family wasn't, okay. So, how did you begin going to church out in California?
Speaker 2: Well that's what I said, it must have been when I moved to California. It's just a group of people I met and a lot of them belonged to this particular church and I went there and that's where I met my wife and so forth.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mary [Mary Adams (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And yeah and we went together for about a year or something and she became pregnant, and so I decided I did not want my kid to have to go through what I went through, so therefore I, you know, decided to do the right thing, which people don't know. I figured, "Well hey, I'm gonna marry the lady," you know rather than--my uncle said, "What do you wanna do? You wanna go back to Michigan or what?" "No, I'm gonna do the right thing," you know. So anyway and I got married, you know.
Speaker 1: All right and you were still working at this company?
Speaker 2: Mission, yes, Mission Appliance [Mission Appliance Corporation], yes.
Speaker 1: Mission. How do you spell that? Do you--
Speaker 2: M-I-S-S-I-O-N (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Mission.
Speaker 2: Mission, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 623787
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens next in your life? You're married and eventually you have--
Speaker 2: Daughter.
Speaker 1: --a daughter and what is her name?
Speaker 2: Rochelle [Rochelle Adams (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Rochelle okay. And what did your wife [Mary Adams (ph.)] do for a living? What did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, when I got married at that particular time she was just getting out of high school or whatever and so she wanted to be, so I, I was working, and so she wanted to be a nurse, and so she went to school to continue her education to be a nurse. And partially, before she was through, I had changed jobs. I quit Mission Appliance [Mission Appliance Corporation] and I got an opportunity to work at, got a job at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], which was a very positive thing that happened because to me, I was at the post office and in a lot of ways there are a lot of advantages came out of it. I started working there and I happen to meet, while I was working at the post office, a fella by the name of Leon Anderson [ph.]. He was a gay guy and he'd been in the [U.S.] military, really wonderful person, and he was in charge of the time office, and he happened to get me in a job at the time office, and I don't know why, but anyway the guy was definitely gay, which he's a wonderful person, I don't hold that against him, but I happened to ask him why, you know why you got--hire me or something. He says, "Well, if you're a young man you'd like to hire a bunch of beautiful ladies to be around on you. Well, I'm gay and I like young men around me," but he never made a pass at me or anything. And that way I had an opportunity to go to school and work in the particular time office, and I had a very easy job, and that's picking the time cards up, sorting them out when people come in, putting the cards back in the rack when they are, before the lunch and then pick them up, and after that, and other that that was it. And therefore I could, if I wanted to go back to school, which my wife was going to school and I was also going to school, I could do my homework right there at the job. So, I did that for a while, and while I was there I did happen, before I got in school, I happened to meet a Chinese fella, his name is Wong [ph.]. I don't remember what his name was. He was taking a course at Trade Tech in Los Angeles [Los Angeles Trade Technical College, Los Angeles, California] to be an illustrator, and he was telling me about it and I said, "Well, that sounds interesting to me." And so I went and signed up, and so therefore I went to school to be a tech illustrator [technical illustrator]. While my wife was working during the day, I was working at nights at the post office, so we could, we had a daughter then, and so it worked out fine for us. And so I completed the course of tech illustration and immediately I got a job working at Hughes Aircraft [Hughes Aircraft Company] as an illustrator.
Story_ID: 623788
Speaker 1: Now tell me what, what a tech, a tech (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tech illustrator is?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Actually it's a, it's a pretty broad field. Like I had to learn drafting, which I had to take quite a few classes, because for some reason they put a lot of stipulations, when I first entered where they wanted me to have qualifications in engineering this sort of thing and they put me through--because I noticed once I got in there a lot of the other guys, because I was the only black, only black person in there, but a lot of the other people that were in this class none of them had to go through those preliminary steps that I had to go into to get into the class; I'm glad I did. But anyway I did get into it and I took the classes, about a three year class and immediately once I graduated I got out of, I went to Hughes Aircraft [Hughes Aircraft Company] because they were dying for illustrators and I worked at Hughes Aircraft for--
Speaker 1: So you felt that the classes that even though the other people didn't have to you know go through those steps (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The background, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that that helped you in any way?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think it hurt me. I don't think it hurt me. You know education isn't--you know like I had to take drafting courses and engineering and all of that sort of thing and, and took a couple of, went to night school and everything, trying you know--and no I don't, like I'm saying I don't regret taking any of that.
Speaker 1: So, actually the courses that you took in drafting at night school that all had to do with you getting into this--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --technical illustration.
Speaker 2: Illustrator.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. So what years are we talking about now? 'Cause you took an engineering class, like each class took a year?
Speaker 2: No, no, no I was going some--like there would be summer classes or you know and then even after I got out of school I took quite a few commercial art courses at Trade Tech [Los Angeles Trade Technical College, Los Angeles, California] that was in conjunction with the tech illustration. So, therefore, because tech illustration was kind of a rigid, it's closer to drafting than anything else, but I had to learn other aspects of art because it's so broad. Like you might have to do a hand or something holding a wrench, fixing a particular part of an airplane or something, well you have to know how to draw a hand. You have to know how to do different things, so quite often--but also you have to know how to do lettering, sign painting, page layout. So, I got a pretty broad experience taking, learning that. And like I said fortunately I was able to get a job immediately at Hughes Aircraft. I got laid off and I got a job at Litton Industries [Litton Industries, Inc.] and then went back to Hughes Aircraft and got job, another, same, same desk everything (laughter) that I had.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 623789
Speaker 1: Did you attend Trade Tech [Los Angeles Trade Technical College, Los Angeles, California] once or twice or was it--(unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I actually attended it twice, and the first time I took some other graphic course and that was about the time I got married [to Mary Adams (ph.)] and I dropped out, and then I returned and enrolled in the tech illustration [technical illustration] the second time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year are we in? About 1959, 1960?
Speaker 2: I don't, that's, that's on my resume there, so I can get that, pull that over.
Speaker 1: All right, now let's talk about the job that you got at Hughes [Hughes Aircraft Company].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me what you, what you did?
Speaker 2: I started out as an illustrator and actually we were working in conjunction with the various technical writers, and therefore they might, you might get a bunch of blueprints and everything and the technical writer would explain various things, and you had to be able to read the schematics and understand what he was trying to project on these schematics. And a lot of times they did not have the knowledge of actually drawing the diagrams and schematics the proper way. They would do a rough drawing, and we had to straighten out the drawings on (unclear), make them a lot more readable to the person who was doing the repairing, or understand the schematics, because when the engineers got--they just did it in short hand more or less, and so therefore you had to more or less straighten it out and make it more presentable to be published in, in the various brochures and technical manuals that they were making.
Speaker 1: And, so how long did you do that? How long were you at Hughes?
Speaker 2: I guess about maybe three or four years or somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: I know we had asked off camera was Mr. Hughes [Howard Hughes] still alive at, I mean was he still involved with the company at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so. I, I never ran across him or had lunch with him or anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you left there you went to what company?
Speaker 2: Litton [Litton Industries, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Litton.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--I don't remember the exact dates, but I was from Hughes to Litton and then I left Litton and went back to Hughes.
Speaker 1: What did you do at Litton?
Speaker 2: Same thing, same type of work, tech illustrator.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what type of company was Litton? I know Hughes was aircraft.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well they, they have, it's a very--I was in field service and support at Hughes, and I don't remember what they called it when I was at Litton Industries some kind of service support or something. I don't remember exactly what you call that. Yeah, and it was the same type of work.
Story_ID: 623790
Speaker 1: And were you doing any of your drawings at home, you know still had you found your niche yet?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was after being at Hughes [Hughes Aircraft Company], I really got back into the art. It drew me back in from when I--reflected when I was a kid. And so I went to my supervisor when I was at Hughes Aircraft because I wanted to further my education, even when I was in tech illustration [technical illustration] at Trade Tech [Los Angeles Trade Technical College, Los Angeles, California], I was taking different commercial art courses and that sort of thing just to enrich my background, and I decided I would possibly try and get into fine art school. Now that's where they teach painting and drawing and sculpture, and so I said well now let me see now--I talked to my supervisor and they had a particular program at Hughes Aircraft and Litton [Litton Industries, Inc.], that any jobs that was associated with the line of work that you were working in they would totally reimburse you. So, I go to my supervisor and ask him, "Well, look I'm--," and most of them were artists or art background, but they weren't working as artists, but it sounded pretty good to them. I said, "Well," I said, "well, I wanna take some painting and sculpture classes. You think they'll pay for it?" And the supervisor said, "Well, I don't know. I'll submit the paperwork." So he did it and so there I managed to get all my fine art education totally reimbursed 100 percent. So I took advantage of that and that's when I really enrolled in artist--to a fine art school at Otis Art Institute [Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles, California] and that's when I decided, hey this is where I want to be rather than tech illustration.
Story_ID: 623791
Speaker 1: Otis Art Institute [Otis College of Art and Design] is, is located where?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles, California.
Speaker 1: And were you living in Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So tell me about attending Otis Art Institute.
Speaker 2: Well I had to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What classes, I know that you said that it was a fine arts school and painting and, and drawing.
Speaker 2: Drawing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your experience there.
Speaker 2: Okay, when I first went there I was studying with a guy I ended up--his name was Joe Mugnaini [Joseph Mugnaini]. He was an Italian guy. He's a pretty wild guy. He's a great teacher though. He is my first teacher, and he's, he's one of these people, he'd walk around and he, he always swore like a sailor. And they called him down to the office, I mean and he'd say some of the damnedest things. Like they had a couple of nuns in there, and he'd want you to put your whole body when you were in there, and he say, "Sister, use your balls when you draw" (laughter), you know and I mean he'd say things like that, and I mean he was called in the office, I mean it wasn't anything, but he was a great teacher and wonderful person. His name was Joe Mugnaini and as a matter of fact, he used to take a group and we would go down to Mexico a couple of times a year and camp out down in Ensenada [Mexico] and that sort of thing. And I'd take my dog and we'd camp out and have a good time. And you know they'd get to drinking and just real kind of, you know very few students, mostly just old friends. We had a pretty good time going down. That was my first time into Mexico, and we went down there and spent a lot of time together, and then I came back and then I--to--then I--Joe quit teaching at night and so I got with another teacher by the name of Arnold Mesches, who was very good. Both of them were very strong influences to me in my art career.
Speaker 1: And they, they taught drawing or painting?
Speaker 2: Drawing, drawing and like I said I studied painting, but if you see, what you will see more in my art, I'm not much of a color--I don't give a damn about--I'm more of the--like most of my drawings I, it's like doing a piece of sculpture or something. My objective in my art or when I do a drawing or something, I would like to say, oh here's your drawing. Now I can give it to a carpenter and there's no ambiguity and he knows what sides, what the top is, it's no fuzzy kind, you could actually construct it, the way I draw you know. And because of my background as a tech illustrator [technical illustrator] and that sort of thing. And I have studied sculpture, sculpture comes to me very easily because I, I've learned how to, about structure and--by being a tech illustrator, actually there's a lot of geometry. And one of the things I got from my teachers were, for instance during the time of Rembrandt and that sort of thing, people had just began to dissect bodies and that sort of thing, find out the muscles, but prior to that the Greeks did it and their work is very anatomically correct, but they used geometry. So, it's knowing how to see a head, a form, or figure and see the geometry in it rather than just strictly know the anatomy. I mean I can look at something and tell the form, and like I'm saying see like the nose, I can see well a pyramid or whatever or, or the eye, an oval eye I mean and, and know how to interpret most forms that way. That's why I like drawing. And painting I've done a few painting--but you find more people call themselves painters, but it's, to me there's a difference between--with drawing, it's dazzling them with brilliance, or baffling them with bullshit and that's painting. A lot of people they're lousy at art, but they can put some colors and everything and be, "(Makes sound) That's wonderful." No, no, no, no, no, you know, I mean like I'm saying they're, they're bullshitting you, you know with all that color and everything because there's nothing there.
Story_ID: 623792
Speaker 1: So at, at this school [Otis Art Institute; Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles, California] where you're learning drawing and, and you said sculpture, so you did take some sculpture classes?
Speaker 2: Sculpture and painting classes also.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know they had different schools within this art institute, you know because they did have you know a ceramic school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you participated in those schools as well?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --primarily I, I took a couple of sculpture classes, painting, and drawing; that's most of my background.
Speaker 1: During this time, how did you feel about the, what were the dominant movements going on in art around that time? This is, we're, we're talking about 1962 to '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know as far as what the movement is. I don't get too caught up--it's just like I'm seeing most of the people that I studied under were more expressionistic kind of thing, and a lot of the movements I would say was social statements and that sort of thing, because that was during the Vietnam War and prior to that. So, it was a lot of political statements and that sort of thing, and I know a couple of my teachers were, you know got us involved in a lot of the anti-war demonstrations and that sort of thing during that particular period.
Speaker 1: And, and what school, did you go to take some advance drawing at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took.
Speaker 1: Okay and so was that around the time when you were involved in anti-war demonstrations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell, tell me about some of them.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember one of the things I know we used to go up to during the war demonstration, we'd drive from, all the way from Los Angeles [California] up to San Francisco [California] to demonstrate. And also one of the big things I do remember somewhere on La Cienega [Boulevard]--not La Cienega, somewhere in West Hollywood [California] they were building some kind of tower of peace and that sort of thing and the police were out there, pretty active during that particular time. And then they had also at that particular time, it was back in the hippie days, where they had these love-ins and things. Like Elysian Park [Los Angeles, California], there might be five thousand people there and the grass [marijuana] and so forth, you could smell it a mile away (laughter). And the loud music and everything, and it was a pretty good time during those days you know. And not only that, I mean like I'm saying it was a different culture going on, love and flower child and all that sort of thing during those particular days.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah the war was going on too, but also civil rights was going on.
Speaker 2: Civil rights were going on too. When that really got into--as a matter of fact, I eventually moved to Mexico now, and that was when like I'm saying, I think at that particular time my Spanish wasn't that good and a bunch of kids run up to me and was trying to tell me that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been assassinated and I was living in Mexico at that particular time.
Story_ID: 623793
Speaker 1: Before you get to Mexico, there was an exhibit that the U.S. state department [U.S. Department of State], the 'Prints and Drawings.' Did you travel with them to Russia?
Speaker 2: No, that was Ruth Waddy who sent some of my stuff there.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that, what was that about?
Speaker 2: That was so far along. I don't know. I don't have any information on the show. I do know that the stuff went there with a group of other Afro American artists, went to Russia. Other than that, I never saw a catalog or anything about that. I don't know, no information.
Speaker 1: So none of your work was really art that protested anything during that time was it?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you took some classes also in metal engraving and, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, where do you take this and is this at the University of Mexico [sic. Academy of San Carlos, Mexico City, Mexico]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so if you, if Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated while you were living there and we're talking about 1967, '68 [1968], 'cause King was assassinated in '68 [1968]. Okay, so what made you decide to move to Mexico?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was studying at Otis Art Institute [Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles, California], like I'm saying I was one of these people, I was a fanatic in drawing and it became so facile that the drawings started looking slick. So, I wanted to try--I don't know if I could explain that, but it's too whimsical or commercial or something and so I, like I said I was just coming out divorce then, and I decided that this one teacher [Joseph Mugnaini], I was saying who was a pretty wild man at Otis Art Institute would take us down to Mexico and that sort of thing and I kind of liked it and I decided I would go to Mexico and live and that--so and not only that I wanted to do something else other than the drawing. So, that's when I got into the printmaking, etching, engraving, and lithography. That's how that came about.
Story_ID: 623794
Speaker 1: Now explain all three of those categories. Tell me what the process is.
Speaker 2: Well, my introduction to--I'll start from the beginning. It was in Mexico--when I left Los Angeles [California], I went to Mexico and arriving in Mexico I understood no Spanish whatsoever. And I decided I would go to school there in Mexico [Academy of San Carlos, Mexico City, Mexico], but drawing was something, like I'm saying you know my drawing was always, I was pretty good. And, but I wanted to do something a little different and so I decided that I would go to Mexico. Now I had a list of names of everybody, but I didn't know one place in Mexico. Some people, like I mean it's like you're going to Texas and somebody give you some information to look up different people and they live in Florida. Well Mexico is just as big. They gave me people who lived in Chiapas [Mexico], a hundred miles from there, very few people lived in Mexico City [Mexico]. Well, I didn't know one town from another. I didn't know whether it's ten miles or a hundred miles. And just the adventures of arriving in Mexico. When I got there, I saved all my money and at that particular time I'd gotten a divorce or in the process of a divorce because I had, by working at--at that particular time I was in pretty good standing. I was buying a home. I was about twenty-one or twenty-two, was buying my own home. My wife [Mary Adams (ph.)] had completed school; she was a nurse, and I bought a duplex house, so my finances were covered because my tenants were paying the mortgage on the duplex, plus my wife was working, all the furniture and everything, and that's when I felt as though I wasn't happy and I wanted to make a change and that's when I got out of the--divorce. Then I went to Mexico because it's very important to me that I provide for my daughter [Rochelle Adams (ph.)], so I wanted to make sure she was good. So, I did go to Mexico, and arriving in Mexico I had a list of names, a list of people to contact. And I tried, I called somebody and the maid or somebody answer in Spanish. Man, I don't know any (laughter), I didn't know whether they lived down the street or a hundred miles and everybody I talked to, I couldn't communicate. And I happened to meet a fellow standing on the corner, he was trying to--in Mexico, he was trying to make a phone call to the United States and he couldn't speak English and I couldn't speak Spanish, so--and he was a Cuban guy, and he and I became very good friends and his name was Wilfredo Marow [ph.], and he was heavyweight champion of Cuba at one time, and he and I became very good friends.
Story_ID: 623795
Speaker 1: So therefore I, I did get enrolled at school called San Carlos in Mexico City [Academy of San Carlos, Mexico City, Mexico]. And I enrolled in graphics. First I enrolled in the lithography class, which I knew absolutely nothing about.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us what that is.
Speaker 1: Lithography, it's one of the printmaking mediums. Lithography is a very complex process, which is--it's simple but the complexity, by it being so simple most people don't get it. And lithography is based on, the word means litho means stone. Printing is -thography [sic.]. So, it's a matter of litho, that's a particular type of stone, which there's one sitting over--
Speaker 2: Oh, you can't get up, you can't get up.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's, it's a Bavarian limestone, which is very grease sensitivity--and it's polished down like you'd like at a gravestone, a very similar thing. Now the basic principles of this particular type of printing is, the basis is grease and water does not mix. Now you don't have to be a genius to understand that, but like I'm saying here's where it gets so simple. You can take this grease pencil and you've got this stone, which is very sensitive. The stone is like a grease pencil. You can draw on that stone, which is a Bavarian limestone from a place, the best ones come from a place called Kelheim. These stones are very grease sensitive.
Speaker 2: From Kelheim.
Speaker 1: Kelheim.
Speaker 2: Where is that?
Speaker 1: That, that's, that's a place in Germany. That's where the best stones come from, which vary, some stones they are from a gray to a yellow. The yellow is a softer stones. The gray is a harder, which is better stones because they last longer. And these stones were used in commercial printing at one time long before the offset--or mechanical printing came in. They had to do all of these particular, this particular type of printing on these particular stones, which was much easier than the process prior to that, which was engraving, where you cut into the metal and that sort of thing to reproduce stuff to copy. But, lithography made it much easier and by using this method it was much faster. It made writing and literature, books and everything, a lot more accessible because you didn't have to use those hand engraved plates so, and lithography is the fact--is that grease and water does not mix. You've got a very sensitive stone, which is very sensitive to grease. Now you take this grease pencil, like it's a hard marking pencil and you can draw with this all right, and you can't touch a stone with your hand because it's very greasy. The oil from the hands will pick up. Then you take--once you do your drawing, get it on the stone, then you have to put a certain talcum powder, which dries that grease up and then you put a combination of nitric acid and gum arabic, a mixture, it depends on how strong an etch, because the more grease you put in the stronger the etch is to affect it. So, you have to be able to calculate this is a light drawing, it's a little grease, and this is a heavy drawing with a lot of grease. So you have to be aware of how much, how strong you want your acid bite on these various, you know, values of grease, and then you can roll it up and you make a print off of that, which it's easier to show you then to explain it verbally. But that's lithography.
Story_ID: 623796
Speaker 1: Now the other one, the lithography, litho is stone, so you're working with a stone. Then there's metal etching. Etching is when you take a copper or zinc plate and you put a combination that's resin, beeswax, and a little bit of powdered asphalt and then mix it up and it works as ground, so you can put it onto a metal plate covered very smoothly and then take a scriber, like a needle or something, and go in there and do your drawing on that. And when you put that, put that wax base on there, then you can dip it in the acid because that wax base protects it from the acid except to where you removed with a scribe that acid goes into those lines and the acid bites deep, okay. You wipe that, you clean that layer of ground off, and then you can rub ink in there because it's an indentation. The ink goes into those lines that the acid has bitten in there, and then you run it through the press with a piece of paper. You dampen your paper so the paper is very malleable and it's forced into those lines where the grease was. Because see you put your grease in there and then you wipe that plate clean except in those emerged lines and paper is forced down in there and you crank her through the press, then you've got a print. Now that's one, that's the etching. No, no that's engraving. The etching, no the engraving is when you have to take like a little chisel and you've got a piece of copper and you take it and carve your drawing in there, that's engrave. So, it's the same thing, but you're not using acid and I mean those are the basics of etching, lithography, and engraving.
Story_ID: 623797
Speaker 1: So tell me how, once you learn these processes how did that help you in your drawings?
Speaker 2: My drawing, well the reality is, is my drawings I stated--when I left Mexico like that's where I learned. I got into graphics, etching, engraving, and lithography. And once I came back to the United States, I had met a fellow in Mexico who more or less took me under his wings because he, when he was in Detroit [Michigan]--and he was Mexican he, he had a hell of a time getting around--he was working here in a factory because he couldn't speak English. So, when I came to Mexico, I happen to meet him and he was teaching there, this teacher and he could relate to me because he said, "Man, I know how you feel because when I was in Detroit I had a--." So he took me under his wings in Mexico and (unclear), taught me this and gave me keys to the--he was a teacher there [Academy of San Carlos, Mexico City, Mexico], keys to the studio, so when children were on vacation, or students were on vacation, I could go in there and work, and he and I became great friends. Well, he had a lot of these litho stones. And about the '60s [1960s] is when that type of printing--see that used to be the--using the old litho stones was done all the way up until the '40 [1940], because then the mechanical printing came in and they quit using these stones, but these stones, the artists start using these particular type of stones to do artwork on and make prints from. Well, it was a big shortage here, but I happen to meet this guy in Mexico, this one who took me under his arm.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Robredo [ph.], I don't know Robredo, I don't remember--Robredo, I don't remember what his first name was. But anyway he had a whole load of those stones. So when I returned to the states after my doing my stint in Mexico, I was able to start selling--I went to a couple of print shops asked them would they be interested. And everybody all over the United States were mad to get some of these stones. So for about a year I was going to Mexico buying stones, bringing them back, and selling them in the states. And I happened to go into this one place, which was one of the major places in the United States in Los Angeles [California] called Gemini G.E.L. [Gemini G.E.L. LLC], they printed all the top blue chip artists in the United States from Roy Lichtenstein, the guy who did the dots, Frank Stella, Jasper Johns, and I mean all these high rollers. And so I asked them, "You guys wanna buy some stones?" And they said, "Oh hell yes." And then, "Hey, could you--there's a possibility of job?" "Yeah," so he called--one guy in there and his name was Sidney Felsen [Sidney B. Felsen], Jewish fellow. Sid called the master printer in there and immediately they hired me and I started working there at Gemini G.E.L., because at that particular time a couple of their printers, it was during the Vietnam War, a lot of them had shot off and went to Canada trying to beat the war and all that sort of thing and so therefore I started working at Gemini and that's where I--I knew a little bit about printmaking, but from what I learned in Mexico like I'm saying this was real--I, when I got there I found out man you don't know shit, (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 623798
Speaker 1: Before we go on with your work at Gemini G.E.L. [Gemini G.E.L. LLC, Los Angeles, California], let's go back to Mexico because in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Yeah that was prior.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-eight [1968] was the--
Speaker 2: Olympics.
Speaker 1: --Summer Olymp- Summer, Summer Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico]. So talk to me about that and how you were involved and tell me what you remember about that time?
Speaker 2: Okay, it was, when I was in Mexico, like I said, after I was there awhile I was going to school [Academy of San Carlos, Mexico City, Mexico], learning these various printing processes. And I was there for about a couple of years I think. Well, then I ran out of money. Well, at that particular time, when I went there I was in pretty good financial shape because the fact is, like it was good because see in Mexico they try and simulate the states in a lot of ways, so therefore they would be making a Mexican movie, they want it to look American. Well, so they need some blacks in there. But the fact is, is they do not like Cubans in Mexico at that particular time, and the only blacks there were predominantly Cuban. So, I got a job working in a lot of the movies and things, like I could work for, might work fifteen minutes or half an hour, whatever, they call you to stand in there and they'd pay me. In one day, hey man I could pay the rent and have enough money to party on (laughter), so if I worked you know two days a month, hey I'm fine, you know. So, I mean, so therefore I did--so after I ran out of money and so forth, then I'd say well I better start thinking about going back to the states because my child support and all that thing had just about run out then. And so I said at that particular time, everybody--you could get a job in Mexico, if you know how to speak English, they could hire you immediately for the Olympic Committee [Mexican Olympic Committee]--for teaching other Mexicans English because they were expecting a lot of people. So, a good buddy of mine, who he just left here a month ago, one of my closest friends, he had gotten a job there in Mexico as a--teaching English. So, I put on my suit and everything after I ran out of money. Well, I'm gonna go down there and try to get a job. I said, "What the hell am I doing?" I meant--me as far as English and grammar I'm awful. I said, but I'm gonna go over here and try out the Olympic Committee just to see what--I went in there, and I went there and I went in and talked to them, and I was there and guy says, "Well, yeah we definitely can use you. When--can you start this evening?" "Now, just a minute. Hey man, I haven't worked in a couple of years now, you want me to come work? Give me a week or two just to get settled in," you know. So, I got a job there working at the Olympic Committee in '68 [1968] and stayed down there all the way through that. And then after that I took another trip all the way through Mexico again with a couple of lady friends of mine, just hitchhiking most of the ways. And when I came back I came back to the states.
Speaker 1: Did you do any art work for the Olympics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a designer, and signs and everything, pretty much all around.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that experience, I mean how did you--did they give you the design that they needed for that Olympic--well tell me the process.
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of it I started in--because you know some projects two or three people--whatever they figure you're capable of doing, or sometimes they'd put you on something alone, like they need certain signs for directions and that sort of thing or they need an emblem or a symbol or something, so you had to come up with a design and that sort of thing for them or different catalogs, brochures, and that sort of thing. And that's what I was doing because that's where my background in tech illustration [technical illustration] just happen to come in and I figured it much--it made more sense for me doing that than trying to teach somebody English. So, I mean I just thought about well hey that's, you know I would try that and I went down there and was interviewed for about ten minutes and they guy wanted me to start that afternoon. No, no, no, no, let's back off here a little bit you know (laughter), I don't want to get into shock.
Story_ID: 623799
Speaker 1: So, that was the--there was something, or an incident that happened in Mexico before the Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tlatelolco [Tlatelolco massacre].
Speaker 1: Right. Wanna talk to me about that, please.
Speaker 2: Well, I was there and I was working at one of the biggest architects. He'd let us use his home there and--
Speaker 1: Who was, who was this?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the architect's name--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --but he was one of the people he designed the, a couple of big museums and I don't remember what his name, his name was. But anyway, I went there and I was hired and we were, we had to, I had to catch a bus or something to go out to the place every morning to work and, and I don't know, there was some kind of big demonstrations with the students there, and there was one place that we used to go to it's like, they weren't projects but certain area is called Tlatelolco [Mexico City, Mexico], where a lot of artists lives and you know kind of low--high rise apartments and that sort of thing. And I don't know, they had some big demonstration there and that's, and at that particular time I was working at the Olympics [Mexican Olympic Committee], and I was coming home, a lot of people, "Oh, they're after the Americans." Well, I don't know what the hell that they're after or whatever, but there was a big riot going on there, and that's when at this place, they said in that particular place, which I wasn't there, they said actually--and they had a plaza around there [Plaza de las Tres Culturas, Mexico City, Mexico], and the police encircled the plaza and then the helicopters came in and started shooting people and everything else. Yeah, when I was down there and there was a lot of uproar about that.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea of how many people were killed? I mean there's--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --been controversy from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I have no idea. I have no idea. And like I'm saying knowing the way they report news there, it doesn't mean it was very accurate.
Story_ID: 623800
Speaker 1: Did you actually attend the Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico]? Were you by any chance there when Tommie Smith and [HistoryMaker] John Carlos--?
Speaker 2: I was there then. No, I was working [for the Mexican Olympic Committee]. See we were working. Like we, we had tickets to go to anything we want, if we could only get off. When the guys (gesture). Yeah, I was there.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about that when that happened. What did you feel when, when that happened? What, what did you think? What were you thinking? Do you think there would be so much repercussion behind that?
Speaker 2: No, I would not have thought it, and like I'm saying--to that extent. That was in--I do remember when that was going on, but psychologically I don't remember exactly. Like I'm saying, I know I was caught up in the war demonstrations and that sort of thing, and I had the Vietnam War, I don't know whether that was--that was still going on then, but being in Mexico, since Mexico is not involved in the Vietnam War, I never was as close to the movement, the war movement after I left, or the race movement because you see I also was there, I went there shortly after, or it might have been before when they had the Watts riots in Los Angeles [California]. And I think I was in Mexico, but I know they had a big show that I was in after the Watts riot, called the black arts festival [Watts Summer Festival]. It was in Watts in Los Angeles, which is an area predominately black. I remember they had a big show there, but I think--I do remember being there. I do remember--I don't remember the exact time because I remember when there were lots of demonstrations going on and buildings being burned down. I don't know whether--what year was--I was in Mexico before that or after that, 'cause I know I was in Mexico in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: (Unclear). How did you avoid the draft?
Speaker 2: Well, at that particular time I was married [to Mary Adams (ph.)], so I was automatically exempt.
Story_ID: 623801
Speaker 1: So now, let's go back to 1969 through '73 [1973], and talk to me more about your work at Gemini G.E.L. [Gemini G.E.L. LLC, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Oh that was, it was a wonderful experience for me because I had to learn the very basics in printmaking, but not very, to the extent that they did it at Gemini G.E.L., because I mean most of the artists that were there were a lot of New York [New York] blue chip artists. And there's a lot of various positive things that happened there, experienced. I met a lot of wonderful friends that we're still in contact today on a monthly or weekly basis, a lot of the guys I worked with then. They worked the hell out of you, because I mean I remember one instance, for instance we were working with, shortly after they did the moon walk on the moon, we were working with Bob Rauschenberg [Robert Rauschenberg], and they had this project that they were gonna do a series of the moon thing ['Stoned Moon,' Robert Rauschenberg]. He was invited to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] to witness this, and so I don't know, they were gonna do this big sweep or something of his regarding the Americans landing on the moon. Now the fact is, is by us making prints, the more images he would turn out, the more money they would make. So, it was one of those things, we would go in there, work started at eight o'clock, you got off for lunch at ten, and about four o'clock in the afternoon the boss would come by and say, "What do you guys want for dinner?" That means you're gonna be there to do some overtime. Okay about eight o'clock he'd come by and ask you how you like your bacon and eggs. (Laughter) You know you're gonna be there to sunrise. And then you get up, "Now you guys go home, be back in about three hours or four hours and come back to work." And that went on for about a couple of--two or three weeks. But, from this, the advantage of working there, all the work that we worked on we would get one of the printer's proofs, and a lot of people are, like I saw a lot of guys are still living off--some of those prints are worth thousands and thousands of dollars. But, when I moved to New Mexico I sold most of mine; I wish I hadn't. And you know I mean everything from Andy Warhol to just, I mean all of these big names. And you know I had all that stuff under my bed, you know, because we would get one of everything. And they treated us, I mean if you had a hurt hand or something, they would send you to the top doctors in Beverly Hills [California]. And then when they, they actually--one of the highlights, they decided that they were gonna have it showed, the Museum of Modern Art in New York. And they said, "What we're gonna do is fly the whole shop there, the janitors and all. The only thing we request is you guys have a good time." So that was one of those experiences where, I mean I got an opportunity to meet all kind of movie stars, celebrities, and everything. And working in there, I mean there were all these people like coming in there, and one of the guys used to hang out with us, name was Michael Crichton. He was a big star. He wrote 'The Andromeda Strain.' He has done--he's a young guy and he's very wealthy. He's about 6'8" and I heard about a year or two he died, and he wasn't that old a guy either. And he was one of these guys, when he was twenty-one years old he was a doctor and all that. But, he's already from family with money. Anyway, they flew the whole shop there and the only thing they want for you to do is just have a good time and that was about it and they was gonna pay, flew the whole shop there with pay, paid you for a week, you know.
Story_ID: 623802
Speaker 1: Tell me your, your position was master printer there [Gemini G.E.L. LLC, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And as a master printer, what was your specific job (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was just printing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just printing. I mean in reality, it was a position--there's only one master printer in a shop. He's the head person in charge. Now we're all, you know, and I got to be master printer in my own shop, but I mean it calls for a certain--you see more people claim they are master printers, but no, no because the fact is, is that you'd have to know and by operating--you've got to know more than how to do--there are a lot of artists who know how to make prints, but they're not printers. Because I've gotta know how to work with--somebody works in this style, I've gotta know how to do that. I gotta know how to work with that one. It's a collaborator. It's handling other people, resolving problems or, or helping my objective. For instance if an artist comes in there and says, "I wanna make a print like this." I have to look at it and see how this work would transfer in partic- in lithography and tell him--a lot of artists they've had a year or so of print, but they don't, they're not printers. I have to tell them, "Well, you use this medium, use this way to get this effect or that effect in order to create what you want." And by being a master you know how to do most of those techniques.
Story_ID: 623803
Speaker 1: Now Gemini G.E.L. [Gemini G.E.L. LLC, Los Angeles, California] was, like you said known for publishing limited editions and sculptures and you had talk- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And etchings--etchings, lithographs. Just printing, yeah they did some of everything, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Explain what a limited edition is and the printer's proof?
Speaker 2: All right. You see there, there--commercial printing, which is your offset printing done mechanically for advertising and promotion, and the inks and so forth they are using on there are mechanically printed. They are not the quality inks that you would use for fine art printing, because the inks that we use it--it's a higher quality and they stand up. Most of those commercial inks under a certain amount of light they fade, et cetera. And so that's the difference between the commercial--it's not a mechanical thing where you push a button and you just, they just run off. You actually have to add your ink and all of that sort of thing by hand. The object is, is to have that edition of print as consistent as possible, where you can take one print and put it right next to the other and one will look like the other. And if you have fifty prints you spread them all out there, in what they call weaving, you take the darkest one, which are hand printed--so therefore by, it's not mechan- so you've gotta be able to judge by eye how much ink. Every time you pull a print you have to take a knife and put a certain amount of ink on your slab in order to print the other. If you put too much, the print is too dark or it's too light, so you have to know how to do that. Now in commercial printing you see a lot of artists, "Oh, I'm a printer," they take it to the print shop, "I want an edition of five hundred." To me that's not a limited edition, five hundred. And some people get greedy. They'll do three hundred, but generally most of the print that I print, maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty, but you see the prints I print they're not selling for ten dollars or twenty dollars. I do have one commercial print, which I'll give you (unclear), that you know they're poster prints, which is different, which is different, because most of the paper, you know like each one of these paper may cost three dollars a sheet and that sort of thing, and you figure well if you do--I would say I normally don't do, if I do, most of my editions run under a hundred, so that's about maybe sixty, seventy prints in an edition. It might take--depends on how many colors it may take me a month to pull an edition of seventy prints. Whereas if you had a commercial press you hit a button you have that in half an hour, but you don't have the quality of print. That's why I have to charge you what I charge you, you understand. So, that's--and like I'm saying some people make an edition of five hundred. If I get five hundred, I'm gonna make so much money, but it cheapens, it cheapens it. You know a lot of people don't figure the more--well there are some--hey I don't, I don't, I don't have any ten dollar prints and all that sort of thing, you know. And so I mean that's the difference. Most of mine are limited editions and all of them are pulled on qua- high quality handmade paper and so forth, and you know sometimes just drawing--some drawings of mine might take, working on and off it might take me nine months to do one drawing or something like that. And you know because it's a totally different thing.
Story_ID: 623804
Speaker 1: Tell me too, what is the printer's proof?
Speaker 2: A printer's proof is, if you're an artist and you come in and you said, "I want a edition of prints Ron [HistoryMaker Ron Adams]." "How big an edition you want?" "Well, I want seventy-five prints." "Okay, we'll do seventy-five prints." Now in that you're gonna pay me to do seventy-five prints, or either if I'm publishing it, the edition is seventy-five prints. But, as an artist, it's not written in stone, but normally the artist will get 10 percent in artist proofs. That would be ten prints exactly like the edition, but they'll be signed artist's proofs. All right, out of this now you get your seventy prints, plus ten artist's proofs. Now I'm the printer I get, you get ten artist's proofs, I get ten printer's proofs, because if I'm the head honcho here, he's printing it and that person has worked on it, so it's only fair that I give him a printer's proof too. He gets--so therefore he might have, I give one to each of the printers, that's two, and then I might keep, if it's ten, eight. I might sell off a few, or either I could put them in our archives when they give my show--my shop a show I've got these to show or I printed this one, I printed that one as an example or then I might sell some off. Now that's the difference between the printer's proof and artist proof, but they both should be the same and look just like the edition prints.
Speaker 1: And so that's why Gemini G.E.L. [Gemini G.E.L. LLC] was so popular--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was big time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and, and had the topnotch artists, 'cause Andy Warhol was even one of the artists.
Speaker 2: Oh hell yeah, I met all those people.
Speaker 1: Okay. And Gemini G.E.L. was in what city?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 623805
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you leave Gemini G.E.L. [Gemini G.E.L. LLC, Los Angeles, California] you move to San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: I did work up in San Francisco for a short time. While I was, I left Gemini G.E.L. and then in the process of--because they had a layoff there, and I went up to San Francisco and worked for a while at another print shop called Editions Press. But in the meantime, when I was working at Editions Press, what I had thought about was, my wife and I were thinking about--I had been trying to get a job teaching in Mexico, a place called Guanajuato, and they took so long that I was working with an American Indian [Native American] guy up in San Francisco. When I left Gemini, I got a job they wanted me to come up there and work on a print. Now I went up there and I worked on this one print by an artist by the name of Fritz Scholder, a very well known Indian artist, and he was out of New Mexico. So, my lady that I was with, who I'd met in Mexico when I was there on vacation and married, she was also from New Mexico, so I had one of these printer's proofs, that I was gonna go back to New Mexico and sell it since that's where he was from plus she had family there. So, we went back to New Mexico and I looked around and I really liked it, and so therefore we had made our mind up that I was gonna go back to Mexico and get a job working in Guanajuato, but we decided why take the little money that we've saved, why don't we go to Santa Fe [New Mexico] and open up a print shop [Hand Graphics LLC], so that's how that came about.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me your second wife's name.
Speaker 2: Hazel Hatameo [ph.]. She was Hispanic.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you have any children in that relationship?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 623806
Speaker 1: So, you move to Santa Fe [New Mexico] to open up--
Speaker 2: A print shop, yeah.
Speaker 1: --your print shop. What was the name of the, your print shop?
Speaker 2: Hand Graphics [Hand Graphics LLC]. Hand Graphics.
Speaker 1: Now talk to me about that experience.
Speaker 2: Well, when I originally got there I went to San- to Santa Fe to sell that print, that Fritz Scholder print, and I looked around--plus I met her [Adams' second wife, Hazel Hatameo (ph.)] relatives, and we looked around Santa Fe and we decided rather than opening up a business with the money we had saved, we should invest it in opening up a business here because we were gonna do that when we returned from Mexico staying awhile. So, we decided well why wait, let's do it now. So, I went and I had a very difficult time because by her being Hispanic and me being Afro American we were doubly qualified for an SBA [Small Business Administration] loan, but we had, we had money too saved. But, what screwed us up, for some reason they awarded us a grant from the Small Business Admin- but there was something in [U.S.] Congress where it took six months to get the damn grant. But, in the meantime prior to having them giving you a grant, you have to have your building facilities and all that sort of thing before you get the grant. Well you've got to understand, I had to pay six months' rent while they're hung up in Congress and that really bit into my money. So, but we did get it open. We did get it open. So, we went there and when I initially got there--and you see one of the things about Santa Fe is in the whole State of New Mexico you've only got a 2 percent Afro American population in all the state and by me going there and saying, meeting the artists and trying--in the community that I was gonna open up a print shop there, and of course you know and those mother fuckers, pardon me, made me so angry that I swore I gonna show them, if it kills me I'm gonna show them. So, I more or less went underground 'til I really got my act together and like I'm saying the SBA had us hung up, plus I had to drive all the way--in order to get the money from them I had to go back to get my equipment, all that machinery and litho stones and drive them all the way to Santa Fe. So, we did get it going and I had the shop there for about seventeen years and there it was--you know and Santa Fe is one of the places--as I don't know about Hispanics, but as far as any, and within Santa Fe I never really sensed any kind of racial discrimination at all. Like I'm saying as a matter, like people don't like each other, and I mean I'm sure I got a lot of people don't--but that had nothing to do with race, like a couple of those people. You know I just (makes sound), they made me so angry at first that I determined to open up a shop, but then they eventually came on in and worked with me. But as far as you know--and from there like I'm saying I, I was everything from an art commissioner to, I've done, been to everything, advisory board. I was judges at, for instance one of the largest shows they have in the United States called the Western States Federation [Western States Arts Federation] where they had every sh- from Alaska, Hawaii, California, Arizona, all of those. It took us three days. I was a judge. They had three of us there, and I was a judge for that, plus I was a judge for a lot of the other local Indian markets. I was a judge in this, in some of everything. I held quite a few. But then, hey man I gotta make some money. I don't have time for all these meetings and things like that. You know it gets to be old after a while.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you the, the people when you first were trying to open the shop and they made you angry, did they just not think that you would be successful at being a printer there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, because there were a coup--
Speaker 1: Well why not?
Speaker 2: There were a couple of other guys who attempted to open up a shop. But like I'm saying they did not have the background that I had, and they figured because they couldn't do it, they laughed at me because I was gonna try and do it. And I know, Eli Levin and Don Fabricant they, they tried to open up a couple of little print shops and it didn't succeed, you know. And I was there and like I'm saying I had, number one I had, and at that particular time a lot of Native American art was hot and I had a monopoly on them Native, Native American and Hispanic. So, I, I had it going on.
Speaker 1: That print that you were trying to sell, well you eventually did sell it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean how much did something like that go for?
Speaker 2: Ah, maybe about twelve hundred bucks [dollars] in those days and somewhere.
Speaker 1: That is a lot of money back then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and so this, so you open the, the shop in 1974?
Speaker 2: Possibly yeah.
Story_ID: 623807
Speaker 1: Now, you were there [Hand Graphics LLC, Santa Fe, New Mexico] for seventeen years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know there's gotta be some stories about some of the artists that you worked with or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --or some of the pieces that you know are worth a lot of money or something. Tell me what, tell me, give me a story.
Speaker 2: Well, I think one to me it was--I felt very good about the fact that Charles White [Charles Wilbert White] had sought me out to do a print for him during the bicentennial of the U.S., and it's, it's a matter of he and his dealer, Ben Horowitz [Benjamin Horowitz], flew out to Los- to Santa Fe [New Mexico] for me to do this particular print with Charles White, because he was going to be in a nationally traveling show and he was the only--it was an Afro American show, he was the only living artist to be in there. So, he says, "Well, if it's an all Afro American show I will get it--." And Los Angeles County Museum [Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California] wanted to do a print to help pay for this, so he decided if it's gonna be an all Afro American show, I'm gonna get an Afro American printer to print it. Okay, well he flew out to New Mexico and for some reason--Bob Blackburn [Robert Blackburn] is much more well known than I am. But, why he came there rather than New York [New York] I don't know. Bob Blackburn didn't have the set up that I had because Bob Blackburn's studio [Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop] was for, more or less it's a learning place and that sort of thing and mine was set up on much more professional level than--so they flew out there and, in order for Charlie to do the print with me. And the fact is the first time I had ever won any competition, Charles White happened to be the judge out of the first competition I ever won a piece in, and I had known him in Los Angeles [California] before he had came to New Mexico. So, he and his dealer, Ben Horowitz, flew out there and by Santa Fe being seven thousand feet, and Charles White only had one lung, it is very difficult for him to breathe there. So, we had to postpone that, but I always had wanted to work with Charlie. And so about a year or two later, I decided I would do something with him and, but he could not come to Santa Fe. So, what I decided to do was one of those big litho stones--you see where that television is sitting there, that's, on that flat stone that's a big stone, about the size of that table. I took and drove the stone out to his house from New Mexico to Los Angeles, Pasadena [California], where he was living and set it up in his studio. And then I left my truck there and flew back to New Mexico, and a couple of months later he called me to tell me he had completed the drawing on the stone, then I drove back to California, and another friend of mine was working for an artist that I also had worked with, Sam Francis, a pretty well know artist. He had a printmaking studio out in Santa Monica [The Litho Shop, Inc., Santa Monica, California]. So, I proofed the print up just to see what it looks like in front of Charlie, hey here's what we got, here's the corrections or whatever you have to make, so we can discuss it while he was there--visually. So, he approved it and then I drove the stone all the way back to New Mexico and that's where we printed the edition of that particular stone. And then he and I continued to work together, and he had gotten ill at that particular time, so I was taking him some little etching, some plates and he says to me, "Ron [HistoryMaker Ron Adams], look if you can't--," because it's my own business, he said, "well, if you can't afford to publish these you don't have to, you know." I said, "No, hell no, as long as you feel like drawing, hey I'm, I'm your man, you know you do all you want." So, those were, he was, he did four of these little plates and he called me, because I was sending them back and forth through the mail these small etching plates, and he says he made the corrections and he called me and told me, "Ron, I'm sending these plates back next week." I said, "Okay," and I waited two or three weeks, and I didn't receive them and his wife [Frances Barrett White] called me and said, "Charlie passed this week." So, I never saw, took about a year to hand those up, you know before I got the prints and printed those. Those were his last etchings and engravings, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you know the, remember the name of the piece, the first piece that you did? Was there a name for the, the, the print?
Speaker 2: Charles White?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Sounds of Silence' [sic. 'Sound of Silence']. It was a lithograph. It's on that, over there, the cover is on that book over there if you wanna see that, 'Sounds of Silence.'
Story_ID: 623808
Speaker 1: Now, when you say publish rather than print, what does that mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Publish means that I'm backing it financially, that's the publisher's end. And I'm also besides being the printer, I'm putting up, I'm financing the thing; that means publishing.
Speaker 1: So do you actually draw up a contract with the, the artist you get a certain amount of money--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah we agreed to do so many prints and we work out, well you get so many or, or however we want to arrange it, you know through the paperwork to keep everything legal, you know.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Or he, sometimes I mean I will sell the prints or sometime the artist will sell it or the gallery will sell, and I get a certain percentage, the artist gets a certain percentage, or either I will do it--you go that way and I'll go that way and I'll sell mine, you sell yours.
Story_ID: 623809
Speaker 1: Okay, so moving on to 1981 you, because you--you said you were looking for a job to be, to teach at a school, so did you get that opportunity then at University of Texas in El Paso [University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas]? Did you work as a printmaking instructor?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, but I have gone, worked at several schools and been invited to do--
Speaker 1: Okay. You wanna talk about any of those times or that you, I mean did you teach or just lecture?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: Any time after that.
Speaker 2: No, I, I have been invited as a guest teacher or lecturer in different schools. One was in Nashville [Tennessee]. I don't remember the name of that, several different--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --universities and things I worked as a guest instructor or something like that.
Story_ID: 623810
Speaker 1: So you sell your shop [Hand Graphics LLC, Santa Fe, New Mexico] after seventeen years--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and where do you go to live then?
Speaker 2: I had, I was married for the third time, and my wife had a gallery [LewAllen Galleries] and a beautiful home and that was in Santa Fe [New Mexico].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you divorced from your second wife [Hazel Hatameo (ph.)] and met your third wife in Santa Fe?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your third wife's name?
Speaker 2: Arlene [Arlene LewAllen], A-R-L-E-N-E.
Speaker 1: And you said she had an art gallery. Is that were you met her?
Speaker 2: No, before that she was working with a gallery--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and I just happen to meet her, and her husband I knew him too before they were divorced and he was a jeweler and I did some work for him. But, you know I had met her--well when somebody says they're married it doesn't even register with you, you know you don't look at that, and as a matter of a couple of years I found out--I'd go by and visit her, she started working at a gallery and I'd go by and just sit around and chat, and finally someone says, "Oh, she's getting a divorce. And I saw her with somebody else." "Really?" Well I found out she was available and we had, went to lunch and I just told her, "This other guy got to go" (laughter), just and she says, "Okay," so you couldn't ask for anything better than that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You got to go.
Story_ID: 623811
Speaker 1: So, where did you move from Santa Fe [New Mexico]? Is this--did you, I'm talking about 1989, are you an artist in residence in Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I was there for about a year or so at Hampton, which was a very enjoyable stay. It was very, very wonderful. I mean they paid me a monthly salary, and I was able to go and come. If I said I wanted to go home for a week or something, because it wasn't any, and I wasn't gonna fool with any of the students and that sort of thing, so I'd go home and stay a week or something and come back, or either my wife [Arlene LewAllen] would come there and stay a week.
Speaker 1: What was the purpose of you being there? What, what does it mean to be an artist in residence? What did, what was your purpose?
Speaker 2: Well, my friend John Biggers [John T. Biggers] happened to be there, and he was very good friends with [HistoryMaker] William Harvey who was the president of Hampton University, and John was a very well known artist, John Biggers, and he recommended me and so I was a guest of the president and they pro- and I was just there to inspire the students. So I was had my own, they paid me very good salary as much as I'd be making as a teacher and all I had to do was do my own work. Sometimes, I mean, I'd go out and help the teachers out or they'd say, "Hey man, I wanna take off for a few days or something will you teach my class?" And it was pretty--I was, I had the run, I didn't have to answer to anybody and you know it was good for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you were there you said for about a year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you wanna talk about any of your other experiences in some of these workshops like the Memphis College of Art [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: I, I, I've done most of those, but I didn't find as much--exciting or worthwhile, I mean working with the students--I, I think I'm a pretty fair teacher I think and I, I, I work well with people I think and, but I, I don't know and something like I'm saying was--I think perhaps the best part to my life was living in Mexico and New Mexico and that way it had--I had such a broad variety of friends for instance in New Mexico, Hispanics, Native Americans, Anglos [Anglo-Saxon], and that sort of thing, just a very multicultural thing and I never felt like, I never felt out of place there by being black, you know. And it wasn't, didn't seem to be an issue or I wasn't conscious of it, you know, not making a point, I mean hey I was, I am what I am so what you know. So, it, it, it was pretty much, I, I pre- and, and not only that Santa Fe is a place where they don't care what you do there, they just want to know about it. Because see Santa Fe originally started from--most of very well off people from the East used to send their relatives out there that they wanted to hide or the people might have been a little outside of the norm, so they'd send them to Taos [New Mexico] and Santa Fe and a lot of them had money. So, therefore, it, it got to be quite a place of very wealthy people, but most of them were kind of neurotic or more accepting. There was a lot of writers and everything that went there. They're much more accepting there, you know, and--New Mexico see so you had a whole rash of you know creative weirdoes and everything else there, and I mean it's pretty much accepted.
Speaker 1: Do you--I was gonna say did you consider yourself one of those people that's why you fit in there (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No (laughter), no, no. It's those other people that's crazy.
Speaker 1: Now you, you sold your print shop [Hand Graphics LLC, Santa Fe, New Mexico] so that you could spend more time on producing your own work is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, that's what I was alluding to the different, the artist in residence. Did that give you time to work on some of your own art work?
Speaker 2: Well, when you're doing that artist in residence at Hampton yes, but a lot of places I was there, I'd go there and stay two or three weeks like in Memphis [Tennessee] or something. And not really, I mean I got the lay of the city out, but I'm mean you're staying at a place and it takes a while to set up an environment that you're comfortable working in, and so no, and, you know.
Story_ID: 623812
Speaker 1: So what pieces, and, and tell me about, you talked about your first art exhibit, tell me about any exhibits after that and once you closed the shop [Hand Graphics LLC, Santa Fe, New Mexico] and could spend more time did you have more exhibits? And you said that, did your wife [Arlene LewAllen] own a gallery [LewAllen Galleries, Santa Fe, New Mexico] or did--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So tell me about that whole experience.
Speaker 2: She started out working, my wife started out working as a gallery--and she was a jeweler, and she was somewhat of a little artist herself. But, she was one of these people, very people oriented. She is--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --one of these people that immediately people, most people liked, even women liked her and I mean for a PR [public relations] person--and she's one of these really extremely high energy kind of people. I mean she would wake up at six [o'clock] in the morning bouncing off the walls, you know I mean just high energy. She'd go out and run a mile and everything and like I'm saying Santa Fe [New Mexico] got snowed in, when I get up in the morning--well I bring, my job is to bring wood in at night and she'd build a fire so when I got up it's warm in there (laughter) you know. So, but anyway that, that was--
Speaker 1: Did you have an art exhibit, I mean, did, did you exhibit your art in her gallery?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when was--you talk about a first competition, but tell me about your first or any of your exhibits.
Speaker 2: You know one of the things, you know sometime I reflected on believe it or not most of my--you can see at the amount of books and the exposure that I've had--but I've never had a relative attend any openings of mine. My daughter [Rochelle Adams (ph.)] once and that was about a year ago. And my sisters [Edmona Adams, Sandra Adams and Betty Adams], nobody has ever seen any shows and the ones who have seen my art they don't like it. So, I mean, so I mean that's kind of bothering me. You figure hey--my daughter was out here about two weeks ago and I wanted to show her where all my stuff was and my books, all the different, all my papers. I look at it and most of them it, it's something I've spent my life, but hey that's me. It's not their trip. They don't understand, so what. You know it doesn't mean anything to them, you know, and I mean you feel as though, hey here's something I've achieved or I reached this particular point and your family doesn't even--you know and like I said even my sister I gave her a big huge Charles White [Charles Wilbert White] print--it's in the basement, never even hung it. You know I mean it's no--
Story_ID: 623813
Speaker 1: Well tell me about some of, even though they didn't attend, when did you have some of your exhibits? I know some of your work was included with the 'Harmon and Harriet Kelley Collection' ['Harmon and Harriet Kelley Collection of African American Art: Works on Paper'] is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I mean tell me about where your art is. Where is it today?
Speaker 2: I'm, I would say I'm possibly in at least thirty some museums. I've got work in the Smithsonian [Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of that piece? Do you remember which piece it is that's in the Smithsonian (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah Bob Blackburn piece. It's called 'Blackburn' [Ron Adams] and I've got also--
Speaker 1: And these are pieces that you printed or, or that you drew--
Speaker 2: Those are my pieces.
Speaker 1: Well, why is it called, why did you say it's a--
Speaker 2: Bob Blackburn.
Speaker 1: --Burn?
Speaker 2: Because see--I don't if you know who Bob Blackburn [Robert Blackburn] was.
Speaker 1: Tell me who he is.
Speaker 2: He is, started out in about the, I guess, in the late '40s [1940s], lithography. He's a very well known lithography. Lithography, that method of printing went out back in the '30s [1930s] and that sort of thing and people were no longer doing it. But, he became involved with a woman named Tanya Grosman [sic. Tatyana Grosman] who started a shop in New York [New York] called Universal Limited [Universal Limited Art Editions], and she was working with a bunch of major artists at that particular time back in the '30s [1930s]--I mean '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], and Bob was one of the major people that did a lot of printmaking. So, he quit and he opened up his own shop in New York [Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop], and it was, like I'm saying, it wasn't quite a professional shop, but it was for people who came in were interested and from all over. He's a very well known person all over New York, Europe and everything else. And he had this little old shop and people would come in. If you had any money, come on in, welcome to work. If you did have money, and he was a very generous person and he's one of these people everybody loved. And by him being actually--there's a lot of people say they're master printers or whatever, but at that particular time he and myself were only the recognized, because we had the background that we're--and so therefore I decided I would, he was gonna have a show and we're gonna have a dual show since both of us are master printers at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia]. While we're preparing for this show, I was gonna do a piece of Bob Blackburn. At that particular time, he became very ill, so he wasn't able to do the show, so I ended up making the print and then it laid around for a year or so before I ever got it printed, because I had sold my shop [Hand Graphics LLC, Santa Fe, New Mexico] and another person was gonna print it for me and he had moved to Texas and then he moved the shop back to Kansas City [Missouri], but he eventually did it and that's where the Bob Blackburn, like I'm saying Bob Blackburn is very well known man, very well known man.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that piece is at the Smithsonian (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Smithsonian as well as the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] and about twenty-five or thirty other museums.
Story_ID: 623814
Speaker 1: And what other pieces are out in museums?
Speaker 2: 'Profile in Blue' [Ron Adams].
Speaker 1: And tell me about that.
Speaker 2: That was--'Profile in Blue' was a print that--like I'm saying, when I left Mexico and got a job at Gemini G.E.L. [Gemini G.E.L. LLC, Los Angeles, California] and learned printmaking, at that particular time, printmaking it's like construction work. And I mean when you get through working at a shop, if you're doing your job that's the last thing you gonna do is mess with some art when you get home. So, the fact is, is, is when I opened my own shop [Hand Graphics LLC, Santa Fe, New Mexico] I was totally dedicated to that and I put my own work away. For seventeen years I didn't do any of my own stuff. I was working with other artists and that sort of thing. And finally when I was visiting a friend of mine one day for dinner and we're over there and I just start sketching on the table on a napkin or something; that looks interesting. I says, I think I'll do a print of that, and that was the first piece I did in seventeen years. I did that and I, the first time I showed it at the, they had a big show in Santa Fe [New Mexico] at the museum [New Mexico Museum of Art] and it won first prize there, and it's been in about a half a different books. It's actually a portrait of me sitting on the press. You might have seen it, and from there like I'm saying Smithsonian [Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.], Library--the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] doesn't have that one, but Smithsonian and it's quite a few, and it's in all those, see all of those books and things and I sit them all there. It's in most of those books and things that I've been published in, and it's a very well known print.
Story_ID: 623815
Speaker 1: So tell me what have you, well what do you want to do now that you have not done?
Speaker 2: You know that's, it may sound crass, but I wanna make some money. Now, that is the bottom line. Now, I mean like I said, I'm in over twenty-five to thirty museums and everything. What else is next? I'm in books. Where do you go from there? So, like I'm saying I need some money. That's the bottom line. I mean all that, "Oh, you sure are wonderful, that's beautiful," that's fine, but that doesn't pay the rent and, but like I said I have, you know and it's, it's you know like I don't get along very well at the High Museum [High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia] here at all. I'm, I've kind of made up with them, but I don't care whether or not I'm in the High or anything. The, the High doesn't mean a damn thing in comparison to the other places that I'm in, you know. It's not gonna make me or break me whether or not I'm in the High Museum, but I did, I had a little problem with them at one time, which I've resolved.
Speaker 1: I mean did it have to do with them having your work there?
Speaker 2: It went there when I was living in New Mexico. I went there and I was gonna leave some of my work there. I also had some other things, some John Biggers [John T. Biggers], some Charles Whites [Charles Wilbert White], and I wanted to see--and the way they treated me like I'm saying I've, like I'm saying when I do things I try and do them in a very professional manner. I wrote them a letter saying, "Hey, I'm coming to Atlanta [Georgia], here's what I've got to show you," and this sort of thing. And I sent it to the main curator. They wrote me back when I said I'd be in Atlanta, and I said I was coming to this black arts festival [National Black Arts Festival] and I was gonna be there a week. And so I had agreed to--I called the person up and says, "Hey, I'm in town." "Well, she's not here, her assistant is here." "Okay, well let me speak to this--." I said I had some work and I wanted to bring it by. Okay, so I talked to someone and they say, "Okay, bring it in, leave it at the gu- with the guard at the door." I don't know, I've never had that before, but maybe that's how they do things here in Georgia. And I go there and I said well--because I also, that was my first piece that I was taking to the Smithsonian [Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.] to deliver. I says, "I would like to pick the work up because I have to deliver something to the Smithsonian," and so I explained it to them. And they said, "Well, leave it at the guard." So I go back after a week of being at the Black Arts Festival, called them up and the lady read me the riot act. "You left this stuff here. You didn't tell us where to ship it back," blah, blah, blah. And they had already shipped my stuff back, and I go to the Smithsonian, they don't tell me leave it with the guard at the door and all that sort of thing. You know and I just figured you know hey, and like I'm saying I've never been treated like that in all my life, and as a matter of fact last time I'm--I'm okay with the High now because I let them have it, and I met a lady by the name of Carol Thompson, very nice, and I explained to her you know and she was very apologetic. She introduced me to the director of the museum there at the High Museum, and I mean he wasn't even there then. But the, actually one of the other guys who was before this new director I happ- they happened to be having a big affair in Santa Fe [New Mexico], and like in Santa Fe they had all these museum directors from all over the country, and a friend of mine was there. His name is Donald Meyer, and he had became friends of mine because he selected me--because they had what's called the Western States Art Foundation [sic.] where I was a judge for the Western States Art, Art Federation [Western States Arts Federation] where they had everybody from Alaska, Hawaii--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --all of those states I was a judge for that. So, they had all these museum director--and I happen to run across this mother from the High, and I let him have it with both barrels. And within a month he wrote me back a letter of apology. I lost that letter. And he was very apologetic, but then I met this lady there and she's very nice to me and I, I forgive them.

Speaker 1: When did you move to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Probably about six years ago.
Speaker 1: From Santa Fe [New Mexico]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What made you move here?
Speaker 2: See in all the printmaking, working most of my life with my head down I became, developed calcium deposits on my neck, and I had to get an operation or they could not go in there and hone this, inside the spinal cord, but they had to go through a couple of nerves to take the pressure off and they went through some nerves and it left me gimpy. So, in cold weather I have to limp like hell. So, I figured ooh, maybe--Atlanta is close to Florida it ought to be warm, but I was surprised (laughter). It's colder than hell here, so that's why I came to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Well, so the National Black Arts Festival was begun here back in the '80s [1980s] and are you involved in that at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay. What do you plan, what are your plans now besides making money (laughter)? Is that your only plan? What would, what would you like to do that you have not done?
Speaker 2: Well, I wish I could travel more, but I can't very well because I like to go to places that, to different countries and everything and it calls for a lot of walking really to get involved with people and see the place. I don't like going as a tourist.
Story_ID: 623817
Speaker 1: So, you would like to travel, but the walking--
Speaker 2: The walking and you know I don't like taking the tourist routes. Like I said I've traveled all over Central America and that sort of thing, and I go where the people are and find out what's going--what the average person. I don't wanna go and stay in The Ritz Carlton and all that, that's not my kind of thing. And number one, like I'm saying there's a lot of walking and that sort of thing and possibly it might be an occasion I have to run too (laughter).
Speaker 1: What about fishing I, I notice all your fishing rods, is that still a pastime of yours?
Speaker 2: No, it is but I've got a, I've got a boat, one of the maintenance guys has here and all that, but I've got a balance problem now and I've got one guy, he's a big strong guy, he generally--I go out with, but he's one of these people, he's got a problem, he talks too much. And he's one of these people when he get, he, he starts here and starts talking, we'll drive an hour and a half to get to Coney [Georgia]; he doesn't stop. You get on the boat, (gesture) all the way back and pretty soon shut the hell up. I mean and, and it's--he's not conscious of it.
Story_ID: 623818
Speaker 1: Tell me, well we wanted to say that your wife [Arlene LewAllen] passed away is that right, the, the third wife?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what year did she pass away?
Speaker 2: I guess it's been--2002.
Speaker 1: Okay, so besides you know, maybe want to travel, are you working on any pieces now that will be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah I'm working on.
Speaker 1: When will they be available and will they be exhibited?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you see one of the things I find about, let's talk about Atlanta [Georgia], I think this is a dead zone as far as I'm concerned. There's a bunch of pseudointellectuals here, but not, not, there are no real collectors here. There was one guy, [HistoryMaker] Paul Jones, who was a major collector, big collector, and I'm sorry I never did invite him because he had a very bad, as far as I'm concerned--he is one of these people that he will, you say, "How much you want for this?" "You give me--." And whatever it is it's too much, and he will sit there six or seven hours just trying to drive--and I don't play those games and most artists do. Well, now I'm gonna ask for fifty dollars this, and she's gonna say thirty and I'm gonna say--no here's what I want. I'm gonna ask you a fair price, we're not gonna go through that song and dance, and a lot of people that's part of the game, but I don't do that. I'm gonna ask you take or leave it. You want it or find something else. But, Paul had a notorious repetition for that, and he recently passed and I'm sorry, I would have rather given him the print because he's been a good drinking buddy probably. But, and then there was Herbert Charles who's another guy who was a major collector around here. I did sell him. And then there's another lady, Brenda Thompson, who has been very supportive here. Her husband [Larry Thompson] is a big deal for Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] and all that sort of thing you know. So, they've got it. Yeah, but otherwise there are no real galleries here. There's none and I just--there's one I heard on--announced on it today, he was on there, Bob Lowe [sic. Bill Lowe]. He's here in--did you see on television he's busted. Well see, I could have told you about him ten years ago because a lot of the artists in Santa Fe [New Mexico], they have problem, ship their work here, and they couldn't get the money from him and I told them you know he had a bad rap on him.
Story_ID: 623819
Speaker 1: Mr. Adams [HistoryMaker Ron Adams], what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, I want on my gravestone, "He meant well" (laughter), that's about all I can say. I don't know what else, you know I mean like I said I try and do the best I can, I try and be fair, and you know I always try and do the right thing. Quite often, you know I guess that I meant well, but I don't know what--
Story_ID: 623820
Speaker 1: Well, because you will have students watching this interview, and you know actually being able to hear that you made a very good life even after coming out of, you know, some adversity as a child and your family you know being, well most of us have--
Speaker 2: Disruptive, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) dys- dysfunctional families, but what advice would you give to the future generations? Just what would you tell someone watching this that's maybe getting ready to graduate from high school or a junior high school student that needs some inspiration, even if it has to do with art, it doesn't have to do with art, but an art student or someone who feels that they have talent? What, what would you, what your words be to them?
Speaker 2: Let's talk about, there's so many people--like I'm saying I did not finish any of my art--I've been to art school, but I didn't get a degree and I don't think that, and I know quite a few of my favorite artists taught, but they didn't have a degree. And I, I think that this is a problem, many artists that go to school and want to be an artist, they want to also go into teaching, and to me I think teaching is not always--if you want to be an artist that that is best. And they said, you know people who can't teach and the people do--are artists. And I think the fact is they get so comfortable in a role of a teacher and that security seems to maybe have, blocks a lot of creativity. I'm not saying all, because I know a lot of very fine artists that are teachers, but then I know a lot of artists who are lousy teachers and lousy artists on top of it. And like I'm, I'm saying it--I know a couple of artists, I think they're very good and I almost would like to see them not so hung up on--it's nice to have that security; I wish I had it. But it seems to mitigate your passion. Maybe that's all in my head, I don't know, you know because I mean they're too secure. They're too secure, and I don't know if that's--because I think artists have so many myths to live up to, you know, I mean if you wanna be raised to be a starving artist, I'm very successful (laughter) you see, I mean. You know, I mean that people--but, but, that, that's bull. Hey, I'd like to be able to, to, to send my kid to school or college or take my lady out to dinner and that sort of thing, and well you know or, or walking around raggedy and that sort of thing. "Oh, oh you're an artist," so therefore you know generally the artists are the last person--people at this particular day and age, "Well, he's an artist," you know I mean--well, okay, "If his water is cut off--," but you know somebody else's--I mean they seem to look at us like, I mean we're supposed to be that way and it's the norm, but hey, no man I like steak and lobster like everybody else, you know. And I like to be able to provide for my siblings [Edmona Adams, Sandra Adams and Betty Adams], you know. And you know and I, I like having a little attitude money, 'cause if you don't have money you can't afford an attitude, so I mean you're coming from, you know and like I'm saying I'd have to--I've got a little bit of savings, but I'm gonna have to do something soon. But yet and still it's always great to have your own freedom to be able to choose. I think that's a very important thing, I choose to or I choose not to and to me that's very important, you know. That's why I say keep a little attitude money, 'cause if you don't have no money you can't afford an attitude.
Story_ID: 623821
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we did not talk about that you'd like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know, like I said I think between my life, I think the best part of my life was in living in Mexico and then in New Mexico. So Mexico, like I said, I did a lot of traveling. I had an opportunity to travel and mostly hitchhiking through all of Central America.
Speaker 1: Hitchhiking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I learned a lot about the culture, a lot about the people, and like I'm saying, it always pays to be able to get out of dodge in a hurry because you know I've run out of towns there and everything else and you know, like I said I feel as though I've had a wonderful life. And like you ask me what else do you want, you know? Like hey I, I just wanna be secure. I mean, I, I've had what museum, I'm, I'm in the Smithsonian [Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.], the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] now, what else, wh- what's up there. What, what, what more. I'm in twenty-five or thirty museums now. I'm broke, you know, and it's just like I'm saying, having that attitude money. And I, I don't know, like I'm saying I wish I could say, "Boy, if I could get in here, do this or get that." I've done that and been there, you know, and like [HistoryMaker] B. B. King says, "The thrill is gone." You know I, I've done all that now, you know. Unless you can think of something, what should I want to do or tell me what, you know, you know. Like I've said, I've had some wonderful people in my life, ladies, like I'm saying, wonderful ladies and that sort of thing. It didn't work, but I can't say anything bad.
Speaker 1: Well if that's all, I have to thank you for taking the time to share your story and we really appreciate it.
Speaker 2: Okay, then well I, I hope to be able to see you some time (laughter). I don't know I, I hope it made sense what all I was saying or people will find it interesting. I'm sure when you go, I'll think of a lot or I should have said this.
Story_ID: 623822
Speaker 1: Oh that was taken at Elephant Butte, New Mexico, it's down near Truth or Consequences [New Mexico]. And as you can see by looking around that I enjoyed doing a lot of fishing, and that was a joke one of my in-laws played, that's why it's got that little bitty fish on there.
Speaker 2: That happens to be a picture of mine, taken of one of my paintings. It's not my most famous painting, but anyway it was there in the archives I guess. That's one of the few paintings I think I've done.
Speaker 1: With color (laughter).
Speaker 2: With color.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That was me working at Gemini [Gemini G.E.L. LLC, Los Angeles, California] when I had hair. I was working on a Josef Albers print with the other printer by the name of George Page. We're making some embossed prints for Josef Albers, very well known artist.
Speaker 1: There, there I was working with one of the America's top artist by the name of Jasper Johns. I don't know what I was doing there. It might have been just a stage setting.
Speaker 2: And that, that's my little grandson. His name is Takis [Takis Thayer]. We call him Teek [ph.] and he used to, he's my wife's daughter's son, and he and I used to have a lot of fun and I've known him ever since he was a good idea, and he's one of the ones I used to have to take into, like I say Santa Fe [New Mexico] is only a 2 percent population [of African Americans], I had to take him with me when I go--and I'd go in places like and he'd try--and people was wondering why he calling me grandpa and that sort of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: And that's a picture of Charles Wright [Charles H. Wright] whose--his wife [Roberta Hughes Wright] sent me after he passed.
Speaker 2: That also opens up too, that's--
Speaker 1: Is that your (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My wife's gallery, but the inside--see if you wanna 'cause it's really--yeah.
Speaker 1: That's her gallery there called LewAll- LewAllen contemporary art. Her name was Arlene, Arlene LewAllen. LewAllen Gallery [LewAllen Galleries, Santa Fe, New Mexico].
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my wife and I. I don't care much for the picture.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: What's her name?
Speaker 1: Arlene, A-R-L-E-N-E, Arlene LewAllen.
Speaker 2: And that's my wife and a very well known artist who recently died about a year ago. His name is Robert Colescott, and I'm on one side and Arlene is on the other side and Colescott is in the middle.
Speaker 1: Those are my granddaughters. My daughter is Rochelle [Rochelle Adams (ph.)]. The little girl next to her is Sandia [ph.]. The taller girl is Deshana [ph.] and the smaller one is Lyanna [ph.].
Speaker 2: Those are the pictures of my mother. Now I don't know where they were taken, but my mother is--would be on the left side and in the, her name was Laura [Laura Wordlaw], and the middle one is the older sister, her name was Mageline [sic.] and the other one was Dorothy [ph.], the younger one.
Speaker 1: And there I'm curating, possibly curating a print.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: All right the top, the gentlemen at the top was my father, by the name of Ned Adams [William Adams]. The small photograph with the lady in the shorts was my older sister. Her name was Edmona [Edmona Adams]. The lady underneath of her, is I think it's number five, is my aunt. Her name was Mary Lee Wicker [ph.]. And from there it's my favorite aunt who was more or less like a grandmother since my [paternal] grandmother [Laura Welch Adams] passed when I was little, so my aunt became like a grandmother, her name was Claudia Welch; she's from the Welch side.
Speaker 2: And that's me posing for a picture working on an engraving plate.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That one ['Profile in Blue,' Ron Adams] is in the Smithsonian [Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.] and about twenty something museums. That was the first piece I did after not printing, doing my own work for seventeen years and that was the first one I did when I went back.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's called 'Aunt Hattie' [Ron Adams].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: 'Neptune Washington' [Ron Adams] or either 'Dandelion Wine' [Ron Adams] or 'Neptune Washington.' Which one you like better, whatever.
Speaker 1: 'Dandelion Wine.' I like this one.
Speaker 2: Okay.
