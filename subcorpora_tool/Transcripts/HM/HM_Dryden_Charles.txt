Since then, I have been--I've written a book called 'A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman' [Lieutenant Colonel Charles W. Dryden], which was published in--pardon me, on April 22, 1997, by the University of Alabama Press in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  I have been very busy promoting the book on book signings all over the country for the last seven and a half years.  And in the process of--I have three books in mind.  'Thank God, I'm Not Young Anymore.'  After that will come 'On the Road and in the Air with A-Train,' my first book; and finally, 'I Don't See Me, Where Am I?'  Those four books. Hopefully, I'll have enough life left to write them within the next five years.

And each time the Lord said, 'Feed my sheep.'"  That's my favorite saying.  Feed the children.  Teach the children.  That's my favorite saying.
Story_ID: 226278
Speaker 1: Next, I'd like to explore your family background.  So I'd like to begin by asking if you could tell me about your mother.
Speaker 2: My?
Speaker 1: Your mother.
Speaker 2: Tell you about my mother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: With delight.  Her name was Violet Adina Buckley, born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889.  She was a housewife and mother through her career, and a domestic to help make ends meet during the [Great] Depression.  My dad was a factory laborer.  And but before she came to this country, she was a teacher at a college for women--I can't think of it.  It starts with a W.  Wilma's College [ph.], I think is the name of it--before she came to this country in 1918 before World War I [WWI] ended.  And she lived with her father, my grandfather [Walter George Buckley], in New York City [New York, New York] waiting for my father, who had fallen in love with her when he was teaching at a college right across the street.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Charles Levy Tucker Dryden.  And he went off to war with the Jamaican Expeditionary Force during World War I.  And when the war ended, he came to the [United] States.  They married, and a year later I was born in 1920.  My mother was the most patient, motherly I've ever known.  She was just all the patience.  That could have been her middle name.  She was never angry with anybody; annoyed perhaps, but never angry.  She would never turn anyone away.  She had a good friend who had a sort of a wayward daughter.  And the friend was at her wit's end what to do with this daughter.  She asked if my mother would accept the daughter into her household.  By this time, at this stage, I was about nineteen or twenty.  And I didn't--'cause I had a sister who's thirteen years younger than I, Pauline [Dryden Miles].  And I was afraid that this wayward girl might influence my sister.  My mother, she just ignored that from all members of the family, and raised that girl to be the very epitome of a lady.  That was my mother.  She was an angel.
Story_ID: 226279
Speaker 1: And did she [Dryden's mother, Violet Buckley Dryden] share any stories with you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Did she?
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories?
Speaker 2: Foremost in my mind that she shared in terms of obeying the law, she shared some.  "Don't ever let a policeman bring you home.  It would break my heart."  I never did.  Came close, but I never did, 'cause I knew this would devastate her.  She was such a gentle, loving person.  She taught me be courteous, respectful of everybody, especially--well, my parents [Charles Dryden] had four classes--four principles by which they raised myself, my brother [Denis Dryden] who is six years younger than I--he passed year before last--and my sister.  First of all, obey--acknowledge and obey God; secondly, obey your parents; thirdly, never, ever disgrace this family by your behavior; and finally, get a good education.  And so both of them, mother and father, focused on those four points.  In our upbringing, my peers and I in the neighborhood, probably, we learned very early on that there are four classes of people who must respect; one, all elderly people, all senior citizens, too; all priests and nuns, you can recognize them by their habits; thirdly, all women whatever age, so that, for example, if you're riding in a subway or bus and you're seated and a woman comes in and stands over you, you must get up.  And it was no burden.  Everybody knew that.  And if you didn't get up, it did not take an adult to tell you when you are--well, when you were a junior teenager, thirteen or fourteen, and you were observed doing the wrong thing, a senior teenager, eighteen and nineteen, would tell you--would take you to task and say, "Boy, what's wrong with you?  Don't you have any manners?" and so forth.  So the whole neighborhood really helped to raise each of us.  And--oh, the fourth class of person was disabled, crippled, people on crutches and so forth.  And those were the principles whereby I was raising all of my peers the same way.
Story_ID: 226280
Speaker 1: Where was your father [Charles Dryden] born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Jamaica, in St. Thomas [Parish, Jamaica]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Parish.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe him?  Were there any things about him that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: He was the disciplinarian.  He--very gentle.  He didn't rant and rave.  But what he said, you knew it went.  And there were certain things that he would not permit you to do.  "Never, ever frighten your mother [Violet Buckley Dryden].  Never."  (Unclear).  I remember one time--I don't know if you're for an anecdote to describe that--but when I was about nine or ten, my folks bought a vacuum cleaner.  Everybody used a carpet sweeper.  That was the highest technology.  We had an electrical vacuum cleaner.  Well, I had three aunts--five aunts.  I had five aunts.  And three of them were older than I, and the younger two, their names were, Lily, Daisy, Myrtle, Hyacinth, and Iris; all named after flowers.  Since my mother's name was Violet, she was named a flower also. Well, Lily, Daisy and Myrtle were older.  Hyacinth was a year older than I, and Iris was a year younger than I.  So those two were just like sisters to me.  And we lived--my parents lived about a few blocks, four or five blocks from where my grandfather [Walter George Buckley], grandmother and my aunts lived.  So after Sunday school, we would visit their house, and they'd come visit our house.  So this particular day, Hyacinth visited and saw me using the vacuum cleaner.  "Let me try that."  "Oh, you'd be lost."  So she said, "Auntie Vi, Charlie [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden] won't let me use the vacuum cleaner."  "Son, don't be so selfish.  Let her use it."  I was betrayed.  How could my mother do this to me?  So foolishly, I stormed into the bathroom.  I was always melodramatic.  I said, "I'm going to kill myself."  She locked the door. I took a glass and let it hit the floor, shattered and it made a sound.  My mother was frantic.  Now, my father was an elevator operator in an apartment building.  So she went out and she told him--no, she told her father, my grandfather.  He was the superintendent of the building.  So he climbed out of an adjacent room through the window into the bathroom window, opened the door so I could--and my mother was frantic.  Well, she told my father.  This was mid-day.  And he didn't say anything 'cause he still was on duty at the elevator.  But when he came home that night, he didn't say anything to me until I had retired, going to bed.  I thought everything was all right.  I didn't think he'd be worried (unclear).  So he shook me awake.  He said, "Charles, come to my room.  I want to speak to you."  Said, "What happened today?"  And I told him.  He says, "Two things, first, don't you ever, ever threaten to take your life.  And don't you ever frighten your mother like you did today.  You understand?"  And he started to whale a tattoo on my arm right, so much that mother said, "Oh, Rob, don't kill my child" (laughter).  But that's the kind of person he was.  He required and expected obedience, respect for others, and support and expected your love too.  So he was a disciplinarian but with love.  And I remember when I was an infant, he used to--I was the only child at the point, and he used to sing lullabies to me.  And I remember that so clear.  I was an infant, you know.  But he was a man--who everybody loved my father.  His sisters-in-law, my mother's half-sisters, my aunts, used to call--she had a nickname for him, she called him her Robin.  And it became Rob for short, and his sisters called him Brother Rob.  And to everyone she was Sister Vi. So Brother Rob, Sister Vi, those were my parents.  Everybody in the neighborhood loved them.  And so that's--that was my period of upbringing.

Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: My age?
Speaker 1: Your ancestors.
Speaker 2: Oh, not far.  Only to my parents [Violet Buckley Dryden and Charles Dryden] and my grandfather, but, who was my maternal grandfather, my mother's father.  But beyond that, I haven't been able to trace it.  I have a nephew, son of my deceased brother [Denis Dryden], who had prepared one a couple of years ago, but he hasn't been able to go very far back, because, you see, we were first generation of Americans born right here.  I've lived in Jamaica for one point with my former wife for three years.  And I got to meet some of my relatives, cousins and aunts and like that.  But beyond that generation, I have not been able to go very far.
Speaker 1: And your mother's father was Jamaican as well?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Your mother's father was Jamaican?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're all Jamaican.
Speaker 1: Makes sense.  What can you tell us about him?
Speaker 2: About?
Speaker 1: What do you remember about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: He was a dignified old man.  His name was Walter George Buckley.  And he and the husband of one of his wife's sisters--see, they put a lot of faith, you might say, in the British tradition, because Jamaica was a British colony.  So they put a lot of respect and so forth in the British royalty; the king, the queen, the princess and so forth.  So every time there was something happening within the royal family of England, it was just--even more so than in this country when a president is inaugurated, something like that.  Most, to my thinking, most people who were raised in British colonies, the generation before mine and even mine, had a lot of respect for the rulers of the British colony, of the United Kingdom [UK], and so forth.  Their heroes also and so forth were the King, the Queen.  And Prince Edward [VIII] abdicated the throne and married a commoner, Wallis [Simpson], whatever the last name was.  British colonists, the worldwide were disappointed that he would let the tradition of the crown down.  So my grandfather and Uncle Eckbert [ph.], the husband of one of his sisters-in-law, used to pretend to be, one was the prime minister, and the other was, called themselves the British of Canterbury or something like that, and they'd address each other like that, you know.  It was sort of a hero worship from a distance.
Story_ID: 226282
Speaker 1: There were, as I know, up around there were some plantations in Jamaica as there were in a number of the Caribbean islands where there was slavery and so forth.  But to--what I've been able to determine listening to my grandfather and others, it's nothing approaching slavery as it was, I'm sure it's been practiced in this country, this was very unique in that slaves were bred like cattle; women were violated like, I can't think of the word, but they were chattels.  And, as a matter of fact, the British Commonwealth did away with slavery in 1832 [sic. 1833]; abolished it and made it against the law.  And we didn't get to that point until '65 [1865], the Civil War, and still continued and to the [United] States, too, continues in forms of divestures of slavery, the effect on the descendants of the former slaves, to this very day, you know, social institutions and so forth.  So, my family was never part of that.  They didn't experience the torture and the brutality of slavery.  And I'll put it--this is not a joke--but I'll put it this way; if the United States Congress should ever vote for reparations to the descendants of former slaves, I won't get a dime, because none of my forebears were slaves in this country.  But that's the difference.  And so, in this country, it is possible, as now are emerging, through projects like this, that people are able to trace their ancestry.  I have a document over there which is a slave sale that took place in this country.  But I don't have that in my background.  And I have had to learn it sort of secondhand--
Story_ID: 226283
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, on my comment that I--being raised in New York City [New York, New York], I never had a black teacher.  Never, ever.  And as a consequence, when I came south, or before I came south, my knowledge of the horrors that blacks in this country had to go through from the time they were brought against their will from Africa, and all the hard in-betweens, the lynchings and all of that stuff, the separations of families, et cetera, was something that's not in my background.  I had to learn it, when I went south to Tuskegee [Alabama] and became friends with--lots of my friends were raised in Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and so forth--and that's when I really began to find out what slavery was all about.  I never learned it up in New York.  The only heroes that I ever heard about, my being raised in New York, was Jesse Owens, Marian Anderson and Joe Louis.  And those were the only ones I knew.  And I came south, then I learned about the ugly details of people like Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass, and on and on and on.  And it was an education for me.  Now, when I went south, it was an education.
Story_ID: 226284
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Violet Buckley Dryden] tells me that when I was an infant, before I could talk, I used to take bits of paper and throw in the air and try to say airplane, airplane.  I couldn't talk yet. I don't remember doing that, but I do remember, I must have been three or four, that I was interested in airplanes and an aunt of mine, Aunt Daisy gave me a model airplane to put together.  And so from that--at the time, more like, I can remember back that far.  I was about maybe five or six.
Story_ID: 226285
Speaker 1: As far as school was concerned, I didn't go to kindergarten, but I started in first grade.  And the very first grade, all the children are ranked, you know, but the teacher didn't tell anybody.  But the system in New York [New York] was that at each level, first, second, third, on up to sixth grade in elementary school, those who were--well, the classes were, like, 1A 1; 1A 2; 1A 3; 1A 4.  And you're ranked according to your academic standing from the year before.  Well, the first, because (unclear), but from 1B, which is the second part of the first year, I was in 1B 1.  In other words, I was in the one section all the way through.  I was never in any other section.  My report cards were solid A's all the way through.  And I'm not saying that--I don't claim that that's any particular inherent genius of mine.  But I lay it to my upbringing.  And I do remember this: before going to school the first time, my mother [Violet Buckley Dryden] used to teach me two things, math and spelling, English.  Math, she used to take bundles of matches, put it in bundles of ten per bundle, and one bundle, ten, twenty; I learned to spell by tens before I even went to school.  In English and spelling, I learned phonetic spelling long before 'Sesame Street' came along.  I was taught by her and my aunts and others the at--the difference (unclear) at family, the in families; whatever.  So you take A T and put C, you get cat; put a B you got bat, fat, so forth.  So before I started school, I could spell.  And that got me into trouble in school--because we never used any kind of profanity at home--and I heard this four-letter word, which is bad news.  But I could spell it.  And I spelled it on a piece of paper that Monday morning, and the paper fell out of my pocket.  My teacher saw it, said, "I want to see you after school."  I didn't know why she wanted to see me for.  She said, "Is this yours?"  I said "yes" very proudly.  She said, "Come with me."  She took me to the washroom, put some brown soap in my mouth.  "Don't you ever, ever say that word again" (laughter).  So I never told my parents about that for years later.  But my spelling in school got me into a lot of trouble.  So I remember those early years.  When I reached sixth grade, I fell in love, like most school boys have a crush on a teacher.  My sixth grade teacher [at P.S. 46, New York, New York] was a pretty Irish lady.  Her name was Mary Elizabeth Sullivan.  I had the most wild crush on her, because she was a number one teacher in my recollection.  She made me-and I was just maybe one or two black kids in the class, all the rest white kids.  But she made me feel as good as any other student.  And I loved her for that.  She brought out of me all the potential that she saw in me.  She did that with all the children, but I particularly enjoyed it and was pleased by it, because it was she who pushed me to the limits of my ability.  As the [U.S.] Army said, "Be all you can be."  And she just brought that out in me.  So when I went to junior high school [I.S. 164, Edward W. Stitt Junior High School, New York, New York], I went into--well, first of all, the day I graduated from elementary school, sixth grade, I had mixed feelings.  I was glad that I was going on to junior high school, different building and all of that; but I was heartbroken I was not going to see Mrs. Sullivan anymore (laughter), and I was going to lose my sweetheart (laughter).
Story_ID: 226286
Speaker 1: I'd like to finish the thought, 'cause I was developing it when you called a break.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It had to do with education.
Speaker 2: We can continue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I had described how I felt about Ms. [Mary Elizabeth] Sullivan [teacher at P.S. 46, New York, New York].  I went to junior high school [I.S. 164, Edward W. Stitt Junior High School, New York, New York], and because of my academic record in elementary school, I was put in the advanced phase.  They call it rapid advancement.  So that the three years that normally--junior high school it was called, not middle school--I did it in two years.   The first year--I covered the first semester's half year, I covered the first year; the second semester, I covered the second year; and then the third year was just normal.  It was RA, RB; each was a half year.  Then RC--well, yeah, RC and RD was a half year each; a total of three years all together.  Well, so that means that I finished high school [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] a year before my normal progression.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And a year before many of my peers.  That wasn't good.  I wasn't ready for high school really.  It wasn't so much high school, because I got into high school a year before I should have.  I finished high school a year before I should have, so that when I went to college [The City College of New York, New York, New York], it was devastating.  I wasn't mature enough for college.  I look backward with understanding that I was ahead of my time.  I was ahead of my maturation rate.  So that when I entered the college where you had a high curve, a lot of the students were just brilliant students.  And when I was competing, it was almost like a waterloo for me.  I was there three years.  I had a miserable academic record.  I was going in mechanic engineering, and I wasn't quite ready for it; for example, I took differential calculus and I failed it.  I repeated it and got an A.  I took integral calculus, I failed it.  I repeated it and got an A, same thing; so which was imminent that I was a year ahead of myself.  And if I had been on my normal time track, I probably would have been okay.  But after three years of a miserable academic record, [Adolf] Hitler started the war [World War II, WWII] and saved my face, 'cause I could leave without being thrown out of college and say, "Well, I'm going off to fight for my country"  (laughter).  To bring that to a close, I didn't get back to college until 1952 when I returned from Korea [Korean War], at which time I was assigned to the base in Long Island [New York], right across the street--right across the road from Roosevelt Field [Long Island, New York]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --where [Charles] Lindbergh took off on that epic flight to Paris [France]--overnight flight.  And right next to Roosevelt Field was Mitchel Field [Long Island, New York].  I was stationed after Korea in Mitchel Field.  And right across the street was what is now Hofstra College [Hofstra University, Hempstead, New York].  It was started in 1950, I guess.  And so I decided to go to night school and summer school and finish college.  But I changed my field, wisely, from mechanical engineering to political science, and ran off a string of A's.  I took about twenty-one courses and got all but two courses were Bs and the rest were all straight A's.  The Bs were given to me by a professor [Dr. Herbert D. Rosenbaum] who later on in 1998--he had retired from Hofstra, he had been my professor in political science--and he submitted my name for an honorary doctorate of humane letters.  And I say all that simply to indicate that that was my education, and how it progressed.  And anyway, I just wanted to give you closure on my education.
Story_ID: 226287
Speaker 1: Can you tell me the names of your brothers and sisters in their birth order (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.  My brother's name was Denis, D-E-N-I-S, one N; Denis Alvin Dryden, six years younger than I.  He was born in 1926, and deceased year before last; yeah.  My sister, Pauline [Dryden Miles], is still alive, is eleven years younger than I; she was born October 25, 1931, the same year that the George Washington Bridge was opened.  My mother [Violet Buckley Dryden] said when Pauline was born, she looked out the window of the hospital, Presbyterian Hospital [New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York] and could see the ceremony taking place.  So she lives in Denver, Colorado.  So she was born October 25th of 1931.  So my brother was six years younger; my sister is eleven years younger than I.
Story_ID: 226288
Speaker 1: What street did you all live on growing up?
Speaker 2: The first street was St. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan [New York, New York], so called part of a--this city called Sugar Hill.  There are a number of prosperous, at that time, and notable black people.  Duke Ellington lived up there, so forth.  And then when I was sixteen, my family moved from Manhattan to the Bronx [New York, New York].  That was in 1936, and I was still going to high school [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] at that point.  And I stayed--we lived--I remained there until I left to go to the service [U.S. Air Force] in 1941.  So that's--those are the places mainly that I lived in my young life.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your block in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very well.  My home in the Bronx, we lived on first 167th Street.  And then after about a year or so, my folks [Violet Buckley Dryden and Charles Dryden] took in a boarder to help make, you know, to make ends meet.  And we moved to a little larger apartment on Home Street.  The address was 800 Home at, H-O-M-E, Street.  It was about a four-square block area, I think of it, Home Street running from Boston Ponds Road [sic. Boston Post Road], past Morris High School [New York, New York], where by the way [HistoryMaker] General Colin [L.] Powell attended Morris High School.  And on the other side of the neighborhood was Prospect Avenue.  And then the final boundary is around 163rd Street, where the streetcar came from Manhattan up to the Bronx.  So about that area is where all the neighbors who were the village that helped to raise me and all my peers.  And you dared not misbehave yourself in the presence of any of them, 'cause before you could get home, the word was home that your son did so and so and so forth.  And you paid the piper (laughter).
Story_ID: 226289
Speaker 1: Are there any people from your community that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  My family is a member of the St. Augustine Presbyterian Church [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we first attended the church, the pastor was Reverend Edler [Garnet] Hawkins.  He was white, Scotsman, very religious countryman.  And the neighborhood, it was mostly Jews living in that area, and they attended temples in the neighborhood.  But then blacks began to move into the neighborhood, and many of them attended two main churches; one was St. Anthony of Padua [Roman] Catholic Church [New York, New York], and then St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, which is the one that my family belonged to.  The pastor there was a young minister.  His name was the Rev. Edler Garnet Hawkins.  He died many years ago, thirty years ago.  But he was one of the most religious clergymen--a genuine, sincere clergymen I've ever known.  Religion to him was not a means of making a living.  It was a mission.  And he was a role model--unmatchable role model for youngsters.  They were about twenty of us I can think of in my peer group, half and half boys and girls.  And out of that group have come doctors, ministers, educators, artists, myself a military man, and so forth.  We were an unusual group of youngsters.  Not so much because of ourselves, but what we were exposed to, the way we were raised by so many people who had impact on our lives.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can remember many of them; the Boy Scout master, Mr. Cryer [ph.], was one man.  Our--older folks, friends of--my father [Charles Dryden] was an elder in the church, and there were some other elders; Mr. Crain [ph.] was the Boy Scouts master; Mr. Cryer was one of the older men coaching one of the basketball teams; there was Mr. So and So, who was a basketball coach.  And all of these men made sure that we grew up as men.  They, by their own--what they shared, but also by their own examples.  They were at home, they were there to raise their kids, to help their children's mother raise them to make sure that we grew up to be responsible men.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Young men.  And I remember that with great affection and great appreciation, 'cause if we had turned out badly, it wasn't for our role models.  We had wonderful role models.  I remember to this day.  So, that deals with your question there about the people in the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 226290
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, sounds and smells in your neighborhood growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we were, we benefitted from some of the smells because there were many southern families, which were southern--families with southern roots.  And so soul food, the fragrances coming from households was familiar.  Then, of course, being from a Jamaican family, there were the familiar smells of Jamaican foods and so forth.  And so I was--I benefitted from both types of cuisine, you might say.  Although there were two cultures to which I was exposed: the African American and the Caribbean.  Nevertheless, we did have common bonds in terms of interest; for example, every time Joe Louis was fighting, the whole neighborhood was attuned by radio, no television.  And we were all downcast when [Max] Schmeling beat him in the first fight.  But then the second time around, and Joe almost killed him with a punch to his kidneys, and then on the radio I heard this German scream (laughter).  They became close friends later, I understand.  But Joe was our hero.  I got to meet him later when the war [World War II, WWII] started.  He was in the service, and he came to Tuskegee [Alabama] and visited.  We all were thrilled by the likes of the Marian Anderson when she sang down at the Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.] after the Daughters of the American Revolution [DAR] had denied her permission to sing in their concert hall [DAR Constitution Hall, Washington, D.C.].  When Jesse Owens embarrassed [Adolf] Hitler by defeating his athletes to the point of where Hitler left the stadium; he couldn't stand it (laughs) you know, because Jesse Owens just whipped, you know, won.  We all--it was a victory for each of us.  There was a common bond that we had; in other words, whenever one of us excelled in whatever field, whether it's music or sports or, for example, later on when Jackie Robinson broke into baseball, everybody was excited about that.  Everybody felt it's a personal victory.  Every time one of our athletes scored a homerun or a touchdown or topped the field or whatever the field was, it was an incentive for us to excel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I'll get to that later when you talk about my [U.S.] military career, what effect that had on me and all the rest of mine.
Story_ID: 226291
Speaker 1: --Now, I'd like to explore your academic career.  What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: My major?
Speaker 1: Your elementary school, what was the name?
Speaker 2: What was it like?
Speaker 1: The name of it?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, it didn't have a name that I know of.  It was P.S. 146.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--no, P.S. 46 [New York, New York].  Yes.  P.S. 46.  My junior high school was Junior High School 164 [I.S. 164, Edward W. Stitt Junior High School, New York, New York].  It was on 64th Street (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--just, in the elementary school, were there any teachers that you remember that impacted you?
Speaker 2: Never.  I've never had a black teacher.  Never.  From kindergarten--from first grade all the up to postgraduate in Columbia University [New York, New York]; I've never had a black teacher.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: It's hard to believe, but the New York City system did not have any black teachers when I was coming through.  And that's why I say I was at a disadvantage because there wasn't anyone of color could teach me about the things I needed to know about citizens of color in this country.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you in these early years, from elementary to junior high?
Speaker 2: I had to say with all humility, excellent.  And I gave you a hint as to one.  My mother [Violet Buckley Dryden] launched me with a good background in math and spelling. Consequently, when I got into the classroom, I really had a leg up on all of my peers.  And there's a picture in my book ['A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman,' Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden] showing--I think it's the first picture--it shows me as president of my school--of my class in junior high school.  There were five blacks in a class of about thirty students.  And they elected me as president of the class.
Speaker 1: And junior high [I.S. 164, Edward W. Stitt Junior High School, New York, New York] was around what year for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I started in 1930, and then I graduated from there in 1933.  Wait a minute.  We're talking about junior high school; '33 [1933], started Stuyvesant [High School, New York, New York] in '33 [1933] and finished in '38 [1938].  That's about right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And who were your friends in junior high school?  Who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Everybody in the class, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 226292
Speaker 1: I must say, my experience in New York City [New York, New York], there was no--I did not experience any prejudice among my classmates, and I don't remember any teacher being outwardly hostile.  There was one teacher who was ingenuous in terms of not realizing--I relate to this in my book ['A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman,' Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden], first grade--no it wasn't first grade, it was later than that. We had moved to 164th Street, so I left--no, wait.  Before I went to P.S. 46 [New York, New York], I was in school on 169th Street, and it was almost like a kindergarten class.  The teacher had us sitting, during a break, to sing a song in a circle, to join hands.  And then you sang a song, making a motion like you were winding taffy (singing): "Wind, wind, nigger baby; wind, wind, nigger baby; pull and pull and one, two, three."  I didn't know what the word meant.  And I'm thinking I'm always trying to be the top of my class, so I was singing just as loudly as any other kid.  So that evening, mother [Violet Buckley Dryden] asked us--she (unclear) wonder how the kids are doing-- "Did you learn anything new in school today?"  "Yes, we learned a new song."  "Would you sing it for us?"  Just my mother and father [Charles Dryden].  My brother [Denis Dryden] and sister [Pauline Dryden Miles] weren't born yet.  "Yeah, I'll sing it."  Before then, up to that moment, there had been lively conversation between my mother and father, and then when I sang the song, there was dead silence.  My father looked like he was going to explode.  His jaw was tight.  He said, "Son, I'm not angry with you, but don't you ever, ever sing that song again.  Is that clear?"  "Yes, Dad."  I don't know whether it was mother or father or both of them, went to school and shook their finger and said, "Don't you ever sing that to my son again."  They never did.  So that was my first encounter.  I never heard the word before.  My folks said that that's a hateful song, or word rather, and we just don't use that.  "You never heard it before," which I hadn't.  "Don't you ever use it again."  So that's when the day, back in the days when parents took a very close track of their children.  And so they went there and they (unclear) (laughter).  And it never happened again.  That was my first encounter with racism.  But, and because I happily had been a good student and had good grades, so teachers could point to me with pride and say this is an example of how I teacher and so forth.  I always had friendly teachers.  I never had any hostile teachers.  I never had anybody who said, "Well, you're not college material.  You (unclear)."  I never had any of that nonsense, fortunately.  So that was my schooling, my upbringing in school.
Story_ID: 226293
Speaker 1: What was your church [St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, New York, New York] community like?
Speaker 2: I mentioned our pastor, Rev. [Edler Garnet] Hawkins, who in later years, that is, in the '60s [1960s]--I had long left the church--but he became moderator of the United Presbyterian Church, U.S.A., which is the highest ranking official in that church. In membership, millions of people across the country.  And he was moderator.  He was the first, and he may still be the only black who's been a moderator of that church.  The church has changed its identity somewhat to some extent.  There used to be two Presbyterian churches:  United Presbyterian Church U.S.A. [sic. Presbyterian Church in the United States of America] in the North; and the American (unclear) [sic. United Presbyterian Church of North America]--something like that, that denomination merged with the other one.  But, yet, even though the membership nationwide was predominantly white, he was the number one--he was the top official.  And he was respected worldwide.  Everybody knew about this very humble--he was like [Mahatma] Gandhi in his approach.  When I was in cadet training, one time I remember I wanted to go see a movie after class hours.  I had been looking forward to it for a couple of weeks.  It had been advertised.  It's called 'Springtime in the Rockies,' and it was featuring Harry James' jazz band, and I loved jazz.  So I was in the theater bright and early first show, and the movie had just started about ten or fifteen minutes, there was a PA announcement, "Cadet Dryden [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden], report to the cadet lounge.  You have a visitor."  "Who's bothering me now?  Now of all times."  And so I left and went up to the lounge.  Who was there?  Reverend Hawkins.  I said--I put my--we embraced and I said, "What brings you down here?"  He said, "Well, I had some business in this part of the country, so I decided to drop in on one of my flock."  I forgot all about that movie.  And we talked until lights out and so forth.  But that's the kind of minister he was, and that's the kind of role model he was.  In the sermon, in the pulpit, he never raised his voice.  You know, some people whoop and holler?  Not him.  He had modulated voice, but he made some very, very deep points that grabbed you right here (gesturing).  And that's why I developed my--built on what I had gotten from my parents' [Violet Buckley Dryden and Charles Dryden] attitude towards God, so forth, creation, responsibilities of life.  He just reinforced it as a clergyman.  And so from those influences, I developed my attitude by other people and the Creator and what's life all about and so forth.  So I'm very much indebted to family and my religious leaders.
Story_ID: 226294
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: High school?
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: Peter Stuyvesant High School [New York, New York].  It's a famous school nationwide.  It's one of the best.  To get in, you had to have an average of 82 on your Regents [Examaminations] from your junior high schools.  So I just did get in.  And I graduated on time, four years later.  And it prepared me--from Stuyvesant, I was prepared to go to [The] City College [of New York, New York, New York], which I told you about earlier.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Where I was ahead of my time.  And it wasn't--it was not to my benefit (laughter).  I should have been on time, not ahead of my time.  I realize that.  So when I came back from Korea [Korean War] in '52 [1952], I went to Hofstra College [Hofstra University, Hempstead, New York] night school and summer school.  And I got a degree age thirty-five and gave my parents [Violet Buckley Dryden and Charles Dryden] an autographed graduation picture that said, "At last" (laughter).  I'm thirty-five.  But by that time, my sister [Pauline Dryden Miles] and my brother [Denis Dryden] each had master's degrees and I didn't even have a B.A., but I finally got it.  I'm the big brother.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Very good experiences.  My foreign language was French, and I had Professor Elliot [ph.].  I remember he used to say, (speaking French).  And to this day, I can conjugate those French verbs and speak a little bit of French.  When I went for my master's in my second language, I chose French, and I passed it first time around.  So what I'm saying is that the roots that I got in high school were excellent.  They fortified or reinforced everything I'd learned along the way.
Speaker 1: Who was impacting you at that time in high school?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Who was impacting you?  Who was influencing what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, in high school?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Did you have friends or were there organizations that you belonged to?
Speaker 2: I belonged to the aviation club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Built models and all that sort of thing.  We had some athletes who were outstanding.  Well, Stuyvesant, however, was noted for its--we were--didn't have that word then.  We were known as the brain, the nerds, if you will; bookworms.  Stuyvesant team would win competitions in debating and every academic subject you could think of.  Our football, basketball teams, we Seldom (unclear) was beating us all the time; football, basketball.
Speaker 1: Were you playing any sports?
Speaker 2: No, not me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I was a runt (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a little fellow, I could not really compete in any physical sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, early on, I had to learn to develop my speaking skills.  And that got me out of a lot of scrapes.  I didn't have to fight 'cause I'd talk my way out (laughter).  So.
Story_ID: 226295
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you wanted to be at this time [at Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: A pilot.  Always wanted to fly.  Always.  That's--so that when I finished flight training at Tuskegee [Alabama], and these wings were pinned on me, I thought I was going to die.  I was so excited, "I made it.  I made it."  My heart was beating like a trip hammer, and I was afraid I was just going to die.  And if I had, I said in my book ['A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman,' Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden], "If I had died that day, I would have died happy, because I would have fulfilled my life's ambition.  I'm only twenty-one years of age" (laughter).  But that's what I always wanted to do, fly.  And all the people in the neighborhood talked about this crazy black kid who wanted to fly when there was no opening for blacks in aviation, either [U.S.] military or civilian.  But that did not (unclear).  I wanted to fly and I wanted the chance to prove I could fly.  And I got the chance.  So at every stage of my cadet training, I was worried about being washed out, because the washout rate is fairly (unclear) it was about 60 percent.  So about one-third of each class started, about one-third finished.  And my class started with eleven and three of us finished.  The first class, I was in the second class; out of thirteen that started, five finished; mine, three out of that one; the third class, ten started, four finished.  That was about one-third of each class until finally at the end of the program--I'm getting at the story--there were 992 of us got our wings at Tuskegee.  So at that rate, there must have been about four thousand who started, and only almost one thousand finished.
Story_ID: 226296
Speaker 1: So where we stopped off last, you were beginning to talk about coming out of high school [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] and going to college.  What were you thinking you wanted to be or when did you first become aware that you wanted to fly?
Speaker 2: I guess when I was born.  That I wanted to fly?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I always wanted to.  As I said, my mother [Violet Buckley Dryden] shared I'd throw pieces of paper and try to say airplane.  So I may have had thoughts of flying when I was in the womb, before I was born.  I don't know.  I always wanted to fly.  I never thought of anything else.  No fireman, no doctor, no cook, no nothing; just flying.
Speaker 1: And did you know that you wanted to go to college when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: That I wanted to go to college?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I knew I had to go to college.
Speaker 1: No choice (laughter).
Speaker 2: No child of any Caribbean parent thinks about anything but going to--finishing--but, see, the fourth principle is, get a good education.  And so, there was never any thought in my mind not to go into college.
Speaker 1: How did your experience in college--if you could say the name of the college again and tell us if you were a member of any organizations or any associations.
Speaker 2: Well, in [The] City College [of] New York [New York, New York], I was in mechanical engineering, and they had an aviation club there.  I never tried to join.  I was never approached to join a fraternity.  In fact, I don't think we had any Greek letter organizations at City.  We had an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter.  But I was so occupied by my academics, trying to pass academically, that I didn't have any spare time for extracurricular activities.  And as I said, my college record was rather disastrous.  It was just a--I can't think of many people who got good to come out of World War II [WWII], but I did.  It saved my face.  I was able to say, "Well, I'm leaving college to go fight for my country," about one step before they were gonna drop me, academically, which would have been the greatest disgrace, but it--what might have been disgraceful turned out to be a preeminent victory, in other words.  "Well, he's going off, fly for his country."
Story_ID: 226297
Speaker 1: And what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, while I was at [The] City College [of New York, New York, New York], there was a program called the Civilian Pilot Training Program, started by the [U.S.] Congress under the urgings of Colonel [Charles] Lindbergh, Lucky Lindy, who flew across the Atlantic [Ocean] by himself.  And he had been visiting Europe just around the time that the Nazis began to invade all over Europe.  And he came back to the [United] States, and he notified everybody what he observed there.  What he observed is that the Germans had, in spite of the Versailles Treaty [sic. Treaty of Versailles], which ended World War I [WWI], which denied Germany any kind of military organization, Army, Navy, Air Force, whatever.  But they were surreptitiously building an Air Force, a corps, a large corps of aviation qualified people as The Hitler Youths.  They were teaching them to fly like Boy Scouts were flying.  But what he was doing really was forming the beginning of the Luftwaffe for Germany, because when they outwardly declared war, these civilian pilots all put on uniforms as a German Air Force, qualified pilots.  They had more qualified pilots than any country in the world.  This country had had pilots in the air corps of World War I, but because of the Atlantic on the east and the Pacific [Ocean] on the west, Americans had a false sense of security.  We're safe.  Nobody'll ever hit this (unclear).  They're fighting over in Europe, they're fighting in Asia; nobody's gonna attack here.  Because no one had the foresight to realize that air power could go around the world ultimately, as you know.  But it was in its infancy that--well, when Lindbergh reported what he had observed, the Congress decided to fund training programs on college campuses all around the country, including five of the historically black colleges [and universities, HBCUs]: Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], West Virginia State [College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], Lincoln.  And so I was at City, which is not a black college, but I was able to get into the program there.  And the program ended up with a pilot license, a private pilot license.  So when I finished the program and received my license, it was the beginning of achievement of an ultimate dream of being a [U.S.] military pilot.  So when Tuskegee was open--excuse me--when the [U.S.] Army Air Corps, under the pressures of our black press newspapers and our leaders like Walter White and A. Philip Randolph and Mary McLeod Bethune, who was a close friend of [First Lady] Eleanor Roosevelt (unclear)--and they brought so much pressure, that the Congress decided to--well, it didn't go that way.  President [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt directed the United States Army Corps to begin accepting applications from blacks.  And I applied, and I was assigned to the second class that went through flight training.  And, of course, I benefitted from the fact that I had, before going to Tuskegee, I had gotten my pilot's license in New York from City College.  So that made my career in cadet training rather easy.  There were a lot of guys who went through it who had never had any training, they made it anyway.  So, as I say, we ended up with 992, who earned their wings through the whole war.  So that's the biggest benefit that I got from City College, even though I didn't get my degree.  And I had to wait for a few years later, came back from Korea [Korean War] and finished college.  But that was a--that's the biggest benefit I got from City College--
Story_ID: 226298
Speaker 1: And then later, when I was on active duty, excuse me, I resumed college at Hofstra [University, Hempstead, New York], went to night school and summer school and got a B.A. in political science in 1952, and then--in 1955, rather.  I started in '52 [1952], got my degree in '55 [1955]; and two years later was able to get a master's [degree] in public law and government at Hofstra--at Columbia University [New York, New York].  So that's how my college training went.  It ended up in a victory rather than a total disgrace.
Speaker 2: And upon graduation from Columbia, what was your next step?
Speaker 1: From Columbia?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, I was in active, on active duty.  The [U.S.] Air Force had two programs.  The first was for undergraduates.  That was--they called Operation Bootstrap [Air Force Educational Leave of Absence].  And by whatever means, an individual in the service, the Air Force particularly, pardon me, could get him or herself to within six months of a degree by going to night school, summer school; whenever.  When you got to that point where you only needed about five subjects to complete your course--undergraduate (unclear), they would--you would apply for, and if you were accepted to the Operation Bootstrap, your next six-month period, you had no duties at all.  As a pilot, you had your flying time each month, but you had no [U.S.] military duties.  You were on campus for the whole time for six months.  Well, I got to that point by going to night summer school.  After six months, I got my degree, and I thought that was the end of it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 226299
Speaker 1: But as it turned out, I returned at my job at Mitchel Field [Long Island], New York, and there was a corporal working in the office where I was, who was head of a publishing magazine, and--David Fisher [ph.].  And we became friends, and we were supporting each other in academics.  I'd give him all the support--moral support in terms of him getting his degree in his education, and likewise, he watched as I was doing my thing.  Well, he had a moonlighting job at the Officer's Club, and one time there were some visitors from the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] and they liked how he conducted himself and how he was so cooperative as a waiter.  So they offered him a job at the Pentagon in a V.A. [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] (unclear) dining room.  Okay.  So he left Mitchel and went to the Pentagon.  About a month later--about a couple months later I had business in the Pentagon in the intelligence office.  And while I was waiting for the colonel I was supposed to see, he came into the room.  He was a courier, his regular duty and he had a moonlighting job in the VIP dining room waiter.  We saw each other, greeted each other and he said, "Well, Colonel"--I mean, "Major" at the time--he said, "Major," I know you got your degree.  When are you going to get your master's [degree]?"  I said, "Well, look, Fisher, I just got a program where my undergraduate education was completed under [U.S.] Air Force auspices, and I don't think I stand a chance of being accepted for the graduate program," which is one year to get a master's.  He said, "Well, all you got to do is apply and I'll see to it that it's approved."  I said, "You're going to approve it?"  He said, "No, not me.  But I work for Colonel Brack [ph.], and he's the one who approves such applications.  So all you have to do is, when you apply, it'll come across my desk and I'll put it on top of the pile and the colonel will approve it.  I'm sure."  He did.  And the colonel did.  And so I was selected to go to Columbia [University, New York, New York] to get my master's.  And we correspond even now and then.  He eventually--he got his degree, got out of the service.  But that's how that particular team came about. So, and I finally got my master's in 1957.  By that time, my brother [Denis Dryden] and sister [Pauline Dryden Miles] both had had their master's for a few years.  But that's the story of my education--
Story_ID: 226300
Speaker 1: I started to tell you, I had a professor in political science, Professor Herbert [D.] Rosenbaum, retired from Hofstra [University, Hempstead, New York] a few years ago.  And about five or six years ago, he called me.  He was living on Long Island [New York], and he said, "Chuck [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden], Nikki [ph.]--" his wife, "--and I are coming down to Atlanta [Georgia].  We have relatives here, and we'd like to stop by your house and visit."  I said, "Be glad to see you."  He came on a Sunday afternoon.  And I greeted him and we talked.  And he said to me, "Chuck, call your family together.  I got some good news for you."  So I, "Okay."  So I called my wife [Marymal Dryden] and my daughter.  He said, "I'm pleased to tell you that your beloved Chuck has been selected by Hofstra to be conferred with an honorary doctorate of humane letters."  I almost fell off the chair (laughter).  It's the last thing I expected.  And so it was awarded.
Speaker 2: And you are now Dr. Dryden.
Speaker 1: Well--I never use the title.  I'll tell you why.  I have always had the greatest respect for those who have--who had to work hard to earn a doctorate in whatever field it may be.  You got all the studies, advance studying you have to do, research.  You've got orals to take.  You got a dissertation to write.  And I've seen my own stepdaughter go through the whole thing.  She just got hers in public health last December 8th, last year.  And she went through the hoops to do it.  And so I feel that the doctorate, the title which I'm entitled, it's almost like a--what I'm trying to say--it doesn't hold water with your going through the whole studies and dissertation and all.  And I said this to my sister's [Pauline Dryden Miles] older child Wendy, who is the vice president at Western Union.  She lives in Alexandria [Virginia].  And I told her, and she said, "Uncle Charlie, you've earned that doctorate from your life's experiences."  But I still--now, I know I earned the title colonel, and I have no questions about that.  But, anyway, that's how I feel about it.  I don't even have any cards that say Dr. Dryden.  I'm Colonel Dryden.  No Mr. Dryden--
Story_ID: 226301
Speaker 1: In what regard do you feel as if you earned the title of colonel?
Speaker 2: How did I earn it?
Speaker 1: How did you earn it?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  Went through flight training [Civilian Pilot Training Program], which itself was quite burdensome.  I been in two wars [World War II and Korean War] and survived.  I have had a number of proteges from whom they told me I was their role model.  I served the country for twenty-one years, in spite of the fact--yes, sure; at the beginning of the reading of my book '[A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman,' Lieutenant Colonel Charles W. Dryden], the very first chapter you learn about my being court marshaled, not once, but twice.  And I served--I survived the two court trials.
Speaker 1: Can you speak a little bit about that?  You do begin your book with that.  Can you discuss that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I had gone overseas with the 99th Fighter Squadron, was the first all-black fighter squadron, and with Colonel [Benjamin O.] Davis [Jr.] as our commander officer.  And he was born famous.  His father [General Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.] was the first black general in the history of the country.  He, himself, had gone through West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].  In the four years, nobody spoke to him.  He was totally segregated.  All the other cadets had roommates, but not him.  No one spoke to him socially, just on official business.  And in spite of that he survived, he made it.  I think he graduated thirty-fifth in a class of 275, something like that.  Only the fourth black American to finish West Point, and he became my CO [commanding officer]. He had been my hero from far distance.  He was--he's from Washington, D.C., and I'm growing up in New York City [New York, New York].  I read about this black--he was the first one in this--in the 20th century to finish West Point.  So he was my hero.  To end up at Tuskegee [Army Air Field, Tuskegee, Alabama], the same as my upper classmen, 'til he finished flight training, then he became my CO here and overseas.  He was a quintessential leader.  He was the kind of guy--just about all of us would follow him through hell.  He was an average pilot.  There was nothing--he was the hot rock out of (unclear), he was a steady pilot, and a heck of an officer.  And so when I ended up in cadet training and found he was my upperclassman, I was inspired by that.  The course consisted of three phases: the primary, basic and advanced.  And as my upperclassmen went through each phrase, losing guys along the way through washout; they (unclear) fight, they start with (unclear), and so by the time they graduated, eight of them that had started were washed out.  But at each phase that the surviving five completed it, that was an inspiration to me.  If they can make it, I can make it.  And so I did.  So eventually, a month after they graduated in March of '42 [1942], my class graduated in April of '42 [1942].  Now, so now he becomes my CO, and his four classmates who had graduated with him, and they were my role model.
Story_ID: 226302
Speaker 1: So, you see, I've had great role models all my life, from my parents [Violet Buckley Dryden and Charles Dryden] my uncles and so forth. My aunts who were my role models, three of them surviving.  I can truthfully say I've had a life that has been blessed from the very beginning.  I was born to parents who were in love and stayed in love all their lives.  I never had to go through single parenthood.  I've always been surrounded by an extended family of aunts and nephews and uncles.  I never heard-I'll put it this way-- a person as so commonly say, "I love you."  My kinfolks didn't believe in verbalizing.  You knew how they felt about you by their actions.  Never any doubt in my mind that all my siblings [Denis Dryden and Pauline Dryden Miles] and I were very, very important to all of our adult kinfolks and as well as our own peers.  And to this day, we're just so that tightly bonded.  So for me, having gone into the program [Tuskegee Army Flying School] as a licensed pilot and having had some experience, oh, I had my moments wondering whether I was gonna make it or not.  But it was not nearly as unsettling and disturbing as those who went through without any previous flying training, because they never knew.  Always had the doubt in mind whether or not they'll make it to the next phase or the next day.  I had those doubts, but not--I just knew I was going to make it.  As a matter of fact, excuse me, at one point, I was little overconfident (laughter).  And my instructor in the first phase, Milton Crenshaw from Arkansas, and it was an old cockpit airplane, the primary trainer, and he had me one day to demonstrate some turns.  So I did the turns the way I had been doing it in the Civilian Pilot Training Program.  He reached back, put his hands on my feet, and my feet on the rudder, he said, "Mr. Dryden [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden], if you don't start using the rudder in your turns, I'm going to wash you out of it."  He never had any more trouble.  I had been making turns without using the rudder, so I'm skidding around turns.  I thought I was doing all right.  No.  That's not the [U.S.] Army way.  You have to coordinate the stick and the rudder so you have a smooth turn.  So my instructors had a big part in molding me as an aviator and as an officer, so that I had an easy time of it as an officer.
Story_ID: 226303
Speaker 1: I had a master sergeant that happened to have been white.  One day, on the flight line at Tuskegee [Army Air Base, Tuskegee, Alabama]--and I'm watching the first class flying, we were waiting our turn to fly.  And so I decided to talk to this master sergeant, and I said--he had been in the service twenty-five, thirty years; I don't--an old veteran, knew the [U.S.] Army.  I said, "Sergeant, tell me something.  I'm having some questions about being an officer."  He said, "Well, sonny, tell me what's your problem."  I said, "I've been raised to respect my elders, and obviously you're much older than I am, and certainly much more experienced in the Army than I, and yet I'm going to be authorized to give you orders and you have to obey my orders.  How come?"  He said, "That's just the Army way."  He said, "It's not--just be the kind of person you are, considering other people's feelings, never feeling better than anybody else just because of your rank and so forth, and treat people the way, with the kind of respect you deserve.  It's just like do unto others as you have them do unto you."  Very valuable advice told me.  I asked him, I said, "Well, what about you dealing, as an officer, with enlisted men like yourself?"  I said, "Because with our difference in age, the way I've been trained, I'm supposed to call you sir, you know."  He said, "Well, sonny, you just be yourself and understand that that's the Army way.  And your men who work for you, be assigned to you, will respect you as just as far as you show your respect for them for their just being a person, and then for the skills that they have whether they're a mechanic or cook or finance clerk or whatever it is, you just show respect for them as a person and for the particular skills they have that you don't have.  Just remember that.  And two things, first:  Never ask your men to do something that you wouldn't do; secondly, never gamble with your men, because if you win their money, they will think that you took advantage of your rank.  And if they lose and they win your money, at some future time when you may have to discipline one of them, they will think you're taking revenge.  So avoid all that.  Just don't never gamble with your men.  Never--you can have a drink with them at a squadron party or picnic or something like that, but never let them see you drunk.  Never."  Good advice.
Story_ID: 226304
Speaker 1: So this thing about never doing--tell your men to do something you wouldn't do, it happened that after I had gotten my commission and I was assigned temporary duty to a squadron on the base [Tuskegee Army Air Base, Tuskegee, Alabama] to learn about being an officer in charge of men.  And so my CO [commanding officer] was the first lieutenant.  I was a first lieutenant--no, I was a second lieutenant, at first.  And so one day at his headquarters, he said--it was a very hot day in August in Tuskegee [Alabama]--he said, "Lieutenant, I want you to take this document up to headquarters, because it's classified and I must have it as a courier."  So I said, "Okay, Lieutenant." I started for the door.  He said, "No, no."  He held out the keys to his prized '38 [1938] Buick.  "Take Betsy."  That's what he called his car.  "It's too hot out there for you to walk."  "But I need the exercise."  "Come on, take the car."  "I can't do that, Lieutenant." (Unclear). He said, "What do you mean you can't do that?"  "Sir, I can't drive."  "You what?  You can fly that [Curtiss] P-40 [Warhawk] out there and you can't drive a Buick?"  I said, "That's right."  He said, "What are you doing tonight?"  "I don't have any plans."  So he said, "You come to my quarters, I'm gonna teach you to drive because I can't have an officer on my staff who can't drive a car."  So, the next night he gave me my first lesson.  The next night for my second lesson, it started to rain.  He said, "We can't take out"-- so we just talked, "how you doing as an officer," and all of that.  And I asked him questions and he answered them.  So while we're talking about generalities, what Tuskegee is all about and how it's important was that it not fail, et cetera, the phone rang down the hall.  And after a few minutes, another resident of the barracks came to his door and knocked.  "Call for you, Lieutenant [Nathaniel] Freeman."  He came back after then he says, "[HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles] Dryden, I got a task for you."  He said, "I just got a message we have some troops coming in from New Jersey.  They'll be here in about an hour, and I've called the motor pool to send a couple of trucks down to the railroad station to bring them to the base.  Now, I want you to take Betsy and go down to the station and meet them, and then lead them and come back to the base."  I said (unclear), "You're not gonna-I had one lesson in that car.  I don't think"--I said.  "You can make it."  That's what he told me.  "You can make it.  You're all right."  So I didn't tell him.  I said, "Lord, you gotta ride with me on this one."  It was a dark road.  It was rainy, no lights along the road, ditches and all.  I made it, got there before the train.  In about fifteen minutes, I saw the drivers of two trucks.  So about fifteen minutes later the train arrived and out come about twenty-nine recruits.  Young. They just got into service.  And so I found out who was in charge, it was a sergeant.  And I said, "Well, just call--have the men sit here and I'll tell them what the score is."  And I told them, "Sunday night we had no advanced notice, so the supply warehouse was closed; the barracks were brand new; hot and cold water, but no beds or anything."  So I told them that.  I said, "Well, here's the story.  The mess hall is closed, there's no food; no cars and so forth.  But what I want you to do," 'cause it had been pouring down rain, so I said, "Each of you get yourself some dry clothes out of your duffel bag and change and find a place on the floor to sleep.  And I'm going to go to BX [Base Exchange] before it closes to try to buy some snacks and so forth so everybody will have a little something to eat, and I'll be back as soon as I can."  So I left and I went to the BOQ [Bachelor Officer Quarters] and got a blanket from my bed and talked to some of my friends who had little stashes of food, you know; cans of food and spam and all sorts of--; went to BX and I bought a few dollars' worth of potato chips and candy and so forth and went back to the barrack.  And I said, "Mess hall is closed.  The PX [Post Exchange] was closing but I got something, enough for each of you to have one candy bar or something like that.  Now, each of you pick a spot where you'll spend on night on the floor; and I see a spot over there by the stairwell, and I'm claiming that."  So I went over there and took off my blouson, loosened my tie, put my rank coat as a pillow, and took off my blouson and said, "Okay.  Lights out in fifteen minutes, and we wake up at 6:00 a.m."  Then I had told the CQ, that's Charge of Quarters, at the orderly room--they had quarters in the squadron--to make me a fire.  And so I laid down.  Well, to make a story short, the word got around the base that this brand new second lieutenant had spent the night sleeping on the floor with his men.  So my reputation was made, you know, a compassionate officer who was concerned--he would not ask his men to do something that he (unclear).  From that point on, my reputation was made.  I had a guy come to me, Nick Kinonas [ph.].  He had met me right after graduation.  He saluted me.  He was the first person to salute me.  Yeah.  And he had saluted me and had his hand out to receive the traditional dollar.  The first person that salutes you as an officer, you owe him a dollar. Okay.
Story_ID: 226305
Speaker 1: Okay, let us start back when you were discussing receiving a dollar after (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, one of the [U.S.] Army traditions or [U.S.] military traditions is, when you're commissioned, when you earn a commission as an officer, the first person who salutes you deserves a dollar.  You owe him a dollar.  So that day after, which is April 29th, 1942, when my two classmates and I graduated [from Tuskegee Army Flying School, Tuskegee, Alabama], as we were leaving the theater where the ceremony was held, the first who walked up to me and saluted was Nick Kinonas [ph.], who was a corporal, I think, at the time.  So I knew the tradition, and I handed him a dollar, and thank you, congratulate me and so forth.  Well, it was about a month after that that this incident occurred where I had spent the night sleeping on the floor along with these troops.  And the next day--see, after having gotten (unclear), he said, "Lieutenant may I be your orderly?"  You know, your valet, like, you know.  It was a British custom that the U.S. forces were beginning to follow.  So I said, "Well, wait until I've been assigned to the BOQ--" the bachelor officers' quarters [Bachelor Officer Quarters], "--and I'll see what it's like and then come back and see me."  So after this incident that I told you about, the next day he appeared at my quarter.  He says, "Lieutenant, you remember you promised that you would consider hiring me as your orderly once you got settled in the BOQ?"  And I says, "Yeah."  He said, "Well, you're here and I would like to know if the offer still stands?"  I said, "Well, okay.  Come on in."  And we talked a while.  And I said, "This is what I'll expect you to do.  Keep the brass on my buckle shined, the peak of my cap, the eagle on my cap; keep my room in order.  That's about it."  So we talked, and I said, "By the way, my roommate is a major, and he's the TJA--" the trial judge advocate which was a lawyer in the military, "--and, of course, you would not want to end up in a court martial because of anything missing from our quarters?"  He said, "I understand."  So to make a long story short, I said, "Now, let's talk about pay."  I said, "What about ten dollars a week?"  He said, "Wonderful."  So he became my orderly.  And he used to keep my room in shape and so forth, so I didn't have to polish the brass and all that and so forth.  So that's what that custom was all about.  Now, that was taken from the British military tradition.  And--but the custom wasn't followed very long at Tuskegee [Army Air Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] after it was abandoned, because there was so many guys getting their commissions and so forth, and it just--so the British tradition, we just let it go.

Speaker 1: What were some of your best and worst experiences in your [U.S.] military career?
Speaker 2: Have you been talking to my wife [Marymal Dryden]?
Speaker 1: No (laughter).
Speaker 2: Because whenever I make a presentation, which is very often and she's in the audience, she asks that question if somebody else doesn't ask it, she asks the question 'cause she knows it's a sort of a pump (unclear).  My best--first the good.  My best experience was that day that I graduated [from Tuskegee Army Flying School, Tuskegee, Alabama] and had the wings pinned on me, because that was the realization of a life's ambition, a life's dream.  And I was so excited I thought I was going to die.  My heart was beating like a trip hammer.  I was over hyperventilating and all this.  Obviously, I didn't.  But that was the highlight of my career.  I've had other highlights, the birth of my sons [Charles Dryden, Jr., Keith Dryden, and Eric Dryden] and so forth, but that was the top.
Story_ID: 226307
Speaker 1: The bottom was the other end of the pendulum.  It happened after I had been overseas with my squadron, 99th [Fighter Squadron] for five months.  Seven others and myself were sent back to the [United] States to be instructors at--well, at Selfridge [Air National Guard Base], Michigan, outside of Detroit [Michigan], to teach the guys who were being trained for the 332nd Fighting Crew [sic. 332nd Fighter Group]--we had three squadrons:  The 100th, the 301st and 302nd.  And they were supposed to go overseas, pick up the 99th, which had been overseas for a year by that time, and become a four-squadron group.  There was--the only one, and they had four squadrons.  So it was our job, the eight of us, to teach them what we had learned fighting the Germans for five months overseas in the air.  And the eight of us ended up at the short stay at Selfridge, Michigan, where we tried to integrate the Officer's Club.  We were told, "Don't come in here.  It's for whites only."  So we tried five nights in a row, different ones of us, because each time one of us went into the club, we were told not to come in as a direct order.  To disobey a direct order at peacetime is flirting with a jail sentence.  To do so in wartime--and, of course, the war was on--you're flirting with the possibility of being shot by a firing squad, because to disobey an order from a superior officer is treason, and you could be shot to death for that.  So, five different groups of us did that, different nights.  And, finally, there was so much uproar in the press and so forth that the base commander had to close the club to everybody, whites and blacks alike.  So we thought we'd won a victory.  But it didn't work that way.  The commanding general, Frederick Odistral [ph.], on a base in (unclear), New York, moved the whole training unit from Selfridge, Michigan, to Walterboro [Army Airfield, Walterboro], South Carolina, about fifty miles west of Charleston [South Carolina].  On that base, there were German prisoners of war who could do things we couldn't do.  They were the enemy.  We had been fighting Germans.  We lost a couple of our buddies in air in combat, and yet, in our country, prisoners of war, who were Germans, could do things we couldn't do.  They could sit anywhere in the base theater.  We had to sit in the segregated colored section.  They could go into the BX [Base Exchange] cafeteria, and we couldn't even go in the building.  I became--it's difficult for me to talk about it even now--(pause).  I became so enraged, outraged that our country would treat us worse than they treat the enemy just because of color.
Story_ID: 226308
Speaker 1: I decided these rednecks down here don't believe we can fly.  Somebody's got to show them.  So I decided to demonstrate how well we could fly by leading a flight of three other guys, who hadn't been overseas yet, on a navigational flight, three points from Walterboro [Army Airfield, Walterboro, South Carolina] to Orangeburg [South Carolina], to two other places, back to Walterboro, our base; and to demonstrate upon return to the base how you land in combat as quickly as you can.  Because, you see, the Germans loved to stooge you around low to the ground on the outskirts of bases from which we would be--American planes would be taking off on training missions.  And when you returned from a combat mission, you're probably low on fuel, maybe zero ammunition if you've been in a dog fight; certainly low on energy, 'cause you've been forcing that airplane around a long time, saving your life and kill the other guy, you're probably low on energy.  So when you come back to a base in a combat area, you try to get your flight on the ground as quickly as you can.  You don't come up and fly on a standard (unclear), 800 feet, the downwind base.  Like, you come in low, low as you can, and you peel off at the end of the runway, one, two, three, four.  The idea is to form such a tight pattern that by the time the leader's airplane reaches the other end of the runway to turn off, his number four man is touching down, so the engine will lose about one, two, three, four.  So I was--ostensibly, that's what I was demonstrating.  Truthfully, I was mad as hell.  Okay.  So I did that.  That was a Saturday at the base?  The next day I was still angered, and I decided to demonstrate how to attack a flak tower.  F-L-A-K, flak.  Stands for, in German, flog, fliegerabwehrkanone, which means, antiaircraft.  The Germans loved to put machineguns around the periphery of water towers.  And so if you came in to attack any kind of target around the town, you knew you're going to be flying on by the machine gunners on the periphery of the water tower.  Well, so I came in, demonstrated this.  When you do that, if you've been flying low to avoid ground fire, when you get within about, oh, maybe a mile of your target, you put your--been low--it's difficult to navigate that way, but to make sure you hit your target, you pull up and then point down at the tower and you give them a couple bursts of machinegun fire, and you get back on the deck and fly off; doing what the British call is jinking.  That is, as you go away, you're changing altitudinal direction constantly.  So if somebody is trying to get a beat on you, it's a hard time.  Well, that's a technique.  And that's what I was supposedly demonstrating; but again, I was still full of anger.  Well, I have to give my wingmen credit.  They flew perfectly in both days.  They flew the tightest formation I've ever seen.  They were so proud.  They were so--all of us were just angry that we'd be treated that way.  And so, that was--both actions were against the regulations in this country.  You do that routinely overseas in combat, but you don't do that here.
Story_ID: 226309
Speaker 1: And so I was grounded and I was court-martialed as you read.  Well, in the first trial, there were two counts: buzzing the base [Walterboro Army Airfield, Walterboro, South Carolina] on Saturday, and buzzing the town on Sunday.  I was acquitted the buzzing of the town, because I was able to concoct a story, flat out lying, I never did understand why the court marshals didn't detect the lie, 'cause what I said was that, about that one, is that, I was leading these guys, demonstrating a simulated attack on a dive bomb attack on the--outside of the base there was a big circle like a bullseye where we used to practice dive bombing runs.  And I was--I said in my story that we were coming in to demonstrate this.  Well, if anybody had sense enough, they would have seen that the direction that I would have been coming in if I was pulling up over the town after doing that was the opposite to the direction in which I came, 'cause I came from the other direction first over the town then to--so, but nobody picks it up, so they acquitted me on that count.  But on the count of buzzing the base, there was no way I could have been acquitted, because on the witness stand, the tower operator was asked, "Well, how low was [HistoryMaker] Lieutenant [Colonel Charles] Dryden's flight when he came over the base on Saturday?"  He said, "Well, the control tower deck, the walkway in the control tower, is seventy-five feet above the ground.  And I had to look down at him as he went by."  So obviously, we were low.  And that was against the rules.  So I was grounded and court-martialed.  Well, as I said, I was acquitted from buzzing the town on Sunday, but I was convicted, as you read in chapter one, of buzzing the base on Saturday.  And for that I was convicted and sentenced to be dismissed from the service and disgraced with a dishonorable discharge, which just about floored me.  I didn't see how it could happen.
Story_ID: 226310
Speaker 1: Well, the reviewing authority in the [U.S.] military acts as a court of appeals, and reviewing the proceedings of the trial, determined that there was a glitch in the proceedings of my trial, in that I was not allowed to use a challenge for cause to challenge one of the members of the court off.  It so happens that one of the members had been heard to say before the trial, "[HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles] Dryden's guilty.  We're gonna hang him.  We're going to throw the book at him."  Well, you can't claim to be without a preconceived prejudgment if you make a public a statement like that.  So I asked my defense attorney to challenge this captain off the court on the basis of what he had been heard to say.  Well, the challenge is, the TJA, the trial judge advocate, he's the only member of the court who's a lawyer, a licensed lawyer, well, the TJA in this case, my trial said that, "Well, that challenge is not valid because it was hearsay evidence."  So he would not allow it.  Well, for me as a defendant under a serious charge like that, I had to get him off that court.  Now, you have an unlimited number of challenges for court as long as you can validate them, like in the case this guy said publicly; his mind is already made up--unlimited number--preemptory--I mean, of a challenge for cause.  But you have only one preemptory challenge.  And you use that to get a person off the court--you don't have to have a reason.  I just want them off the court.  You don't have to say, "I don't like his looks, I don't like his sound.  I want him off the court."  The preempt, he's gotta go.  So I was forced to use my one preemptory challenge to get that man off the court.  If my challenge for cause had been valid, which I (unclear) was true, I could have gotten two off the court; him for that charge and one preemptory, which would have stacked the odds more in my favor.  Okay.  Especially since (unclear) the court, when my squadron mates had come back to the [United] States with me.  I just knew I had it made.  So what happened is one of them had buckled under something like that and voted to be found guilty. Well, the second charge granted me because of the findings of the authority.  I had a second trial on the charge of buzzing the base [Walterboro Army Airfield, Walterboro, South Carolina].  And again I was found guilty.  But instead of being dismissed from the service with a dishonorable discharge, I was fined $110 a month for three months, which was a lot of money at that time.  I was confined to the base for three months, which meant I couldn't leave the base; and suspended from promotion consideration for a year; they wouldn't even consider me for promotion.  And as it turned out, it was seven years before I was promoted to captain.  But I was just delighted just to be on active duty, able to remain on active duty for twenty-one years, and retire as a lieutenant colonel.  And I think I believe this is true, I don't believe there's anyone else in the history of the armed forces of United States [United States Armed Forces]: [U.S.] Army, [U.S.] Navy, [U.S.] Air Force, Marines [U.S. Marine Corps], [U.S.] Coast Guard, who has had convictions, in not one but two general court martials, and yet was able to retire after twenty-one years as lieutenant colonel.  I don't think so.  So that was one of the good things of my life.  That was the highlight, to be able to do that.
Story_ID: 226311
Speaker 1: When you retired from the [U.S.] military, what was next?  What did you do next?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, when I retired the military, I was forty-two.  Last week, I was eighty-four.  So that was halfway point of my life.  So I've lived half of my life since then out of the military.  What did I do?  Well, I've had a number of jobs.  The first one of any length of time was with Pepsi-Cola Company [PepsiCo] with the headquarters of New York City [New York, New York].  I was hired by the first black American who was vice president of a major corporation, Harvey [C.] Russell [Jr.].  He hired me, and I worked for Harvey for about two years.  When Pepsi-Cola merged with Frito-Lay, became PepsiCo, Incorporated, Harvey Russell was promoted to vice president of the new higher level company, PepsiCo, Inc., which included two companies: Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay.  So he was kicked upstairs.  Replacing him at Pepsi-Cola, who became my boss in his place after he left, was a man named H. Naylor Fitzhugh.  Now Professor Fitzhugh was a professor at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] when I was still on active duty and anticipating leaving the service pretty soon.  I was about--I had two years to go for twenty years.  I enrolled in a couple of courses of business administration at Howard while I was instructing ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  And so, I met him--that's when we became friends.  So after I left the service and went with PepsiCo and he came to PepsiCo Company, became my boss.  So my former professor became my boss.  We had very good times.  I stayed with the company another two years, a total of four years.
Story_ID: 226312
Speaker 1: I left to become executive director of an organization known as PEDCO; P-E-D-C-O, standing for Presbyterian Economic Development Corporation.  It was set up by the Presbyterian Church with a fund of nine million dollars from loans to minority entrepreneurs; women, Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and so forth; loans, not grants.  It was my job to receive proposals from companies all over the country for different--proposed ventures.  There was a group of Indians out in Arizona.  They had a toy making company, which I think exists today.  There were a couple of black women in Cleveland [Ohio] who had a printing business in the basement of one of their homes, and they were printing graduation programs and all sort of things.  They applied for a fifty thousand dollar loan.  I think they got it.  It was your father that helped me in that job, by the way.  He would look at the report, 'cause he has business acumen, and I didn't have business training.  So I said, "Gee.  What do you think of this proposal?"  He said, "Well, I think it's pretty good."  We presented it to the board, and the board would say "Okay."  And they get the money.  I think the most outstanding proposal I ever had to deal with was a group of black farmers in Mississippi near a town called West Point [Mississippi], which is not far from Philadelphia [Mississippi], where the three civil rights--were lynched; Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Chaney, the black one.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were all lynched and buried in the dam.   But I got this proposal.  It was where these farmers had put--under the leadership of a black minister at Mary Holmes Junior College [Mary Holmes College, West Point, Mississippi], which was near where--West Point, Mississippi, in the eastern border of Mississippi.  And I got this proposal, and Gene [Eugene Merriday, Sr.] said, "I think that looks pretty good.  You ought to take a look at it."  So I went down there and checked in at the college.  I met Reverend Clifton [ph.] something or other, and he said, "Oh, I'll give you a tour of the ponds," that these farmers had pooled all of the land they owned--had had pits--they're not pits, but like a shallow pond--on their property and staffed them with fingerling catfish; baby catfish.  Your dad will remember this as a good project.  And they were going to--after the catfish had grown, they'd slaughter them in a slaughterhouse and sell the catfish to companies who were making fish sticks.  That was a growing industry.  It was growing rapidly.  So I went down there and I talked to Reverend Clifton something or other, and met some of the farmers.  I looked at the land where they had these little fishes swimming around.  I went back home and recommended that it be funded.  And I think they'd asked for $150,000, which they got.
Story_ID: 226313
Speaker 1: After I left there [Presbyterian Economic Development Corporation (PEDCO)] to go to Jamaica--as I mentioned to you, I lived there for three years--and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were you the assistant to the president in Jamaica?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Were you the assistant to the president in Jamaica?
Speaker 1: No.  I was assistant to the president of a travel company called Martin's Jamaica [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not the president of the company.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I did get to know the prime minister.  He's now prime minister.  P. J. Patterson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was then the minister of tourism.  But, so--oh, I after I left PEDCO and came--visited the guy who succeeded me, Dave Liston [ph.], and I said, "Dave, tell me, whatever happened to the catfish farm?"  He said, "Chuck [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden]," he said, "--it's too sad.  A hurricane, I've forgotten which one, came through the area, flooded the area, and all the catfish babies swam out to sea."  And that was the end of the project.  And it had such promise.  It was heartbreaking.  But there were--some of the Indians [Native Americans] had a toy making thing that I told you about, there was a group of young blacks out in California.  They thought they could have a restaurant, high-class restaurant.  And they applied for $150,000, and they got it.  Went out there to examine it and found out that the president of the organization had bought himself a brand-new Cadillac.  They had a restaurant with pine walls and so forth, and they were trying to live like people who had been successful after being in business for years, and they gonna start at the top.  So there were a few like that.  What did they call their business?  "It's a Black Thang."  T-H-A-N-G.  Something like that (laughter).  There were some jive turkeys, but there were some good ones.  Your dad will tell you about some of those, 'cause he had to work with the inner workings of the proposal; some of them were good, some of them just jive turkey.

Speaker 1: And so when you left Jamaica, what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: When I left Jamaica, I came back to the [United] States, and I worked for a while with, excuse me, an agency in Brooklyn [New York, New York] that was dealing with people addicted to--was it coke?  Anyway, the--methadone was the medicine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The heroin.
Speaker 2: --to get them off of the habit.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I loved what I was doing, working with these former addicts--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and visiting them and "Don't ever let anybody tell you you're a junkie.  You're not a junkie.  The very fact that you made a mistake and you've gotten into a habit which is hard for you to break, but you're making an effort to get out of it.  You're better (unclear) than I am.  You've been there and you're trying to get out.  I've never been there."  So--don't ever--and I loved the work.  And every now and then we'd lose one in overdose.  But then on the other hand, we'd have three or four of them come out of it and be successful, with teachers and whatever.  And that was much of a joy.  Well, here in Atlanta [Georgia], with that project in New York [New York], it's a sort of a beacon and a guide.  Various cities around the country, including Atlanta, ones that have somewhat similar programs.  And here in Atlanta, they have--they're starting a program which would deal, not with drug addicts, but with mothers, single parents households with children between six and eighteen; something like that, and alcoholics.  Those are the two targets or populations.  And it so happened that when I got the notice, I came down for an interview.  I was accepted.  And then when I was getting ready to put a staff together, and I think I told you--or have I told you--the person I wanted to be my comptroller, handle the funds, was your father?  Because when we worked together in New York, I became so convinced in his security mindedness and his integrity that if something new was coming up in the area--forgot what it was--and he knew about it, I knew about it.  And then later on, I met your mother socially somewhere, and she had never heard anything about this particular--
Story_ID: 226315
Speaker 1: You were talking about the loans [through the Presbyterian Economic Development Corporation (PEDCO)], going through the process of the job after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Well, the little fishes swam out to sea, and that was the end of the program. I haven't heard much more about it.  Gene [Merriday, Sr.] had left early to come south.  And he became a loan officer, I think, at Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia].  And I've had an account there ever since I came here [Atlanta, Georgia].  And it was from that agency that I was fired because I kept insisting I want him on my safe.  "Can't have him."  "I want him."  "You can't have him."  "I want him."  "You're fired" (laughter).  And we've remained friends ever since.  I never quite put it to him this way, I would say, "You know, Gene, because of my friendship with you I got fired from my first job."  But as it turned out, it was fortuitous because about year or two years later, that particular agency folded, the funding stopped.  In the meanwhile, I had gotten a job at Lockheed [Martin], which lasted for thirteen years.  So as is often happened in my life, it turns out that what seemed to be a cloud was the best thing ever happened, my being fired.  That was the best thing.  I didn't believe it at the time, but that's the way it turned out.
Speaker 1: Wow.  And you spent thirteen years at Lockheed.  What were you doing while you were there?
Speaker 2: I was in personnel.  They used to call it personnel and now call it human relations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my role was being a sort of a consultant to two groups of employees:  one, salaried people who wanted to be promoted in their particular skill area, what advice I would have for them and so forth, more schooling or whatever.  And the other group of people was those who were waged, hourly employees, who wanted to know how to get in to become a salaried person.  My advice to them was based mainly upon what I had observed in the operations of the company.  It was like a closed, almost like a clique. Those who had been with the company when it started back in early 1950s and had been there, some of them.  One man was a department--was a division manager, and he hadn't finished high school.  And there were some people who came to me for advice and guidance who had--one person was a couple subjects away from a Ph.D.  A lot of well-educated people, but just weren't able to hit the right chord, you might say.  And I had a couple of young black men who came to me for advice.  Both of them M.B.A.s.  "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Lieutenant Colonel Charles] Dryden, what do we have to do to get ahead in this company?  We're ambitious and we know we got the smarts.  What do we do?"  I said, "The best thing you can do, brothers, is to leave now.  Don't hang around here until you reach the point of no return, where you've invested so much time that you can't afford to leave, even though you're not going any further than the ceiling.  So don't do that.  Leave and find a company where you'll have a much more unlimited opportunity for advancement and put your skills there.  Don't stay here."  I often wondered if my office was wired.  I'll put it this way:  there was a group of disgruntled employees, and they were seeking advice from three or four other blacks with the company.  And we used to meet off the grounds on Saturdays, and we would tell them about who to trust, who not to trust, what to do and not to do, and so forth.  And seven of them, there were five of them--three young men and three black women, who were in a management training program.  And I'd met Gordan [ph.] just the other day, and he's still there, and he's doing pretty well as things go.
Story_ID: 226316
Speaker 1: But I always emphasized my own integrity.  I'm gonna tell you like it is.  I'm not gonna tell you a lie.  If I have to leave, you know--in fact, that's one of the reasons I left Pepsi-Cola [PepsiCo], because there were limited, very limited, great limits on opportunities for the general run of people.  Mr. [Harvey C.] Russell [Jr.] and Mr. [H. Naylor] Fitzhugh had gotten to be vice presidents, but they--those were few and far between.  But there were qualified people all over the place.  And so I resigned to take this other job with PEDCO [Presbyterian Economic Development Corporation].  But I was glad to go, because as I left I wrote a letter saying, "I'm not happy with what I've seen here in four years."  So I'm glad to say that I've always been able to face myself, look in the mirror and say, "Well, you're true to yourself," because I can't stand hypocrisy.  I mean, if I'm gonna have to give up my own self-respect in order to (unclear), the hell with it.  There's nothing more important to me than to be able to say to myself "You're a nice guy.  I like you" (laughter).  I can't contemplate having to think about myself, say, "You're a son-of-a-bitch."  And I've met some people who are just that.  They would sell their grandmother for a dollar.  I could never do that.
Story_ID: 226317
Speaker 1: And so, when did you begin writing the 'A-Train[:Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman', Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden]?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: When did you begin writing your first book, the 'A-Train'?
Speaker 2: I started at 1889--1989.  There was a professor of history.  You may even know him or know about him.  He was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  His name is Dr. Maceo [Crenshaw] Dailey [Jr.].  He's not there anymore.  He left about six, seven years ago.  He's head of the African American studies program at the University of Texas [at El Paso] in El Paso [Texas].  And--but he was at Spelman at the time, and he had me speak to the students one time.  And when I was through, he said to me, "Well, [HistoryMaker Lieutenant] Colonel [Charles Dryden], when are you going to write your memoirs?"  "One of these days."  He said, "Tomorrow is not promised to anyone.  So you better get started."  So then he made me a proposition I couldn't refuse.  He said, "To go from my house to my office on campus at Spelman, Charles Hall, I pass your house.  My wife is on the staff at Spelman, and our little boy (unclear) and he goes to the elementary school around the corner from Spelman.  So we will bring the family car by your door, pick you up, take you to the campus, feel free to use my office with all the reference books.  It's a history office.  You know how to use a computer?"  I said, "No."  I thought that was my out.  "That's no excuse.  I'll teach you."  Which he did.  WordPerfect 3.5, I think.  Whatever it is.  He taught me how to use it.  I had written one or two chapters in longhand in the few years before that.  And my first exercise was to transcribe from my written work to the computer.  After about a week or two of that, I got my--I'd learned my way around the keyboard.  And so then it became fun.  And I started composing after chapter one and two, I'm on new ground.  I had to translate my thoughts into new chapters.  And so it went for a year and half until it was finished.  He would, excuse me, take me to his office bright in the morning, he'd go by his class or whatever; his wife would go to her office, and he'd drop the little boy off at elementary school.  And I was there working like a monk in a monastery.  Five o'clock would come, he'd collect his family, go home, I'm still working at the keyboard 'til about eleven o'clock at night, and I'd call my wife [Marymal Dryden] and say, "Okay.  Baby, come get me."  She'd come pick me up.  And next morning--if it was a weekday, next morning, eight o'clock, (unclear) go.  And that went on for a year and a half 'till it was finally finished.  And then came the job of finding a publisher.  Now, my wife had given me a book called the 'Writer's Market' [ph.] when I started doing the book.  You familiar with it?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: Okay.  And finally, of course, I learned a lot of things, especially in the section one where they teach you about the protocol, the formatting of a manuscript to get the publisher to accept it and publish it; the margins and all that sort of thing.  You don't submit a handwritten manuscript unless you're an Ernest Hemingway.  And if it's typed, it's got to be double-spaced and all the rest of the margins and all that kind of thing.  So I sent courier letters to thirty publishers, and I got twenty-nine rejects.  "Nice try, but we're not doing that," or whatever, except for the University of Alabama Press in Tuscaloosa [Alabama].  The then director said, "Sounds interesting.  Send us sample chapters," and so forth, which I did.  "We really liked that.  Send us a completed manuscript," which I did.  He had to go through his reviewing panel, and then he had two--what should I say--neutral readers to read it in turn; first one would give me his marginal comments about suggested changes; the second one, and so on--after the first one sent it back to me, to (unclear) make any changes I thought I would accept, and then to the second one.  But the director told me, "Mr. Dryden, remember, that's your book.  That's your voice.  Don't let anybody--they can change little things, grammatical spellings and so forth, but it's your voice.  Don't let anybody speak for you."  And I remembered that.  And finally, it was accepted all the way around.  And they published it--they first published it in April 22nd of 1997.  So it's been out seven and a half years.
Story_ID: 226318
Speaker 1: And you spent the past couple of years in numerous cities doing talks about the book ['A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman,' Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden].  What has that been like?
Speaker 2: Talking about the book?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I mentioned to you that my third book is going to be--I still have to make (unclear).  Thank God, I'm able.  And I was going to do the second one about 'On the Road and in the Air with A-Train,' but I had to get this other one first.  My days may be limited, I don't know.  But the third one, 'On the Road and in the Air with A-Train,' I'm gonna to be relating some very interesting things.  First of all, the two people, two interviews, two book signings that I had were very interesting, heartwarming.  First of all, I had a four-city tour in upstate New York, the year the book came out.  Hit Buffalo [New York], Rochester [New York], Syracuse [New York], and Albany [New York], the state capital.  In Buffalo, the mayor gave me this watch with the seal of the city on it.  The next thing was Rochester.  I was on a radio broadcast and over the telephone link where listeners can call into the station and ask questions of the interviewee.  There came over the radio a very heavy German accented voice that said, "[HistoryMaker Lieutenant] Colonel [Charles] Dryden, I'm one of your former enemies."  I didn't know whether this Nazi was gonna start talking about Aryan superiority and what have you. But that's not what he said.  What he said was, "My squadron mates and I in the Luftwaffe could never figure out why it was we were never able to shoot down a bomber that you Red Tails--" we painted the tails of our airplane red "--were escorting.  You had to be the best."  Now, I was not quick with it enough to realize that I must get a copy of that tape to prove that a former German Nazi thought we were the best that they ever encountered.  Some years later, about three years ago, I called my friend, who was my host in Rochester, Ronnie Good [ph.].  "Ronnie, you remember--" he was in the studio "--you remember that time?"  He said, "I sure do."  I said, "Ronnie, do you think that station might still have that tape?"  He said, "I'll try."  So about a month later, he said, "Well, I tried, but they discarded it.  They have so many tapes, broadcast and so forth."  So that was a lost opportunity to have something for archives.  But he did say to me--a couple of months ago, he said, "I think I can get the station manager, he's still there, to sign an affidavit saying that he heard a former Nazi say how good we were."  The second incident happened in El Paso, Texas.  I was having a book signing at Fort Bliss, and I was in the BX [Base Exchange] signing books, and up to the table came a white guy looked to be about my age.  He had on an [U.S.] Air Force cap, and he said to me, "Were you one of the Red Tails?"  And I says, "Yeah."  He started to cry, the tears started coming down his cheek.  And explained to me that one day on a mission over Vienna [Austria], he had--his airplane was (unclear).  He was flying a [Consolidated] B-24 [Liberator].  And they were straggling.  They couldn't keep up with the formation going home.  The rest of the bombers had dropped all their bombs and so forth.  But they couldn't keep up.  They had two engines shot out, something like that.  So they were in trouble.  So the airplane's commander started calling, "Mayday.  Mayday.  Help.  Help."  And a few minutes he said it.  Out of the (unclear) came two Red Tails; one on each side, escorted him all the way home safely to their base in Italy.  He said, "If it hadn't been for you men from Tuskegee [Army Flying School, Tuskegee, Alabama] who saved our lives, I wouldn't be sitting here today.  I wouldn't have had children and grandchildren.  And so our family owe you men from Tuskegee our past, our present, our future."  And at that point, I started to cry (laughter).  It was so touching to have him put it that way, that his whole family's future depended on the fact that we did what we did.  And, of course, we had the unmatched record that in two hundred escort missions, we never, never, never lost a bomber because that we escorted them.  Because every time we lost one, you lost ten American lives, whether it's B-29s [Boeing B-29 Superfortress] or B-24s.  He had a pilot, copilot, navigator, bombardier, and gunners at the top, underneath and (unclear) in the nose.  So, we were never guilty of being the cause of any American crew members losing their lives in a bomber.  So those are two of the things that I'm gonna talk about in that book.
Story_ID: 226319
Speaker 1: An interesting one, I think you'll find interesting, in the outskirts of Baltimore [Maryland], I had a book signing [for 'A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman,' Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden] at a Barnes & Noble, and there was a sister, a young woman in her late twenties, black lady.  And when the questions were over, everybody left, she said, "[HistoryMaker Lieutenant] Colonel [Charles Dryden], I have a question maybe you can answer."  "I'll try."  "Did the Tuskegee Airmen ever get over the syphilis?"  I said, "God help me with this one?"  And I said, "Now, sister--" I said, "--there were two experiments involving black men around the time in the '30s [1930s], 1930 in the geographical area of Tuskegee [Alabama].  One of them involved about four hundred black men who had syphilis, who were as guinea pigs not treated at all medically by the VA [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] doctors to see if any would survive without medication; and those who died, how much they would suffer before they perish and so forth.  There was, at Tuskegee beginning in 1940, '41 [1941], a group of black American men who became the first pilots in the United States Army Air Corps.  Two different men altogether.  It couldn't have been us with syphilis, 'cause if we had any kind of illness, we could not have gotten in the program.  So please make that difference."  And she said, "Thanks for telling me."  The thing about it is, if she, knowing about the two experiments and made the misapprehension was one and the same group, how many thousands of people who've seen 'Miss Evers' Boys', which was the Tuskegee Airmen--I mean, the story about the men with syphilis, the main leader which was Laurence Fishburne; and the HBO movie, '[The] Tuskegee Airmen,' the main leader which was Laurence Fishburne.
Speaker 2: Laurence Fishburne.
Speaker 1: So it's understandable that she put the two together and said, "Oh, it was the Tuskegee Airmen had--."  No.  No.  No.  So it's things like that.  Then the last (unclear) had a girl who'll tell you this, it's a positive one.  I had an aunt who died year before last in Miami [Florida], and I went down for the funeral.  On the way home at the Miami International Airport [Miami, Florida], I was sitting in the gateway; gotten there early, so there was nobody else sitting there but me.  From behind me into the area came the captain of the aircraft, four stripes on his sleeve.  He was a brother, a black man.  He didn't see me at first.  He walked up to the counter, and I watched him and I smiled as I showed him four stripes.  And after he checked in and reported "I'm the pilot" and so and so, he turned around and he saw me, and his (unclear) face lit up with a smile, 'cause I had my cap, says Tuskegee.  He came over to me, he extended his hand.  We shook hands and I told him, "I'm so glad to see you brother," and so forth.  He said to me, "On my airplane, you fly first class," 'cause I was coach.  And he had space in first class.  So he upgraded me on the spot.  And I was in a wheelchair, so they wheeled me down to the site of the airplane and into the airplane.  The first flight attendant I saw was a sister.  The second was a sister.  The third was a sister.  So the only white person on the airplane was the copilot.  Well, I'm a mischievous person.  I had to have my little jokes.  So after they got the airplane started, got in the air, and the flight crew began doing their thing, I punched the button for assistance.  So, the sister came up and she said, "May I help you, sir?"  I said, "Sister, what is that white boy doing on our airplane?" And she fell out (laughter).  But it's things like that.  I've had a number of heartwarming experiences, and I'm gonna write a book about them.
Story_ID: 226320
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to add to the interview, something perhaps that I didn't ask?
Speaker 2: No.  I think you've covered the ground between my retiring from the [U.S.] Air Force, and forty-two years later here I am at eighty-four; especially what I've said about this book about 'Thank God, I'm Not Young Anymore,' and the reason for it.  The good--maybe I didn't explain enough of that, and it'll take a moment.  It's gonna have three sections:  the good, the bad, the ugly.  In discussing that format with my wife [Marymal Dryden], she said, "Well, that all sounds sort of pessimistic.  Don't you see any hope in the world and in the future?"  'Cause she's a number one optimist.  She forced me to think about it.  And when I thought about it, I had (unclear) yeah, there's--it's hope in the world.  There are a lot of good people in the world of the younger generation; people who, as parents or adults, show that they have compassion, humanity, regard for others, and a sense of responsibility for raising children.  Unfortunately, a lot of their peers don't.  Newsweek magazine has this article, current issue, the cover, "How to Say No to Your Children."  There are a lot of people who have children, don't know how to say no.  And every child needs to be told, "You can't do that.  You must not do that.  You will not do that."  But on the other hand, there are some who--so I had to add the hope.  And it was really reinforced when I had the stroke three and a half years ago.  Whenever I go out on my cane, as you see me, or when I'm in a wheelchair and I'm going into a store or coming from the supermarket, people will rush to empty my basket or open the doors for me; all sorts of things.  "Can I help you?"  And that really enforces the hope.  But I'm just hoping that those decent people, the numbers of them, begin to catch up with and outnumber the knuckleheads who are in this world.
Story_ID: 226321
Speaker 1: Now I don't know if I, I don't think I explained to you the introduction to my 'Thank God, I'm Not Young Anymore.'
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Go like this, and this is my last anecdote.  One beautiful Indian summer day, and it actually happened in 2001, but I'm gonna--I created, but this actually happened.  The telephone rang in our home in Atlanta [Georgia].  Being close to the phone, my wife [Marymal Dryden] picked up the receiver, flipped on the loudspeaker switch and said very cheerfully, "Good afternoon.  Dryden residence."  The caller said, "Ma'am, my company is conducting a survey and" --and she interrupted, and she said, "excuse me, sir, for interrupting you, but I don't know your first name.  And I don't believe you know me on a first-name basis, so I most prefer if you'd address me as Mrs. Dryden.  Okay?"  He said, "Fuck you," and hung up.  That's my second (unclear).  That's what made me think I have got to write this book about what is happening to--that would never have happened with one of my peers.  Never.  And to bring it up to date, two months ago, three months ago, Time magazine reported a little five year old said to his teacher, "Oh, shut up, bitch."  What?  No.  I can't live in that kind of world.  I don't know how to live in a world like that.  I had problems with my first son [Charles Dryden, Jr.].  He's sixteen, seventeen.  And he'd showed disrespect for his grandmother, my mother-in-law, my former wife.  He had taken the one television we had and put it in his room when his two little [Kevin Dryden and Eric Dryden] brothers were watching '[The] Rootie Kazootie [Club]' or some show that they were looking at.  He just took it and put it in his room, closed the door.  So his grandmother, my mother-in-law, reported to me that he had been very disrespectful to her and to the little boys.  So I called him and I said, "Thumper--" his nickname was Thumper, his name is Charles Walter, Jr.  I said, "Let me hear your side of the story."  He said, "Well, I just wanted to watch a program and we only have one television, so I thought I'd put it in my room."  I said, "Tell you what you do, son.  You go get--." He's seventeen or eighteen. I said, "I want you to go in the attic and get the biggest suitcase you can find.  Fill it with all of your favorite clothes and you get the hell out of here.  You cannot live here and disrespect anyone; your brothers, your grandma, anyone.  So there's no place for you here.  Get out of here."  His jaws were filling--well, he was snorting like a horse.  He filled a suitcase, he left.  It was a January and it was bitter cold outside up in [New] Jersey.  So as soon as he left us, I started praying.  I said, "Lord, take care of my son."  Three hours later, he came back.  His face was wind burned, he was frosted and stuff.  I said, "Okay.  You're ready to obey."  He said, "Yeah, Dad."  I said, "What made you decide to come home?"  He said, "Well, Dad, I only had ten dollars with me, and I went to Keyport [New Jersey]--" which is about two--he had to walk to Keyport, "--and found out that the night was fifteen dollars a night, I only had ten dollars; but tomorrow I was gonna be hungry, I wouldn't have a place to stay.  So it's not so bad at home after all."  And he and I are just like this (gestures).  He called me just last week to wish me a happy birthday.  He's a father.  His son, my grandson, early thirties, and he was a Marine [U.S. Marine Corps] in the first Gulf War.  Fine young man.  The point I'm making is--this is the end of it--you gotta pass it on from generation to generation, and maybe it will become again a world in which people can live.  But it's getting worse, and not just limited to one person, one country.  What's going on now worldwide is horrifying.  It's horrifying.  I hate to read the news about twenty-two more people were killed.  Man head--beheaded on--what?  I'm glad I'm not young anymore.  I'm glad.  And I hope none of my children, boys or girls, 'cause we now have women in the [U.S.] military, are gonna be caught up in--it's an awful world.  Awful. I don't know how much longer the Creator is going to allow this to go on.  Last time he got annoyed, he flooded the world (laughter).  He came close with these hurricanes.  But when it was over, no one saw a rainbow, which was a protocol that says "I'm not gonna do this again.  But don't make me mad.  I could do worse."  And James Baldwin wrote a book that said, 'The Fire Next Time.' Maybe that's what we're heading toward.  I don't know.  But I won't be here.  I won't be here.
Story_ID: 226322
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: A book has been published called 'Faith Under Fire[: Stories of Hope and Courage from World War II,' Steve Rabey].  I have copies here.  About fifteen people were interviewed for it, and it's a chapter in each one.  And at the end of chapter on myself, I'm asked the same question.  I want to be remembered by the fact that I put emphasis on raising children to be responsible, caring adults.  And that's about the size of it.  That's what I want to be remembered as a person who always was concerned about the welfare, the care and feeding and raising of children.  That's my greatest--all the medals and all the stuff, that don't mean nothing.  And all of that (gestures), that's fine.  But when I lay all those trophies down, I want to be able to--I want to hear people say, "He was a nice guy.  He did a good job.  I liked him."  That's what I want.
Speaker 1: I'd like to thank you for being so gracious with your time.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: And just--the life that you led in general that's brought us to the point where we have to make sure that you are remembered and revered in our history and culture.

Speaker 1: All right, sir.  If you could tell us who is in this photo and where and when it was taken?
Speaker 2: About this picture?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Just give us a quick description.  Tell us who is in the photo.
Speaker 2: I'll give you some statistics, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad [Charles Dryden], born February 3rd, 1899.  I'm sorry, 1889.  Yeah, 1889.  And I don't recall the date of his death.  That's why I was asking about your questionnaire.  You know, I provided dates and you can get that from--in there.  My mother [Violet Buckley Dryden], born June 30th, 1891.  And I don't recall what--I think she died April 8th--I'll get it from Jodi's [Jodi Merriday] notes.  They were born both in Jamaica.  My mother in Kingston, Jamaica; and my father in St. Thomas Parish, Jamaica.  In this country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --was December 29th and they met--they were married in 1919.  So that had to be in 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Great.
Speaker 2: This was taken in Scottsdale, Arizona; the outskirts of Phoenix [Arizona].  It must have been--let's see.  It was taken--it must have been in 1978.  Or maybe it's about two years--no, '79 [1979]--two years after my book ['A-Train: Memoirs of A Tuskegee Airman,' Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden] came out, which was 1997.  So this would be 1999.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me just tell you a quick thing about that picture.  I had a book signing here in Atlanta [Georgia], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me know when you're done.
Speaker 2: I will.  A description of this photo?
Speaker 1: A teacher at [The] Paideia School [Atlanta, Georgia], which is a middle school here in Atlanta, had given her students a project to write a paper.  So this little black boy decided to write about Tuskegee Airmen.  So his parents had bought a copy of the book, and when he turned in his paper, he loaned that copy of the book to the teacher.  She says--she wrote a letter that she was very casually leafing through the book and came on my picture.  She said, "Oh, my God.  That's my father."  The general is her father, Mr. Templeton [ph.] (laughter).  And so she was very intrigued by the fact that her father was pictured in a person's autobiography.  And she had come by it quite by accident.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Great.  Next photo.  That's horizontal.
Speaker 1: Well, can I ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Try to (unclear) the picture both side to side in all instances.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's my family: mother, father, brother [Denis Dryden] and sister [Pauline Dryden Miles].  You know, when I was court martialed, my sister, who was then thirteen, she wrote a letter to President [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt saying, "Please don't put my brother out of the [U.S.] Army."
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And that letter has been found at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Wow.  Okay.  We got it.  Next.
Speaker 1: Now, let me see if it's '69 [1969].  I was a happy camper.  I had made it.  This is--I am now a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps, as it was (unclear).  And then, contrast, that was when I was twenty-two--not quite twenty-two, as second lieutenant.  In the last picture I want to suggest is just before I retired as lieutenant colonel.  And it's just before the picture of the general and myself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Next.
Speaker 1: --when I was lieutenant clonel.  My captain, who was the commander of the ground school, Captain Roy Matthews.  I have to think of that.  I'm in the middle and the one on the right was killed in combat.  The other two are both from Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Great.  Next.
Speaker 1: Let's see if we can get the picture.
Speaker 2: You just want to give a quick description on this one?  Different time period?  Go ahead, sir, if you want to say anything about this one.
Speaker 1: (No audible response).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: Did you have anything to say about that picture?
Speaker 2: That picture?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The end of a career shows, and all--and hopefully wiser--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --officer (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  I'm going to go towards the front.  Now, you remember they're being just one (unclear).  Oh, wow.  You wrote a letter to the president of your--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I am proud of that.  Yeah.  I was proud of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Go ahead, please.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Wait.  No, no.  That's for him to go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Next photo means pull it.  Okay.  Sir, go ahead.  Do you have comments for this one?
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: Did you have something you want to tell us about this photo?
Speaker 2: About that one?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Just in training to be a pilot before going to the United States Army Air Corps.  In other words, Civilian Pilot Training [Program] picture.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next photo.
Speaker 2: And then there's the high--junior high school [I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt Junior High School, New York, New York].  And there are four blacks in that class.  And I was elected by my classmates to be president.  So it was the first opportunity I had to learn something about leadership.  And you know, as a result of that picture--I'll just tell you this--I told you earlier I had to learn how to talk my way out of a situation.  I never was much of a fighter or boxer or what have you.  So one day, another class at the junior high school was merged with my class, 'cause their teacher was away for something.  So in that class was somebody from my neighborhood whose name was Arnold Malliat [ph.].  And he was a bad dude.  He could fight and so forth.  So he was making a lot of noise in the back of the room.  I said, "Why don't you be quiet."  "You gonna make me?  I'll see you at lunch."  Oh, God.  Everybody knew he could put lumps on anybody's head.  But I couldn't back out of it.  I was gonna take my lumps.  So at lunchtime, my gut is just (unclear).  I don't enjoy being hurt, but I had to fight.  So they formed a circle and we started duking.  And I threw a punch (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You might want to (unclear) while you're talking.  Oh, you were saying you threw a punch?
Speaker 2: I threw a punch and my hand wasn't quite closed in a fist.  So my nail must have scratched his eye.  And he went like that, and what he do that for.  I was all over him, just like a tornado.  And after a while, he said, "I quit.  I quit.  You're the best."  That made my reputation.  Everybody knew that Arnold Malliat was a bad mister, and I had made him (unclear).  Okay.  So people were saying, "That Charlie Dryden [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden] may look quiet, but he beat Arnold Malliat."  That's not the end of the story.  Years later, about twelve, thirteen years ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --my stepson, Tony [ph.], Marymal [Dryden]'s middle son, said (unclear), "Dad, you got you some visitors at the kitchen."  So I came, "Well, what's his name."  "Arnold Malliat."
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.
Speaker 2: And I had told my family the story about Arnold Malliat.  So Tony said to me, "Dad, you don't suppose (pause)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Go ahead and go to--give us a description for this one, please.
Speaker 2: A description of this one?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is the original photograph of the original pilots of the 99th Fighter Squadron.  And I don't think you want all the names.  But our commanding officer is--at that point he was Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.; born famous as the son of the first black general [General Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.] in the Army, United States Army and--the first general, and the son who graduated from West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], and in four years at the military academy, he had no roommate.  He was totally segregated.  All the other cadets had roommates except him.  And nobody spoke to him except on official business.  They tried to break his spirit and get him to quit, but he didn't.  He made it.  And he later rose through the rank, while he was alive, to the rank of three-star general; the first black person to do that.  And before he died on the Fourth of July 2002, President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton promoted him to the rank of four-star general in a ceremony near the White House [Washington, D.C.] on December 8, 1998.  So he died as a four-star general.
