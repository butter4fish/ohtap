Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted by [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden, and the videographer is Scott Stearns.  The interview is being held at 1207 Addison Road, Capitol Heights, Maryland.  And the date is November 8, 2006.  Madam HistoryMaker, would you give me your full name and would you spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: Thank you.  My name, my birth name, Georgette Seabrooke and Powell [HistoryMaker Georgette Seabrooke Powell] is my marriage name.  It was, in fact, it was Georgette Ernestine--Ernestine was my godmother, and Seabrooke, my maiden name.
Speaker 1: When were you born and where?
Speaker 2: I was born August 2, 1916 in Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Charleston, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, very good.  And how would you describe your profession?  What have you done over your lifetime?  How do you, how do you--what has been your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's been rather varied in that as a young person I aspired to be an artist, and I was able to use my talent and, during the Depression [Great Depression] years, and du- as a muralist and later as a--became a domestic life.  I married and have three children.  And later I resumed my artistic career and decided that I wanted to do something in the arts to earn a living (laughter).  So I became an art therapist for a while in my later years.
Speaker 1: Art therapist?
Speaker 2: Art therapist, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was at, it was a kind of a thing that started to surface back in the 1960s in which the organization was made up.  And there are many, many art therapists whose--and they call themselves registered art therapists.  That's members of this group.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm very interested in the art therapy that you did, and we're gonna talk about that later.
Speaker 2: All right, yeah.
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about that, very interested in that aspect and how you trained to become an art therapist.
Story_ID: 378124
Speaker 1: Before we talk about your family history and your growing up years, we have five, kind of warm-up questions--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --like People magazine questions, okay--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which will give the viewers of your interview of your interview another slant on your personality.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So can I ask you, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite, what?
Speaker 1: Food.
Speaker 2: Mood?
Speaker 1: Food.  Food (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Food--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.  (Laughter) Well, I'd say having been born in Charleston, South Carolina, the favorite foods were rice, okra, gumbo, chicken and fish (laughter) and those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And mac- . Yeah, macaroni and cheese, things of that kind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I--gee, that's a hard one.  I think--well, I like blue and the violets and the greens.  I like those kind of colors, muted colors and some bright colors.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite season?  What is your favorite season of the year?
Speaker 2: Well, favorite season, I think it's more towards spring because at least you get, there's more light as far as getting around is concerned and going into summer which is usually hot.  It hasn't been for the past couple of years, but I think spring is a good time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have or have you had in the past, a favorite vacation destination, a favorite place you like to go for vacation?
Speaker 2: Oh, I really don't think so.  It seems as though the places that I've visited, it sort of happened like surprise visits and, you know, you go to see folks out of town and friends and so forth when you're quite young.  And that was very nice.  You know, as a child, I went--my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] sent me to Rochester [New York] and that was a bit different, having been, having settled in New York City [New York, New York].  And as I grew older and met more people and my travels did expand to the point of being able to travel overseas in other countries.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite saying?  Do you have a favorite saying or something that you like to share with people?
Speaker 2: You know, I really, I don't think so.  I couldn't--at the moment I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: All right, yeah.  You'll probably come across it as we talk, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, (laughter) thank you.
Story_ID: 378125
Speaker 1: We wanna talk a little about, a little bit about your family background, your family history--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --so that people who look at your interview will understand your roots and where you came from and how you came to be the artist that you were.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: And so we'd like to talk first about your mother.  I wanna ask you about your mother.  Would you tell me your mother's name and the year she was born and where she was born?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I see.  I was trying to--that's very interesting because I recently met a genealogist who's going to get all of the family history of the South Carolinians and so he's done a bit of delving into my father [George Seabrooke] and mother about the time, how old they were at certain times when I was born.  And I believe we've come up with, my mother was, I think she was thirty-seven when I was born.  It was an interesting type of--she had been married before and not, did not have a child.  And she was a widow when she met my father who was a bachelor.  So they got married (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did they meet?
Speaker 2: I don't know, except that they're both from Charleston, South Carolina originally.  And I think they had traveled a bit, like to New York and different other places.
Speaker 1: Okay, give me your mother's name.  What was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Anna Simmons [Anna Simmons Seabrooke].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, that's her maiden name, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she grew up in Charleston.  In fact, she talks, she talked about her mother dying at an early age, and then her father remarrying a lady who she said, she spoke French more of the time.  And, of course, and she was quite strict with her.  So her--it turned out to be, I believe now that I know more about backgrounds of other folks, maybe her mother, her stepmother was a Haitian lady.  And she was a strict Catholic.  So my mother, you know, she saw that she went to church and so forth, and so I think when I was young I had the pleasure of meeting this lady because she too moved to New York and lived in downtown New York [New York] for a number of years before she passed on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 378126
Speaker 1: And what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was George, George Edward Seabrooke [George Seabrooke], and it's very interesting at that time because people used to say George W. Seabrooke, George Edward Seabrooke.  Of course, I don't think they wanted to be George Washington but anyway, it's George Edward.  And he apparently was one of four sons.  And their father [John Seabrooke] was the role model of the family, I think, in fact, according to my historical facts, he was a dock worker, and he worked hard and saved his pennies.  And they made fun of him saving his pennies.  But he accumulated enough to buy several pieces of property in Charleston, South Carolina and see that his sons had businesses of their own.  And he didn't want 'em to work for white men, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father grew up in Charleston also?
Speaker 2: To my knowledge, yeah.  Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Did he ever tell you any stories about his growing up years?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, that--no.  The only--well, the kinds of things I sort of associate him with, there were certain folks like young people at the time of his growing up and they moved to New York [New York].  And you've heard of someone like Ed Smalls who opened up Small's Paradise up in Harlem [New York, New York].  And then there was one by the name of (unclear) [ph.] and there's some--there are some other names too.  And they were all associated with each other at a certain time of their life.  And they tried to maintain their, their relationship when they grew--when they moved to New York from South Carolina.
Story_ID: 378127
Speaker 1: When did they leave--when did they move from Charleston [South Carolina] to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Well, you know, it's interesting.  Permanently, I would feel that it would have been at the time that I--after I was born and when I--I think I was about six years old.  And they decided to make a permanent move.
Speaker 1: You were six years old?
Speaker 2: Yes, because I know--in my memoirs I have a picture of my father [George Seabrooke].  And, of course, he had a--in a restaurant on King Street, and that's on--it's, so, you know, this-- his brother.
Speaker 1: Where was the restaurant?
Speaker 2: King Street, main, main street in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Charleston?
Speaker 2: --Charleston, South Carolina, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, he had a restaurant.
Speaker 2: And there was another one in (unclear).  And then the father [John Seabrooke], he had one, a restaurant down to Market Street, which, of course, they grew in to be prominent parts of Charleston, South Carolina.  I, I think too that what prompted them to want to move is the fact that, I, for some reason or other, I think my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] was concerned about my health and so forth.  And she thought it would be better for me to live more north.  And, of course, it's not that they were fortunate enough to have a lot of money, that they did, get to make the move, and we were able to move to New York City and Yorkville section which is mid-Manhattan [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were about six years old then when you moved?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that move at all?  Do you have any memories of the move or--
Speaker 2: I--well, I don't remember the move exactly.  I think in looking back, I know too, like I don't know whether it was before we made that final move or not.  But I do--I think it might have been before then I might have traveled to see my mother's friend who lived in Rochester [New York].  And one of the big events in my life at that time was because in Rochester, they made the beer (laughter) that was quite (unclear).  And we, and I associated--it was quite integrated, the neighborhood.  And I really enjoyed the short stay in the summertime which is like you go to vacation.  And the highlight of that was sent--my father had, he sent me a birthday present.  Now, maybe that was when I was five or six.  And I opened it and I was so--it was a rag doll.  It was a little, a brown rag doll, and she said, "Mama."  And so her name was Miriam and I thought that was one of the highlights of my life, receiving my first little, black doll (laughter) at that time.
Story_ID: 378128
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you move into when you moved to New York [New York] with your mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] and father [George Seabrooke]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. The neighborhood we moved into, it was called Yorkville [New York, New York].  It was predominantly German.
Speaker 1: Now, where was Yorkville?  What part of Manhattan [New York]?
Speaker 2: Downtown, around the 80s, East 80s.
Speaker 1: East 80s.
Speaker 2: East 80s, yeah.  I think it was on 89th Street.  There was a brewery, and you could smell the beer all over the place.  But anyway, yeah.  And while I said it was predominantly German, there were others who lived in the neighborhood, and Polish, you know, and even Spanish speaking and well the black, the blacks were always allotted to certain houses when they moved in places in New York.  So there were two buildings in the block I lived in, that, the blacks and nearby, several blocks down, there were some more.  It was sort of distributed in sections where there were a few others, who lived nearby.
Speaker 1: Did you have any brothers and sisters when you moved or it's just you and--
Speaker 2: I'm a soldier.  I'm an only child.
Speaker 1: You were (unclear), okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  What work did your father get when he first came to New York?  What kind of work did he have?
Speaker 2: That was most discouraging as far as--you know, looking back, I would think the kinds of things that, that kind of family aspired to be, self-sufficient with their own businesses, although segregated.  But coming to New York was a different--that was different in that one had to look for a job to stay alive.  And my father had to resort to being a porter.  And at that time, there was a theater several blocks away.  And I think at that--I think at that time, the name was Proctor [RKO Proctor's 86th Street Theatre, New York, New York] or something.  It was a chain's theater.  And he worked there for years, you know.  And, of course, then my mother, she too had to resort to domestic jobs, you know, because she was able to be a homemaker in Charleston [South Carolina].  And then after my birth, she had to help, resorted to helping out so she could, she wouldn't--but she worked for some of the people who were very nice, a dentist and different other people.
Speaker 1: What part of Manhattan did she work in?  Do you know where she went to work or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I first--when we first moved to 85th Street, I remember her working for a dentist and dental assistant, you know, cleaning the office and all that sort of thing.  And, and the other jobs which followed, it was more or less, meeting other friends who worked for rich people.  And that was more or less housekeeping and, you know, it was that kind of job, um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 378129
Speaker 1: Going back to Charleston [South Carolina] where you were born, what are your earliest, farthest back memories of, as a child?  How far back can you remember as a child, before you left for New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Before I left for New York?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are some of your early memories of Charleston?
Speaker 2: And thank you.  Well, you know, that would have to go back to when I was about five.  So, I tell everybody, I said, talk about progress in education, I think that folks who I knew were quite positive in what they wanted to teach.  And I know my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] and father [George Seabrooke] sent me to a, a little school in a lady--one of her friend's house.  Her name was Marie Tobin [ph.].  And she taught how to read and write and then we'd have our little dances and so forth.  And it was particularly helpful because I think having learned how to read and write, by the time I--when I moved to New York, that meant that going to the public, the school, and I was ready for it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you were ready?  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 378130
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What school did you first attend?  When did you start school?  As soon as you got there [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's another thing.  I, I think I--I'm particularly, I'm very grateful for the fact that my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] was quite aware of what the schools had to offer.  And she decided that, in the neighborhood we lived in, between 2nd [Avenue] and 3rd Avenue, it was very nice, more or less, poor, you know, whites and, as they say, colored folks at that time.  And it was in--I've told the story many times because she met, she met a nanny who was taking--a black lady who was taking a little white boy to school.  And she wanted to know where she was going.  And so she decided that she was gonna find out where this school was and that I should attend.  And so I attended Public School 6 [P.S. 6, Lillie D. Blake School, New York, New York], which is Madison Avenue, 81st Street.  I understand it's still quite prestigious (laughter).  And just having two or three little girls my color, it meant that I was the only one in the class to have--I did receive special attention.  I think they, they gave me some sort of testing, a test and they also recognized my artistic ability in fifth or sixth grade.  What they did was, at that time, you know, you have to--you had to be six.  So that meant I was near seven when I went into the school.  And I was skipped five times (laughter), I know.  And I was, I graduated at twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve?
Speaker 2: From P.S. 6, yeah, and the only black. It's very interesting.
Story_ID: 378131
Speaker 1: When did you start to draw and paint?  How old were you when you really had an interest?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, somewhere I have this picture that I made when I was, I think in the sixth grade, a charcoal and done. But then before I even started to go to school.  But, you know, I would try to make little drawings and my father [George Seabrooke] would draw.  In fact, I have--I've saved a little notebook from years back in which he had made this little figure, and I had made my figure too.  Of course, I think that's when the art interest began in elementary school [P.S. 6, Lillie D. Blake School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So you said your father had some interests in art too?
Speaker 2: Well, I think he had interests, and I think she did too, and that she wanted to push me for whatever my talents were.
Speaker 1: Your mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother.  Yeah, so, anyway, and, you know, it all happens like, I guess, the kind of thing that happens today and yesterday and so forth, as far as parents' interests in children, and my children and so forth.  She was, she was very, very concerned about the way I was treated at school.  So sometimes I'd look up (laughter), and I was--when they were taking us for a walk or something, and here she is out there in the street watching to see that I had a partner, you know.  She was very keen about--and very mindful of what might happen.  So she wanted to make sure (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have art classes or art instruction at the elementary school?  Did they have art classes?
Speaker 2: No, but you--I don't remember art classes, but the school was so progressive.  The principal of that particular school, she said--it was a public school, but she said it was run like a private school.  And in the neighborhood, we had also rich folks as well as poor, some poor.  And today, there are some names in politics I'm sure they're descendants of the, you know, the young people I might have gone to school with.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 378132
Speaker 1: But the school [P.S. 6, Lillie D. Blake School, New York, New York] taught us everything as a--we had a gym class, and we had a cooking class.  And let's see, what else?  And sewing too, in addition to the reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you don't remember any art.  But they didn't have any art classes?
Speaker 1: No, no, not elementary, no, no.  But I thought the preparation was great in that one, it geared one to living and it made you feel good in that here I am, twelve years old, and I made my own graduation dress.  And, of course--
Speaker 2: Was it blue?
Speaker 1: It's got--it wasn't sewn--well, I was very proud although my father [George Seabrooke] said, "Do you think you want to wear that?"
Speaker 2: Was it blue, was it blue?
Speaker 1: No, white.
Speaker 2: Oh, white.
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, (unclear) royal and all hand sewn.  And they taught us how to use the machine and everything.  So I had made, own handmade dress for my graduation, uh-huh, yeah.  But see, but, of course, since the interests begun that I wanted to know more about the arts, I did say--well, I don't know--(unclear) I meant my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke], that I wanted to attend high school and that I could, you know, be--would be able to learn more.  And, of course, unlike--I guess I shouldn't compare with--I had been reading the other day about the boys' school, girls' schools and coed.  And in those days, they were prevalent.  I attended Washington Irving High School [New York, New York] which was all girls.  And I thought it was great, and predominantly girls who wanted to follow art as a livelihood after and so forth.  So, and, of course, we did have to have some academic subjects too.  But I, I think it was a good--and still is, one of the, you know, I would say best schools in New York City.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 378133
Speaker 1: Your mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] and father [George Seabrooke] were very attentive to your development and education and your schooling.  And before we get into the high school [Washington Irving High School, New York, New York], how do you remember your mother?  What was she like as a person, her personality?
Speaker 2: Her personality (laughter)?
Speaker 1: What was she like?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember my mother's, you know--I think a very caring person and that I really felt too, having a child at her age, and that it meant to her more, you know, care and responsibility.  But also the fact that--and she told me, she made me aware of the kinds of things that I had to learn how to do for myself too.  And I think, I think she had, always had my interests at heart.  And I feel that way about my father too.
Speaker 1: What was he like as a person?
Speaker 2: As a person, he was a quiet person, very quiet man.  And, and not--as I remember, not much of a conversationalist, but quite aware of what I wanted to be.  And so I don't remember like--he, folks from Charleston, South Carolina would get together like on Saturdays up in Harlem [New York, New York] at the 350 [ph.] and so forth.  And then there were other areas--places too.  And he met Mr. Halston, I forgot--I think it was Augustus Halston [Edwin Augustus Halston], and he had the opportunity of attending one of the famous colleges, and very, very talented.  And so, of course, he was outstanding, not only as a Charlestonian, but as an artist.  And I remember my father said, "Well, if, you know--if you want to follow your heart, my friend says it's better that you be a teacher."  And I said, "Oh," you know.  I really didn't give it that much thought as to saying how am I gonna make a living?  I just sort of, "No, I don't think I'd wanna be a teacher" (laughter).
Story_ID: 378134
Speaker 1: When you were ready to--when you went to Washington Irving High School [New York, New York], did you have art on your mind then, that that's what you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was the reason, yes, because that was the only school that I found out about, and I think it really was one of the few schools in which, which majored in art, and they taught, you know arts and industry, a little smattering of everything, how to paint and draw, how to do commercial and layouts and things of that kind.  So Washington Irving did fit the bill, and the teach (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where was Washington Irving High School?  Where was it in the city?
Speaker 2: Downtown, now, was it 9th Street [sic.]?  You know where Union Square [New York, New York] is?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So it was way downtown then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, way down--oh, yeah, that's another thing, traveling from 85th Street downtown.
Speaker 1: Every day, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think by that time, the time I went to high school, the el [elevated train] was very popular down (unclear) not the subway, I'd get--subway wasn't around that way.  It was either the el or the trolley car.  So I traveled by the el.  And that took me right to high school.
Story_ID: 378135
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were your friends?  Did you have any best friends?  You didn't have any brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But who were your best friends as you left elementary [P.S. 6, Lillie D. Blake School, New York, New York] and went to the high school [Washington Irving High School, New York, New York]?  Who were some of your best friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the best friends were, lived at--a few of the young people who lived in the building and, of course, that brings to mind too some of the things that I hear today about environment and so forth.  You can be poor and you still have aspirations.  I don't understand why (laughter) you must give into any particular way of living.  And my girlfriend, I called my best friend, well, she's two years older.  And she said she wanted to be a writer.  And her brother, he was four, I think he was four or five years older. Well, he wanted to be a musician.  And then the older one, well, he really, he was just a hard worker.  But when we would--we had stoops--and you know what a stoop is?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, and so when we would sit out on the stoop in the evening, and we'd talk about, you know--and she'd write a, she'd write something, and I'll make the pictures.  I'll illustrate and so forth.  And, well, the other young people were really nice, but I think I was drawn to her because of her aspirations as well as my wanting to be an artist, um-hm yeah.
Story_ID: 378136
Speaker 1: You enjoyed high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I enjoyed high school.  And that was a full four year term.  And, of course, some academia was thrown in too.
Speaker 1: What was your best subject?  What was your best subject?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember.  I know we had to take English and French.  And I'm not gonna--but I won't say about the grades (laughter).  I think my mind was focusing on whatever the art projects were, you know.
Speaker 1: So you had art every year, did you?
Speaker 2: The arts, I was major, major.
Speaker 1: That was your major?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, of course, we had to take something--some academia.  I think maybe I don't remember the math or something.  But when it--as, when it was time to graduate, of course, I remember working very hard and thinking in terms of maybe I'll get a scholarship or something of that kind (laughter).  Well, that was my introduction to what I called a bit of discrimination.  And the teacher, instructor, she announced that one of the girls would, she would have a scholarship to Pratt Institute [New York, New York].  And, of course, it just seemed like she was the only one singled out.  But I did have the nerve to ask her, well, I said, "Why, why didn't you include other students?"  You know, but then she said she felt that this child, this young lady was, well, was more of a candidate for that type of art, for the art scholarship.  But she just made up her mind, okay.
Speaker 1: So you felt that you were discriminated against?
Speaker 2: I felt, I felt that way because I did feel that if a scholarship is given, it should be more open and not just given to someone because you had decided personally, you know.  And there was another girl in the class too, and she was very talented.  But she didn't seem like--she was a white girl, but she didn't seem--but I just, it just, to me, it seemed as if it was that she had not done the right thing in not including all of the students.
Speaker 1: What was the mix of students, black and white at the school at the time?  Were there many black students or were you very one of few?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  Well, I must say that throughout, throughout my school years, I seemed to be the only black in my class most of the time.  I didn't really see--I met another young lady.  And she was attending Washington Irving High School [New York, New York] too, but different classes.  And we did become friends too.  And, but all of my classes, I seemed to be the only one.
Story_ID: 378137
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers, any teachers at the high school that you especially remember influencing you and helping you along?  Did any of the teachers stand out (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, as far as high school--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --is concerned, yes, and it was quite interesting too.  And it should be among my memoirs, but I don't know whether I still have it.  There was one teacher, and who--she taught, what?  I don't remember.  It was commercial art or what it was.  But the graduation ceremonies were twice a year, and, you know, so I was going--I graduated January/February, and therefore, I had, and what could you do in the next six months, if you wanted to go to another, to college or something, if it's possible?  And so I told her, I'd take a post-high school (laughter), I was a post-high school student and teach and was in her class.  And she was very, very receptive to my work, and I used to make block prints and so forth.  Her name was Mrs. Morris [ph.].  And I think it was the same time that I had gone up to the Harlem Arts Workshop when James Wells [James Lesesne Wells] first got that job in the summertime, and my linoleum block print appeared in the, in the magazine at Washington Irving [Washington Irving High School, New York, New York], you know, student magazine at that time.
Speaker 1: What appeared in the magazine?
Speaker 2: My blo-, I had made linoleum block print.
Speaker 1: Oh, linoleum block print.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and that, too, of course was something which I had conceived.  The, it was Africans, and I had not--no prior knowledge or having studied anything about African art.  But I had made up this linoleum block print of some people or some figures and the designs and so forth.  And it was a block print.  And I also made a screen of the same design at James Wells' workshop.

Speaker 1: You went to the Harlem Art Workshop [sic. Harlem Arts Workshop]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right after you graduated or were you still at Washington Irving [Washington Irving High School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, it was, see, the Harlem Art Workshop was a summer--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a summer.
Speaker 2: --yeah, summer.
Speaker 1: So you went there after you graduated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after I graduated high school.  And then, of course, I think it was, at that time, yeah, because as I said, I think my, my graduation took place in the winter.  And then I went on to work toward other things, and then I believe, at this time, that that's what, this Harlem Art Workshop followed in the summertime.
Speaker 1: What did you do during the winter and spring?  If you finished high school in the winter--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what did you do between that time and the summer?
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I'm saying.  I was still a student.  That's what I called myself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see.  You were still there, okay.
Speaker 2: --a post-high school (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  I see, okay.
Speaker 2: She [Mrs. Morris (ph.)] said I could still come to school and (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, who was James Wells [James Lesesne Wells]?
Speaker 2: Well, well, James Wells was an instructor at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and he had become well known for his painting and his wood, prints, wood prints and so forth.  And for some reason or other, although he did not reside in Harlem [New York, New York], he was given the job of being director of this Harlem Arts Workshop.
Speaker 1: Well, was he teaching at Howard then or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He was teaching at Howard then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I think he was.
Speaker 1: But he was in Harlem during the summer teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the students that you met at the Harlem Art Workshop?
Speaker 2: The people who I met, well, it was sort of a free-for-all type as far as age and so forth.  So, you know, doors are open.  Young people from the neighborhood could come and work.  And one of the--of course, one of the people who I met, and I did not know, and he had the background, but Palmer Hayden.  He was the assistant--he was supposed to be the assistant to Mr. Wells.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: That, I think maybe he called me precocious or something.  It seems as though that I, I wanted to be able to be helpful for whatever I knew how to do.  And so one of my, one of the friends I met at that time too was Jacob Lawrence.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: And Jake and I were teenagers together.  So Jake used to come up to--but he didn't do much--he would observe and so forth, you know.
Speaker 1: But you were the same age as Jacob Law- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think, yeah.  I might be a year older, yeah.  As far as the other people, like on the project and so forth, yeah, we were the youngest, yeah.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  So you were there that summer with James Wells and Jacob Lawrence--
Speaker 2: And, yeah, Jacob.  I would say Jake was not a regular, but he did come and, he--I think he did and, and make some pictures at (unclear) workshop.  I have a picture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this was kind of--
Story_ID: 378139
Speaker 1: I have a picture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this was kind of your first venture above 80th Street in Harlem [New York, New York] then?  You really hadn't been to Harlem before that time?  Had you spent much time in--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  To tell the truth, as far as Harlem is concerned, living downtown and, as I said, sometimes we, I was able to read the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] which was published way back at that time.  And I read that they were going to have workshops at the Y [Harlem YMCA, New York, New York]. That was a beautiful new building too, the YMCA.   And so I asked my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] and first had to get her permission to go to these workshops and to mingle with the folks too.  "Can I get on the trolley car (laughter) and go up to Harlem?"  That's quite an experience, you know, down in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Right, okay.  You also attended the Harlem Community Art Center [New York, New York].  When did you go there?
Speaker 1: But Harlem, it really sort of--it gelled together because in the community art center, was, I think that was more or less a meeting place, 125th Street, Gwendolyn Bennett as I remember, she was president of the Harlem Artists Guild.
Speaker 2: Oh, she was, Gwendolyn Bennett?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she--we used to have meetings there.  I, as I remember, going there more or less after I was selected for the mural project.  Before that, it was, one I met was Augusta Savage because she had the, she had opened her doors for a school [Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts, New York, New York].  And I met several other--
Speaker 2: Did you go to her school?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't, but I was, I met them (laughter).  And--
Speaker 2: Where was her school?  Do you remember where her school was?
Speaker 1: That was at her studio home too.  I think this was around 135th Street or nearby [143rd Street].  I'm not quite sure of the address.  And she was so well known--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, of course, all of the young people gravitated to her, and she was responsible, in part, for having a say in this Harlem art project when they decided that, to hire somebody--you know, back in, well, actually to make that a project of the Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] and so forth.
Speaker 2: Who was Gwendolyn Bennett?  Let me back up.  Who was Gwendolyn Bennett?
Speaker 1: Now, Gwendolyn Bennett, I'm not sure of her background.  I think she too might have come from one of the colleges and so forth, but I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 2: So she was a summer director.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--but she was a spokesperson and activist of the arts and the blacks, you know.  And, as I said, when the Harlem Artists Guild, there was also, you know what I'm saying, following, following my graduation and going on to be able to get the job with the Works Progress Administration [WPA], the Federal Art Project.  They, they were the ladies who sort of looked toward helping the young artists and so forth.
Story_ID: 378140
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, after that summer when you went to the Harlem Arts Workshop and the Harlem Community Art Center [New York, New York], after that summer, in September, what did you do with the next years, the next couple of years?  What were you doing?
Speaker 2: Well, that--okay.  I was--it meant that--wanting to have a job, to get a job or how do you, how do you continue school if you're short on funds?  (Laughter) So what really happened was that upon my graduation from high school, I had lost my father [George Seabrooke] too.  He died and knowing that, you know, the way, I think the way we were living, it was comfortable, but, of course, it was not, it was not--they were not in the category to have money to save to send me to any college or anything.  And so therefore, I thought that, now, I really was undecided except that I wanted to continue to study.  And I met this other friend at Washington Irving High School [New York, New York] too who said, yes, she said she would like to do it.  So we, we knew we couldn't, we didn't get, we couldn't get scholarships through our high school.  And then, you know, it was interesting because we tried to get summer jobs at least to help ourselves, and I don't know, and you remember--was, I know, you know, Walter White, and (laughter)--.  Well, we had the nerve, we said, we have to go there and ask can we, can we get jobs, you know, and so forth.  So we took it upon ourselves, (laughter) got an appointment to talk.  Well, he said he was sorry.  And I said, "Well, what about a waitress?"  No, he didn't know anything about that.
Speaker 1: This is at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] now.
Speaker 2: The NAACP.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But anyway, [HistoryMaker] Camille Billops, you know, Camille?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she, I was interviewed by her, and she was saying, asking me the same questions.  And I said, "Oh, Lord, we couldn't get the jobs and we weren't light enough." 'Cause we found too, it was just not the discrimination between black and white, but there was discrimination in our own color.  And all them folks, whether you were a waitress or whatever or a dancer, you were fair skinned (laughter).  So that meant, okay, well, what are we going to do?
Story_ID: 378141
Speaker 1: Someone suggested, and I'm not quite sure how it came about, you know, there's this (unclear) wonderful art school, and it's tuition free.  And, but you have to take a test to get in, you know.  And that turned out--that's Cooper Union art school [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was Cooper?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was free?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).  And Cooper Union, you know, it was made tuition free, by Peter Cooper, and it's still tuition free.  And I guess you know right now George Campbell [HistoryMaker George Campbell, Jr.] is the director and that was something too because that was the first black director, in all those years, you know.  But anyway, he's doing a good job.
Speaker 2: Now, what is his name again?
Speaker 1: George Campbell.
Speaker 2: George Campbell, and he's a director?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think his wife, Mary Smith--[HistoryMaker] Mary Schmidt Campbell, she used to run the studio gallery [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York], I think, at 125th Street.  Because, make a long story short, we found out when these tests were given, that--to enter, you know, Cooper Union, and so we got ourselves together, thinking it was going to be something artistic, more or less.  But it was, I won't tell you it was disappointing, but it was something that we did not really expect the kinds of questions and answers.  And so that was a day-long test and so forth.  And when we talked to--and I'll never forget because I've said it so many times, and one of the kids, young ladies we know, "Oh, that was so easy.  I know I'm getting in."  I said, "Oh, you thought it was easy?"  And so, when the decision was made and they let us know, she didn't get in, and my friend and I were admitted.
Speaker 2: Who was your friend?  What was her name?
Speaker 1: Willesa Ralph [ph.], her name was.  And she, she said, now, (unclear), she had tremendous talent.  In fact, when she attended Cooper Union, she was befriended by one of the young, rich, young ladies who commuted daily from Connecticut, and I think it was Revlon [Revlon Products Corporation; Revlon, Inc.] had just begun.  And she became an administrator, you know, employee for years later and stayed there and worked many years.  But me, so anyway, after we were admitted, and I--I mean, we were just in awe of ourselves, you know.
Story_ID: 378142
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long did you study at Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was, it was supposed to be four, it's a four-year course, went all day long, you know.  I say it's a nine to five [o'clock] job, and so like the first year, you know, coming--my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] and I had moved to the Bronx [New York] by that time.
Speaker 1: You moved to the Bronx.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and then, of course, and then I'd come downtown and I think we had moved, I think (unclear) my father [George Seabrooke] died.  And, but anyway, I did my best and put forth my best efforts for whatever the projects were.  And after the first year, then we had the opportunity to choose our painting instructors if we wanted, you know, fine arts and so forth.  And I chose John Steuart Curry who was one of the most famous Midwestern artists and so he, you know, he'd come and he'd talk about the art.  And we'd talk about what subjects and he, of course, and so because I had, I had begun to go to church with my friends on a Sunday at St. Mark's Methodist Church [St. Mark's United Methodist Church, New York, New York] and so forth.  But then it was, the kind of religion that I felt should be on paper, I painted the church scene, and I think you saw it in my room.  So Mr. Curry, he saw me painting, he just added a little critique and so forth.  And, and I thought, well, and my friend, she made a painting too of a mother and daughter curling their hair, you know.  And so at the end of that first year and the exhibit, guess what?  I received a silver medal for painting and, for that painting which I was so honored.  And even today, you know, I've talked to some of the folks, as I said, well, we don't give out silver medals anymore, but we do give prizes, you know.  But anyway, and now, I guess wanting to go on with the studies, had been--this was the second year over, and you have to go in the third, had two more.  Now, that mean two, no job.  No way we're going to do.  So that was when at my church I had, I was befriended by a young minister who wanted to help and he introduced me to Augusta Savage and we would work and meet other artists.  And then, of course, she, in turn, told me, told us what was going on, about their trying to get together for this project in Harlem [New York, New York], the Harlem arts project, you know.  And with Charles Spinky Alston [Charles Alston], of course, as the chosen director.  And so what happened is that I said, oh, my, I need to help myself, I need supplies and so forth.
Story_ID: 376372
Speaker 1: --Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] as a student?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But then you had the opportunity, the Works Progress Administration [WPA] came along.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you had the Harlem arts hospital project (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was, I applied.  Of course, actually, as you know, the whole system was unemployment and giving jobs to people who needed.  And I applied because, in the way that my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] and I, you know, I needed assistance.  And, but I did use the address of my cousin because that too brings out a bit of segregation in a way.  But we were, we thought it was a good thing to do, to have that Harlem art project.  And we were very proud that we were going to be able to paint the--in the Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York], you know.
Speaker 1: So you applied for, to be one of the artists--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --one of the master artists.
Speaker 2: I, yeah, I applied, I applied for the job, and there were several of us who--Charles Alston.  He was the director, and we had meetings, you know, at his place.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you know him before this time?  Had you met him before?
Speaker 2: No, that was my first, the first I had met him.
Speaker 1: And who were the other artists who were selected?
Speaker 2: Vertis Hayes and Elba Lightfoot and Selma Day.  They were two ladies and Sara Murrell and--and there was one white artist, Alfred Crimi--
Speaker 1: Crimi.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  And, you know, at that critical time, there were--
Speaker 1: So you left Cooper to move into this project?
Speaker 2: Actually, I didn't call myself leaving Cooper.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I had, I asked for a meeting with my director and explained to him that--what was happening, and if I were able to get this job, can I apply, using my work hours to my work hours--to my study hours at Cooper Union.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: And which I did.  And the whole time that I--after I did get it, I was down at Cooper Union 'cause it's three days a week.  The other two days I spent all day at Cooper Union throughout the time.  And so everything seemed to be going along pretty well, except that the fourth year when the year had gone by, the mural time had expired as far as they were concerned.  And they said, that was when they said, "Well, you've lost too much time," and there was a new director.  And I, my picture and I was interviewed, had attended the school dance and everything.  And last minute before I was ready to go for my certificate, I was told I couldn't graduate.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And that was a blow.
Story_ID: 376373
Speaker 1: Now, in Harlem [New York, New York], what institution was selected for the artwork that you were gonna do?  Where was it to go?
Speaker 2: Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did Harlem Hospital get selected?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you see that's a (unclear), and that, why--I'm not sure.  And I feel, that the director about Spinky Alston [Charles Alston], of course.  They sat down and decided that, yes, if we have black artists, that would be a good thing, to paint murals at Harlem Hospital.  And so that's how, apparently, that was determined because all of us had submitted, you know, designs and drawings for Harlem Hospital.  And we visited the hospital, and were chosen to make the designs for certain areas and like, Alston in the lobby and Vertis Hayes and mine is the nurses' penthouse.
Speaker 1: Yours is gonna be in the nurses' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  They call the pent- nurses' recreation penthouse, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a new building for the nurses, you know, and very nice.
Speaker 1: How long did it take you, how much time did you spend doing the drawings and the planning and actually doing the mural?  How long did that take, all of that?
Speaker 2: Well, actual--I was assisted, too.  You see, of course, realizing that this is the kind of a job too where assistance is spread to give the person, the master artist, assistance too.  So there were two young men who helped me.  And as I said, we worked the three days a week, and so many--I've forgot the amount of hours, you know.
Story_ID: 376374
Speaker 1: But at the same time, we did not--we thought it should have been finished within the year after.  And because of that protest and so forth, it went on to the second year.  And then that was what helped, that was my downfall as far as my trying to convince the school [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] people, the staff, that, through no fault of mine I had tried to comply.  And I was still doing my schoolwork, but the project had taken longer than I thought it would.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, why did it take much longer?
Speaker 1: It took much longer because the superintendent of the hospital--and I think Mr. Dermody [Lawrence T. Dermody], they, they said, when they looked at the designs, that Harlem [New York, New York] was not going to be--well, colored people weren't going to be living there.  It was more or less white people in the neighborhood.  And they even thought that other colored people would not like it.
Speaker 2: So you used the word protest.
Speaker 1: Yes, 'cause then the protest came after that decision that he did not want us to make these murals (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: --with the black characters and so forth.
Speaker 2: For Harlem Hospital, yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So then tell me, so you were kind of stalled?
Speaker 1: Yes, we were stalled.
Speaker 2: So tell me about the, how did it--tell me about the protest?  What happened then?
Speaker 1: Well, what happened is that we wondered why, here we are being paid and some of us--would they put us on another project?  Would they move our talents to another place?  Or what would we do?  And then the protests really started through the fact that the knowledge spread to the artists union and American Artists' Congress that started too at that time.  And they took to the streets downtown in the protests.
Speaker 2: Where did they protest?
Speaker 1: Around 14th Street in that neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Whose office?  Who were protesting, the--
Speaker 1: Well, just protesting against the government and the Work Progress [Works Progress Administration (WPA)], you know, the--well, not protesting against the government but saying that the government should be able to let us go on with our work.
Speaker 2: How much were you getting paid for this work?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Yes, I start, I started as, the first salary was $25 a week when we first started.  And after we, well, like I became the master artist, I think my pay rose to $27.50 a week.  And as I remember I did receive 27.50 for the week, yeah, three days a week, as I say.  That was our work, work week.
Speaker 2: Well, while this protest was going on and people were trying to support you and Charles Alston and Vertis Hayes and so on, what were the three or four of you doing?  Were you meeting with each other?  What were you doing?
Speaker 1: No, well, we had to, we had to produce in some way.  And I, I'm not quite sure what the depths of progress took place in that they thought we might have to work elsewhere.  We might have to make up new designs if we could not, if it would not be accepted at Harlem Hospital.  And even to the point they had an easel project too, and I don't think, I don't think at that time I became an artist on the easel project when I--at one time, I did too, just making paintings for public, like you say, now what they call art in public places.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 376375
Speaker 1: Tell me about the mural that you had designed and planned and the one you had planned to paint in Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] in the nurses' pavilion.  Tell me about that painting.  What was the content of the painting?  How big was it?  Tell me about the painting you were planning?
Speaker 2: To me, it was quite a surprise that anyone would criticize or make that kind of remark because I deliberately integrated my subjects and chose subjects who were black and white.  And I called it 'Recreation in Harlem.'
Speaker 1: You called it what, again?
Speaker 2: 'Recreation in Harlem.'
Speaker 1: 'In Harlem,' okay.
Speaker 2: But then, on the other hand, the subjects, of course, and the kinds of things that folks do, and they were, you know, that I had been exposed to like gospel singers and (unclear) then there were those who, in the swimming pool, and then there was the home scene of the nurses--at that time, they used to have a service.  These folks would come to the homes.
Speaker 1: So it really showed people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Integration--
Speaker 1: --people in neighborhoods--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the area.
Speaker 2: It was an integration of subject matter which would take place in any, any neighborhood.  And I felt that it was an integration of color as well, and, of course, I will say that Charles Alston, his ['Magic in Medicine'] was beautiful.  It was dealing with the medicine men and so forth, how so much was, saw it (unclear) a learning experience to the African, you know.  And Vertis Hayes, his mural ['Pursuit of Happiness'] was more or less coming up through the cotton fields and so forth, which was black.  But mine had a bit of black and white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I, I couldn't understand why that, I was subject to this disapproval.
Story_ID: 376376
Speaker 1: How big was your painting ['Recreation in Harlem'], your mural planned?  How big was it planned to be?
Speaker 2: Well, it took up the whole wall, I think and the kinds of pictures that I have shown you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, we'll see it on the video.  It was quite large, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was quite long.  It was, you know, like this room where the ladies went, the nurses went to, as I said, relax and so forth.  It was longer than that one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did any of the doctors or nurses at Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] come out to support your project and you and Mr. Alston [Charles Alston]?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, to my knowledge, I don't, I didn't know of any.  Of course, after, after so much talk and so much being written about it, the walls of Harlem, there was a big article in the artists magazine.  In fact, that was what convinced me at that time to send it to them to tell them just what was happening and why I couldn't not say that I had finished at the time that I should have received my certificate, you know, from Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York].  And, but the doctor who we had met, I (unclear) she mentored to me too.  And I did not realize that, how much he was going to bat (unclear).  I, do you think, may I ask, is that a behind-the-scenes kind of--
Speaker 1: Who was the doctor?
Speaker 2: Dr. Louis Wright [Louis T. Wright].
Speaker 1: Dr. Louis Wright.
Speaker 2: Dr. Wright, Louis Wright, yeah.  I didn't know any other doctors.  But, see, it seems that was unlike most kinds of protests I would say, and it clearly brought out to us that continued segregation was prevalent in Harlem [New York, New York] wherein black people were moving there daily.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it just didn't make sense.
Speaker 1: Well, how did it get resolved?  You eventually were allowed to produce your mural and the other artists did their murals.  How did it get resolved?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, it was resolved because the protests continued, and it was going into the second year, I believe, and here we were saying, "If we're gonna have jobs, we're gonna, you know, get something done."  But meanwhile, they must have been talks, you know, between the higher-ups and finally, finally, the director [Lawrence T. Dermody] said if, well, if they really like the pictures, they can go ahead and paint them.  But it took that--that took a long time.
Speaker 1: Is your mural still at Harlem Hospital?
Speaker 2: Well, no, to tell the truth, I, I thought that it had been neglected over the years.  And at one time, I had heard that it had been covered.  And it, but now, in recent years, and now I understand Mayor Bloomberg [Michael Bloomberg] wants to restore them as much as possible so that they may be seen, and so I'm looking forward.  But I do realize that they've been badly damaged in many areas and all of them, and I do hope that they will, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's the plan, to take them down, put them in storage.  They're building new buildings, and they're gonna reinstall them.  That's the plan (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I see, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 376377
Speaker 1: You did another hospital mural.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: My next assignment--this was over at Queens General Hospital [Queens Hospital Center, Queens, New York], and I made, far from subject matter that I would not get involved in.  It was a children's fairytale, kind of picture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Children's fairytale.
Speaker 2: --in the children's ward, Queens General.
Speaker 1: Now, was this under the Works Progress Administration [WPA] too?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was under, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: I did some work on three areas.  I did that mural, and I also did some paintings on the easel project, they called it, which, of course, now would be art in public places of some kind, yeah.
Speaker 1: And where did they place the easel work?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: I see, but you did the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were, you know, we were able to paint pictures and submit them, you know, to the director.
Speaker 1: Now, you were quite young when you did all this work, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Well, to tell the truth, it was '35 [1935], 1935 when I was first hired, you know, and '39 [1939], 1939.  So you can see that--
Speaker 1: You were in your twenties, early twenties.
Speaker 2: No, not even that.  I guess about, yes, nineteen, nineteen (laughter).
Speaker 1: Let's see.  You were born in 1916, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I was born in 1916.
Speaker 1: So you were in your early twenties?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's when it ended.

Speaker 1: So now this project ended at the end of the 1930s.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt who put some of this money into the Works Progress Administration [WPA] was still the president.  What did you do after that?  What was your next move?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that, it was a realization for most of us that art and drama and the kinds of things for which we had sought to make a living through the Work Progress Administration, it just wasn't there for us because unemployment was rampant.  And so therefore, I did not have a job after it was over.  I, I became domesticated and got married at an early age.
Speaker 1: Who did you marry and when?
Speaker 2: I married in '36 [1936] so I left--right at the time.  And like, my husband and I were married for forty-six years when he died.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: George Powell.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, well, I met, like many people in that era too, you know, meet folks through housing, the house, and we lived in the same apartment building.  And--
Speaker 1: What was his occupation?  What was he doing?
Speaker 2: Well, he, at the time I met him, his mother had seen my picture in the paper, and she was a very proud, ambitious lady.  And she told me that her son liked to draw and so forth.  And so she brought about the introduction.  But what had happened was that he had, had taken this--well, course, that he called--well, he had taken, had studied rather at this university [Middlesex University] in Boston [Massachusetts] which is now Brandeis [Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts], you know.  And I think it was sort of beginning of the study of podiatry because, you know, people used to just cut their own corns and so forth.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that brought a profession to the taking care of one's feet (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he practice podiatry?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: He did.
Speaker 2: Of course, the story was on that too as newlyweds.  I did everything I, to help him and still the Depression [Great Depression].  And we moved from New York [New York], and he did.  And I used to travel back and forth from New York to Washington, D.C. and he opened an office in one of the most popular neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when did he do that, what year?
Speaker 2: --1234 U Street.
Speaker 1: On U Street.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did he open his office here?
Speaker 2: The office?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He opened his office, let me see, is that around '35 [1935]? Let me see, '36 [1936].  It was say, mid-'30s [1930s].  I think it was about '30s [1930s].  We got married in '36 [1936], I said, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, soon after we got married.
Story_ID: 376379
Speaker 1: What had happened, like in Washington [D.C.], like in the early '40s [1940s], there was a surge of black people moving here in D.C. for the new government jobs, the kinds of jobs that they weren't able to get before.  But that didn't, that didn't help his [Powell's husband, George Powell] profession because it was still a segregated city.  And folks weren't aware of the podiatry, podiatrist.  It was difficult to build up business.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, had you moved here at that point?
Speaker 1: I, I visited him back and forth for nearly two years (laughter).
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: And then he decided that Washington was not the place.  He had a certificate that he could have, he could have practiced in Boston [Massachusetts], where he went to school [Middlesex University; Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts].  And, but he kept the--he kept it alive, certificate for D.C. and Boston throughout the years.  And not--but he did not, was not able to practice in New York because they wanted a person who had a--their training in New York, and he was from Boston.  So that meant civil service, and so I worked with him I told him, "Whatever he wanted was--," as I said, "that was the domestic part of my, my feelings on folks, you know, young married folks should help each other."  And he decided to take the civil service test, and he became a firefighter.
Speaker 2: A firefighter.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so he remained a--
Speaker 2: In New York?
Speaker 1: In New York.  He was a New York City [New York, New York] firefighter.
Story_ID: 376380
Speaker 1: When did you have, start having your family?  How many children did you have?  And who are your--?
Speaker 2: I have three, three children.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the oldest.  Who is the oldest?
Speaker 2: The oldest is named after his father, George Wesley Powell, and he is a retired fire marshal and so he devoted much of his life as a firefighter.  And--
Speaker 1: Your second child?
Speaker 2: And my second is my daughter, Phyllis [Phyllis Powell Washington], whom you've met here.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I would say, credit her with being a very good businesswoman.  And at the time, we felt very good about the young people who, were working in the corporate, you know, world.  And she started at sixteen (unclear) working, and she continued really.  And when she moved to Washington [D.C.], she became an administrator in the civil service employment services.
Speaker 1: And your third child?
Speaker 2: And my third, son [Richard Victor Powell], he joined the [U.S.] Navy.  He asked if he--he aspired to be a musician since early on.  He, he's a--he was born with the flexibility of doing several things.  And one, he is an accomplished musician, percussionist.  So we worked on that and helped him, since he wanted to go in the Navy.  But he wasn't able to join as a Navy man like he wanted to at first.  So he became a ham operator.
Speaker 1: What is he doing today?  Where is he today?
Speaker 2: Well, right now, he's a retired school teacher, and he is an accomplished scuba diver.  He loves the water, so that (unclear) (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 378143
Speaker 1: When did you and your husband [George Powell] move to Washington [D.C.] and why did you come back to Washington?  Why did you move here?
Speaker 2: The reason that we came back to Washington and I guess it has to do--perhaps it was me prodding him to not give up because I thought, it's not giving up.  But if you have studied something, I think given the chance later on, if you were not successful in the first place, as I think he would have been successful had he been able to stay down in Washington under those conditions.  But it would have taken years to establish himself.  And so under those conditions and he had kept his certificate intact and so forth, and so, "Should we go up to Washington and look around or should we look around D.C.?"  And so we took, we chose D.C. to come and we spent--we talked to real estate men who said, "Oh, things have changed and things have changed.  It's not like it used to be.  I'm sure it'll be different if you wanted to move here now."  And so that sort of ignited a little more feeling that maybe it would be a good thing the second time around, and try it.  And I thought, and I encouraged him.  And I think he became--it was something he had to really work for 'causes after all, being twenty years as a firefighter and getting back into that.  But he be--he had a very successful practice, I think.  Not that it was a big, big, but our home became the office, you know, in the basement, a very nice office.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.
Speaker 2: And he also was able to meet some of the podiatrists who had formed organizations and they, too, were working with people in civil service.  So he, he worked with senior citizens at--you know, so many days a week and in D.C. at one of their health centers too (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well te--
Story_ID: 378144
Speaker 1: Tell me how you continued your artwork--
Speaker 2: My artwork.
Speaker 1: --and your artistry when you came here?  What did you do in your career when you came back here?
Speaker 2: Well, my career was on hold actually for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I think I almost said in despair that: when will I get back to my painting?  And how I would stay up night after night, painting as a young person and things had changed so much.  But then, too, D.C. [Washington, D.C.] changed that too, to the point of my husband [George Powell] even recognizing, he says, "I know you want to do something that--you know, the art studio and so forth."  And we--in our home, of course, I didn't have a studio, but he had heard of a retiring, not, a podiatrist who had passed.  And he had this office on 14th Street, and he was saying, "Now, maybe if you want to start again, to try to do something, maybe you want to try to take over this office."  So here I was.  I decided, yes, that's a good idea.  And I, I did open this studio, we called the Powell Art Studio [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: You called it what?
Speaker 2: Powell Art Studio.
Speaker 1: Art studio, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my son [Richard Victor Powell], the youngest had gotten out of the [U.S.] Navy.  And he was in his early twenties.  And he said he would teach, and I would teach.  And I turned one part of it into a gallery and so forth.  In fact, Lois Jones [Lois Mailou Jones] didn't bring her pictures, and we had--it was quite a nice (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She, Lois Jones exhibited?
Speaker 2: Yes, on 14th Street.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: It was 3427 14th Street, yeah.
Speaker 1: 3724 [sic.], okay.
Speaker 2: It's across the street and the Giant Food store was built there at the time.  And that came into--that's a part of my life too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had your studio, you were painting.
Speaker 2: And then I--yeah, I was, I really started painting because what had happened in that I began to meet, meet people, you know, new--some artists of color and so forth.  And I think I sort of became one of the group in that, you know, looking forward to exhibits and so forth like that.
Story_ID: 378145
Speaker 1: Then I, but what I did before leaving New York [New York], I, it just seemed to me that the kind of life because my mother [Anna Simmons Seabrooke] was ill and so forth, and I did have--I found myself depressed in so many areas, I read about this school, the school downtown at Turtle Bay Music School in New York City.  And this is, and they ran the art therapy cour-
Speaker 2: They had an art therapy course?
Speaker 1: Courses, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: So I decided that I would get on the el [elevated train]. In those days, you go on the el and go anywhere in the city.  So I decided I would go down there and find out what it was all about.  And really seemed to be a challenge, I felt, yes, I should really get back into what I really wanted to do and do it more often.  And so, and I attended this, these classes for a couple of semesters (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what was art therapy?  Tell me, what was that at the time?
Speaker 1: Well, the art therapy actually, it was--there were classes conducted by an artist and a lady.  But she actually had worked with delinquent kids at Willowick School [ph.], I think it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, boys school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, boys, and she had found that art had done so much toward helping them to help themselves.  And I was really quite taken by what I felt the arts could be (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So when you came to Washington [D.C.], then you really pursued art therapy?
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.
Speaker 2: And did you study it?
Speaker 1: Well, what I did, it was--actually, it was sort of a new ground in that, see, artists had been working for--those who had talent, I found they were working and not with a title, but, or just working with patients in hospitals and so forth.
Story_ID: 378146
Speaker 1: And before moving to Washington [D.C.], I had met this lady who had, had a job over at D.C. General Hospital [District of Columbia General Hospital, Washington, D.C.] in acute psychiatry and Darche [ph.], I decided to look her up and find.  And she said, yes, oh, she said, I can have--I would like to have someone to help me so far.  And I said, and I found her and inquired about the art therapy at D.C. General.  And so what happened is that I was able to work with her as her assistant and that was sixty--in '63 [1963], I think, so that '63 [1963] to '66 [1966].  And I, I found that it really is something that is, that is quite useful, psychologically.
Speaker 2: Did you actually go to school here [Washington, D.C.] to study art therapy?
Speaker 1: Well, that's another thing about discrimination (laughter), actually, since I, I didn't know about civil service and the kinds of jobs that they were giving, black people and white people.  And they gave me a low grade and as her, to help her.  And, but she was a woman who had been a product of Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and so forth.  I think she was a Jewish lady and her father was first Jewish judge in Baltimore [Maryland], so she had a very good background, and she was a very good writer too.  But then as far as the job, taking the job, she did not make the job.  She only told them that she needed someone.  And so I fit the bill to be able to work with her, you know.  And, and I said, I tell, Ronnie [ph.], I said.  Well, really, it's quite a shock because this, the woman in charge, hesitated to give me a GS-4 [General Schedule], but my friend had just gotten a GS-10 (laughter).  And so, and I said, "Now, I'm going to be her assistant," and she even told me, "Well, you know, I go through Maine every summer, and you'll take over."  And our psychologist friend, he would come in, so forth.  And the responsibility lie with me and having the patients brought down by the folks in charge of their wards, you know.
Story_ID: 378147
Speaker 1: What was the Washington School of Psychiatry [Washington, D.C.]?  Did you attend that?
Speaker 2: Washington School of Psychiatry was actually--I don't know whether they're still alive or not.
Speaker 1: Did you go there?
Speaker 2: But I took courses there on how to recognize, you know, certain phases, forms of mental illness and so forth.  And I decided to try to learn on my own, more about the field, on my own because I was denied that kind of time off from this job because this, the lady in charge.  It was really, it was really an offshoot of occupational therapy and, of course, the art therapy was a part of the occupational therapy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of patients did you work with?
Speaker 2: Patients?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with art therapy.  What kind of patients did you work with?
Speaker 2: Well, I fit into the category of working with the indigent and, of course, I did a very--I think I did a very good job because here's this lady who seems to be at home working with the, would-be bank robbers or so forth (laughter), the white ones, and this, and for the black people who are unable to really talk about their illness in the same way.  And, of course, they were diagnosed at the same time, not given too much help.  And, well, I took pride in working with them because I would sketch, make portraits and so forth, and I took particular pride in one young man who had been committed for what I don't--I'm not quite sure.  And he had made up, like a mural, of the kinds of things he was interested and we talked about and so forth.  And it turned out, he had been in the [U.S.] Army.  And I said, can you read and write?  He couldn't read or write.  And I, you know, the kinds of things that they could express themselves because they were poor, and, of course, they were diagnosed as having mental troubles.
Story_ID: 378148
Speaker 1: Now, all the time that you were doing the art therapy, you were still painting?  You were doing a lot of painting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my own--I had started my--
Speaker 1: You were painting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, I did, when we came down here [Washington, D.C.] and I, as I said, had found some other outlets too.  And I became friendly with some of the folks.  And then I, I made a painting which one of my newfound friends had told me, "Oh, you know, they're buying art for the Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois] now, and so--and said, and maybe if you send, you could send a slide, you never know.  They might buy it."  So I did, and I don't know--have you been to Johnson Publishing Company in recent years?
Speaker 1: Not in recent years, no.
Speaker 2: My painting hung next to the office of Mr. Johnson's mother [Gertrude Johnson Williams].  It's called 'Grandmother's Birthday,' you know the painting?
Speaker 1: I was there a long time ago.  And it's still there, I bet.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was just so surprised.  At the time I sold it for very little.
Speaker 1: How much?  Can you tell me how much you sold it for?
Speaker 2: About three hundred dollars.  And I understand it's insured for a thousand.  And you should see the beautiful frame (laughter).  And--
Speaker 1: Where else did, where else were you able to sell your art during these years?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't feel that I have been in the company of many place, people or places except the D.C. Commission on the Arts [D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities].  I did become, no, they did become one of the sources of my income toward having these arts classes and so forth because the D.C. Commission on the Arts receives money from the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] and so forth.  And I, they, they--they did buy several pieces from me a few years back.  It was not what, you know, they were--ask, not to ask too much for.  And that's called art in public places.  So they're (laughter)--
Story_ID: 378149
Speaker 1: I noticed another achievement that you made, another achievement.  You went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and you got a degree there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's, that's a bit--that I did not actually plan either because folks would say, now, you see Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York], arts, it's a college.  But at the time that I was seeking my certificate and was the full four years, but the art schools did not, they did not concern themselves with a college degree.  I think it's probably true with all of them, you know.  And so, anyway, the same son who I talked about in the [U.S.] Navy, Richard [Richard Victor Powell], he had gone to, enrolled himself at Howard.  And he had become friendly with some of the new students, one of whom was Donny Hathaway, and they worked together too.  And, of course, as you know, Donny was quite famous.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so he knew everything was going on.  He says, "You know, they started a course, what they call University Without Walls at Howard."
Speaker 1: At Howard?
Speaker 2: "And why don't you try to, why don't you try to get in?"  And so I told him, well, there too was another Chicago [Illinois] artist, [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson.  Do you know Jeff?
Speaker 1: I know of him, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), okay.  And he was a head of the art department--
Speaker 1: Art department at Howard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And well, I introduced myself to Jeff, you know, and well, not only did he meet Richard in Chicago, and seems like which, he took over Richard's apartment or vice versa or something.  But then he said, "Oh, oh, my gosh."  He says, "Here I am writing, I'm writing a thesis, I'm writing about you.  And the--."
Speaker 1: He was writing about you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In the Harlem--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: The same as (unclear) you were talking about.  He says, "The Harlem art project and the artists.  Oh," he says, "such a pleasure."  So anyway, he was very nice.  And so he gave me, he more or less said he'd be my mentor here, you know, faculty person.  And I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, and that's how you came to get a degree from Howard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how I came to get a degree.
Speaker 1: What year was that, that you got your--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: You got a--what degree did you get?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What was the degree?
Speaker 2: Bachelor fine arts and education.
Speaker 1: Fine arts?
Speaker 2: I think it was bachelor of fine arts.  He told me I could, I can teach if I wanted to, something with this degree.  But the lady in charge, her name was Anita Hackney [Anita Moore Hackney].
Story_ID: 378150
Speaker 1: When you were at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in the school without walls [University Without Walls] studying art--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did you know and meet Lois Jones [Lois Mailou Jones] at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: Was she around?
Speaker 2: Yes, prior to that, and I don't know (unclear).  My children have been instrumental in many ways in finding about things, like, of course, my daughter [Phyllis Powell Washington] (unclear) Blue Cross, Blue Shield.  But, Richard [Richard Victor Powell], again, he had found out, you know, he says, "You and daddy [George Powell] have not taken any trips, any long trips or anything.  In fact, I don't think I've been on a plane with you."  And so it was this 'round the world trip, and Lois Jones had, had the trips planned for her students each year.  And this was a biggie.  This was a big--this was around the world.  And so we found, we said, okay, we'll try to go.  And that, actually, I think I met Lois before, but it, more and more, a closer friendship.  And actually, there weren't that many students who signed up, but there were some people, older people and so forth, and we had a wonderful time.  It was, only about seventeen or eighteen of us, you know.  And we went around the world in thirty-five days.
Speaker 1: Wow, with Lois?
Speaker 2: With Lois (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) An introduction to all the countries.  And, well, of course, Africa was not included, but we went to New Delhi [India], Hong Kong, you name it.  It was that, yeah.
Story_ID: 378151
Speaker 1: You started, I think it was 1969, something called Tomorrow's World Art Center [Operation Heritage Art Center; Tomorrow's World Art Center, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tomorrow's--
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.  What was that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's another thing.  Since, living in the Bronx [New York] and so forth, neighborhood, as neighborhood folks and people who want to improve their, you know, environment and so forth, we had made up an organization, Patona [ph.] community organization, cooperate in the interest of your neighbor and so forth.  And, and those folks, they used to make a paper, and they turned our house into a meeting place and so forth and so on.  And so therefore, I think that sort of helped me to want to do things when I didn't come down to Washington [D.C.], not knowing anyone, I soon did find out that there were groups of artists.  Number one, I was able to be admitted in the D.C. Teachers College [District of Columbia Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] for the Saturday classes and so forth.  And then the other was, mingling with more people, I decided to work part time with the department of recreation [D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation] and so forth, and they, too, had the art classes and so forth.  And this was on, I--when I had the studio on 14th Street, my son, Richard [Richard Victor Powell], decided to go back to Chicago [Illinois] to live, and I walked the streets, and I found this spacious and very nice building.  And it had a office available, and so I rented that as a studio for myself.  And then I said--the next one became available.  I rented that.  And then my mind, to me, I said people aren't doing enough for each other here.  It's not like New York [New York].  I didn't see this feeling of coming together.  And that really was a no, no.  So, then I said, well, there was this young man who I had met through just association of one another, you know, attending the neighborhood affairs and so forth.  And he said, oh.  He had just put together Operation Heritage, and I said, "Well, that's nice.  What do you do?"  And he named how he wanted it, just enlarged in terms of writing all of these kinds of things, including arts.  And I thought that was great.  And, but then I had the space, but he had the idea.  And, but he talked, talked, talked in thankfulness, and to this day, he--I sort of thank him in a way, too, because I said, you know, to do--and talk about something and not being able to have a team.  So that was when I first put in for the first grant to the national endowment to have classes up at this, at the art center which we first named Operation Heritage Art Center.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And, so that went on several years.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 378152
Speaker 1: And then (clears throat), it went on that I, I made friends with the mental health center folks who had just opened a building near right where this building is on 14th Street [Washington, D.C.].  And they gave us permission, gave me permission to have the children paint on the walls.  And, you know, just the wood while it was in process of being built.  And done so everything is fine, but soon as--the kids would get out and were painting spontaneous pictures which didn't appeal to some people.  And one of the neighbors said, "What are you having those children paint all that stuff on the walls for?"  He made a remark.  And I said, "Well, this is great."  You know, and I thought it was.  But then the artists who's working with them, my assistant, he said, he just--he got mad.  He said, "What on earth do they expect?  Artists are the creators of tomorrow's world.  Artists are the creators."  And I said, "Oh, yes, they are."  So I got together with my husband [George Powell] and Walter [ph.] and the guy and some of the others, and then I told the other guys, I said, "No, it's not gonna be Operation Heritage [Operation Heritage Art Center] for me.  You can keep on working at it, but from now on, it's Tomorrow's World Art Center [Washington, D.C.]."  And I, I shied away too, from the black, black, black thoughts because I have always felt that working multi-culturally is an asset, and I think, personally, I think it's the way to go.
Story_ID: 378153
Speaker 1: --This letter from President Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], how did you happen to get this letter?  What was the occasion?
Speaker 2: Well, this is a treasured letter from our former president, Ronald Reagan.  And actually, it was sent to me through an affair which was given to honor me in 1979, and my daughter [Phyllis Powell Washington] was the chairperson of that group of folks who honored me, my daughter who is here.  And I, I really, was not (laughter) as I said, I'm not quite sure who was the person in charge, but I was quite honored to receive it.
Speaker 1: What did he--what did the president say to you in the letter?  Could you read it?
Speaker 2: Oh, "Dear Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Georgette Seabrooke Powell].  I have just learned that a group of your friends and admirers will be honoring you, and I want to send my congratulations.  Not only have you made the world a more beautiful place through your art, but you've given others the skills to develop and perfect their own artistic gifts.  You are the rare combination, a doer and a teacher.  Nancy [Nancy Reagan] asked me to convey her own best wishes.  God bless you.  Sincerely, Ronald Reagan."  A very beautiful letter.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: One of your treasures, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 378154
Speaker 1: What are some of the, briefly some of the other community art projects that you developed and led.  You were telling me--
Speaker 2: Yes, well, the other projects that I took great pride in developing was when we were able to move into what we thought was going to be an art (laughter), an art center, downtown Washington [D.C.].  It was in, in one of the, old merchandise buildings where merchandise was (unclear) Landsberg [ph.].  And when we moved into that--we were told that that would be turned into an arts center.  Unfortunately, we were only able to stay there a few years.  But at that time, we did develop friendship among each other and new programs.  And the new programs that I added which were unlike my 14th Street, where I had my studio [Powell Art Studio, Washington, D.C.] at first, these, they were senior citizen groups and more children's young groups and much more exhibits.  And having, finding our way to places to exhibit, we were able to have exhibits in Children's Medical Center [Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C.], the Martin Luther King Library [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, Washington, D.C.], and many other areas throughout the city, and as a group, I, I called to the artists who I worked with, the Capitol City Artists and so the Capital City Artists, they would get together and, for a small fee, we would be able to have an exhibit and reception, and be introduced to others in the, in the area, yeah.

Speaker 1: By my count, you exhibited seventy-two times.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, by my count, you had seventy-two exhibits, all the way from New York City [New York, New York] to Washington [D.C.] and other places.  Which of those exhibits, maybe one or two or three, stand out in your mind?  Are there any exhibits that kind of stand out in your mind today?  Seventy-two is a lot exhibitions.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Are there any that really, you remember especially?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say two, beginning at an early age (cough), excuse me, recognition as being, you know, an artist, a recognized artist, it started, I would say at late 19--like I think 1938, '39 [1939].  And then in 1940, I was awarded the painting prize from Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana].  And, and in fact, it's very interesting because I told my husband [George Powell], since he loved photography so, I had him take a picture of me with my, our first son [George Wesley Powell], as mother and baby.  And he won the award until the next year.  I have exhibited in Chicago [Illinois] and some other areas.  Of course, the most prestigious in the '60s [1960s] was being chosen to go to the FESTAC festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria].  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that the '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Seventies [1970s]? No.
Speaker 1: I think it was the '70s [1970s], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That was in Lagos, Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lagos, yeah.  That's--
Speaker 1: It's 1977.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1977.
Speaker 1: You know why I know that?  'Cause I was supposed to go.
Speaker 2: Oh, you were?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and some other people got the mails all messed up, and I didn't get a chance to go.  But I was supposed to have gone.  But anyways, tell me about FESTAC?  Tell me about FESTAC?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you were not the only one because it seemed there was someone else in charge before Jeff.  And then when Jeff took it over, there was some hard feelings among some other artists, and then apparently, this listing had been made.  And it became so big and so forth, some names were dropped, and, of course, since I was living in Washington at that time, and was able to find out a bit more, said, "Please don't leave me out."  Of course not, of course not, you know, one of those things.
Speaker 1: So that was a highlight then, going to Lagos?
Speaker 2: That was a highlight.  We, we exhibited at, you know, at, at the Nigeria gathering.  It was really, really so different.  And to this day, then I, I don't think I've, have ever experienced anything like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 378156
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you ever exhibit in Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I did, because I think it was 1980.  This young lady (unclear).  I can't--her name's on the tip of my--her father was a writer.  She had the, made up an exhibit, Phyllis [Phyllis Powell Washington]--oh, I'm trying to remember.  The--
Speaker 1: It was called 'Forever Free' ['Forever Free: Art By African American Women, 1862-1980'].  That was 1981?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Was that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, that's right.  Yes.  And so, and in fact, since I--not that I lived in Charleston, just made visits and so forth, but I always liked to--I guess assert myself that I'm a Charlestonian.  And so I, before the exhibit or before we even reached Charleston, and my painting was chosen, one of those for the exhibit, I did let them know--who was it?  It was through the press in some way.  And it was just wonderful when I, when I got, when I reached Charleston, the television, they were waiting and asking me questions, and so forth.  And George [Powell's husband, George Powell] and I when I was interviewed--one of the radio stations, television stations, and toward the end, my painting was chosen because they had a black arts festival [Charleston Black Arts Festival; MOJA Arts Festival: A Celebration of African American and Caribbean Arts].  And I was asked to--so I think it was one of the beer companies that paid for it, had a beautiful poster.  In fact, I, that was the highlight of that Charleston introduction for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's great.
Story_ID: 378157
Speaker 1: How did your work change over the years from the mural work at Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] and Queens Hospital [Queens General Hospital; Queens Hospital Center, Queens, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that--
Speaker 1: --to the easel work, and then in later years, how did your work change over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, as a young artist, and I think most people in that era, we learned how to paint, oil paint.  And I made some very, some very--well, I think it's very great, good.  In fact, I had some reproductions of them.  And so I think they're, you know, outstanding.  But then later on when I'd really begun to paint the second time around, acrylics, I found out, could be used in the same way.  And I, I was able to paint and to mix colors, and colors were bright, brighter.  So I started painting in acrylic.  And then I decided that I might have a--try the collage and the collage, of course, is mixed media, and so you might have torn paper and all that sort of thing, you know.  And that, I guess, that had been the kind of media in which I really had been using in past years.  And (unclear), there's always a story too with all of these kinds of things that happened, it seems in my house, when I made this outstanding--I call it outstanding, this one with this lady.  And that was torn paper, sand, everything, you know.  And there was a young man who living in housed, one of the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] students at the time, and then he said, "Oh, you made that?"  Well, do you know, he told me last year that now he is an outstanding collage artist, and he's making much more--a lot of money.  And I got it all from you tearing up paper (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's great.
Speaker 2: I thought that was funny.
Speaker 1: That's very good.
Story_ID: 378158
Speaker 1: I think we're coming down to the end, and you've done very, very well--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --in this interview, and very good stories.  Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview that I haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, I guess it's up to individuals.  I would say as a, as a person of my age now, I do find people living longer and so forth, and I do feel that more time could be given, and they, integrate it into the (unclear) of learning and doing in the way that they would like to continue their life.  And I think it's very important because I see that so many people used to think older people as just being in a rut, but it isn't that way anymore.  They're very alert, and I have a 103 year old cousin, and I spoke to her two days, and here she is telling me about the election and so forth.  She's in New York [New York].  And she is so alert, you know.
Speaker 1: Have you painted anything recently?  Have you done anything recently?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't done anything.  I sketch sometimes, but I, I call myself--I tell people, I say, I'm meditating because I'm trying to go over the kinds of things I'd like to write about.  And unfortunately, I haven't been able to get this written.  And that's, that's an aspiration: to write (laughter).
Speaker 1: Write, okay.
Story_ID: 378159
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, [HistoryMaker] Allan Crite, Allan--
Speaker 2: Allan?
Speaker 1: Allan Crite from Boston [Massachusetts], the artist?
Speaker 2: Oh, he and I--is he still living?
Speaker 1: Yes, he's a little older than you are, but--
Speaker 2: He exhibited at Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: He probably did.  He did a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, this gentleman--and this is something too, he came to Washington [D.C.], and talking about black history and so forth, and Joan [ph.]--we had, well, there was a white guy who very much in (unclear) well, forms of art.  He's an artist.  And so he said, you know, "I'm looking for somebody to show and talk about the arts for this occasion."  And so my friend, his name is Martin, Martin Fesiah [ph.], he says, "Oh you're looking at the right person now."  And so anyway, I got together with him that week, and found myself on a plane to Pittsburgh.  And that is the coldest place (laughter).  But then he--had a wonderful ovation.  And he showed--his work was shown too.
Speaker 1: Did he?
Speaker 2: I, I'm sure it was.  He does sculptural.
Speaker 1: Yeah, his sketches.  Well, last time I saw him, he said he gets up every morning and he sketches something every morning, he said.  He's a little older than you are.  But he says, I still sketch every morning.
Speaker 2: All right, now, all right.
Story_ID: 378160
Speaker 1: Let me ask you another kind of wrap-up question.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How you feel about the way you've led your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, the way I've led my life?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I think, well, you know, looking back, I guess, I think there was a time that I, I would think to myself, will I ever rise above this? Not that, you know, what people must understand was being a woman, and you get the--and then you marry and you have children and so forth.  And then you find yourself, now, should you pursue something in your later life or during your marriage, during your marriage?  And then I was thinking, well, am I getting--when will I get back to my painting?  I said, here I am a person, the first thing I do in the morning and the evening, I was always at the easel.  And that was my life early on.  And so I was happy to have had the experience of rekindling that same feeling later on in life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think it's re--it has been a reward for me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 378161
Speaker 1: Last question, I think.  How would you like to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you.  Well, you know, I think I'd like--in fact, I'm just so surprised that my, at the recent party that I had, that I had so many people who expressed themselves as, as their interests and their wanting to be a part of my life.  And the most flattering statement too from one of the artists, she--and I said, you know, well--I was going someplace or doing something.  And she says, would you--I said, you know, at my age--, "What do you mean at your age?  You don't have any friends your age.  Your friends are our age."  (Laughter) I said, well, I said, well, how flattering that can be.  And that is to be able to assimilate my thoughts and to talk to people of all ages.  And I think it's very, very important and having a blessing of being able to do it. I, I feel it's very great.  And, hopefully, getting myself into the writing and the painting to a certain extent again.  Thank you.

Speaker 1: This, that's a picture of a mural ['Recreation in Harlem'] which was painted at Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] in the '30s [1930s], and say, 1935, and it was under the Federal Art Project [Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project] and it was primarily to, call it a recreation room for the nurses in the Harlem Hospital building.  I was attempting to show the different activities in the community by painting that picture.  It's an oil on canvass, and it was quite colorful at the time that it was made.
Speaker 2: I think that one's very interesting because I attempting and did have an annual affair which was called Art in the Park.  I started in 1966 on the grounds of the (unclear) giant parking lot.  And that is in Meridian Hill Park [Washington, D.C.].  And that, as you see, is in '90 [1990].  And that gentleman came as--became a showcase of the afternoon.  Apparently, he's a wrestler.  I did not know him.  But he drew attention to the Art in the Park.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: You know, I, looking at old pictures, I believe this has become quite famous.  It appears in the book of Romare Bearden and Jake Lawrence [Jacob Lawrence], and it is a picture of all of the folks, the artists, dancers and so forth in our group who were the new employees of the Federal Art Project.  It's in front of the 306, 141st Street, and that's gained a name as the famous 306 where we met and congregated, to have meeting and to meet each other.  And I'm picture there with the others.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, good.
Speaker 2: I was one of the nominees, and it was a lifetime achievement award, something which I had won before.  But this is a recent event, and that was taken several, several years ago.  I think it was 2002?  I can't see, yeah, I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You said it was The Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right, next.  Okay, tell us about this?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  They're ready.
Speaker 1: That picture appeared in one of the, one of the periodical in the Urban League, I believe.  But it's, it's of a drawing, a charcoal drawing, which I made at an early while, when I attended the Harlem Arts Workshop, and that was as a teenager.  And I--that young lady, she was one who posed for us quite often.  In fact, the picture on the wall there, which I have also included with a linoleum block print, which I had made that same year at the Harlem, at the workshop.
Speaker 2: Art in the Park expanded, and became something to look forward each year (laughter).  This picture depicts one of the activities in which we encouraged the young people to paint their own mural and set aside art supplies and so forth, inviting them to paint and we provided the supplies.  That's Malcolm X, Meridian Hill Park.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is my family.  And it--it was at a birthday party a couple of years ago, as you (unclear).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: My sons, Wesley [George Wesley Powell] and Richard [Richard Victor Powell] and my daughter, and right behind me, Phyllis [Phyllis Powell Washington], and, of course, the occasion is, I think that was about the eighty-eighth birthday party or something like that.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This, that picture was in the yearbook at the time that I thought I would receive my certificate from Cooper Union art school [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York].  And I was all set and had attended all the activities, including, included in the book, and, of course, it meant a great deal because everything happened in a way that I had my expectations failed at the time, but I later received my certificate.
Speaker 1: And what year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, at the time that I received the certificate, it had to be many years afterwards, and I'm not quite sure just what that year is, right offhand, but it's a time that I should have graduated.  That would have been in '36 [1936], I think.  Is that the--'36 [1936].  Am I correct?  Is there a date on there?
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven [1937].
Speaker 2: Thirty-seven [1937], okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You got in 1973.
Speaker 2: I know I got it before I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Maybe 1970.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have a certificate of graduation from Howard, but I don't have it here.
