Story_ID: 473326
Speaker 1: Back to your mother again. Talk--let's talk about your mother, what you remember of her--talk about those memories you had of your mother.
Speaker 2: My mother, my mother was born in, my mother was born in Hallettsville, Texas. They moved to Houston, Texas, in an area called the Heights [Independence Heights]. A part of, part of Houston that was incorporated, the only part of Houston that was incorporated, and it was composed of about eight hundred blacks. And, finally became incorporated and became a part of, a part of Houston. Part of the Carroll family, her father [Andrew Carroll] was a minister. She had ten or eleven brothers. They moved to Houston. They were more into the trades. Her brothers were contractors and carpenters, and built their first home in--in Independence Heights, that's where it was. They built their first home in Independence Heights. Very prominent business and entrepreneurs when the city was incorporated. And, when she left, she left Independence Heights, and she went off to college, she went off to college and there she met my father [Fred Parrott, Sr.]. My father's from Mansfield, Louisiana, and they were married. As I recall, she--he was in dental school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and after they got married, they moved back to Houston, Texas, and I was born. And, she, she was a very vibrant woman, way ahead of her time. A leader in the community, an educator--went on to get the highest degree at that time, a master's degree in special education that no one, no one, black or white at that time, had a degree in special education from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]. I remember, before she got her degree, before she got her degree, she was always very afraid of supervisors and superintendents. She'd spend hours and hours in the preparation of her lesson plans. She's teaching in the, in the elementary school, and I said to her, "What are you doing, same things over and over again?" And she would continue to do it. She'd stay up all times of the night. She always had a library, always read, read tremendously, and wanted to be somebody. And once she got her master's degree, she just really, just, just wasn't afraid of the superintendent, wasn't afraid of anybody, but before--you must remember, this is in segregated times. And, went on to become quite an educator, quite a leader. Became president of every organization--flower--I guess it was the book club, the flower club, dental society, president of--president of every organization there. Was into arts before arts was well known, at that time.  And, really developed a, a strong leadership in the, in the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association]. She travelled all over the world, visiting YWCA over the world. She established-- and even today when I go back, they recognize Mollie C. Parrott [Mollie Carroll Parrott] as an activist, as a visionary, as a lady. I hear it all the time, "She was my mentor." "I have the greatest respect for her." "She taught me great work ethics." She felt that education was so vitally important, especially for African American men. At age sixteen, she sent me away. She, she really had a dislike for, for Caucasians. Really disliked Caucasians, because she is a generation from slavery, and she, she sent me away at sixteen to a northern school because she said, "Fred [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], I want you to learn all you can about those white devils." And, she subsequently mellowed down a little bit and realized her a Christian lady, and realized that, that you have to be diverse to, to, to make it in this great country that we live in. And her struggle in going to school--she would--it took her years to, to get her, get her master's. She worked in the day and in summer she would, she'd go to Boston University in the summer times to, to pursue her advanced degree; quite a lady, quite a lady.
Story_ID: 473327
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the things that she [Parrott's mother, Mollie Carroll Parrott], some of the foods that she would cook when she'd cook some of your favorite meals (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She disliked cooking. She felt that that was--and it showed up in her cooking--and she just felt this that, I guess, primarily because of slavery, and having to cook. She was not a slave, but she was a generation from slavery, 1900. She just never felt that--she had more to give to the world than to cook. She would cook because--she took cooking as a chore. To, like to some people--cooking is really an art, it's creative, there is a talent, 'cause you can mix love, you can mix warmth, you can mix caring, you can mix, put a little sex in there and mix it all up and you have a fantastic cuisine. But she just threw something or other on the table, and threw it on there. There was no love in the food, and the food showed it; didn't like cooking; cooked only because she had to cook for her family.
Speaker 1: What about Christmas or Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: The same. She made an effort to do it, but it was as though--as I'm saying, cooking is very creative, it takes a lot of talent. You have to put love into it, put sex into, put caring into it, mix it all up and make it something beautiful and tasteful. She was not into cooking.
Speaker 1: How often did you see your mother?
Speaker 2: Uh, mother--I saw--my mother was a very busy lady. My mother was trying to prepare herself to, to, to be somebody, you know. I saw her on a day-to-day basis, of course, but she was busy. She'd stay up to three and four o'clock in the morning studying, wake up in the morning studying.
Speaker 1: Was it difficult for you as a young man growing up knowing that mama was busy, but she still kept you--used to give you some time?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. She gave me time, as a matter of fact, that's how I learned how to cook. She'd come home for--she was a teacher--she'd come home from school. We'd have greens and ham hocks--she'd say, "Boy, wash those greens twelve times, each leaf, twelve times, not eleven times, twelve times. Put that oil in there," you know, oil or grease, put the oil in there. By the time, by the time--she'd time me---by the time, it's almost ready, I'd hear walking up, walking to the door to put the final touches on it. For a long time, mother and myself, we lived together because my father [Fred Parrott, Sr.] practiced dentistry in another, in another city. So a long time we were, we were together.
Speaker 1: We'll come back to him in just a little bit. Talk about those memories, the good memories that you have about your mother.
Speaker 2: All my memories were great about my mother. She's just, she's just, just a wonderful, wonderful lady, very inspirational. Believed that a man should work, instilled principles and work ethics in me, community, spirit of community, spirit of giving back. She was a community person, I'm a community person, been working in the community for twenty years, probably the result of the influence that she had on me.
Story_ID: 473328
Speaker 1: Now I know you, being a typical young man, you have some bad days, did she [Parrott's mother, Mollie Carroll Parrott] ever dispense a little discipline on you sometimes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she used to spank me quite a bit because of the, of the frustration of somewhat being a single parent, being a parent. The husband [Fred Parrott, Sr.] working elsewhere and having to hold the responsibility as most black woman today, or in the past; having to carry the burden of their husbands off working elsewhere. So, some frustration that she had--she used to--one thing she did is she taught me to eat everything. There's nothing that I--today there's nothing that I dislike.
Speaker 1: So if it was broccoli, you don't have a problem with broccoli?
Speaker 2: I have no problem with anything. She fixed it up and called it something else, and say, "Oh, this is good, eat it." A very kind, generous, lovely lady, beautiful lady, no nonsense lady, very disciplined, very focused, very committed, very dedicated and hard-worker and goal orientated.
Speaker 1: When you were a young man, when her birthday came up or Christmas or one of those holidays, did you give her a gift--something like that?
Speaker 2: I was brought up to believe that--I never had birthdays, this is unusual. It's unusual (laughter). She felt that, this is unusual (laughter)--she felt that, she was the mother, she was the lady, mother who had to go through the pain and suffering for bringing me into the world, so I should give her a birthday present on my birthday. So, I never (laughter), I never had birthday parties, all the way up until she died, I gave her a birthday on my birthday present, and I never knew this. I thought I was the only child in the world who gave their mother a birthday present on her birthday, until I read my sister's book ['The Dawn at My Back: Memoir of a Black Texas Upbringing'] and she brought my sister [Carroll Parrott Blue]  up the same way. Where, my sister never had birthday presents, my sister had to give her a birthday present on her birthday. So, birthdays are not important to me.
Speaker 1: Interesting, interesting, interesting. Gosh, even today, is that how you feel (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Even today, I'm--I'm--birthday is meaningfulness to me, means nothing to me because I never had a birthday, never had birthday parties. Always celebrated my mother's birthday, on my birthday I celebrated my mother's birthday by, by giving her a present, giving her--glorifying her for bringing me into the world.
Story_ID: 473329
Speaker 1: Now, your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott], did she have sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: Yes. She had--family of eleven--I can't remember all the brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: She had eleven brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Eight or nine or ten or eleven, a large family.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get a chance to meet all of them?
Speaker 2: I met most of them.
Speaker 1: Were they around you a lot?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what did you guys do with your aunts, your uncles?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my aunts and uncles. Most of them lived in the Independence Heights, that was the Independence Heights that was incorporated right outside of Houston [Texas], where they had about eight hundred blacks, and they, they, they, most of them lived there. And, when it became a part of Houston, they stayed--remained there, they had businesses and great church corps, they had a mayor there, the whole bit. City all of its own, so most of her relatives stayed there. You know, we used to go out there, take the street car and go out there and visit them.
Speaker 1: How about family reunions, family gatherings?
Speaker 2: We never had family reunions, as I recall.
Speaker 1: Just didn't want to get into that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as I recall, they may have, but I left home at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Right, you said that. Now, the brothers, the aunts and uncles, they had children, they had children who have children, did you meet them?
Speaker 2: Some of them had children. Not a very close bonded family. I don't remember any first cousins or anything like that. I had one first cousin. He died very young. But I left Houston at sixteen and never really went back.
Story_ID: 473330
Speaker 1: Do you remember your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I remember my, my paternal grandmother. Her name was Henrietta, Henrietta Parrott. She was from Mansfield, Louisiana. She was illiterate; she couldn't write, couldn't read, was afraid of the telephone--wouldn't pick the telephone up--a very sweet, gracious lady.
Speaker 1: How much impact did she have on you in your life sir?
Speaker 2: Not very much impact. I would just see her on--go visit during Christmas. Never, never had the loving, warm and caring relationship with her. I knew that she was my grandmother, knew that she was afraid to pick the telephone up--wouldn't pick it up.
Speaker 1: Now this is your grandmother on your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott]--
Speaker 2: Father's [Fred Parrott, Sr.] side (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Father's side.
Speaker 2: Did not know my grandmother on my fa- on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Gotcha.
Speaker 2: That's the Parrott side.
Speaker 1: The Parrott side. What about your grandfather on the Parrott side?
Speaker 2: The only, the only grandparent that I knew was grandmother on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of your grandfather, her husband?
Speaker 2: I know the name, Alex Parrott.
Speaker 1: Spell that again, sir.
Speaker 2: A-L-E-X, Parrott P-A-R-R-O-T-T, Alex Parrott, Sr. Never met him.
Speaker 1: Never met him? Interesting, interesting. Do you recall times when your grandmother would, you'd come over or go to her house and she would cook you something or she'd give you a gift? Do you remember some par- Christmastime--?
Speaker 2: Oh, when I'd go to Mansfield, yes.  We used to, she used to cook (unclear) whatever--cut up a--kill a pig and pork and greens, and whatever they had. They were farmers, and I spent summers there with her, just one or two weeks.
Speaker 1: You would spend summers, about one or two weeks?
Speaker 2: You would spend summers? About one or two weeks.
Speaker 1: Was this annually or just--?
Speaker 2: No, just periodically.
Speaker 1: Just periodically. And they would always, she would always--Henrietta Parrott would always--how would she, how would she receive you when you'd come to her?
Speaker 2: Oh, lovingly, caring, happy.
Speaker 1: But you never saw your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No. He died, passed early (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He died early--I see. Okay. She never remarried?
Speaker 2: Never remarried.
Speaker 1: Okay. How many children did your grandmother have?
Speaker 2: Ten. Ten or more. A large family (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wow. A lot of children. A lot of family. Any reason why--I mean, you're in the baby business yourself, sir--why'd, why'd people at that time have large families then as compared to now?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was no information on contraception, and what have you. People just had large families at that time.
Speaker 1: Interesting--and kids, of course, were useful for whatever work they could do?
Speaker 2: Worked for the farm, they all worked on the farm. Parents were very innovative and they all farmed, and had a little store on the farm.
Speaker 1: I just want to go back for a second, you say you don't recall your grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: No, I do recall my grandmother on my mother's side. Not on my father's side (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And her name was--her name was?
Speaker 2: Grandmother on my mother's side was Hen- my grandmother--no, I don't recall my grandmother on my mother's side. The only--on my paternal side my grandmother was Henrietta Parrott.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the only grandparent that I knew.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I think her name was, Pollie [Pollie Carroll]. I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, how about your grandfather on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I know he was a minister. I think his name was Andrew Carroll.
Speaker 1: Andrew Carroll, C-A-R-R-O-L-L?
Speaker 2: L-L.
Speaker 1: Grandmother on mother's side. Okay. Did you ever get a chance to see the grandmother or the father (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Never did?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Their names were never talked about--never discussed?
Speaker 2: Talked about briefly, but I never knew them.
Story_ID: 473331
Speaker 1: Back to your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott], this lady obviously had a--because of the situation that you were in, where your father [Fred Parrott, Sr.] was--we'll talk about him in a minute--(cough) excuse me, this woman had a tremendous impact on you.
Speaker 2: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm gonna ask you something--please understand why I want to ask this question. When she died, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes. She died in my home in Marina City Club [Marina del Rey, California] at the--. I was a practicing physician and I went out to the hospital and I had a, I had a refrigerator in my home, and Tuesday she said, "Fred [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], this refrigerator is--you need a new refrigerator." I was off on Wednesday, and Wednesday we were going to get a new refrigerator. And Tuesday night, the refrigerator caught fire. And, she died that night from smoke inhalation and they called me from the hospital. I came back, we had a fire. And that must have been--that was in 1970--1976. Smoke inhalation at the Marina City Club.
Speaker 1: So, she was in your home, there was a fire at your house (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In my home, at my house.
Speaker 1: And she died of smoke inhalation?
Speaker 2: Smoke inhalation.
Speaker 1: I know that had to hurt you very deeply.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: If I may, some thoughts that went through your mind at that time about your mother? Can you remember, sir?
Speaker 2: Well, she tried to, you know, as I recall she was very, very intelligent. She got down on the floor; she tried to make her way to the door. She didn't stand up, she got down because you say, you know, get down on the floor. She tried to get her way to the floor, but, and I guess the smoke was so great, she couldn't make it. And, they broke in and they found her and they called me and let me know that she had passed.
Speaker 1: There was no one there with her?
Speaker 2: No, I had just left going to the hospital.
Story_ID: 473332
Speaker 1: Dr. Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], as you indicated your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott] passed away at your house in a fire. The feelings that you went through at that time--let me go back, a moment, and talk about the strength of the black woman in the home at that time in your life. What was that like, sir?
Speaker 2: The black woman was very strong, very, very responsible, very reliable. They really were the backbone of the family. They were the glue that kept the family together. Most of time the breadwinner, and they'd really be the person found president--CEO of the home, the management of the home. And I think that's the case in most families today.
Speaker 1: The mother's still the--
Speaker 2: The woman is still the--in successful homes, usually the woman has the strength to, to be the manager. It's amazing how strong women are and how they can assume all of those types of responsibilities. In today's capitalistic society, women have careers. They have to strive for promotions. If they--to give you an example, if there is, there's a opening for a position for a senior vice president, you might have a woman, a minority, Asian or what have you, a woman today can't use severe discipline in rearing, I have to go pick my kid up from the, from the babysitter. She has to be there, she has to assume the responsibility for her corporate life and still have some responsibility for the management of the home. And even though, even though, she may have a, she may have a responsible parent who is the husband, she's still looking out the back of his head--side of his head--to watch to see what he's doing. She may come in and allow him. But I think, as a gynecologist, a good woman is the first to get up in the morning, the last to go to bed. She knows how to get in the bed without being touched. She knows how to get out of bed without being touched. She knows how to get in the bed when she wants to be touched. But she is, I think that she is, she's just remarkable. She's very strong, she's very responsible. She's committed, she's dedicated, she's focused. And, I think if it wasn't for the maternal instinct, we would have more and more women who would be president, chairman of the boards and CEO of major corporations. But the maternal instinct is so powerful. So, a lot of them have the desire to be chairman; a lot of them go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and fine universities, and when that maternal instinct hits them they--and if they have a husband who is capable of taking care of her, they will defer their career to raising their children. So I have a great deal of respect for women. I don't know how they do it, but they do it. My mother was from that type of grain.
Story_ID: 473333
Speaker 1: We talked about your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott], we can come back to it a little bit later, but I'd just like to go over to the other gentleman in your life, your father.
Speaker 2: Father.
Speaker 1: His name was again?
Speaker 2: Uh, Fred Douglass Parrott, Sr. [Fred Parrott, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Sr. Okay. Talk about your father.
Speaker 2: Father was a--came from a large family, nine or ten siblings. He's the one, only one--my mother was the only one in her family--with a college degree. As a matter of fact, they used to call her Blackie. 'Cause she was the darkest one in her family. My father was the only one in his family that had a college degree. He went to Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee]. He got a dental degree and he sort of worked on the farm in Mansfield [Louisiana] and he worked to--at the railroad. He cut his--a lot--a lot of his brothers worked for the railroad and the mills. He got his foot amputated--a train ran over it. A very kind, religious man, deacon in his church, community activist, not--not as aggressive as my mother. He worked for a number of years at his practice in Mansfield, Louisiana. I think he moved back to Houston [Texas] during my teenage years. So, my mother raised me--raised me herself up until teenager, then I think he moved back, then, I was there for a short period of time, then I moved. So I didn't know him as well as I knew my--knew my mother. He--it was not a macho thing for a man, at that time, to take the sons out, so I can't remember many times my father ever taking me to any--any occasions. This disturbed me for a time, so I've asked African American men, "Did your father ever take you out?" They said, "No, my father was busy working." Never took me out. Mother always took me various places. So, this was a common thing at that--at that time. You have a--do you have any--did you have a general relationship where your father took you out? You did?
Speaker 1: Firstly, my--my father [William Brewington] was--he--I was raised without a father. My mother [Mosetta Smalls] raised me, (unclear).
Speaker 2: So I think we find in the African American families that fathers had very little to do with the raising of the children.
Speaker 1: And, why was that?
Speaker 2: Well, as I just told you, it was a macho thing at the time. He was so busy working and left all the responsibilities to the woman, I think.
Speaker 1: So the fathers made the babies, created the babies, and then went off and went to work to make--
Speaker 2: Went to work--
Speaker 1: --to support the children?
Speaker 2: --to support the children then left the raising of the children to the mother. I think it's just the opposite now, I think you find more and more younger African American men being associated in the--assuming the responsibilities of raising their children.
Speaker 1: But, sometimes some African American fathers get bad reputations because of that. They make these babies, and then they leave. Is that good?
Speaker 2: I think it's terrible. I mean it's irresponsible. But, I think it's getting better.
Speaker 1: When you did see your father and you knew he was your father, what was, you know, how did you feel about him--you didn't see him that often--you saw mama all the time--how did you receive him?
Speaker 2: Well, a very nice man. A very gentle man, very kind man, and we later became very close friends, good friends. He would come and visit me when I was in--very proud to come visit his son, so he spent--he spent a lot of--a great deal of time with me. Mother would come all the time.
Story_ID: 473334
Speaker 1: Now, this is when you had left Houston [Texas] at the age of sixteen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I was living here at the Marina [Marina City Club, Marina del Rey, California].
Speaker 1: In Los Angeles [California]. So you went from Houston to Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: No. I went from--I went from Houston first to Chicago [Illinois], then, then I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], then from Howard, I went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and from UCLA, I, I worked for Wyeth laboratories--Wyeth pharmaceutical laboratories [Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; Wyeth] for the year. But, in between there, I went to the Korean War. I got a direct commission as a first lieutenant in the Medical Service Corps. At UCLA, I got a graduate degree (cough) in microbiology and got a direct commission as a first lieutenant. Went to the Korean War and met doctors there and they sort of motivated me to go back to medical school.  So I was in the [U.S. military] service--
Speaker 1: (Cough) Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
Speaker 2: While in the service, I, I made applications to every pharmaceutical company in the country while I was, while I was an officer, and when I went to get an interview, I went to the interview as an officer. I got several offers to come in as the pharmaceutical representative--they didn't have many pharm- African American pharmaceutical representatives at that time, none on the West Coast. And, they called Chicago but I wanted to say in California. So I got offers to go to the Wyeth pharmaceutical company in Los Angeles and I accepted that. And, very interesting, I--
Speaker 1: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 2: I'd applied, I applied to medical school and I got accepted. And, so, at that time I could go into the general, general manager, to the regional vice president, to the regional manager, you can't do that today.  Because he hired me, so I could go to his office, through his secretary, go in and talk to him, E.V. Scott, Mr. E.V. Scott. I'd go and talk to Mr. Scott and give him my ideas on marketing, public relations, what have you. One day I told him I was in the office, given a detail to a, to a doctor and the dean of the medical school, and he said, "Young man, you should apply to medical school." "I want that, too, Mr. Scott." So, I was in the doctor's office, and the dean of the medical school was there and he'd heard of my needs and he asked if I was applying to medical school. I said, "What do you think, Mr. Scott?" I'd already been accepted to medical school. He said, "I think you should apply." I said, "I think you're right, because I can't become a manager, you know, I can't become a district manager with Wyeth." There were nine African Americans managers of, as managers of pharmaceutical management, at that time. So, I--he said, "I think that's a great idea. Come back and apply." So I came back two or three days--two days--two or three weeks after and filled out an application and I got accepted. He said, "Fantastic." I said, "Now what I'd like to do, I'd like to be the student representative for Wyeth while I'm in medical school," laid a business plan out, "and I will detail all of the dental students, all the pharmaceutical students, all the medical students while I'm there." "What a brilliant idea, Fred [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott]." He said, "As a matter of fact, I'm going back to, I'm going back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]," that's where our corporate office was, "I'm going back to the corporate office, and I'll mention that to Mr. Smith, Stewart V. Smith [Stewart Smith]." And he came back and said, "He didn't like the idea, but you have my permission to write a personal letter to Stewart V. Smith, senior vice president, Wyeth Laboratories." I wrote it, type, type, type, peck--to little, Stewart V. Smith, (background noise) outlining my ideas that I will be marketing all of the medical students, all of the dental students, all the pharmacy students about our, about our products. And what they would do when they grad- these would be senior students--what they would do when they get to hospitals where they're going to intern, they would have all the names of the students that I have detailed on our specialty products. I had the names written down, where they were going to intern, products that I have interviewed them on--that I have detailed them on. He said, "I think that's a great idea, Fred." So he sent that letter in and I didn't hear from him, didn't hear from him for two days.
Story_ID: 473335
Speaker 1: Then, I get this special delivery letter, "Fred [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], we think this is just a fantastic idea. We like it, but first of all you're going to have to get permission from the president of Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee] because they don't allow medical students to work." So, I went to Meharry, took my letter, made an appointment to see the president of Meharry Medical College. He read the letter and said, "Oh my god, I've never of such." Called the dean. The dean said, "I've never heard of such." He called the board, and the board voted unanimously. And, I had to stay on, I had to stay on campus, and they didn't give me a great grade point average to do, 3.5 that I have to maintain. So, I had a salary [from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; Wyeth]. I had a car, had products. I, the area was segregated, Nashville [Tennessee] is segregated, and I made a deal with--there was a black restaurant owner--that I'd bring all the students in on the weekends, and he gave me my meals the other five days a week. Him and his bar up there with all the whiskey, and champagne and wine, what have you. So when I take the students, I'd have the display table there and talk to them about our specialty products, have my photographer and take pictures of it. By this time, I'm dealing with the corporate office in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], now, and I send that back. And, wherever I, wherever I wanna go on the holidays I went. One year I went and worked in New York [New York]. I just called the corporate office and said, "I want to work in New York," went to New York. Every summer, I'd go back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and work with my doctors there. I was what you call a personalized representative. I called on all of the black doctors all over the West Coast. So, I'd be in my car and I leave Seattle [Washington], Oregon, San Francisco [California], Bay Area [San Francisco Bay, California]; all over the West Coast. So, I was the only, I was the--and all of my doctors were very, very, very cooperative with me. We had a company, Pfizer [Pfizer Inc.], that was our greatest competitor. They were selling penicillin $1.00--$1.10. And we had a product called Bicillin [Bicillin L-A]. I got all my doctors together, all my doctors together and we used to buy gross of Bicillin where I could serve--sell it at a competitive level to our--with the same price that Pfizer was selling it. So, my sales were always up and always high. So, I did, I did--then when I went to medical school, then I became the student representative. The richest guy in my class; had a car. That's it. It was quite an experience. Everybody was afraid. Thought the professors would bother me. They didn't bother me. I had a two-bedroom apartment out there where they lived.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Knew everybody at Meharry, everybody knew me.
Speaker 2: Because of the fact that your father [Fred Parrott, Sr.] had graduated from there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no. The fact that I was a student representative. I fed ever--we had a--we had an infant formula called SMA [simulated milk adapted]. It was a baby formula. That's how I fed everybody--fed their babies, everybody's--was the SMA, I fed their babies. The bad thing about it was, well with me, is that I had to determine, do I wanna get familiar with, with the medical students? Medical students are poor, very poor. You have to know your personality. Now, if I would socialize with them and drink beer with them and when they would meet with our hospital representative when I send their names in, first of all, they'd say, "What do think about our student representative, Fred Parrott?" Well, if they didn't know anything about me, they'd say, "Well, he's great." If they knew something about me, they could say something negative. So I had, I had to make a choice, am I going to socialize with them, or fraternize with them, or just see them and be friendly and move on. I selected to not--go and have a beer or what have you--but not to really, really get them to know me. So if--now some people, some people have the personality that they can handle it. I don't have that type of personality. So I think, I think the lesson here is that you have to know who you are and what you are and what you're capable of doing.
Story_ID: 473336
Speaker 1: Back to your father [Fred Parrott, Sr.] for just a minute, he went to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] to dental school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went to Meharry.
Speaker 1: And he was a dentist?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you, you mentioned the fact that you didn't see much of him--maybe, would you say an average of once a year?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I--I'd see him, yeah. We had contact with one another, had a great relation--had a great relationship, he was a very nice man, he was a gentleman, deacon of his church, very Christian, very religious.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, it was interesting that you mentioned how you, when your birthday came up, how you your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott] would treat you for your birthday. How would your father treat your birthday and Christmas?
Speaker 2: He would give me presents, you know, he would give me presents.
Speaker 1: I'm just curious about the distance between Louisiana, where he worked at, and where you guys lived at in Texas. That was--how much of a distance was that?
Speaker 2: Six, seven hours.
Speaker 1: One way? Six to--so that was--it was--it was--
Speaker 2: By car, you know, by car.
Speaker 1: Didn't take the old airplanes, in those days, trains or nothing like that--by car? His practice was good--it was a good practice that he had in--in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I don't think he made a great, tremendous amount of money. He, he used to star- he did all right, but he was not a, what you'd say, a booming successful dentist. He made a living.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go--were you ever--did you ever go down to Louisiana to see him?
Speaker 2: I went to his office once or twice, as I recall.
Story_ID: 473337
Speaker 1: Did you ever have an interest in dentistry?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why's that?
Speaker 2: Well, I had an interest in wanting to be somebody. I wanted to be a doctor, whether it was dentistry (unclear). At that time, there was only a few things that you could do. You could be an educator, be a doctor, be a lawyer, dentist, only so many, only so many things that you could do. Today, you've got a hundred different type of things that you could do. But I knew I wanted to be a professional. There was never any question that I wasn't going to college.
Speaker 1: It was just a question of what college you were going to, yes?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what college did you choose?
Speaker 2: I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: For your undergrad- undergraduate studies. And, what did you--what were your undergrad studies in?
Speaker 2: Psychology.
Speaker 1: Psychology? Interesting. But you never wanted to become a psychologist?
Speaker 2: Wanted to come--to be a psychologist, wanted to be a clinical psychologist, but I couldn't get into the graduate school at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]. So I had to change over and do pre-med. Got a graduate degree in, in microbiology, and that's how I got into, got into Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]. When I left Meharry, I did an internship at L.A. County Hospital [Los Angeles County General Hospital; Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center, Los Angeles, California]. Then I was fortunate enough to get a, a fellowship at the University of Minnesota Medical Center [Minneapolis, Minnesota], you know, beforehand. In that same class of Mayo [Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota] fellows was Joycelyn Elders. Joycelyn Elders was the first black ma- surgeon general. She had a Mayo fellowship in obstet- in pediatrics, and I had one in OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology].
Speaker 1: This was at Meharry?
Speaker 2: No, at the University of Minnesota. We had Mayo fellowships together. So, we worked very closely together, while we were there. There was one other guy, one other guy named Benjamin Clark [ph.] from Denver [Colorado]. He had a Mayo fellowship in anesthesia--anesthesiology. So, there was three of us in that class, and a Mayo fellowship would mean that, we would get $250--$250 an hour--$250 a month that was tax-free. That was a lot of money at that time. When I left Meharry, when I left Meharry to go, when I left Meharry, I had saved $20,000. I saved $5,000 a year from my job, they were paying me--I was making as much money as the professors were making.
Speaker 1: So, you walked into a practice with money in your pocket already?
Speaker 2: When I came into practice, I had over $20,000, so I didn't have to borrow money.
Story_ID: 473338
Speaker 1: I'd like to go, again, go back to your father [Fred Parrott, Sr.]--try to get back to him again. He was a dentist. You, you said that you wanted to be a professional, not necessarily a dentist, but you wanted to be a professional. He--you didn't see him--you saw him on a regular basis. You sometimes would travel down to see him. But the re- talk about, if you would sir, the relationship between you and your father if you would.
Speaker 2: We had a great relationship, just not as, not as close a relationship as I had with my, you know, with my mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott]. But, we had a great relationship; he was a great man, very kind man, gentle man, but not a very talkative man. He just went about his business, enjoyed his work. He would--one thing he'd do, he'd fix breakfast in the morning, he goes to work and he comes home. He was a, he was a community activist, too, very active in the community, very active in the church, mentored a lot of dentists. Went back about four or five years ago and people still remember him, still remember my mother. It's a wonderful feeling to go back thirty and forty years and people still remember your mother and your father. So they were, they were, really made a significant impact in the community of Houston [Texas].
Story_ID: 473339
Speaker 1: Now, let's go back in life now, we got, we talked about your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott], we've talked about your father [Fred Parrott, Sr.], the relationship that you had, let's talk about your siblings. You had a sister, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Carroll Parrott Blue.
Speaker 1: Spell that--Carroll.
Speaker 2: Carroll, C-A-R-R-O-L-L, Blue, B-L-U-E, Blue, Parrott, P-A-R-R-O-T-T.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, was she younger than you or older?
Speaker 2: She's younger than I am.
Speaker 1: So, she was your only sibling that you had?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: No other one? And, what does she do for a living these days?
Speaker 2: Right now, she is a, she is a retired, distinguished, renowned professor of film and telecommunications. She was a professor at the University of California- San Diego State [San Diego State University, San Diego, California], for a number of years. She, she also graduated from Jack Yates High [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas]. She graduated from college, she went to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]. Then she went to--she got an M.F.F. [sic. M.F.A.] master of fine arts, University of California [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in film and director--film director and communication. She's done a number of documentaries. Well known independent--in the film industry. She was a fellow, one of few scholars at the film academy [American Film Institute]. That's where they accept talented, creative students from all over the United States--from all over the world, maybe about fifteen or twenty students. And she--prior to that she became an international photographer, and from photography, went into, went into film. She, she's presently doing consulting work at the--on the staff of the University of Ca- University of Houston [Houston, Texas]. She moved back home.
Speaker 1: So, she now lives in Houston, Texas, working as a consultant?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the university.
Speaker 1: Outstanding, see it's in the, the, the, it's there; the good roots were there, your family was there, the strong family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I gave--I told--I asked you to look up her, to look it up and you'd find a large history in, in there, 'Dawn at My Back' ['Dawn at My Back: Memoir of a Black Texas Upbringing,' Carroll Parrott Blue] D-A-W-N, 'Dawn at My Back.' And you can find, she has a lot of history in there about the family. She know, she knows about my maternal grandmother [Pollie Carroll]. She's done a lot of research, and you could--if you wanna add something to it, you can add to it. She knows about my--tell you a great deal about my mother and her background and her journey, hard journey through Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]. It would be interesting. 'Dawn at My Back,' just go to Google, or any of the websites, just type in 'Dawn at My Back,' by Carroll Parrott Blue, and the whole page will come up.
Speaker 1: Is this a documentary or is this a film that she did?
Speaker 2: Well, this is a book that she wrote about--it's a book of mother and daughter relationship, a very powerful book.
Speaker 1: In fact, we may ask you to recommend her to be another HistoryMaker, also.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A mother and daughter--you don't say. Okay. What was it like for you guys when you--she was younger than you by how many years?
Speaker 2: She was younger than me, about fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Oh, so there's a fifteen-year age difference?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, here you were for a long time, you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know, yeah, I didn't know her very well.
Speaker 1: Huh, so at sixteen you went, you left the house--
Speaker 2: I left the house.
Speaker 1: --and went to--
Speaker 2: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Chicago.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So here you were, and here you were--and now, seems almost like a replacement, you might say?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 473340
Speaker 1: When you first went to school, down in Houston, Texas, what were some of your early memories down there at school?
Speaker 2: I have very few--very little memory about my, elementary and junior high. I do remember, I was telling someone yesterday, we were talking in the fitness center, I do remember there was a, there was one guy, he was a bully, he used to wait for me every day when I came out (laughter). Every day, when I'd come out he'd be waiting for me. And that was one of the most frustrating, and devastating and frightening experiences of my life. I don't know whatever happened to him, but, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know his name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember--I was trying to think of his name the other day when I was trying to tell this guy. The guy was telling me, the guy was telling me that he was a bully--he was a white guy--he was a bully and then the black guy came up and got a foot in and put him with--separated them, and he knew the guy's name. But I can't remember this guy's name who was bothering me. But it wasn't a great, great feelings, and something happened to him, he might've gone to jail or something, but I was glad to get him off my back.
Speaker 1: Did he beat you up--?
Speaker 2: Aw, he did everything to me.
Speaker 1: He take your money?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have any money, but he--he--
Speaker 1: Take your food?
Speaker 2: Whatever I, whatever he did, he bullied me.
Speaker 1: And no one would help you at all?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: And this was in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in high school.
Speaker 1: And, in Houston, Texas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Man. You mentioned, okay, I'm trying to put this in a order now. Okay, you came out of high school. What high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Jack Yates [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Jack Yates?
Speaker 2: Yates.
Speaker 1: That's Y-A-T-E-S?
Speaker 2: J-A-C-K, Y-A-T-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a public school.
Speaker 1: In, in Houston, Texas; and what year, sir?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess it must have in the '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 473341
Speaker 1: Then you, like you said, college was a known thing, you was going to college. So you left high school [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas] and you went to college. Where did you go to school at, sir?
Speaker 2: I went to college at age sixteen at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: The Bisons. The campus, of course, isn't like it is today?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was it like back in those days, those early days at Howard University?
Speaker 2: Howard University, I was, I was very young, I worked a full-time job there, worked all the way through, through college, as part of my mother's [Mollie Carroll Parrott] training. One of the other highlights, I became an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] while I there. I missed a great of the college activity because my mother believed that a man should work. So I missed a lot of the dancing and, plus I was pre-med, I was not a big man on campus.
Speaker 1: But being an Alpha did kind of raise it up a little bit?
Speaker 2: A little bit, but I was a, I was a virgin 'til I was a senior in college 'cause I was focused on pre-med.
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: Pre-med students are not big men on campus.
Speaker 1: Interesting, because if you're pre-med you would think that you're going make some money one day, a girl would wanna latch onto you?
Speaker 2: No. You don't have time; you're focused on trying to get through medical school. No, pre-med students were not big man on campus. I had some friends who were big man on campus, but we didn't become friends until afterwards. I used to see them; they were big, big man on campus. My best friends, well we became friends afterwards, but beforehand, I used to work from three 'til eleven o'clock at night.
Speaker 1: I know the ratio of women to men in Washington, D.C., maybe--I--it might not be the same then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) it was at that time.
Speaker 1: So it was something like sixteen to one ratio.
Speaker 2: Right. Probably now.
Speaker 1: How about, what was it back then?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know. I wasn't into girls that much.
Speaker 1: But, Howard is a party school, as I recall.
Speaker 2: Was a, it was a party school. Then again, at that time, it was a really, really a color, color system. You know, black and white. Washington was mostly white and they sort of looked down on the black, more so at that time than it is today.
Speaker 1: Hm, interesting, because I know for a fact, since I have--
Speaker 2: Well, you're from the Washington area.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm from D.C., yes. I know that you have a lot of white guys going to school now at Howard University.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I understand that.
Speaker 1: Yes, the rate it's changed over.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For a variety of reasons, maybe they can't get into a school or they want to, whatever the case may be, but they're coming to Howard in large numbers.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Absolutely. So, your years at Howard University, they went by pretty fast for you?
Speaker 2: They went by very fast, very fast.
Speaker 1: You were able to, like you said, you had a job, you were living off-campus, enjoying the good life down there, but a pre-med person. That--what was the difficulty in--since--did Howard University have a medical school at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why--how--were you trying to get into Howard University [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did not get into Howard University.
Speaker 1: You were turned down?
Speaker 2: Uh, I don't know if I applied at that time, or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I was interested in psychology.
Speaker 1: Psychology. Okay. Okay. Then you--okay--
Speaker 2: From there I went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: You went to UCLA. Now, at UCLA you were in, in pursuit of--?
Speaker 2: Of psychology, but I couldn't get into, into the clinical program in psychology.
Speaker 1: So how long did you go to UCLA for, sir?
Speaker 2: Went to UCLA about four years.
Speaker 1: So, here you have a--now you've got a, a, a bachelor's degree from Howard University, and now you're going to UCLA, you now have a master's degree in?
Speaker 2: In bio- microbiology.
Speaker 1: Microbiology.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 473342
Speaker 1: And so now you've got these two degrees in microbiology, now comes the question of, I want to get into medical school. Now, talk about the decision that you made to want to go into medical school versus dental school, to follow in the footsteps of your father [Fred Parrott, Sr.].
Speaker 2: From UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], I went into the Korean War.
Speaker 1: You went to the U.S. Army?
Speaker 2: U.S. Army.
Speaker 1: And you were, since you had a lot of degrees, you became an officer.
Speaker 2: Became an officer.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, when you got your master's degree--should I go back a little bit--when did you--what year did you graduate from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] sir?
Speaker 2: Forty-eight [1948].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-eight [1948]. I was two years old then. And let me see, let me see, you graduated from, from UCLA, a master's degree from UCLA, in what year, sir?
Speaker 2: Fifty--
Speaker 1: Fifty-two [1952]?
Speaker 2: About '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay. Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, then went into U.S. Army, Korean War?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952] to '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952], '50 [1950], '51 [1951] to '52 [1952], something like that.
Speaker 1: All right, sir. So, you went to the U.S. Army as a--any specialty?
Speaker 2: First lieutenant, MSC, Medical Service Corps.
Speaker 1: Medical Service Corps, went to the Army as a member of the U.S. Medical Service Corps. Okay, at least, thank god, they brought you in as an officer, because sometimes, back in those days, you were brought in as an enlisted man. Even if you had a degree, they would bring you in as a--they didn't care, they just brought you in. Okay, as a medical service officer. And you attained--you came in as a first lieutenant or you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First lieutenant.
Speaker 1: Interesting. You were not a second lieutenant; they brought you in as a first lieutenant. Okay. Medical Service Corps as a first lieutenant. Interesting, interesting. And so you stayed a first lieutenant. Where were you stationed at, your first duty station?
Speaker 2: Tokyo, Japan.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tokyo, Japan. How long were you in Japan, sir?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: And what did you do in Tokyo, Japan?
Speaker 2: I was a bacteriologist, and I opened up a--then I worked for--on my moonlighting days, I opened up a--what--you see tailors who come in from Hong Kong; well, I opened up a tailor shop in, in Tokyo and I worked for Mohan Tailors [ph.] out of Hong Kong. So, I had--I would fit all the servicemen with, with suits and jackets and shirts from Hong Kong. I had a, had a Japanese tailor, we had a hotel, and I made a tremendous amount of money doing that while I was in the service.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say, you can make a little money when you're over there doing something like that, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, there was the business side of you, as well as the professional side?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see, roots for planning to become a businessman at that time?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you have two years over in Japan, Tokyo, Japan--
Speaker 2: And then I, then I went to, the--colonel decided to send me to Korea. Well, what I used to do, I'd made an arrangement that I would fly at the end of the month to Korea, and that would be tax free. I think we were making $200 or $300 a month as a first lieutenant. So, by flying in a combat area that would be tax free. So every month, I would fly over and fly back, so like the 30th or 31st I still was able to deliver cargo and come back. Then, the colonel decided he wanted to send me over to Korea. And, so, I never will forget, he invited me to his party, he's gonna head up a colonel's party, and I went. And, I met his wife, and I said, "You know, Colonel Lindberg [Robert B. Lindberg] is sending me over to Korea for three months. I want you to make certain that I only stay three months though, on the TDY [temporary duty]. I don't want to be over there more than three months, now, Ms. Lindberg (laughter)." Ms. Lindberg liked me, you know, I was a black first lieutenant and she liked me. And she said, "I'll see that you get back, Lieutenant Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott]." True enough, I got back within three months--served my duty.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) you know, so you know. (Laughter) The colonel's wife did you a favor.
Speaker 2: Did me a favor.
Speaker 1: I understand. So now, you're back and forth between Korea and Japan, and two years have gone by, now what happens next?
Speaker 2: Next, when I was in the service, I start--I worked with doctors, medical doctors that say, "You should go to medical school." That's when I start applying to pharmaceutical companies. I had planned I was going to work for a pharmaceutical company for six months. Get them to send me to medical school and that's what I did. I worked, I worked for them [Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; Wyeth] for six months, got them, got them to send me to medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], and the rest is history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The rest is history.
Story_ID: 473343
Speaker 1: Now you're in medical school, Meharry [Meharry Medical College] in Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 2: In Nashville, Tennessee (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I'm sorry, Nashville, Tennessee, excuse me, Nashville, Tennessee. Again, it's still down south, what was the flavor like for you at that time in, in, in your life?
Speaker 2: The flavor was great because I was student representative [for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; Wyeth], as I told you before, you know, I was the richest guy in my class, making more money than anybody, making more money than the professors, and living with the professors, two bedroom apartment--we said that before, we don't have a lot of time. So, life was good.
Speaker 1: Life was good. So, here you're now able (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Saving $5,000 a month.
Speaker 1: Ouch--$5,000, saving $5,000 a month.
Speaker 2: Graduated with $20,000, over $20,000.
Speaker 1: Graduated with $20,000.
Speaker 2: And from there, I went, as a fellow, to the University of Minnesota Medical Center [Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: Okay. What made you choose obstetrics and gynecology?
Speaker 2: Because I liked it, it's a, it's a happy specialty, you get only young people, very few complications. It's a specialty that, at one time, you could really be learned to be proficient in it. Mortality rate is very low. In my entire career, I never been into a, an intensive care unit but one time in my entire medical career. I wouldn't know how to operate in an intensive care, 'cause you're dealing with young people. Surgery is something that you can learn and you can perfect. And, it's just more of happy specialty bringing life into the world. The hours are not the best, but it's a, it's a, it's a very enjoyable, caring, loving specialty.
Speaker 1: And you bring babies into the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's part of it.
Speaker 2: Part of it and every, every father, it was mandatory that he would have to take the, take the class to be with the mother, for me. If not, they have to have some good reason, I wouldn't take them on, and if there's some reason why they wouldn't, wouldn't take the, take the class, and that helped out quite a bit, helped the mother. There's nothing more beautiful than seeing the father there with the mother. I can picture it now, the father holding the baby up and singing to it in a warm embrace and doing the bonding right there, right there in the, right there in the suite.
Speaker 1: When you're in medical school, 'cause you know as well as I do, that first class they give you, Medical 101, where you have to meet a cadaver for the first time, what was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Hm. Well, medical school was not really, really a problem for me. It was something that I wanted to do. Medical school was just a beautiful experience, I had no bad experience. Unfortunately, a lot of students have some bitter taste in their mouths about, about medical schools and they don't get back to the institution that made it all possible for them. We have our Real Men Cook Foundation, we have our Real Men Cook Foundation academic scholarship of excellence, where we have given over half a million dollars to the four historically minority medical schools [HBCUs]. We probably have approaching seventy-five scholarships we have given to, to four historically medical schools, that's Morehouse [Morehouse School of Medicine] in Atlanta, Georgia; that's Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee; Howard University [Howard University College of Medicine] in Washington, D.C.; and some of those scholarships are still going today. Just this year, we've gotten, received letters from, letters from students thanking us for the scholarships that we have given. We probably had more scholarships, student scholarships than any Meharry alumni at Meharry. We were leaving, giving back to the university. We're probably ranked up as top five, top alumni giving back to, to the institution that made it all possible for you.
Speaker 1: That's a blessing. Thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: I'd say it's been a, it's been a great journey.
Story_ID: 473344
Speaker 1: So, now you come out of medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], you're now M.D., now you leave there and you go--where do you go after that now?
Speaker 2: Came directly to Los Angeles, California.
Speaker 1: The City of Angels.
Speaker 2: The City of Angels.
Speaker 1: You opened up a practice here in town?
Speaker 2: Opened up a practice.
Speaker 1: What was that like--selection of the location, people that you first work with--what was that like?
Speaker 2: I was sort of a visionary, innovative, and I, to really get my practice started, I used to make house calls for other obstetricians, house calls. And I worked with, worked with the American Cancer Society and I used to go around being on the speakers bureau, and I would, at that time, cervical cancer, would speak to, oh, three or four times a week, I would go out with the American Cancer Society and speak about, about cervical cancer and pass my cards out, worked closely with the Planned Parenthood association [Planned Parenthood Federation of America]. So, I never really had a difficult time in, in building a, building a practice. First practiced, out of Morningside Hospital [Los Angeles, California]; became chief of staff there. Then from Morningside Hospital, Centinela Hospital [Centinela Hospital Medical Center] solicited me. They came over and asked me to come to Centinela Hospital, and I went, and I spent all of my practice at Centinela Hospital, in Inglewood, California.
Speaker 1: For how many years were you there, sir?
Speaker 2: About twenty-five.
Speaker 1: Twenty-five years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You were at Morningside for how many years?
Speaker 2: Three to five.
Speaker 1: Three to five. And, I should have asked up front, when--what year did you graduate from medical school?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958]. Okay. God, twenty-five years, that's a long, long t- ca- just out of--let's see, graduated, and I'm sorry, from medical school you said 1948. How many babies have you delivered in your lifetime?
Speaker 2: Thousands.
Speaker 1: Thousands. Um, I'm sure they've come back to--and met you and talked with you.
Speaker 2: There's no place I go that I don't meet someone whom I am popular with.
Speaker 1: What do they say to you, sir?
Speaker 2: "Oh, this is my doctor. He took my baby." Very few places I go in Cali--in Los Angeles when I go out, that I don't meet somebody that--not, that I've not touched.
Story_ID: 473345
Speaker 1: But, one of the greatest, one of the greatest activities that we did, a community activity we did, we started the Real Men Cook Foundation for Education [Real Men Cook Foundation for Education Center for Early Detection of Prostate Cancer], and we did that in the '80s [1980s] and we did that for about ten years.
Speaker 2: This is the Real Men Cook--
Speaker 1: Foundation for Education, it was a culinary extravaganza where we would, where we'd get a hundred black men from various, various professions--like Chief Parks [HistoryMaker Bernard Parks], and Chief Williams [Willie L. Williams], actors, and writers, to be chefs. We get no less than a hundred men, and we did that for ten years. And we did that for the, for the, to raise money for the four historically minority medical schools [HBCUs] and that's where we raised over $500,000 for them. And, that's how we established our academic scholarship of excellence and that was a very fun, fun type of event. We did that for ten years. In 1993, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. And our board of directors changed our mission from education to bringing education on erectile dysfunction, on men's issues, on nutrition, on prevention of obesity, on prostate cancer and prostate cancer screening. And, there we, we--that was founded on February 2, 1994 in the chamber of Cecil Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray]. Cecil Murray was the faith leader for, for FAME A.M.E. Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California]. He was our first honorary, honorary chairperson. The founding members of the Real Men Cook Foundation were Dr. Eila Skinner [Eila C. Skinner] who is associate professor of urology at USC Norris Cancer Center [USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California], Dr. Donald Skinner [Donald G. Skinner] who is the chairman for professor of department of urology, USC Norris Cancer Center, and Fred D. Parrott, M.D. [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], prostate cancer survivor. We started that over twelve years ago. I was diagnosed in 1993, and by May was cured of prostate cancer and I've been free ever since. And they have been with us ever since. Dr. Skinner, she still does the, the regions--the letters out to, to men who have been screened. And since that time, I imagine, I've screened over fifty thousand men, we've touched over a million families, we have, we have personally talked to over five hundred ministers, we've sent out millions and millions of flyers and posters and information on prostate cancer. We have a, we have a outreach office in the inner city. We have a one-on-one consultation model on prostate cancer education--director, Juan Burnson [ph.] is director of that. We have a Latino outreach director, Victor Grimaldo, who speaks and talks and educates the Spanish speaking men on erectile dysfunction, on men's issues of prevention of obesity, prostate cancer and prostate cancer screening.
Story_ID: 473346
Speaker 1: Okay Dr. Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], 1993 you were diagnosed with prostate cancer, but there was something in your life that was very personal to you in regards to prostate cancer, what was that, sir?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Fred Parrott, Sr.] died of prostate cancer; he died a horrible death of prostate cancer. He, it's really interesting. He, he came up one Christmas, and then I sent him over to a urologist, Dr. Bledsoe [ph.]. And Dr. Bledsoe called me up that he had did, at that time they did needle biopsies, called me up and said everything was fine. Then he called me back later on, my father was (unclear) to go, my father was so happy, it was clear. He called me up, and he had just got a report back, and he said, "We got bad report, I was given the wrong report. Your father does have prostate cancer." And my father was happy, leaving that day, I said, "Well, Doc, I can't tell him, you gonna have to tell him." So he said, "Okay." So he, he--when he got back home to Houston [Texas], he arranged for a bed at Baylor University [Baylor College of Medicine], a great cancer center in Houston. And, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and it metastasized, and there was no, there was no treatment; you'd give him the estrogen--no treatment as of the date. And, he, he died of--he was in so much pain, I used to hear him moan out. He was a deacon, a very spiritual man, he used to moan out, "Oh God, what have I done, what have I done for me to have this much pain?" A tremendous amount of pain. But I had forgotten that he had prostate cancer. I never got tested until about ten, fifteen years later. So went over with a friend of mine who was having, who was having, having his prostate removed; not because of prostate cancer, but because of hyperplasia. And I sat with him on the operating, with him in the operating room, and I realized that I need to go get tested. When I went to get tested my PSA [prostate specific antigen] was four. At that time, there was a zero to four in milligrams, and the next year, I had four, I said, "I better go get a biopsy." And, I called on my own, "Oh, we have a doctor in the office," the new biopsy had just came about. So he did a biopsy on me in his office. It came back negative, and I said, "I still need to go." So, I called Dr. Donald Skinner [Donald G. Skinner], 'cause I looked around to see who, who the specialist who was doing--the most promising specialist who was doing, doing work in prostate cancer.  And, talked to Skinner, one of the people that I was referred to and I called him up, and he referred me to Dr. Eila Skinner [Eila C. Skinner], his associate; no relationship, just had the same name. So, that's how I became--and, she did a biopsy on me and it came back positive, had a--made a score of six, and my PSA rate, and then my PS--. I had a, I had a Real Men Cook--it was in 1996, I had a Real Men Cook for Education [Real Men Cook Foundation for Education Center for Early Detection of Prostate Cancer], coming up and I wanted to do that, do that one before I went in for surgery. By the time I was ready for surgery, my PSA had risen up to about eight or nine, but it was, it was localized, and we did a very radical; it was what they call a nerve-sparing procedure. So, I've been free ever since.
Speaker 1: So you were diagnosed in 1993?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't until 1996 that you actually had the actual--?
Speaker 2: No, 1990--1994, we, we founded it. Nineteen ninety-four [1994] we did our--we founded in the office of Cecil Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray]. But we never made any, asked for any donations until two or three years later. We did do a prostate cancer education extravaganza with Norris [USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California] one year. That was in 1996, I think.
Speaker 1: But you get diagnosed in 1993, and you had the surgery in 1993?
Speaker 2: I had surgery in 1994.
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994]. Okay, had surgery, okay, you had a radical, you had a radical. Dr. Parrott, in your, now that, here you now--okay, in this part of your life now, you're now a prostate cancer survivor?
Speaker 2: I'm cured of prostate--yes.
Speaker 1: And I know people argue about that term cured and in remission (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. I'm a prostate cancer survivor.
Story_ID: 473347
Speaker 1: But now you see something here more than that. You see a need for other men, black men in particular because it is the number one killer of African American men, you see a need to do something, what was that need and what did you do, sir?
Speaker 2: Well, for the past twelve years, we have been working closely with USC Norris [USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California] and with faith and community leaders and political leaders to close the prostate cancer gap, to help close the prostate cancer gap and save the lives of minority men from prostate cancer. And we do that by educational programs [by the Real Men Cook Foundation] throughout the city, by participating in health fairs and by having prostate cancer screenings. At one time, we were doing a prostate cancer education screening about every other month or so. We've cut it down quite a bit, now, we're gonna cut it down even more, it's a very tremendous amount of hard work. We still haven't gotten the support that we feel that we should get, and in the future, with all that kind of work, with those organizations, those churches, those politicians who, who work with us and who, who, who have the same dedication and commitment and the focus that we have. This is not a, this is not a program where we can use someone's name. A name will not--we're working with black people mostly who are uneducated, mostly who have a fear factor, who have a fear of the white medical establishment, who have the Tuskegee [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male] legacy behind them, there's the fear of that and a fear of intrusiveness, of it being invasive and who are just not educated. We need, we need all of our faith and community and political leaders to work directly with us, not just to use their name, but they have to, to make an effort. In the past two years, we had been targeting black women organizations to teach them as to the importance of early detection for their loved ones. Women are not physically attacked by prostate cancer, but they are so devastated and frustrated by it because their husbands and their loved ones are in such a state of denial and have such fear and shame and embarrassed. So we have to teach them, women have to crusade, and, and really trying to make an impact into one of the colored organizations. Quite the contrary, and you would think that, that we're finding more and more Spanish speaking community, because the areas which we used to target are now being populated by Spanish speaking populations. So, those areas now, are Spanish speaking. And we found that the Latino women, even though they have a macho husband, but they are the president and CEO and chairman of the board of the home, and when that macho man comes home, she not only motivates him, she brings him to the screening site. So, 50 to 55 percent of the men who attend our education and screening program are now Spanish speaking. As a result of that, we've had to have a Spanish speaking education director, as well as an English speaking director. But we have been very fortunate because we have, we have a large number, have a large number of our faith leaders who have been attacked by prostate cancer, and they themselves have prostate cancer. Oh, we're still a little behind time, we're still--as I always say, "Education, education and more education are our best way of rescuing men from prostate cancer."
Story_ID: 473348
Speaker 1: Dr. Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], you spend an awful lot of time in what you do as the founder, as the CEO of the Real Men Cook Foundation. Why do you do that, sir?
Speaker 2: It's a passion, it's a mission, and I think that, I think you have to have some type of mission in your life, some type of passion in your life. You have to do something other than just your work, you know. It's a great country we have, and I think that you shouldn't leave here without giving something back to the country or something to the country and the community that made it all possible for you. I think that, I think that more and more people are beginning to--you can have all the riches and wealth and financial convenience in life, but if you don't give back, you're missing something.
Speaker 1: I heard that word before, I think something your mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott] told you about the giving back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Back to mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you gotta give back.
Speaker 1: And you get involved in other things, as well, you do other things. You play tennis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm very much involved into, very much involved in the community, we have one program that we, I think I told you about, I think I told you about one program we have done, we, we, we're very interested in education. We did a project with the Inglewood Unified School District where we honored the, all of the parents who, who, who took an interest in the educational process of their children. We didn't do it for one school, we did it for the entire Inglewood Unified School District. That's one of the better projects that we have ever done. We are working now, we are working now with the, with the Los Angeles [California] chapter of Links [The Links, Incorporated], where we share, we do, The Links have a program where they have high school students from various schools who have aspirations for higher education, and last year we had about fifty-six boys, and what we do, we gonna have what they call a community program where they go out and they find a home in the inner city, and, these boys refurbish this home, they refurbish the home in one day. None of the boys ever picked up a paint brush, or had ever picked up any tools, and they refurbish this home in one day and give them the opportunity to use their hands, and to teach them how to give back to the community. Last year we did it, last year we did it in the name of Larry McCormick who was a very strong supporter of the, of The Links. And this year we did it in the name of--I can't think of his name, he died of colon cancer at the age of forty- forty-two, Chicken [ph.]--.
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about now. I can get his name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know he did a refurbish of a museum, by the same little black author who had all these--
Speaker 1: The lady who just passed away.
Speaker 2: No, she's still alive, but she had all these black history photos and archives in her garage.
Speaker 1: Clayton, [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton.
Speaker 2: Mayme Clayton, we just refurbished her place in the name of, in the name of this young guy who--
Speaker 1: I can't think of his name (unclear). So you--all these projects you've got going, you're doing a lot for the community, you're giving back a lot to the community, you're do it because this is something you want to do. Do you find time to play a little tennis every now and then?
Speaker 2: Well, we're into fitness, we're in the gym five, six days a week. So we're into health and nutrition, and fitness and exercise.
Speaker 1: How old are you now, sir?
Speaker 2: On Medicare (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But you look great. You're doing the physical thing, you get out there, you play, you do what you have to do to stay in good physical shape.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're very much into health, nutrition, fitness and exercise.
Story_ID: 473349
Speaker 1: Dr. Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott] is there anything else that you want to get off and do before the Lord calls you home?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to really get involved into health, nutrition, fitness and the prevention of obesity. We've been working with, and, we've put it together, but we're working with our health clubs here, we have a program all outlined where we can have day with some women, black women group, because obesity is one of the highest incidence in the United States, and obesity is a very sensitive issue. But, this is an issue that we are really interested in. We have a program already outlined.  We have a, we have a studio that I go to that would welcome it, it's just a matter of presenting this very sensitive issue to a group of women that we hope would assume the leadership role and to help spread the word that, that the prevention of obesity would save lives. Save the lives of both men and women with prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and a host of things. As you know, prostate cancer in obese men is much more aggressive than in men who are physically fit. So that's a project that we're very much interested in.
Story_ID: 473350
Speaker 1: Just a couple more questions for you, sir. One of them is very serious, how do you want to be remembered, Dr. Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott]?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I've never given that a thought. I, I, it never entered my mind on how I'd like to be remembered. You know, we do what we feel that we should do and what we enjoy doing. I think that if you do what you enjoy doing and you get a satisfaction out of it, that is peace within itself.
Story_ID: 473351
Speaker 1: As you look back in time through your lifetime, and you look at where we as a people are today, what, what's your feelings about where we come from, where we're going, are we going in the right direction, what do you think, sir?
Speaker 2: That's a very difficult question. I wish, I, I, I don't know if we're going forward or if we're going backwards. You know, it seems as though, in the latter part of the 20th century here, in the 20th century we were just moving forward. I don't know if we have had the young people to take up the, the leadership roles, (unclear). I don't know if we, as, as the seniors, if we have made preparation for young people to take our places.  Because once you get into power, it takes so long to, to reach, to reach a--the capacity or the level of being presidents, you can't be presidents or chairman of the board, until, it's something that we'd like to achieve in our lifetime, but we, I don't know if it's a selfishness, or what have you, I don't think we should have prepared our young people to take the rolls of some of our older statesmen. I don't think we've done it adequately. We've done it in some phases, because there are young people who are moving forward, but not enough of them. As far as my life is concerned, I can't think of anything that I would do any differently. I really can't. I've already thought about it, what would I do differently if I had it to do all over again? I can't think of anything that, that I would do any differently than I've done.
Speaker 1: Now, you've never been married?
Speaker 2: Never been married.
Speaker 1: No children?
Speaker 2: No children.
Speaker 1: Got some nephews?
Speaker 2: Got some nephews. They're all deceased though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wonder if I have a nephew. No, I don't have any nephews. My sister [Carroll Parrott Blue] didn't have any children.
Speaker 1: Well, Dr. Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], is there anything else that you want to talk about?
Speaker 2: No. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: We thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We thank you.
Story_ID: 473352
Speaker 1: Dr. Parrott [HistoryMaker Dr. Fred Parrott], what were some of your earliest memories of just life itself.
Speaker 2: Some of my early, earliest memories, that was, that was, that I can remember very distinctly and very clearly, is when, when the neighborhood, when the neighborhood kids would call me and say, "Fred, let's play basketball." And I had a basketball over my garage. My mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott] had a very beautiful yard, and we just totally destroyed that yard. And as much as she loved flowers, she never said anything about it because she wanted us, wanted me to be home, and wanted me happy. This was the unselfishness that, on her part, that she allowed us to play basketball and destroy all of her green grass. And, and, and basketball--as a matter of fact, I, as a result of that, I made it back. One of the things I did, I made the, I was able to make the basketball team in high school [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas]. And that was, that was--and, I held the basketball, I played basketball every day, seven days a week. And that was rain or shine, I would play out--be out playing basketball.
Story_ID: 473353
Speaker 1: The last question. Some sights, smells or sounds that you can remember that you can relate to that trigger some thoughts in your mind? Like if you see a flower, if you smell some pork chops, if you, if you hear a train going by.
Speaker 2: The only sights or scenes that I can remember is my mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott] walking down the street, walking down the street, and I had those beans and, and hog hocks on, and the first thing she would do she'd open that screen door and kick off her shoes and say (makes noise) (laughter). And come in there--I don't know if that is significant or not, but I do, I do recall that. To see how I'm coming with the kitchen and the cooking, and when she comes in she takes over and, and finish up the meal. But, I clearly remember her getting off the street car, and I could hear her walking down the street, knocking on the door, and the first thing she'd do she'd take of those shoes, and, (makes noise). Aw, that vivid memory in my mind--
Speaker 1: Nothing else?
Speaker 2: Not a very pleasant memory, but that's a good memory.
Story_ID: 473354
Speaker 1: What did the church, what influence did the church have on you as a young man?
Speaker 2: You know, unfortunately, I usually, I usually think of that because, somehow or another, I escaped the church. I don't know how I did it, and sometimes I regret that I was not involved in the church as I, as I, as I should have been, because church is the backbone of, of all the youth. I used to slip out of the church and play hooky, and go play basketball. How I was able to manage to get away from my mother [Mollie Carroll Parrott] and my father [Fred Parrott, Sr.], who were there at church at all times. There was a time that when I was small and she used to take me, I used to be with her to go to church. But when I started going to Sunday school, I used to skip Sunday school. And I have some friends here and I used to ask them, "How did I ever get out of not going to church?" So I'm not a very biblical person, so I missed the church experience, I missed singing in the choir, I missed participating in the Sunday school, and that's sort of odd. Most people, especially black people, they're brought up in the church. My parents think that I was brought up in the church, but I was never really part of any church.
Story_ID: 473355
Speaker 1: Now, you got off into fraternities, I heard you say, Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]?
Speaker 2: I was an Alpha.
Speaker 1: And also, what other fraternities were you a member of?
Speaker 2: That was the, that was the only, the best one I wanted to be in; be with the best. And, and one of my, one of the things I found, I became dean of pledgees. That was an aspiration, I wanted, wanted to be, did become dean of the pledgees during my, during my term with the Alphas.
Speaker 1: And you were a member of Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity]?
Speaker 2: Not a member of Boule; member of the 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.], a member of other organizations, but not a member of the Boule; one of the founding members of the 100 Black Men here in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: And what does that organization do?
Speaker 2: Organization is a very fine organization, and it's, it's primarily with fostering the educational process of, of boys. They have a mentoring program, they, they give scholarships. It's, it's just an unbelievable great organization for young black men with aspirations for higher education. Their whole concentration is on inspiring and motivating black youth for higher education, and to preparing them to be successful in the community, and giving back to the community. It's one of the greatest organizations I know of with their goals and their mission for the motivation and educational process that they have for the black youth of Los Angeles. It's such a tremendous program; academy award-winning program. I'm very proud to have been associated with the 100 Black Men of Los Angeles, Inc.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that you haven't done yet that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I told you that, I told you that probably the program, the program that I have on board now, on board, is all ready to go. It's the prevention of obesity in minority men and women. We have that program already ready to go. And I think it is a very important program. We, we probably will still try to take it off the board sometime within the next eighteen months or so. I think it is a very important program; prevention of obesity, health and nutrition, and exercise and fitness. So, that's the only other project that I have, presently. We're going to continue, to continue the program that we do have with The Links [The Links, Incorporated], and this program on obesity, we're going to be working with the, with the Girls Club of America [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], to, to get that rolling. I think we'll be able to do that 2007, 2008.
