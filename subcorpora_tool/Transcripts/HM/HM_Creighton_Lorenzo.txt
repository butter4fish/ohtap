Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you what I call People magazine-ish--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --type questions, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: You know, I really like gold.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I just, I don't know why but I just like the color gold for whatever reason.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: You know, I used to, before I moved to the desert, I used to like fall because it was football season.  And I just like the, you know, the feel of fall and the leaves and the changing of the seasons, but now in the desert I like the spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you like to eat?  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: You know, I love to barbecue a good steak, and I like barbecue ribs and, you know, all of the fixings that go with that but, you know, in later years I had to kind of change my diet and be a little more, you know, more into the salads, into the grilled food, you know, chicken breasts and that kind of thing, but I still love a good pot of greens and, you know, and with some, with some good fat meat in there and cornbread and the whole bit, but I just can't eat it as much as I used to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you go on vacation do you have a favorite destination?
Speaker 2: You know, we like to travel, the family, and now, you know, we've got kids so it's a challenge finding good places.  They like beach communities.  And we're trying to plan a trip, an educational trip where they can go to Europe because I'd like to take 'em to Europe to see that.  But generally we don't take long trips, we take fairly short trips and go to beach communities and just kind of enjoy the ambience there.
Speaker 1: And when you go to the beach, would it be in the Caribbean or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: The last time we went to Bahamas and, but we usually go to California, but last time we went to Bahamas 'cause it's a very short trip from here to California.  With the work schedule the way it is, it's tough to get away (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --but we got to make time for the kids.
Story_ID: 544232
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother [Lucille Fox Creighton] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --father, let's start with your father.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: His name was David Creighton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me where he was born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Mount Vernon, Alabama, in roughly 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know about his parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his father was actually--I was named after his father, his, his father was named Lorenzo Peavy, P-E-A-V-Y.  His mother was a twin, named Dora, her name was Dora Williams [Dora Williams Creighton].  And he took his stepfather's name in later years, Creighton, and that's how we ended up with the name Creighton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now tell me more about your grandparents?  Did you get to meet them?  Did you know them?
Speaker 2: I actually got to really meet them all over the years, and my father's father was the last one to pass away.  He passed away about six years ago, seven years, well, actually more than that, probably about eight years ago but he was 100 years old when he passed away.  And he was a very unique individual because he owned a, you know, several hundred acres in a town called Salitpa, Alabama.  So I got an opportunity to spend a lot of time with him.  And he, you know, was very clear up until his death, you know, when he died at a hundred years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were some of the times that you spent with them?  Did they have a farm in Alabama with this acreage?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he had a farm in this small town.  And, and it's really kind of an amazing community there in this area in Alabama, mostly what they call Clarke County, Alabama.  And you grow trees (laughter).  You know, they had small plots where they grew some greens and they had a few chickens and, you know, maybe a few cows but generally they grow trees.  And the trees were sold at intervals for paper wood or pulp wood they call it.  And so it was a long time between paychecks, so they had to get accustomed to that.  And my grandmother also, on both sides they grew trees.  And had small plots where they actually, you know, grew stuff for the houses but it was a very rural part of Alabama and continues to be a very rural part of Alabama today.  And both my mother and father came from that area, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you remember most about going to visit your grandparents?
Speaker 2: You know, as a kid, you know, I, we back in the, our first recollection was maybe the late '50s [1950s], when I'd go into Alabama.  We'd leave Iowa because the only reason we, we ended up in Iowa was because after World War II [WWII] my father needed a job after he got out of the [U.S. military] service and the African American servicemen weren't as accepted in the South after World War II, so he had an uncle from that same area in Alabama who worked at a plant called John Deere tractor works [Deere and Company], and that's, and so my father followed him to John Deere tractor works where they make the majority of the tractors, in John Deere tractors.  And he got a job working in the foundry.  And so in the '50s [1950s], we would, we would travel back to the South and we'd have a caravan of African Americans who would, who would leave Iowa and follow each other, and most would stop in Mississippi, but my family was from Alabama so we had to go a little bit further, and it was sometimes a little bit dicey going through the South.  And we couldn't stay at hotels, you know, we couldn't eat at most restaurants.  And we'd have to find African American enclaves as we went through the South that we could stop and eat and use the restroom and that kind of thing.  I remember many times using the restroom in the woods.  And as a kid I really didn't quite understand that but, but in later years I really, I understood it clear.
Story_ID: 544233
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you, were there any stories shared about your [paternal] grandparents' parents?  Was there anybody in slavery, any information that you might have about that?
Speaker 2: I actually met my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my great-grandmother was, and I don't remember her name but she didn't know who her parents were.  She thought that her father--and she was very fair skinned and I thought that she was, she looked white.  And I went to her funeral in 1958 in Alabama in this area that I referred to in Clarke County.  And I don't remember any conversations with her, but I do remember as a kindergartener I think or maybe first grader, you know, seeing her in her casket and she was very fair skinned.  And so I asked my mother [Lucille Fox Creighton] in later years about her and she would, she told me the story that my great-grandmother was raised on a plantation in Clarke County, Alabama, and that she suspected that her father was the slave master's son.  And that, but she didn't know who her parents were.  And I thought that, you know, I never, you know, I don't remember much about her other than just, just being at the funeral 'cause in Alabama in that part of the country and, I think it's still somewhat of a tradition now, they would have the wake actually in the house and so everybody would come to the house and they'd have the casket in the living room or in a bedroom and they'd have, you know, the family gathering there and then they would go from there to the church and then ultimately to the burial plot.  And, and that, that just made an impression on me, so but she was a, she clearly was, was mixed.  And you know, my mother made that very clear to me in later years.  And then her mother, which her name was Mary Fox, my grandmother on my mother's side was named Mary Fox, she also told me the story in later years.
Story_ID: 544234
Speaker 1: Now, your mother, on your mother's side--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --tell me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Mother is named Lucille Creighton [Lucille Fox Creighton].  Her maiden name was Lucille Fox.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her parents?
Speaker 2: Her father was named Charlie Fox and her mother was Mary Fox.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: She was born in a town not far from where my father [David Creighton] was born and it was called Winn, Alabama, W-I-N-N, in the same county, Clarke County, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: My mother would have been born in 1925.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell me about Charlie and Mary Fox.
Speaker 2: Well, Charlie Fox, he, I think, was born in Mississippi and he traveled a lot.  He worked on the railroads and he traveled a lot.  He died in the early '80s [1980s].  And my grandmother, Mary Fox, she basically, they had separated and she was a tree farmer.  She grew pine trees and, you know, had a really basic house.  She had done well for herself.  She had a, probably a hundred plus acres of trees that she farmed.  But she never really liked, you know, the amenities that most people get accustomed to like indoor bathrooms.  And she didn't really care much for air conditioning.  She had a, you know, wood stoves all my life, and we tried to, I remember in the mid-'60s [1960s], tried to upgrade her home for her, and she just said, "Absolutely not, this is the way I like it," and she never got a stove or a, she did have a refrigerator but outside of that she only had one light bulb in each room, and very basic house.  And as a kid (laughter) it was really a challenge coming from, you know, Iowa, and staying down there in the summers.  We'd go down many summers and stay.  And that was a challenge, you know, with the outhouse, you know, out from the house, and, you know, having to catch chickens and cook 'em and go out and pull greens for, and the peas and, and shelling the peas for, for dinner in the evening.  And, you know, now I can, I respect it a lot more than I did in those days, it was a little tough.  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and the mosquitoes as big as birds, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories about their parents, either one of their parents?
Speaker 2: You know, my mother never really talked about their parents much but I did know that my grandmother on my mother's side had some Indian heritage which would have been Creek Indian [Native American].  Now my grandfather, she really never talked much about him or his family, but I did get an opportunity to meet his family, a lot of 'em over the years.  And they came from another area of Alabama, not real far from this, from the Clarke County area.  And we used to go and have family reunions with the Fox family, but we had more emphasis on the father side as it related to family reunions.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Do you know how either of your grandparents acquired the land that they owned?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I do recall that story.  My mother's--grandmother, which would have been my grandmother, her father, which would have been my great-grandfather was a slave and when the slaves were freed, they were given a considerable amount of land. I mean, it was probably up to, close to, you know, six, seven hundred acres.  And I think it was split later among the, his children, so they all got a hundred plus acres roughly, and that stayed in the family.  And we still actually own a good portion of that that was left to my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Your grand- now this is your grandmother, Mary?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So her father was a slave?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And any more information about him at all?
Speaker 2: No, we really didn't hear much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --about him.
Speaker 1: Did you know his name?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --I didn't remember his name.
Story_ID: 544235
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, is there a story about how your mother [Lucille Fox Creighton] and father [David Creighton] met?
Speaker 2: You know, my mother and father, in Alabama it was kind of a custom that you wanted to get out of the country.  And they both decided that at some point in their lives that they wanted to go to Mobile, and try to find better jobs.  And, you know, it was pretty limited about, you know, what they could do in the country, so both went to Mobile, Alabama, and that's where they met actually in Mobile, Alabama.  And then he went off to the [U.S.] military and when he came back from the military, is when they both decided that, you know, there was very limited opportunity even in Mobile, Alabama, and that they needed to find another way to make a living and so that's how he took her to Waterloo, Iowa, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was because he had a brother that was already working there?
Speaker 2: He had an uncle who actually, who actually worked at John Deere tractor works [Deere and Company] in Waterloo, and but, and it was a unique time in Waterloo too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you need to tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Waterloo, when they got to Waterloo in the '40s [1940s], Waterloo has a very unique history.  It is a small town of about seventy-five, eighty thousand people in the northeast corner of Iowa, very, very cold environment.  African Americans ended up in Waterloo because of a railroad strike that happened in 1911 on the Illinois Central Railroad.  When the, they had a, a huge strike and Illinois Central Railroad was a critical spur in that town because they shipped tractors out, as well as, it's, it was a huge hub for meatpacking, Rath Meats [Rath Packing Company] and, and a couple other meatpacking operations were based in Waterloo, as well as it was a place where grain and things were shipped out of.  So the spur was very critical in the economics of Iowa, and even the Midwest, you know, on the Illinois Central Railroad.  Well, there was a huge strike and so they couldn't figure out how to, how to get around this strike so they went to Mississippi in the Delta and brought up African Americans, African Americans on railroad cars, hundreds of 'em, to work on the railroad and, and, and ultimately they were strike breakers.  And they lived on the boxcars in the railroad yard for, for many, many years and then once the strike was broke they fired 'em all.  But they had nothing to go back to, so they stayed.  And at the same time the economy in Waterloo was burgeoning because, you know, you had the tractor works needed to pump out more tractors and the meat processing was huge.  And so they decided to hire the African Americans at the lower end positions in the factories to help with the production of the meat and in the foundry and the low level jobs.  And so the community stayed in the railroad yard but it grew out from the railroad yard, very, I mean, one, in the '60s [1960s] the magazines touted Waterloo, Iowa as the most segregated city in America.  So you had probably at any given time ten thousand African Americans who lived there but they could not go out of the boundaries of their community.  And even when I grew up in the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], I didn't even know what the rest of the town looked like because you, if you couldn't go outside of the boundaries of your community unless you had basically a pass to be in another part of town unless you were a domestic worker or you had to go to work at a factory.  You pretty much better not leave your community.  So and that grew, I mean, into the '40s [1940s], and it's still, I mean, even to this day, Waterloo is still a very segregated town.  It's still based out of that railroad yard and it has kind of gotten bigger over the years but, you know, the same premise (laughter) applies.  And the schools were, that I went to were, you know, 50 to 60 percent African American, you know, even in a small town like that up until I graduated from high school [East High School, Waterloo, Iowa].  So it was very unique.  And, and in the '40s [1940s], it was a kind of a buddy system or you had to know somebody and they would, you know, pull their relatives from the, from Mississippi.  And my parents were kind of an anomaly because they came from Alabama but the majority of the African Americans in Waterloo actually came out of Holmes County, Mississippi, which was, which had another spur of the Illinois Central Railroad yard and that's how they got there.  And, the, the, the uniqueness about that is that it was a really polarizing event, you know, in 1911 and a lot of animosity in the community came out of that strike break, you know, when they broke the strike.  And that animosity continued for generations and generations.  And to this day, I mean, there are still vestiges of that animosity that exists because of it, I mean, it just didn't change. It just didn't change.

Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: You know, I can remember back, you know, to certain events, things that happened to, you know, maybe three and four years old, I mean, just snippets.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But nothing major.  But, you know, first memory is really, you know, kindergarten, kindergarten on.
Speaker 1: Tell me about what you remember.
Speaker 2: You know, I remember one thing that I really remember--1960, New Year's Eve, my mother [Lucille Fox Creighton] crying, and that's really one of my first consciousness of, you know, from that point on, I remember.  She had gotten a call in the middle of night, and it was very rare to get calls in those days because in our hometown [Waterloo, Iowa] we had party lines, you know, so, you know, you had two or three families on one phone line.  And she got a call in the middle of the night, her brother had gotten murdered in Iowa.  And he had gotten murdered in a cornfield.  And that was really, really, you know, a dramatic event for the whole family because it wasn't just an accidental death, he had actually gotten murdered, so.
Speaker 1: Did they ever find out why he was murdered?
Speaker 2: They never really found out why.  It was a guy who killed him and beat him to death in a cornfield and left him out there in the cold and we, and they found him, I think a couple of days--well, it would have, it happened a couple days before but they found him on that New Year's Eve in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any happy memories, first memories?
Speaker 2: You know, you know, the camaraderie and the friendships and, you know, the life's lessons that you learned in a small town, and the friends that you develop, you know, from early, you know, in life and you keep them for your whole life.  And the sports.  You know, we were really into, you know, football, and track and different things, the whole town, and it was a, you know, some really happy memories in those days.  The family life and you know, mother and father [David Creighton] and--
Story_ID: 544237
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your, your mother [Lucille Fox Creighton].  What type of mother was she?  What was your relationship like with her?
Speaker 2: You know, my mother was always, we always said that she was always in our corner.  She was always in our corner and always was there for us, but like all the families in our community [in Waterloo, Iowa], I mean, everybody had to work.  You know, I mean, mother worked, you know, many, many hours, father [David Creighton] worked a lot of hours and had to have side businesses to, you know, to take care of the family.  We had, you know, essentially five children in the household.  And so my early memories were that they just weren't there a lot, you know, but the times that we had with them were good times, were good times.  My mother was tough, you know, she was a disciplinarian.  She was the one who made you toe the line and made sure that you did what you were supposed to be doing.  Father was a little more laid back but mother, she was a disciplinarian.  But you knew she cared for you but she would, she'd put the belt to you.  She'd put the belt to you if she had to.
Speaker 1: How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: My mother had a high school diploma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And for her, I mean, that was huge because people didn't get high school diplomas in Alabama in those days.  So having graduated from high school was a huge, huge event for her.
Speaker 1: And what type of work did she do?
Speaker 2: Mother was a cook all of her life.  She cooked, and it was kind of a family tradition in her family that that's what they did, and that's what she moved from her, the small town she grew up in, to Mobile [Alabama] to cook.  She had a brother who cooked, and her father [Charlie Fox] had been a cook.  So it was kind of the family tradition and so she cooked all her life.  And at one time she opened up her own small restaurant, it did very well, and but she got tired of the, you know, the stress from it and went back just to cooking with a correctional facility, she cooked for a halfway house for a number of years until she retired.
Speaker 1: Now, and what about your father?  You said he was a little laid back, what was your relationship like with him?
Speaker 2: He, we had a great relationship.  My father and I bonded from a very early age.  I was looking at a photo before I came here today when I was like five years old, and I was sitting on the hood of his '56 [1956] Buick, you know.  And, you know, and he and I were very close, and stayed close throughout the years.  And, but we had a good relationship and I learned a lot from him.  He gave me a lot of good wisdom on how to do things.  But he didn't have a lot of education but he was a very bright guy but he didn't have a lot of education.  He, I think, he dropped out of school in sixth or seventh grade because he was the oldest child in his family, and he had to go to work to support the other children in his family.
Story_ID: 544238
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about the neighborhood in which you lived.
Speaker 2: It was a, you know, a lower, middle-class neighborhood, all African Americans, in the Waterloo, Iowa--in an area that was surrounded by all working-class African Americans.  Everybody there worked at either Rath Packing [Rath Packing Company] or John Deere [Deere and Company].  We all went to the same schools.  We all knew each other, everybody knew each other.  And it was a good neighborhood because it was safe in those days, in the early days.  You know, you could leave your doors unlocked.  And if you were three or four blocks away and you got in trouble, you know, the parent who was closest would grab you by the nape of your neck and bring you to your mother, and then you got your beating, you know, when you got to your house.  And so, and in that respect it was very safe.  We knew what to expect and we knew, you know, what our boundaries were, and, but it was a good neighborhood.
Speaker 1: And as a child growing up you said you knew where to go, I mean, when you got to be a little older and could travel around--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the city yourself, you knew where you could go and where you could not go?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, it was pretty clear.  I mean, my hometown was a lot like South Africa in many ways because, you know, that animosity from that railroad strike still existed and the impression of African Americans had been, you know, kind of indelibly marked in the brains of everybody in the community, and you could not move outside of that community.  I remember in a story, you know, in the early '60s [1960s], where a woman, an African American woman, single mother with about four kids had moved kind of across the boundary line of where you could go, you know, across the railroad tracks.  And there was a protest because the realtor who had rented her the house, they felt that he had violated some sort of a code.  And it was the strangest TV story because the gist of it--'cause the people were throwing eggs at her house and rocks at her house but the gist of the story was this realtor had no right to rent her the house, not that anybody was doing anything wrong by throwing rocks at her house.  And I thought that was really, really strange as a kid, I didn't really get it.  And but you could not go outside of the boundaries of your community or you risked going to jail or being ganged up on and beat up, so you had to stay in that community.  And, and but we did have a pass, on Christmas, we could go over on what we call the west side of town and see the Christmas lights.  And that was the only time you had a pass to leave that area.
Story_ID: 544239
Speaker 1: So you were telling me about the Christmas passes.  Now tell me how that worked.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well it was kind of a, how do I put it?  It was not--it was kind of an unspoken thing.  There was no literal pass, but at Christmastime as long as the families, you know, and that's what my father [David Creighton] did, he would load us up into the family car and then we'd go over into the more, the wealthier part of town [Waterloo, Iowa], and those were the people who owned the businesses and who were the managers at the factory and the managers at the meatpacking plant [Rath Packing Company] and, and they lived in, you know, very nice, you know, pristine neighborhoods on what we call the west side of town.  The African Americans lived on the east side of town on the other side of the river, the Cedar River, we call it.  And we would, each year around Christmastime, go take, and see the Christmas lights, and that was really, really a treat.  And up until that time I, and in even, you know, any time before that, I never saw that part of town.  I feel, you felt totally unsafe venturing into that part of town.  Now in the later years we'd go to that part of town for sports events but it was a very controlled, you know, you know, transportation into the community and out of the community to make sure that we didn't have any, any issues.
Story_ID: 544240
Speaker 1: Now, who owned the businesses on the east side of town where you lived?
Speaker 2: It was the people from the west side, (laughter) you know, it was the people from the west side.  African Americans didn't own any businesses but now they did own a few.  It was one guy who had been there and his name was Cliff Smith [Clifford Smith], and he owned a business called Cliff's Supper Club [Waterloo, Iowa] that was, was famous because Cliff had actually come there in the '20s [1920s] or, you know, in the early '20s [1920s] and he opened up a restaurant.  And his claim to fame was when African Americans came from other parts of the country, he would, he actually had a boardinghouse and a restaurant so he would kind of stake you until you got on your feet and then you could pay him back.  And a lot of times he didn't get paid back but that's what he did.  And then, and Cliff Smith died in the late '80s [1980s], and he was close to a hundred years old and we'd go and he still had his, his restaurant.  And we'd go and we'd eat, you know, at his restaurant.  And he had, you know, good old down home food, you know, the black eyed peas and the ham hocks.  And, and so it was a, kind of a, you know, an old beat up part of town but everyone went to Cliff to hear the stories and to eat the food, and so he was kind of our historian.
Speaker 1: What stories do you remember that he might have told?
Speaker 2: You know, he would talk a lot about, you know, times when, you know, we would have influxes of African Americans and the tough times they had.  But Cliff always had a positive attitude, he always had a great attitude.  And his philosophy was, you know, don't get depressed about this, just overcome it.  You know, and he would tell young people, you know, you go out and get an education and you do better for yourself.  And you could, you always got a good feeling when you went to Cliff's Supper Club to eat.  And it really was not a supper club, I mean it was a hole in the wall by the railroad track.  It was still right next to the railroad yard where it had been originally.  And, you know, he just told a lot of great stories about, you know, events in Waterloo [Iowa] and, you know, old sports stories about, you know, some of the sports legends who came through and just some great old stories.
Story_ID: 544241
Speaker 1: Now, think of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What sounds--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sights, and smells take you back to Waterloo [Iowa]?
Speaker 2: Wow.  You know, to this day, you know, when I hear a train signal in the distance with that whistle, it just takes me back because we lived with that, I mean, it came right down (laughter) the middle of our neighborhood.  And the other thing that takes me back is whenever I smell a meatpacking plant because we were, the meatpacking plant [Rath Packing Company] was right next to our neighborhood and we could tell on the days, when they, we called it the kill days when they were killing hogs and the cattle and the smells.  And then they also had a sheep kill, so they would kill sheep and it was, the smell was, I mean, sickening on the days when they, when they did it.  And so those smells always bring me back, you know, to those early memories of, of my life in Waterloo, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any sights that remind you of Waterloo?
Speaker 2: You know, whenever I go into an African American community, you know, anymore, you know, an older run down African American community it, it just brings back memories of my childhood and the teenage years.  And Waterloo was very segregated and very, you know, you know, dilapidated up until the time I moved out.

Speaker 1: Describe your house where you lived.  Do you remember the street address?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: The first house that I remember living in was 324 Dane Street [Waterloo, Iowa].  And it was in, right in the heart of the African American community.  And in later, in '63 [1963], the urban renewal came in and they took our house to tear it, they tore it down and put a highway through.  And we used to, it was not urban renewal, it was urban destruction because most, the, the things that were torn down were never replaced, so.  But in '63 [1963] they tore it down.  And then we moved to 7th- 1725 Linden Avenue.  And my father [David Creighton] built a new house.  And he, it was a small house probably, you know, a thousand square feet but it was our house and it was new, and we were so excited about this new house and where our room would be, and the new location 'cause it was at that time, it was the edge of the African American community that was very rural but soon, the community (laughter) engulfed us again, so it wasn't many years after that, so.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: I currently have two families, two, my father had a family before he had this family.  So all together I have about ten brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but my nuclear family that we lived in, my oldest sister was named Vernita [Vernita Creighton Betty], the next brother was Leon [Leon Creighton], Larry [Larry Creighton], and then I, then it was myself, and then my youngest brother, Tommy [Tommy Creighton].  And we all, you know, grew up there and stayed there most of our lives and then everybody just kind of moved away.  My sister moved to Detroit [Michigan], and one brother moved to Detroit, one brother moved to Nebraska, and one brother moved to Michigan.  And then my little brother still, is still in Iowa.  He's retired, he's a disabled [U.S.] military veteran and he lives in, lives in Iowa.
Story_ID: 544243
Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school.  What was the name of the elementary school that you went to?
Speaker 2: Well, the first elementary school I went to was a school called Longfellow Elementary School [Waterloo, Iowa].  And it was, at the time it was mixed, it was about half African American and half white.  It was located on the edge of the African American community.  And I went there until third grade.  And I got kicked out in third grade out of elementary school and had to go to a private school starting in the fourth grade.
Speaker 1: And you got kicked out why?
Speaker 2: You know, it was, I don't really know.  In those days, you know, African American kids had to live by a certain regimen and if you didn't, you know, you were branded a troublemaker and, and they didn't have much tolerance for you.  And so I got kicked out and I end up going to a Catholic school called Our Lady of Victory Academy [Waterloo, Iowa], we called it OLVA, we used to call it the Old Ladies Violin Association (laughter) but it was the OLVA.  And it was a school, a disciplinary school.  And they touted themselves with straightening, straightening out, you know, tough young, young children.  And it was actually a very good school, I really learned a lot.  I mean, the education was superior and it was actually a pretty decent school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were your teachers in the elementary, in Longfellow before you went to Our Lady of Victory because, well, were the teachers black and white or all white or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No--
Speaker 1: --mixed?
Speaker 2: --I only remember one African American teacher and that was in second grade.  And all the, all the, all of the other teachers were white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember Mrs. Reed [Olabelle Reed] which was my African American teacher in second grade.  I remember my third grade teacher because she slapped me (laughter) and the one who kicked me out of school.  And her name, Miss Wittenhagen [ph.] in third grade, and I remember her.  And then after that I remember a lot of the nuns.  I remember we had this one nun called Sister Mary [ph.], cause they were all the, the old, what they call BVM [Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary] nuns, they had the whole, the full habits (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) habits.
Speaker 2: And, and her name was Sister Mary Rita Morris [ph.] and we nicknamed her Sister Mary Rigor Mortis (laughter) because she was so tough.  But so, you know, I remember, remember a few teachers that made an impact in, in grade school.
Speaker 1: And how did they make an impact?  Which teachers were they that made an impact in your life?  Or nuns (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, really the nuns.  We had Sister Mary Ameldean [ph.] was the other one and she was a very good teacher and she insisted upon you making sure you, you got your work done and you stayed focus.  And they were, and because that was their life and they had no other distractions other than those children.  And they made sure that you were focused and you, and, you know, 'cause I was a little distracted as a kid, you know.  There was a lot of, you know, unique things going on in the community.  You know, there weren't, you know, being an African American kid in that kind of community it was, it was just tough, it was really tough because there was two sets of rules, well there was one set of rules and two applications.  And, you know, and so that, that didn't set right with me and a lot of my friends but, you know, we didn't know what to do about, we didn't know any better, and so it was a little, it was a lot of distraction because of the racial dynamics in the community.  But the nuns really didn't care about that.  It really wasn't, you know, wasn't racial for them, it was about the kids, and the focus was on the kids and they wanted to make sure that you got educated and they didn't care, you know.  If you got out of line they didn't care what color, you got cracked across the knuckles with that ruler, (laughter) so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you talk about the racial applications being different, what are some of the things that you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, one of the memories I have in that third grade class that I got kicked out of is that, you know, we would, there was like four young African American boys in the classroom and there were some African American girls.  And the teacher just felt that she would come and slap us.  And I would remember getting a big handprint on my face every day and I couldn't figure out why she would slap me every day.  And so and she would slap the other boys the same way and we'd put our head down on our desk.  And then, I just knew that that wasn't right because the other kids weren't getting slapped like that and I just thought that it was inappropriate for that to happen.  And, you know, and I just didn't, I couldn't deal with it, I just couldn't deal with that.  And I'd go home and tell my mother [Lucille Fox Creighton], well, and it kind of fell on deaf ears because I mean she grew up in Alabama, I mean, you know, (laughter) in the, you know, in the '40s [1940s] and so to her, you know, you just have to do what you have to do, you know, to cooperate in school.  And so it was a challenge, it was a challenge.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: You know, early on, I was a decent student and I got better when I went to Catholic school.
Story_ID: 544244
Speaker 1: And then after Catholic school [Our Lady of Victory Academy, Waterloo, Iowa], junior high school, I was a, because I went back to public school in junior high school because I didn't wanna go to the Catholic middle school and high school, so I went back, I convinced my mother [Lucille Fox Creighton] to let me go back to public school.  And everything that I had in public school from seventh through ninth grade, I had already had in Catholic grade school (laughter) so it was easy because it was just a rehash of what I'd already done.  So I got, you know, excellent grades in, in junior high school.  And in high school I was just kind of average.
Speaker 2: What was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 1: The junior high school I went to was called McKinstry Junior High School [Charles S. McKinstry Junior High School, Waterloo, Iowa].
Speaker 2: Spell that for me?
Speaker 1: M, small C, capital, K-I-N-S-T-R-Y.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was named after a prominent local, local businessman.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And the high school that you attended?
Speaker 1: It was called East Waterloo High School [East High School, Waterloo, Iowa].  Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] just spoke at my old high school yesterday, so (laughter).
Speaker 2: At East Waterloo?
Speaker 1: East Waterloo.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, were you involved in extracurricular activities?  You said sport, did you play football?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played football and I was just an average football player.  And I wrestled and I, you know, I always wanted to be a better athlete than I was but that wasn't my calling.  You know, my brothers were, my older brother, Leon [Leon Creighton], was a great wrestler and Iowa has this huge wrestling tradition.  My hometown is where Dan Gable came from.  And Dan Gable as many people know was the Olympic coach for, you know, the Greco-Roman wrestling team, was the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] wrestling coach, and, and was unbeaten through his, you know, junior high school, high school, college career and NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournaments until the last meet but he was just, I mean, famous wrestler.  And so my hometown had that huge wrestling tradition.  And a football tradition.  My football team was very unique because it was ranked number one in the nation one year that I was in high school and I was, sat on the bench most of the time but it was ranked number one in the nation but it wasn't ranked, it was not ranked, in the state.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, but it was, we never lost a game all while I went to high school and but we never got ranked in the state because our team was primarily African American, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Americans.  Okay.  What about music?  Were you in the band or did you play an instrument?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't, you know, we didn't, in those days, I mean, you know, athletes just didn't do that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, you didn't do that.  But, you know, we had a great band.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, let's see.  You graduated from high school in what year?
Speaker 1: In 1971.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now we came through, well, let me, I wanna go back and ask you about the Catholic school.  Did your parents have to pay for you to go to that school?
Speaker 1: No, I think I actually got a scholarship to go.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think I got a scholarship to go.
Story_ID: 544245
Speaker 1: Now, in the '60s [1960s] when you were in elementary school and junior high school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a lot was going on as far as civil rights and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were your parents active in civil rights at all?
Speaker 2: No.  My parents [Lucille Fox Creighton and David Creighton] were, well, my mother was tough, she didn't take any trash but she didn't actively go out and protest.  And, in fact, tried to encourage us to, you know, don't, you know, go to school and, you know, be focused on that because she felt that was more important but we didn't listen, and I personally didn't listen because it was an awakening time, you know, particularly in our hometown and it was an awakening time.  In 19--Waterloo [Iowa] was infamous because as I stated earlier, it was the most segregated city in America as touted by Jet magazine.  And so in the early '60s [1960s] we had riots, just like the bigger cities.  And 1967 was the first riot in Waterloo and in '68 [1968] a major riot where a large part of the business community on the east side of Waterloo was actually burned down and buildings were burned and, and they actually had to call, in 1968 they actually called the Iowa National Guard [Iowa Army National Guard] in to patrol the African American community and cordon it off from the rest of the community.  And they actually stayed there for about a month.  And it was an interesting time.  And our high school [East High School, Waterloo, Iowa], they actually patrolled our high school to make sure that--because the young kids were the ones who were doing all the protesting and the older people, you know, were trying to maintain their jobs at the factory and at the meatpacking plant [Rath Packing Company].  And there were no, I think, there was one African American policeman in the community.  And so we had a lot of conflict and strife, you know, in the, from the mid-'60s [1960s] on until 1970.
Speaker 1: Well, because of the dynamics of that community where the African Americans had to stay in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in one area, it, what were the protests, what were some of the reasons that they were protesting?  I mean, it wasn't like going downtown and sitting in at the lunch counters.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: How were the protests done?
Speaker 2: Well, the protests started for a whole host of reasons and it was like a powder keg, I mean, you just needed a stimulus.  I mean, it was one of the, it wasn't like we, like in the South.  You know, what happened was is, one incident what happened where for example, the police would come in and arrest someone and, and it would just explode like the Detroit [Michigan] riots and, you know, in '67 [1967].  And I had, had, was lucky enough to be in Detroit in 1967 and unlucky enough to be there when the riots started because my other siblings on my, the, the older ones on the, the other side of the family lived there and I used to go there in the summers and I got caught in the Detroit riot.  So I knew what it was like and when I came back home when the riots started, I mean, it was just an explosion.  They came to a football game on the west side of town and they brought all this auxiliary policemen one night and they, they decided that they were gonna arrest somebody in the crowd and then a bunch of other people jumped in and it started a big melee and then it just exploded and the kids started throwing rocks and burning buildings and, and so the, it was just kind of like a spark that, that took to set it off.  And then it, then it changed into a different type of an event because then people started to realize, well, you know what, we don't have jobs.  I mean, you know, as a kid, you know, I used to see other kids, you know, drive around in their Chevrolets and convertibles.  And then, you know, we were, we didn't have anything to do, and so we had another riot that started when all of the kids were in the park playing basketball until two o'clock in the morning and then they decided that they were gonna turn the lights off, so a riot started and then they wanted to have a meeting with all the kids to determine why the riot started and they says, "Well why would you be in the park playing basketball at two o'clock in the morning?"  And one of the kids jumped up and said, "If we had jobs to go to at seven o'clock in the morning we wouldn't play basketball until two o'clock in the morning."  Everybody was like the light was turned on.  And they decided that things had to change.  That young people had to have opportunity and had to have hope because we had no hope.  I mean, we, you know, I mean, it was a time when there was a lot of drugs and, you know, and other things and so kids had nothing to turn to.  So and that was the spark that kind of changed Waterloo to a small degree, to a small degree.
Story_ID: 544246
Speaker 1: Had you decided that you wanted to go to college while you were in high school [East High School, Waterloo, Iowa] or before that?
Speaker 2: You know, I really didn't know because nobody really went to college.  You know, your best hope was to get a job at the meatpacking plant [Rath Packing Company] or get a job at John Deere tractor works [Deere and Company] because that was the tradition.  And to even consider college it just wasn't something that you thought about.  I knew that I didn't wanna stay there, I knew that I had, I wanted to do something different, that I had bigger dreams and bigger aspirations but I didn't know what they were, I didn't know, I didn't, I hadn't formulated that thought but something, there was one simple thing that helped me formulate that thought, and it wasn't that I was scared but it was the Vietnam War and a lot of my friends had gone and come back with, you know, with a limb missing or, or in a box.  And it was an easy choice to, you know, you go to Vietnam or do you go to college.  And I wish that I mean, that I could tell you that I had this aspiration that I was gonna go to college but it was an easy choice.  And when I went to college, I really wasn't committed that first year but then I got challenged.  And I went off to a small college called Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, which was about seventy miles from my hometown, a very, a private college in the north, further north on the Minnesota border.  And, and I got challenged that first year.  Now, I'm gonna back up because in 1968, we walked out of my high school because some guys came back from Vietnam and they said you need, some friends that we knew that were a little bit older than us that we had hung around with in the parks, and we had nothing to do, which we didn't have much to do most of the time, and so, and they said, you know what, you guys should be studying African American history or black studies at the time.  And so, and they said, you know, they actually have books here in your high school and they won't let you see 'em.  So we said that's not true.  So we went and broke into a cabinet and lo and behold there were, there were black studies books in the cabinet that they wouldn't let us have.  So we decided to protest it and we walked out of class, we walked out of class.  And, just they said, well, we'll let 'em stay out of class but Iowa has this formula where you have to have so many students in class to keep your funding and the whole bit, so they had to figure out how to get us back in class.  So, I mean, 'cause all of us walked out and we shut the high school down.  And, and so they decided to give us black studies.  And they hired an African American teacher from the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] to come in and teach black studies.  And so as not to be disingenuine [ph.], I decided to take the class that next semester which would have been my junior year, my first semester of my junior year.  And I was really intrigued by black studies.  And when I went to college in 1971, freshman year, we decided to walk out of college (laughter) and get black studies, so we got a black studies department at my little college.  It was two thousand students at Luther College, and not to be disingenuine, I ended up being a black studies major at Luther College, and a black studies and political science major.  And, you know, did that and really enjoyed it, and really enjoyed learning about African politics and African history.  And it's just something that, you know, I got out of that protest that we did at our high school in Waterloo, Iowa.
Speaker 1: But why Luther College?  Now this is a religious school; right?
Speaker 2: Yes, a Lutheran college, a small Lutheran college.  Well, you know, I had applied to two other schools, I applied to, I think, a school in Michigan, in Kalamazoo [Michigan], I think, it was Eastern [sic. Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] or something like that, and I applied to the University of Iowa.  And being somewhat naive about financial aid, I looked at the financial aid package and Luther was the most expensive and it had the biggest dollar amount so I said that's where I'm going (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And plus it was relatively close to home, seventy miles.
Story_ID: 544247
Speaker 1: Now, what about church?  What was your family religious experience?
Speaker 2: You know, my mother [Lucille Fox Creighton] was a Methodist from her upbringing and my father [David Creighton] was a, you know, you know, dyed in the wool Baptist.  So we had this huge dichotomy in my household.  And so I kind of rotated between the Methodist church and the Baptist church.  But I liked, just personally, I liked the Baptist church better but my mother, because the Baptist church was a little more entertaining.  You know, it was a, my minister was Minister Thad Thomas, who was out of Mississippi, who was just a good old down home guy who just--he preached with all these analogies that you could understand.  And the Methodists, you know, even though you got the message, it just wasn't as impactful for, for a kid.  So I kind of leaned toward my father's church more which was Mount Carmel Baptist Church [Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church, Waterloo, Iowa] which was actually about two and a half blocks from my house.  So I couldn't, there was no way that I could not go to church on a Sunday.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your transition from Waterloo [Iowa] to Luther College [Decorah, Iowa]?  What was it like for you?  Was this, you know, you went away from home to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --visit your older brothers and sisters--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Michigan [Detroit, Michigan], so you had been away from home before but not for an extended period--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of time?
Speaker 2: No, I had not.  And it was a challenge for me going to a small college like that, a Lutheran college.  And it was about, it was at a time, 1971, is when a lot of African Americans were recruited to go to college and they really, you know, opened up financial aid resources to try to, to try redress past wrongs and, and try to attempt to get some parity.  And so we had ninety African Americans at that college when I started and a huge number were from Chicago [Illinois].  But it was still a challenge because I did not get the foundations that I needed in high school [East High School, Waterloo, Iowa].  You know, in retrospect and looking back, you know, we were kind of pushed through, pushed through, you know, classes to get us out of there.  And I stayed there for the full four years and graduated on time.  And really got the hang of it and was challenged because I was so far behind the eight ball when I got there, my writing skills, and, you know, my math skills and everything, I was just, you know, I just was not ready for college.  But I really worked on it in a remedial way to get it, get up to speed.
Story_ID: 544248
Speaker 1: You said that there were about ninety African American students out of two thousand--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that attended the school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you walked out the first year to get the black studies.  What about a black student union?  What were some of the activities that the African Americans came together to accomplish?
Speaker 2: We, we had a great Black Student Union at Luther College [Decorah, Iowa].  In fact, we, we organized, it was actually organized before we got there, it had been organized in the '60s [1960s].  They had a much smaller group of African Americans there.  But in '71 [1971] was the biggest group ever that went to that college and even now it's a much smaller group.  But it was, it was a concerted effort by the university, by the college to do that.  And mainly we partied.  I mean it was a party event.  And they gave us a house.  We had, what we called the Black Cultural Center, and it was right in the middle of campus and it was a, it was a huge house, it was probably built like in the early 1900s.  And, and so we partied.  I mean, we partied because that was a, you know, we didn't have anything else to do other than study and party.  But we did, we had other activities where we just did conscious raising, you know, intellectual events.  And we had, the, the college was very good because they brought in a lot of people like [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.  I remember in 1973 they brought Dick Gregory in and Dick Gregory told me that the world was gonna end in six months and scared me.  And I just saw him recently and told him (laughter) I said, "Dick, you remember when you told me," he didn't remember.  But, but and Hosea Williams and [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond.  And, and, and we had an opportunity to and to sit down with them, you know, in a, in a, in that setting and, and just pick their brains and talk about things and, and it really opened my eyes up about the world and, you know, coming from a, where I came from, you know, meeting these people was, was phenomenal.  We'd bring inmates from the penitentiary in and, and, and African Americans, you know, and bring 'em in and talk to them about their plight and how they got there and, and so it was really, really a good event.  And then later I became a leader in the Black Student Union and ultimately, you know, moved into the house.  I actually moved into the house and managed the Black Cultural Center for the last three years that I was there.
Story_ID: 544249
Speaker 1: So now you're preparing to graduate.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what are your thoughts about what you would do after college?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Lucille Fox Creighton] always told me, she said, "One, you know, one of the things you may wanna do just to protect yourself because you know it's tough to get a job," she said, "why don't you get your teaching certificate and at least you can teach."  And I didn't really wanna come back to my hometown.  I had come back in the summers and worked at the factory and, and, and different things and had odd jobs painting houses and I really didn't wanna come back to my hometown but I really didn't have a concept for how to find another job.  I didn't have, you know, relatives that I could call on and go, you know, and that would hook me up with a job or, and I didn't really know how to, you know, to find one.  The only thing I knew was Waterloo, Iowa.  So I did come back, I came back and did my student teaching in Waterloo and, and taught part time when I came back and, you know, so, that was, that was real helpful.  But, but one of the things about teaching that was real interesting, is I came back to East High School [Waterloo, Iowa] to teach that first semester and there was a principal at East High School, he was an African American and that's, he chose me to come back and work with him because they really needed positive role models for the kids.  And so I had a secondary education certificate.  So his name was Walter Cunningham [Walter L. Cunningham].  And Walter was, Cunningham was, was one of those inspirational guys in the African American community who had taught me in junior high school when I was in eighth grade [at Charles S. McKinstry Junior High School, Waterloo, Iowa].  And I was still a pretty tough kid in eighth grade and but he was a tough guy too but he was also my wrestling coach.  So we couldn't, we couldn't pull anything over on him.  And, in fact, I was causing, I didn't think it was trouble, in his class.  And in those days, they had corporal punishment, you could get a swat.  So he had this walnut paddle that he had holes drilled in that if you got out of line he would give you a swat and he'd make you come in after school and he'd give you a swat.  And so he called me, he said, "Creighton [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton], you're getting a swat after, after school," and I was like, "No, no, why," you know.  So he brought me back in and oh, man, I literally, I mean, the term sit down, you couldn't sit down for a week, you know, you'd have, you'd have this big red spot on your rear end--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --with all these little holes from that paddle.  And I sat up from that point on and took notice and learned math in eighth grade.  I mean, I, if, you know, he made sure that you got it.  And then later on he was the, you know, he was the principal at East High School and when he brought me in he introduced me as the only teacher he had that he'd given a swat to, (laughter) so.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, you got your teaching certificate from Luther [Luther College, Decorah, Iowa] also?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And so that was actually your first job was to teach part time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I taught part time.  And then I started working in, in 1970, late 1975 in corrections but I taught part time and worked in corrections.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you, you graduated from college in '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 544250
Speaker 1: So, in 1975 is when you went to corrections too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, early, well, actually it would have been probably 1976 when I first started in corrections.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but I taught part time and did odd jobs.  I worked at the Boys Club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America] and then I think, I think I got recruited to work in corrections probably in January or February of 1976.
Speaker 1: Did you, were you ever a member of the Boys Club?
Speaker 2: You know, as a kid, I went to the Boys Club, I was a, I had a membership card at the Boys Club and I used to go there quite a bit.  And the old guy who ran the Boys Club he, he saw that I had gotten out of college [Luther College, Decorah, Iowa] which was kind of anomaly in my hometown, so he, he wanted me to come back and, and be a, the librarian and a mentor for the kids which the librarian was more of a counselor (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --than anything because the kids didn't check out a lot of books but we'd counsel 'em and work with 'em and so I did that for a while and taught a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did you get involved in corrections?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, you know, I needed a job and I saw the job posted pretrial release and it was interviewing persons who had gotten arrested to make a decision on whether or not they met the criteria to be released on their own recognizances.  And they had this intricate point system that was utilized that you could make a decision on whether a person got released and so I would go in front of the judges and make a recommendation, "This person has the, the ties in the community, I think, they can be released pending adjudication of their crimes," and so they wouldn't have to post a bond.  And it was real helpful considering that I had lived in the street and I knew most of these people who were in jail and, and, and it was an opportunity for me to, to, you know, to work and make a decent living.
Speaker 1: And most of the inmates in the Waterloo [Iowa], this is in Waterloo?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Were African American?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd venture to say that probably 40 percent of the people who were in jail were African American.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Forty percent.
Speaker 1: And was there a lot of crime in Waterloo?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, it was a lot of petty crime and, and there was a lot of, of the same type of crime that you'd find in any, any, you know, under any impoverished community in, in, in America.  A lot of petty crime but then sometimes you'd have, you know, major crimes that would come through, you know, murder, you know, burglary, you know, most, mostly property crime issues but periodically you'd have major crimes.
Speaker 1: And so tell me what, how did this job fair for you?
Speaker 2: You know, it really helped me out a lot because I learned a lot about people 'cause I'd actually have to go into the jail and interview people and talk with them and talk to their relatives and, and verify their, you know, their, their backgrounds and, and a lot of it were people that I knew.  And it was one of those jobs that was such a grind that within less than a year I became the manager of the unit because I had the perseverance to stay.  People left because it was such a tough job, you know, going into the jail cells and, and dealing with that element of, of, of society.  And since I had, I stayed around and I wasn't ready, I mean, it was, you know, I was not ready to be a manager yet.  I had not had the life experience and the world experience to do it.  But I was the only person left standing so I became a manager very quickly and then gained the respect of the judges which would, help me out much later in my career.
Speaker 1: And, and we're talking you're about twenty-three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty-two, twenty-three years old.
Speaker 1: Twenty-three, twenty-two, twenty-three years old.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now you're the manager of a--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a prerelease, pre--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --trial release program?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 544251
Speaker 1: What happened?  Do you get burned out or--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I ended up, I ended up running, you know, I decided to change careers because I had an African American black studies degree and a political science degree, so I decided to run for office.  And I ran for office in 1978, so I stayed for a couple of years.  And they said, "Well, you know, since you're running for office, the Hatch Act [Hatch Act of 1939] applies which means that you can't work for a government agency and also run for office," which was not true but, but they, they just decided that, you know, I should probably just run for office and not, and do that.  And, and I decided to go ahead and run for office not because, I, I just thought that I needed to ma- have a purpose and that I could really make an impact in my community by becoming a state legislator so I ran for Iowa House District 34 [Iowa House of Representatives District 34] and I was fortunate enough to win the primary but I lost the general election by three hundred votes.  And so I came really close and I would have been twenty-five years old when I did that but it was again a great learning experience having a political science major I knew the theory of political science but I didn't know the practical application of it.  So I learned the practical application of political science by running for office and I, I tell you it was an eye opening experience, (laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that were eye opening?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you know, when, when I, and, and I'll back up briefly and kind of explain it.  My hometown [Waterloo, Iowa] as you know was very segregated as I had mentioned earlier and so I didn't really know the west side of town.  Well, my district was a gerrymandered district at best and so it included part of the east side and part of the west side which I didn't know much about.  I mean, even at this point in my life I didn't know much about the west side.  So I door knocked because all of the, all of the campaign pundits said, "You know, you gotta get out, knock doors, and meet people."  So I'd knock on doors and, you know, on the west side of town and, and people would look out and see me and they said, "You know what I'm gonna let my dog out here in two minutes and so you better," (laughter) "be out from in front of my house," so I'm running and, you know, trying to get away.  And, and you (unclear) but I met a lot of good people too but I got to explore the west side of town and, and it was, it was, it was real interesting.  And but I learned a lot and made a lot of friends, you know, in both, in both parts of the community.
Speaker 1: Was the west side becoming any more integrated by this time, this is in the late '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: The, the, the nearer part of the west side which was closest to the east side was, was poor people but they still were not diverse but they were poor (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But the town had, and so that was the buffer, the buffer zone.  But it, it really had not changed much, it had not changed much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1978.
Speaker 1: What about businesses on the east side?  Did African Americans begin to own more and more businesses on that side of town?
Speaker 2: No, they still, no, I mean, by that time and, and in the late, the mid-'70s [1970s], and the late '70s [1970s], you had African Americans who owned bars, you know.  A lot of bars and, and clubs, you know, hole in the wall clubs I'll call 'em.  And that was the extent of it.  You had one African American who owned a massage parlor and that was about it, that was the only businesses that, that, that African Americans could generate.
Story_ID: 544252
Speaker 1: So after you lose the election, what do you decide to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I got recruited to go work at a bank.  I decided not to go back into corrections.  I had an opportunity 'cause I had a lot of good friends in corrections but it, it was tough.  You know, when you work in corrections, I mean, and your day is filled with burglars, rapists, murderers, you know, petty thieves, you think the world is a tough place.  And so I went to work at, at a bank, a fairly large regional bank in town called National Bank of Waterloo [Waterloo, Iowa].  And it's amazing when I went in as a, a management trainee and the world changed because I dealt with, (laughter) you know, with people who had money now so it was a whole different world for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you would be there for a number of years, so tell me, you went in as a trainee--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then, tell me your progression (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I stayed until, from roughly 1979, late 1978 early 1979 until 1985.  I worked as a trainee, I worked in every department, worked as a teller, I worked in commercial lending, I worked in student loans and installment loans, I worked in accounting, auditing and, and computer department, to get a well rounded experience in the bank and it was, the bank president personally mentored me quite a bit.  And at the end and they decided to make me a bank officer, the last few years that I was there, I was a bank officer in, I did community affairs, I was a community affairs officer in charge of charitable contributions and outreach but I still did bank sales too.  And we kind of did a lot of things and it was a tough time in Iowa because that's when the farm crisis hit.  And the farm crisis was that the price of corn and beans went down and tractors didn't sell because farmers now couldn't buy 'em because they weren't getting enough for their corn and beans to farm, the land hit a, hit rock bottom and that's when the whole farm aid thing kind of developed.  Well, in my hometown they actually did a movie out of my hometown, Jessica Lange was there and they did a movie called 'Country.'  And it was about the farm crisis and it was in the county and because it was such, such a depressed time.  John Deere tractor works [Deere and Company] lost half of its, half of its employees.  And the, the Rath Packing [Rath Packing Company] closed, sold the rights to its name.  And African Americans were hit probably the hardest because they had the lowest level positions in the factory and in the, and so a lot of people left there.  Waterloo [Iowa] lost probably 35 percent of its population.  And I remember as a young bank officer having to put on overalls and go out and repossess tractors and, you know, and cars and, you know, close farms down and, and it was a tough time.
Story_ID: 544253
Speaker 1: And toward the end of that in 1982, I was fortunate enough to be appointed a judge.  I actually had not gone to law school yet because in Iowa magistrates which is the lowest level of the judges, you can, you can be appointed to it if you go through an interview process; they have a judicial nominating commission that appoints the judges.  So I was fortunate and I saw the job posted, it said judicial magistrate and I told my boss at the bank [National Bank of Waterloo, Waterloo, Iowa], the president, I said, "You know what I wanna apply for that job," and I said, "Now if I get it, can I have the time off from the bank to do that," and he said, "Yeah, sure," because he didn't think I would get it.  And I was the only African American that applied out of a 175 people.  And I, I, I felt good about it because, I mean, I knew how the judicial system worked from having made those decisions and having worked with all of the, the people in corrections and I had the respect of the judges and, and they respected my opinion and, and because I, I worked really hard when I worked in corrections.  And I kind of missed that, I liked the banking business because I learned about how money worked but I really missed the corrections side of it.  So, so in 1982 when I went in and, and I made it through all of the interviews and the judicial nominating commission appointed me as, as the new magistrate.  And so in this district, which was what they call a first district, they had five magistrates that did these rotating benches and so it was, it was, it was like an early Judge Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis].  You know, so in, in 1982, you know, as a, as a young man, you know, I, I was sitting on the bench with my judicial robes.  And, you know, and, and it was so, it was so thrilling 'cause the first time I walked out and they announced, you know, "All rise the Honorable Lorenzo Creighton [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton] now presiding," and then I sat, and, you know, they have these benches that sit up high so you can kind of look down on people.  And I really enjoyed it and really enjoyed the, you know, but it was a learning experience for me because it, it taught me how to respect power and how not to abuse power and how to, how because I already understood how abusive things could be from my upbringing and background, and when I was appointed the, the chief judge he brought me in and he said, "Lorenzo", he said, "you know why you got appointed?"  And I said, "I don't know." He said, "Why?"  I said, "I don't know, I don't know why."  And I said, "Because of my experience?"  He said, "No, because we expect you to do the right thing."  He says, "Don't let anybody influence, and you never have," and he says, "and do the right thing and don't let anybody tell you how to, how to do it, you know, and then so, and we, we appointed you because we trust that you'll do the right thing."  And so, and as you have to understand the only African American judge out of ninety-nine magistrates in the whole state and it was a challenge.  You know, when African Americans would appear in front of me, it, you know, my, pole star was fair.  You know, I, I had seen the whole concept of one set of rules and two different applications, I said there's gonna be one set of rules and one application in my court.  If you deserve a break you get a break, if you don't deserve a break you don't get a break, I don't care about the color of your skin, I'm gonna treat you with respect.  And or, you know, or, you know, and I'd, I'd put people in jail, (laughter) I'd let 'em out of jail and--
Speaker 2: What kind of cases were they?
Speaker 1: They were, they were, we generally had small claim cases, amounts up to three thousand dollars.  We'd have criminal cases which would be misdemeanor cases, and then periodically I would have to do work for the district court judges and it would be an appearance on felony cases.  And one of the big cases I had was I had a couple murder cases that I had to set bond and set the, set the appearance date in court and we could do that as magistrates we just couldn't hear the big cases but we could actually do that.  And so, so I'd have trials and there would be some, you know, some major trials on small issues because, because the potential for litigation it would come out of it.  So, I got a lot of great experience from that and, and it intrigued me and that's why I decided to go to law school.
Speaker 2: Who was the, the governor of Iowa at that time, do you remember?
Speaker 1: At that time the governor was, Governor Terry Branstad who, who was the governor for many years.  Actually Terry Branstad who I knew, was, had started as lieutenant governor in 1978 and didn't end his reign as governor until about 1992 [sic. 1999].  So he was a, he was governor of Iowa for a very long time.
Story_ID: 544254
Speaker 1: You said that this is what intrigued you into going to law school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how long before you would go to law school?
Speaker 2: Well, I had always thought about law school because of my, my experience in corrections and understanding politics and how politics worked that the missing piece for me was law school.  But I never had a desire to practice law, I only had a desire to have a law degree.  And because I got tired, I didn't wanna be a victim, you know, I knew to not be a victim, you know, you, you get a law degree.  And so in 1985, I decided to go to law school.  And so I took the LSAT in, in early 1984 while I was a sitting judge and applied to a couple law schools but the one that I was really interested in was Drake Law School [Drake University Law School] in Des Moines, Iowa.  And I got accepted to Drake Law School on a scholarship but it was a school, a full scholarship for tuition for, but for nothing else.  But, but I, I took it.  I said, you know, this is my opportunity, this is my opportunity to do what I've always wanted to do and that was to make a difference in some kind of way.  I didn't know in, in what way but I knew that I wanted to make a difference, so.
Story_ID: 544255
Speaker 1: But before you go off to law school [Drake University Law School, Des Moines, Iowa], and you're still sitting on the bench at--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I guess, in '84 [1984], you become the commissioner of the Iowa Civil Rights Commission?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was appointed by Governor Branstad [Terry Branstad] to the Iowa Civil Rights Commission in the, in the mid-'80s [1980s].  And, you know, sat on the commission as one of the commissioners not the, not the full, not the chairman--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --of the commission but as one of the commissioners.  And again I learned, I learned a lot.  And, you know, we had to make decisions on cases that came to the civil rights commission.  And the governor, who became a friend of mine, felt that I was suited because of my background to be on that commission, so.
Speaker 1: And how long was the commission in, in effect?  I mean, when had it started?
Speaker 2: The commission had actually started much earlier than that.  I think the commission had started in the late '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.  And it, you know, and it continues today but it had really kind of come into its own in the mid-'80s [1980s] as a real force to be reckoned with and it had been given the teeth to really, to make a difference in the '80s [1980s] by legislation in the Iowa Legislature and, and by some well meaning legislators who really gave it the teeth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know actually why it was started?  What, what made this commission different from other states, say--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I think it was very similar to what had been done in other states.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a way, it was basically copied from other states, the model.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the whole concept.  And, and everybody knew that Iowa really needed it because 2 percent of the population was African American.  And, and that was the predominant, you know, minority was African Americans because at that time very few other groups had come to Iowa but 47 percent of the people in the penitentiary were African American.  So it was just a, so everyone knew that things needed to change.
Story_ID: 544256
Speaker 1: You actually, you go to Des Moines [Iowa]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to go to law school [Drake University Law School, Des Moines, Iowa] and what was that experience like after ten years of being out of, out of college?
Speaker 2: You know, it was tough.  It was tough because you, you develop a lot of bad habits.  You know, you, you, you've gotta get back into that study mode again.  And, and law school is by its nature, and, I mean, that was still kind of the, the end of the Socratic Method, you know.  And, and I thought I knew law, you know, and I didn't, you know, I mean I knew it from a practical standpoint but I didn't know it from a theory standpoint or from an educational standpoint so I had to kind of clear my mind and go back.  And, and out of several hundred students there was eleven African Americans who went to law school.  And the first year half of those African Americans had dropped out.  The second year all but four of us had dropped out.  And by the third year there was only two of us left.  And two of us graduated in 1988.  And so it was a, it was a challenge, it was not a fun time.  It was a, and again, those, those, that lack of preparation, you know, kind of haunted me again.  You know, I, I did, I needed better skills than, than, than what I had, and I had to work on those skills, I had to work on my writing skills, and work on my study skills, and work on my reading skills, and when you have to read a thousand plus pages a night and comprehend them, you know, you, (laughter) you know, it's a challenge for a kid coming from where I came from.
Speaker 1: Now, you still were very young for what you have accomplished so far--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'cause in '85 [1985] you're like thirty-one years old.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduate from law school and what are your thoughts then?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I was, in law school I had, I had a challenge because I had, didn't have any resources to, to finish school and you weren't supposed to work in law school, you were supposed to go strictly to law school.  In fact, they forbid it but I secretly worked the whole time I was in law school and then tried to study and tried to operate on four hours of sleep.  And, you know, I, I probably could have gotten better grades had I not done that but it, but I had, I didn't have a choice, because I had tuition but I didn't have money (laughter).  You know--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I didn't have any, any living expense and so I had to pay for my, you know, apartment and that kind of thing.  And then I, while I was a junior in my second semester, junior year, I started working for the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission.  And I'm sorry, I started working for the Iowa Department of Personnel [Iowa Department of Administrative Services] first and I negotiated labor contracts and was a consultant to labor management and kind of worked my way up in the Iowa Department of Personnel.
Story_ID: 544257
Speaker 1: You become a management specialist for the Iowa Department of Personnel [Iowa Department of Administrative Services].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you said some of your duties were to negotiate labor contracts and things like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I had the opportunity because one of the emphasis that I had in law school [Drake University Law School, Des Moines, Iowa] was labor law.  So I had an opportunity to sit as a negotiator on some of the big state employee contracts and one was the AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] contract and the other was the social service workers contract.  I actually chaired the social service worker contract and was the, was the number, well, was the second chair on the AFSCME contract which is a, you know, kind of we have a team of people, you have a team of managers from different disciplines and then the union has a team and you sit and you negotiate and you, you hammer out the contract for a term of years.  And so it was a great experience but also I did a lot of litigation through what, labor arbitration litigation where the state would, would have a case, a union case, and, and we would arbitrate that case.  'Cause in state employee contracts and, and, enabling statutes they, they don't have the right to strike so they have binding arbitration so we'd have these major arbitrations over salary and wages and it would be binding, whatever the arbitrator's decision was is what the parties had to go by.  So you'd have arbitrations that could impact millions of dollars and, and so I got an opportunity to, to, to do litigation work and that was, you know, really, really a learning experience for me, learning how to win.  You know, learning how to, how to present in front of a judge and, and, and be demure and try to get your win, win your case, and so it was a, I learned a lot from that.  But it was a burnout because, you know, you, you know, as a young staff, you know, attorney, you know, you'd work, you know, eighty, ninety hours a week and, you know, it was like law school again.  You know, for a small amount of pay in comparison to what the big litigation lawyers were making.  And I knew that I couldn't do it forever because, you know, it's just one of those jobs where you cycle through, I mean, there's no way, you could do it permanently because that that level of work would have been a, a absolute burnout.
Story_ID: 544258
Speaker 1: So now you graduate, you receive your J.D. in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --nineteen eighty-eight [1988]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, I left that job with the Iowa Department of Personnel [Iowa Department of Administrative Services] and I saw another job posted on the wall and it said Iowa Racing Commission [Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission] deputy director.  And I said wow.  I'm gonna go for that job.  I said, you know what, that's something that I'd really be interested in and it, and it sound like it, you probably only have to work sixty hours a week.  So I applied for the job because it said you needed a law degree.  And I was really hoping that I had a chance but something in my gut told me to go for it.  And so when I, sit down for the interview it's a guy that I, that I campaigned with in 1978, (laughter) you know, when I was running for office.  And he looked, he said, "Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton]," he says, "you know what?  I don't even need to interview anybody else, you got the job."
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And I was so, I was so thankful and so I started out as the deputy director of the Iowa Racing Commission in 1989.  But what was so interesting about the position is that we regulated horse racing and dog racing and, and I prosecuted, you know, cases against, you know, dog owners who would give their dogs drugs or, or jockeys who would shock a horse to make him run or anybody who would give a, a horse drugs to, to impact a race.  And so again, I was back kind of into the litigation mode but I was also the, the regulator over horse racing and dog racing, really enjoyed it.  You know, going to the horse track and watching the races and I managed the, the people who managed the, the state part of the regulatory process at the tracks.
Story_ID: 544259
Speaker 1: And in 1989 they decided, Iowa decided to pass, the legislature decided to pass a bill called riverboat gambling.  And I remember sitting in the gallery at the Iowa Legislature and watching them pass this bill.  And I'm thinking to myself, why would they pass a, a gambling bill on boats.  And it didn't really make a lot of sense to me and my boss looked at me and he said, "And guess what?  You, you gotta regulate that."  I said, "Me?  I don't have enough staff, we, where are we gonna get staff," you know, and because in the bill, they didn't give us an appropriation for staff.  And he says, "Nah, don't worry about it, we got three years before it actually takes place.  And so just, just, you know, learn as much as you can about casino gambling and, and, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll work it out."  So, and when they gave us the bill, they said the Iowa Racing Commission [Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission] would manage it and they gave it to me as kind of my baby because I was the legal person on staff.  And so you have this enabling statute and then you have to put the meat to it which is the regulation.  So we spent three years writing the regulation.  And I got an opportunity, I traveled to Las Vegas [Nevada] and I traveled to New Jersey and, and mentored with a, a lot of the regulators in those jurisdictions but nobody had done riverboat gambling before, so it was a first.  And Iowa was the first that did it.  So in 1991 we opened the first casinos in Iowa and I had an opportunity to write the regulation along with my staff and, and kind of, and, and we didn't recreate the wheel, I mean, we, we took things out of the New Jersey law, we took things out of the Nevada law, and we took things out of horse racing and dog racing regulation because it was gambling also, just a different form.  And we, we created the Iowa regulations on, on riverboat gambling.  And then other states decided that they wanted to copy it because Iowa, you know, had gone through this, this downturn in the farm economy and they were looking for ways to raise revenue.  And so one of the river communities thought it was a great idea because a farm implement factory had closed in Davenport, Iowa, that riverboat gambling would be a good way to generate jobs and opportunity for its citizens.  And so the riverboat gambling bill was pushed through the Iowa Legislature and I was just lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.
Speaker 2: How, how does riverboat gambling differ from any other type of gambling?
Speaker 1: Well, it, same thing, just in a confined space, you know, an infinite [sic. finite] space that use, the riverboats had a, a restriction that you could only have X amount of square footage dedicated to gambling.  And so you had this, this kind of anomaly of having slot machines and table games on a boat that cruised out into the river, you know, it really didn't make a lot of sense but we made it work.  And, and it generated a lot of revenue for the State of Iowa and then other states decided that that they wanted the opportunity to do it and then that's how I developed a opportunity in the business.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And since no one else had riverboat gambling, how did you decide, you know, how did you come up with the regulations?  Just by, like you said taking different parts from different regulations?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we, what we did is we had to make it fit on a boat so, you know, I'd come out to Nevada and I'd walk around these big casinos and say, wow, how are we gone make this on a boat?  I mean, you know, how do, how do you power the slot machines, you know.  How do you, you know, because they also had this fiction of that the boats had a limited time that the casino could be opened, that it could only be opened during a cruise on the river and when it came back.  And then, then it presented all kind of other problems, the riverboats were underpowered for the current in the river because they couldn't have a, an ocean going key alarm and the power and they had to have this paddle wheel that recreated the riverboat history, it was sort of like the people who wrote the bill, the original enabling statute, wanted to somehow sanitize it and make it a little more palatable for the, the anti-gaming forces.  So they put it on riverboats but it worked.  You know, it worked in spite of all of the restrictions in the bill.  But now since that time the laws have changed considerably and now the boats don't have to cruise, they can stay dockside, and they can be connected to power, so they don't have to be powered by diesel generators and the whole bit.  So, so things have kind of evolved over the years since 1991 which was the first riverboats that were opened.
Story_ID: 544260
Speaker 1: So, once you got the riverboats going and you were over all these other--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --entities, what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in 1991, late 1991, early, well, early 1992, I'm sorry, early 1992, a guy came to Des Moines [Iowa], with a staff member from the Mississippi delegation that wanted to open up casinos in Mississippi.  And he was an African American and his name was Harvey Johnson [Harvey Johnson, Jr.].  And Harvey was on the Mississippi Tax Commission [Mississippi State Tax Commission; Mississippi Department of Revenue] which had been given the responsibility because a bill had been, had passed, in the Mississippi Legislature [Mississippi State Legislature] paralleling the Iowa bill to put riverboat casinos in Mississippi but they had, didn't have that three year timeline, they had a very short timeline to get these casinos open.  So they came up and they wanted some reciprocity, you know, from one state to another.  And so I, I gave 'em a seminar about how we had done it in Iowa because it was very intricate on how, what we had done and how we developed a licensing database because you have to license every individual who works there and, and how we wrote the regulations and, and how we, we made the decisions on, on what gaming companies would be licensed and how we ensured the integrity.  And, and they were, they were kind of floored, you know.  And I had learned this over three years, I mean, it's like going back to college again so and then now they have to open up these boats in the next four to five months.  So they were just kind of shocked at how, how much work needed to be done to get the boats opened.  And so I gave 'em this seminar and, and we talked for about a day and a half.  And then the next thing, they went home.  And about two weeks later, Harvey Johnson gives me a call and he says, you know, "Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton], we need help."  He said, "Would you consider coming to Mississippi to help us open up our, you know, casino gaming program in Mississippi."  You know, and the only thing I remembered about Mississippi was driving through there in the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], you know, and, and, and the history of Mississippi.  And I said, I don't know, let me think about that one.  He said, you know what, you know, and he, he burnt my ear for the longest about, you know, you should do it, an African American, you know.  And so I went back and he said now, and the one thing that kind of swayed me at the end of the conversation he said, "You're the deputy director where you're at now.  Here you would be the executive director.  It would be your show."  He said, "So you gotta think about that."  And he said, "Now give me a call back tomorrow and let, let me know what you think."  So I went home and I thought about it, I thought about, I talked to every, you know, my friends and everything about it, and, and I talked to my girlfriend who is now my wife, Lisa [Lisa Shaw Creighton], and, and then I, and she was just kind of taken aback by the idea of going to Mississippi 'cause she had never even been but she had only heard about it.  And, and I told her I said I think I'm gonna do it.  And everybody thought I was out of my mind to go to Mississippi to, to run a state agency.  Well, I did it.  I, I, resigned from the Iowa Racing Commission [Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission] went down and joined the Mississippi Gaming Commission as the executive director with a small staff and basically did the same thing I had done in Iowa but in a much shorter time frame.  But, you know, we knew what mistakes we had made there and I recruited some of my staff members to come with me and we knew what mistakes we had made and we knew how to get it going in a shorter timeline and I didn't even take a pay increase.  And they didn't even pay for me to go down.  I remember driving this U-Haul down and, and, you know, moving to Mississippi.
Story_ID: 544261
Speaker 1: And so tell me when do you get married?
Speaker 2: You know, I got married in 1993.  So my, my girlfriend [Creighton's wife, Lisa Shaw Creighton] came down with me and we got married, we got married in 1993.  And she, she did not like Mississippi in the early days.  I remember when we first got down we were looking for a, a place to stay and so we knew we had to have an apartment before we bought a house, and we got down to the apartment, we, we got the apartment sight unseen (laughter) so, when we drove up they said, "We think it's rented."  And I said, "Oh, no, no, no.  You know what I sent you guys three months deposit, it ain't rented," you know.  And then so they hemmed and hawed and they let us have the apartment.  And it was in a, not a, it was in a part of Jackson [Mississippi] where African Americans normally didn't live and so that was a first experience.  It was on this lake, the Ross Barnett Reservoir which is a famous segregation, segregationist, Mississippi governor.  So here I go again (laughter).  And so but we, and, and it worked.  And, you know, we opened the casinos in Mississippi and, you know, it was, well, well, the funniest story though is when the governor had to, who was a, who ran on a kind of an old throwback platform, Governor Kirk Fordice, rest his soul.  He ran on a, a, you know, kind of an old style, you know, staunch throwback Republican, you know, almost to the segregation days.  You understand I was hired sight unseen by one of the persons on the tax commission who was an African American and he didn't bother to tell him that I was African American.  And I think, and I never verified this story that they thought that a guy by the name of Creighton [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton] from Iowa couldn't be African American.  So when they brought me into the governor's office and they said, "We want you to meet the new executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission," you know, and then he, this is who you're gonna take down to introduce to the press.  And understand, you know, gaming coming to a state was big news.  And he had his reading glasses on and I sat across the desk from him, he looked down over his glasses at me and said, "Wow," he says, "well, at least you're not a, an out of state tassel loafer wearing lawyer," and as he said that I slid my shoes up under his desk so he couldn't see the tassels (laughter) and, and he didn't see.  He read down my resume, he said, "Well, I guess, we'll introduce you anyway."  And so we went down and the press, they, they had a field day.  The press just gathered around and, and, and you have to put it in perspective, you know, this is 1992, not really all that long ago but I was the only African American heading an agen- an agency of government in Mississippi.  You know, a state that's probably 30 to 40 percent African American.  And again here I am an anomaly and I immediately garnered some enemies because I shouldn't have been in that position.  But the reality was is they needed someone with experience in that position to get this done and they're just, I mean, they couldn't recruit people from the industry because they made so much more, and they couldn't, there was no other states that had done it, so it was a real catch-22.  But, you know, I toughed it out, you know, and it was, it was a challenge.  And the press was after me every day, you know, about any little issue and it was a challenge, it was a real challenge.
Story_ID: 544262
Speaker 1: Who were some of the top people in the gaming industry during that time, say even in Nevada and New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was Steve Wynn was still kind of doing his thing, you know, in Nevada, you know, The Mirage [Las Vegas, Nevada] had opened in 1989.  You know, Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] was still just kind of exploding at that time, between 1989 and 1992, there was this explosion in Vegas but it was a, you know, it was a different Vegas then than it is now, Vegas has since exploded again.  A lot of those companies were really hesitant to come to Mississippi until they kind of saw what it would be.  And being a novice at this still, one of the things that I decided to do was kind of to change the way that that Mississippi did business as, as far as it related to gaming.  When I got there, I had been told that, "Well, we don't want gaming to be big in Mississippi, we just want these kind of ma and pa operators and we don't want it to be big."  And, and, and my pole star again was what was in the best interest of the State of Mississippi and that's what, not what in the best interest of, of, you know, Billy Bob's constituency.  And I got a lot of pressure in that respect, you know, "I'm a send Billy down there to see you and you need to give him a job," and, and, you know, and I just, you know, I, I didn't do it.  You know, I did what I thought was the right thing to do.  You know, I, I, I got there on integrity and I was gonna keep my integrity.  And, and that was a huge challenge because I had a lot of pressure from, you know, the political forces in Mississippi to, you know, to do the wrong thing.  And I knew better, you know, I was smarter than that.  And so what I did is I created--a lot of the gaming lawyers helped me out in Mississippi and they, I created what they called a beauty contest.  I changed the criteria by which license applications were granted and basically said who's gonna hire the most employees, who's gonna have the most economic development, who, who's gonna do the most for the State of Mississippi is how we're gonna rate the applicants for a license.  We had forty-five license applications and so we, we rerated those licenses and so that favored the bigger companies with the bigger, with the greater resources that could do the most for the state.  And but the gold ol' boys had a different plan, they had a plan that, that they, their buddies were gonna get licenses and then turn around and sell 'em to some big companies and take care of their little constituency.  Well, I kind of, kind of messed that up.  So I was not real popular among some of the good ol' boys in Mississippi.  But I always, and my friends who know the story, you know, always say, you know, "You kind of saved them from themselves," (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 544263
Speaker 1: So how long do you stay in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed in Mississippi for, you know, not a, not a real long time, I stayed in Mississippi for a little over a year.  And they, they decided that they were going to change the rules at the commission [Mississippi Gaming Commission] which would say that if you had worked at the commission you couldn't get a job in gaming for two years.  Well, that's what I knew.  So I said, you know, now that I've got it established and we've got the casinos opened and the regs [regulations] are in place, and, you know, the good ol' boys can't, can't, you know, give their, their friends licenses, you know what, it's time for me to look for other opportunity.  And so I got recruited to run a casino in St. Louis [Missouri], and I took that job.
Speaker 1: How many casinos did you open in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: When I was in Mississippi we opened about four casinos or five casinos, we, we, and I was just opening a fifth one when we left.  And as it turns out, you know, Mississippi now is the third largest gaming jurisdiction in the United States.  You know, the first is Nevada, the second is New Jersey, and Mississippi is the third.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And it's because we convinced them, my staff convinced them to keep the tax rates low and, and not to, and not to restrict licenses and let it be laissez-faire, let the, let the, let the market control the industry because if you do it any other way you get a potential for corruption and, and, and things like that and so it worked, you know, the model worked.
Speaker 1: So every license was unrestricted?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically the only criteria was, is it a legal site, under, under Mississippi statute that enabled gaming, and it had to be approved by the commission, the site, and you could, as long as the site was legal you could put a casino anywhere you wanted.  As long as, and the sites were all based upon water.  Now, they didn't have to cruise, they, it was a different modification from the Iowa law, it was a modification from the Iowa law which didn't require the boats to cruise, they just had to be on water.
Story_ID: 544264
Speaker 1: And in Tunica, Mississippi, we got an attorney general's opinion to say that the Delta was water so (laughter) we could put 'em, you know, any, about three thousand feet off of the river.  And, and, Tunica was really the, the place for me that that that really impacted me the most.  And I, I pushed casinos in Tunica, Mississippi, for a very simple reason.  I went to Tunica, Mississippi, in 1992 and it was a big cotton field.  And it, it was a county that had about eight thousand residents but it was the, it had the worst dichotomy of any kind of, and what I mean by dichotomy, it had, it was the poorest county in the Americas, probably North and South America, but it had the most millionaires per capita of any county in America.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And the, and the millionaires were the landowners who owned all the plantations as they called them.  And so I met with all these plantation owners and talked about their sites so they could put casinos there.  And they, and up to that point, all of the African Americans had worked as sharecroppers or farmhands at a very low wage in the cotton fields and, and in the catfish farms.  And it was a huge county but only had eight thousand residents.  And it was, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] had visited there in, in the late '80s [1980s] and, and dubbed it Little Haiti because and, and it had this area of town where they had the open sewage ditch that went down through the middle of town, right down through the middle of the African American neighborhood and they called it Sugar Ditch because it was so bad.  People were traditionally on welfare, traditionally unemployed or seasonal workers.  And when I went there, you know, I said, we gotta put casinos here.  And so I worked with Attorney General Mike Moore's [Michael Moore] staff to come up with a plan that we could legally put casinos in Tunica County [Mississippi].  And it was, it was really, really, you know, kind of historical for me because the attorney that I worked with, it was a young man, and I miss, I'm losing, I'm brain locking on his name right now, but he came out of the Delta, he was a lawyer who went to Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], very liberal but his father had been the one who had given Byron De La Beckwith the gun to shoot Medgar Evers.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: You know, but they wanted to change Mississippi, you know, they rejected that past.  And, and he and I worked together to, to put those casinos up in, up in Tunica.  And it worked.  And now when you go to Tunica you have people who, who make a living wage, you know, who, who make forty, fifty thousand [dollars] a year.  We actually had to bus people from Marks, Mississippi, and small towns into Tunica, give 'em life skills, teach 'em how to comb their hair, how to wear their clothes, you know, how to, how to speak normally.  And, I mean, it was a, it was an amazing transformation.  And then now I go back to Tunica and some of those same people who, who needed those basic life skills now are managers and supervisors who have homes and cars and, and their kids can go to school.  There are still some issues, you know, in the county because of that tradition, traditions die hard but, but now, I mean, it's just a different world, there's apartments, and oh, I mean, it's, it's just an amazing place.  And there are several casinos and they feed the Memphis [Tennessee] market and, and the Arkansas, and, and it's an amazing transformation.  Now I, I never got any credit for any of that because, (laughter) you know, they didn't, they didn't want the idea of a, you know, of a person like me coming into Mississippi, and it's more parochialism than anything else and making a difference, so.
Story_ID: 544265
Speaker 1: You pack up and you go to St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, tell me about St. Louis.
Speaker 2: First job running a casino, you know, I got an opportunity to switch sides from a regulator to an operator.  And it was very interesting because most people in this business don't start out as the president of a casino, they actually start out, you know, in the dish room and work their way up to, you know, to a dealer, and, and you know, and then become a floor supervisor and then a, you know, a pit boss and then a shift manager and table games dealer, and then the next thing you know they're president of a casino.  And, you know, it takes twenty years for that transformation but here I am, you know, my first opportunity was really OJT [on the job training].  But having come from that regulatory background and, and having the law degree, you know, and understanding how to manage people generally, it was, it was not a tough transformation for me to, to go to managing a casino.  And it was at a time where it was a big expansion in the industry so they needed people.  And they needed, you know, to, to move people along quickly so I got that opportunity to run a casino in St. Louis.  But I didn't stay long.  We got it close to opening because the, in Missouri the law had not changed at that time, they had a couple of elections and I got recruited to go to an operational casino [Lady Luck Natchez] in, back in Mississippi [Natchez, Mississippi] so I came back to Mississippi.
Story_ID: 544266
Speaker 1: All right.  So you leave St. Louis [Missouri] and you go to Natchez [Mississippi] to a operational casino.  What was the name of the casino?
Speaker 2: It was called Lady Luck Natchez [Natchez, Mississippi].  And it was a Las Vegas company [Lady Luck Gaming Corporation, Las Vegas, Nevada] that recruited me to go down and, and open up casinos.  And they, and it was a, I actually was gone open a casino in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and run the one in the Natchez.  We never got the one in Vicksburg opened because I think they ultimately sold the site but I was kind of commuting between Vicksburg and Natchez, Mississippi.  And that was an experience.  Natchez was an operational riverboat, a very small riverboat in a, in a small community.  Again, you know, great on the job training.  Got an opportunity to really put my theories to test.  You know, to, to, to grow revenues and, and I was fortunate enough because I kind of thought out of the box.  I didn't come from the industry and so I went down and it was a struggling casino, I mean, usually, you know, that was the kind of opportunity I got and I took it.  And the pay was much better than what I had made as a regulator.  So, but it was a step back as far as location, I mean, St. Louis was a big city, vibrant, a lot of things going on and to go back to Mississippi and my wife [Lisa Shaw Creighton] was like oh, no.  You know, we were, we were married now and, and so we decided to go back to, well, I decided to go back and she followed (laughter) so we went to, went to Natchez.  But we lived in Vicksburg and so I drove about seventy miles.  You know, I'd stay down to Vicksburg two or three days a week and I'd come home and I'd stay down there, I mean, in Natchez and then I'd come back home.  But I was, I was able to double the revenues of that casino in a relatively short period of time and my bosses were truly impressed by that but it really wasn't rocket science, it was just that I had to cater to the, to the real population.  I mean, the, the belief was that the Garden Club [Natchez Garden Club, Natchez, Mississippi], which was the kind of the owners of the antebellum homes and they have the pilgrimage trails in Natchez and the whole bit, would, would patronize a casino and that really wasn't the customer.  And so all of the marketing was geared toward them.  Well, I geared the marketing to the real customer.  You know, we got great entertainment in and, and the African Americans who could afford to gamble came to the, to the casino. And my bosses never came down to see me so they didn't really know what we were doing but the, but they saw the revenues shoot up, so they were real excited about me, you know, me being down there at that time.
Story_ID: 544267
Speaker 1: But not long I got an opportunity to move.  So I was fortunate enough to, I got a call one day from a, a company called Bally's [Bally Entertainment Corporation].  And Bally's, they had heard that, you know, I had done a good job in Natchez [Mississippi] and I got an opportunity to interview with the guy who ran Bally's, the CEO, a guy by the name of Wally Barr.  And so Wally called me to New Orleans [Louisiana] and said, you know, "Would you be interested in coming to work for Bally's?"  Well, Bally's was a much bigger company than Lady Luck [Lady Luck Gaming Corporation, Las Vegas, Nevada].  Lady Luck was a very small gaming company, they didn't have a lot of casinos and but Bally's had casinos in Atlantic City [New Jersey] and Las Vegas [Nevada] and I said wow, you know.  I, I, I started kind of visualizing the potential to even maybe one day ending up in Las Vegas if I got with a bigger company.  So I talked with Wally Barr and he offered me the opportunity to go to New Orleans to run a casino that was just about to open and they were having some challenges with the, with the vessel.  The vessel was in a neighborhood that was predominantly African American, Eastern New Orleans on Lake Pontchartrain.  So, I took the position and again we moved from Mississippi to New Orleans.  My wife [Lisa Shaw Creighton] was real happy about that though, she, now she got an opportunity to come back to a bigger city.  So we, we made the, the trek to New Orleans.  And, and in July of 1995 I started, I started as senior vice president of operations for Bally's Casino and Lakeshore Resort [sic. Bally's Casino Lakeshore Resort] in New Orleans which was a, which was a much bigger casino and a much bigger operation than the boat in Natchez [Lady Luck Natchez, Natchez, Mississippi].  And so it was a, it was a, it was a learning experience also running that casino in a much bigger town with a little different politics than, than a small town in Natchez and but it was, but it was a good opportunity for me.
Speaker 2: Was it a better opportunity?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  I think it was, well, it was more money clearly.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But, but it was a better opportunity from a career path because the company that I was working for now had more opportunity with more casinos around the country.  And in the next year it merged, it merged with Hilton Corporation [Hilton Hotels Corporation] which even gave me more opportunity.  So with the Hilton Corporation it brought a few more casinos in as well as the Hilton chain, and the economic power of the Hilton Corporation in gaming.  And so it really, really, opened up the opportunities for me and, and so I stayed in New Orleans for quite a number of years.  I stayed in New Orleans from 1995 until 2001.
Story_ID: 544268
Speaker 1: And in 2001 'cause I had always explained to my boss that I would love to have an opportunity to come to Las Vegas [Nevada].  That was, that was, had been a dream of mine.  I had actually visited Vegas in 1980 for the first time and was intrigued with it.  I remember sitting on, right in, you know, and the place I stayed was the Flamingo, Flamingo Las Vegas [Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada].  And I walked around, I said I wonder what it would be like to run one of these places.  I couldn't even imagine it because it was just such a, you know, a comprehensive business, you know, and many different facets, you know.  You got food, you got casinos, you got hotel rooms, you got entertainment, and I just, I couldn't even conceive of how one person could run it.  And got the thought out of my mind but then when I got that, and got in the industry that thought always stayed with me.  And so in, in 2001, the CEO of the company then, which was called Park Place Entertainment [Park Place Entertainment Corporation; Caesars Entertainment, Inc.], we had evolved again and, and gone through a transition and a merger, we had spun off from Hilton [Hilton Hotels Corporation] and we created a new company called Park Place Entertainment.  And now we had more casinos in Vegas, and, you know, Caesars Palace [Las Vegas, Nevada] was, was our mothership property, and Flamingo and casinos in Reno [Nevada] and Mississippi and all over, you know, all over the country.  And so I got recruited to come to Vegas as the vice president of, of community and government affairs because of my government background.  And it was a little bit of a step back from casino operations which I loved but it was an opportunity for me to get to Vegas.  And so I talked to my family and we, you know, we all agreed, you know, we wanna go to Vegas, you know, Vegas was a, for me, it was, you know, the, kind of the mecca of gaming, you know, if you, if you wanna be in gaming this is the place to be.  So when I came out I did that job for about a year and a half and it was my responsibility to set up the community affairs program, which was the charitable program for Park Place and, and with my legal background, I mean, I researched, you know, the 501s [501(c)(3)] and how to, how to set it up, and what was the best charitable model to use.  And then also I did government affairs for the company worldwide, predominantly in the United States.  And so it was my responsibility to track legislation and to give political fundraisers, to set up our PAC, our political action committee, and solicit charitable contributions, I mean, not charitable, well charitable contributions from the properties and our, and, and our employees but also to solicit political contributions from, from people within the company to fund various initiatives that we needed, you know, with, with politicians.  And, and so I wanted to make sure it was done on the legal, you know, it was done proper, and they knew my background as a regulator for integrity and honesty and so, they said, you know what, "This is the guy we wanna pick to bring to Las Vegas to, to set this up."  And so we, I set up the program and, and did it for about a year and a half and my old boss, Wally Barr who was the, the operations person for the company said, "Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton], do you wanna go back into operations?"  And I said yes (laughter).  And because that was my dream.  And he says, "Well, there's an opening yeah, there's a president's job at the Flamingo, would you be interested in taking that job?"  And I said absolutely.  You know, and, and, you know, all these thoughts came back to me, you know, how I'd sit there in 1980 and how I thought about this, and it was, you know, and I, I just say, you know, I must be the luckiest man, you know, on the planet Earth.  I mean, and, and, you know, coming where I, from where I came from, you know, to running the Flamingo, was, was a major step for me but it was, it was a, you know, I was so ecstatic about it.  And so I came to the Flamingo and, and again I was lucky enough to, to, to get the money to renovate it and I again raised the revenues real well and, and stayed at the Flamingo until, until 2003.  I stayed at the Flamingo, well, I'm sorry 'til 2005 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) '5 [2005].
Speaker 1: And had an opportunity to, you know, really make an impact at the Flamingo and interact with the employees.  And, you know, it's a huge hotel, you know, 3600 rooms.  And, you know, it's just a, it was a, I learned a lot, I learned a lot about hotel operations, marketing again and, and, you know, you know, table games operations, slot machine operations, on a Vegas scale.  And, and how to, how to bring in customers.
Story_ID: 544269
Speaker 1: What happened was in 2005, another merger.  You know, I had gone through several mergers and they decided that that Harrah's hotel casino company [Harrah's Entertainment, Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corporation] was going to buy Caesars Entertainment [Caesars Entertainment, Inc.] which was our new name at that time.  And I decided that it was probably time for me to look for other opportunity because I didn't know what the future was with this company.  I knew them as a regulator in Mississippi and didn't have a great experience with them, knew them as a competitor in New Orleans [Louisiana] and didn't have a--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --great experience with them and I said, you know, it's probably time for me to, to look for other opportunities.  So I got recruited to come to MGM Mirage company [MGM Resorts International], which has the majority of the casinos in Las Vegas [Nevada] and I jumped at that opportunity.  And Caesars Entertainment let me out of my contract and I was able to come over to MGM Mirage and they offered me the position as president and CEO of New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: And, and tell me what that entails?
Speaker 1: You know, it's, it's a comprehensive job.  It's just like any casino.  In Vegas, you know, it's evolved over the years from, you know, from Steve Wynn's early days in 1980 when I first went to Flamingo [Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada], you know, the casino was the, the big thing, that's where your revenue was made and everything supported the casino and, you know, you gave away buffet passes and you got people into the casino, hotel rooms were cheap.  Well, Vegas has evolved.  I mean, it's a, it's an adult destination and people come here for more than gambling, you know, you have great shows and we have several shows here in New York-New York.  We have a Cirque du Soleil show 'Zumanity.'  You know, we, we just brought in Rosie, Roseanne Barr for a comedy show, a temporary comedy show.  We, we have great restaurants, you know, we have high end restaurants, we have spas, we, our hotel room product is, is, you know, will, will match any in the world.  So, you know, Vegas has changed.  And so you have to run all of that, you have to run, you know, your, your casino, your hotel, your, your food and beverage outlets, your, your, all the other amenities.  And, and then you have to be competitive, you have to compete with all the other people on the Strip [Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada] who, who want those same customers, so it's a, it's a fun place.
Story_ID: 544270
Speaker 1: Now, you consider New York-New York [New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] a, a middle market.  What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Well, when we say middle market we, in our company we have, you know, high end product, Bellagio [Bellagio Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] is our high end product.  You know, MGM [MGM Grand Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] has really high end rooms.  Like, for example, MGM has a, which is our sister property across the street, has a area called the mansions, and it has a motor court and we come pick you up in a Bentley or a Rolls Royce.  And the suite that you're in may be anywhere from seven thousand square feet to twenty thousand square feet with your own swimming pool, in your suite.  You know, a high end restaurant, we have a French restaurant at MGM that it's rated the number one French restaurant in, in North America.  And that's the high end.  And, and, you know, and then we have Mandalay Bay [Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] which has high end product.  Then we have Mirage [The Mirage, Las Vegas, Nevada] which has high end product.  And so we, we're in that middle range market.  We cater to, you know, that middle range customer who wants good value, but they wanna, they wanna have a good experience also.  They wanna have a nice clean room, they wanna go to a good restaurant, they wanna experience shows, and they so, and that's what we, we call the middle market.  And then we have the economy, which is below us, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many employees do you manage here?
Speaker 2: Here at New York-New York we have about 2,300 employees.  And, and that's primarily because we run three shifts of operation.  But we really have more because most of our restaurants are leased out so but we don't include those employees in our, in our count.  But probably at New York-New York we have about 3,500 people in total who work here on a twenty-four hour basis.
Speaker 1: How important is customer service?
Speaker 2: Customer service is the pinnacle of this business and we spend a lot of time on customer service.  And this company, one of the reasons I was so glad to get to this company is that we have a diversity program that focuses on, on making sure that we have a diverse workforce and that we understand diverse customers and we spend a lot of time and effort in that.  And we spend a lot of time on customer service because hey, it's all about the experience.  And our employees know to get you back because you're gonna tip better, you're gonna spend money here, they need to treat you like a, you know, they need to treat you with respect and treat you like they want you to come back.  So we spend a lot of time on customer service and making sure that the, that the experience is a great experience for you.
Speaker 1: Well, I just wanna let you know it's working.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm impressed.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 544271
Speaker 1: What about up and coming additions to the hotel?
Speaker 2: We, we have a lot of things going on.  And, and that's the thing about Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], you always have to, the cycle is much shorter on reinventing yourself.  And but it's still a challenge because everybody is doing it so construction is a premium.  But what we're doing now is we're renovating all of our corridors and we're going back and renovating all of our rooms, we are adding new restaurants, we're bringing in celebrity chefs, we're putting in new two new nightclubs, we're putting in a, a club called ROK Vegas [ROK!] which is a rock club.  And we're also putting in another club which is going to have a, a high end casino gambling pit right inside the club.  And we're also going to continue the renovation of the casino floor, all new carpet, new trellises, new lighting, new chandeliers.  And so next year we're gonna spend the, you know, you know, well, actually this year and next year we'll probably spend $80 million in total in renovation programs on the property, so a lot of changes.
Speaker 1: And, and I understand you wanna focus on older clientele?
Speaker 2: Well, when we, you know, old is a relative term (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, especially when you're old.  Now, but old is a relative term.  What we, what we wanna focus on is the customer that can enjoy Vegas.  And Vegas used to be touted as a kid friendly place, it's evolved from that, you know, the theme parks are gone.  I mean, we do have a roller coaster here at New York-New York [New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] but really little kids can't ride it.  But the dichotomy is, is that we have a show called 'Zumanity' which is a little bit racy and can be considered a little bit over the edge so that's our dichotomy.  And we have a, an arcade but we're gonna take about half of that arcade, make it much nicer and then use the other half for additional meeting space for our convention customers.  So we're, we're, we're focusing in Vegas more on that customer who is mature, who appreciates the amenities, the spas, the great restaurants, the, the nightclubs, so and that's a, that a wide range from that young hip edgy trendy up to, you know, that mature person who still likes to come and, and have a good time, so we, we have a little bit for everyone.
Story_ID: 544272
Speaker 1: I know that you worked in Mississippi and when Hurricane Katrina took place--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --tell me about your feelings and experience with that?
Speaker 2: You know, it was really tough.  I mean, we, we having lived it before.  You know, we lived on Lake Pontchartrain, our house was in Slidell, Louisiana, on Lake Pontchartrain.  And I had seen the storm surges before, you know, and hurricanes that near misses and that had come near.  And running a boat, a huge boat on the lake, we were always aware of it, and we tracked it through Doppler radar because we had radar on the boat because the boats were early days were required to cruise.  And so I spent a lot of time with the boat engineers and captain so I could better understand the impact of what a hurricane would do.  And it was no secret to people who, who were in the industry that I was in and who were, or were in the boating or shipping industry in New Orleans [Louisiana] what would happen if New Orleans or any community nearby took a direct hit from a hurricane of significant strength.  We knew that New Orleans would be flooded and that the levees would be breached, that was not a secret to me.  I mean, I clearly understood that.  And where I lived I was always concerned about my family's safety because we lived about thirty, you know, forty feet from the water, you know, in a beautiful, beautiful neighborhood.  When it, when it did hit, we had already, clearly we were in, in Las Vegas [Nevada] but we watched it on the news and when I saw it coming in, I knew what would happen because my engineers had told me, they said, "Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton], where you live," and this is flashing back to when I was still in New Orleans, "where you live, it'll be about forty feet of water, a surge will come in and hit your home, so you do not want your family to be there, you do not wanna try to ride out the storm."  And so in '98 [1998], I think, Hurricane Georges came and I was actually in Vegas at a meeting, I'm calling my family, "Get out of there, leave, leave, leave."  And so they finally, they left and they went up to Jackson, Mississippi, and stayed with friends and up in Jackson and it was a miss, it didn't hit but we knew what would happen.  And so when it hit, I was not surprised.  I mean, I, I knew what amount of devastation it would be, and I knew that the levees would be breached because my landlord, which we paid rent to from the boat in our casino [Bally's Casino Lakeshore Resort, New Orleans, Louisiana], was, was sitting on, right next to the Orleans Levee Board levee, so we actually our, our landlord was the Orleans Levee District which manages the levees in New Orleans.  And so I spent a lot of time with the levee board engineers talking about our casino.  And what impact--because it was a huge part of their budget.  So they didn't want any damage to happen, you know, because that money went to fix the levees or purported to go fix the levees.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And, you know, we, we knew, we knew.  And when I saw the amount of devastation and I started getting the calls from all my ex-employees and, and me and my wife [Lisa Shaw Creighton] just made a conscious decision that we were gonna spend money to help people that we knew.  And, you know, I, my old secretary was the one that, that, you know, that I wanted to help.  And so I helped her get a place in Atlanta [Georgia], you know, hoping that she could, kind of survive and kind of get it back together, you know.  And all the other employees are calling and I'm writing checks, you know, and I didn't keep track of how much money I spent but look I felt I had been blessed and shame on me if I can't share the blessings, you know, where I came from and the things that I had been through in my life and I couldn't share the blessings, shame on me.  And I've believed from my community affairs days when I worked at the bank [National Bank of Waterloo, Waterloo, Iowa] and, and that, that, you know, what you give, you get back tenfold.  I've always believed that and, and, and that's just the way I was.
Story_ID: 544273
Speaker 1: My secretary never, and this is a story that I gotta tell, but I, I never, I didn't, I don't tell many people the story because I didn't do it for any kind of notoriety or anything (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: But I called her up one day and asked her how she was doing and she said, "Well, I got twenty-six cents in my pocket," and she has two kids and they were sleeping on the floor at various relatives' house and they were kind of rotating around, when they burnt out with one relative they go to another relative and but that's, I mean, that story is told thousands and thousands of times over.  And it was about three weeks before Christmas and we as a family decided that we, we basically aren't gonna have Christmas, we're gonna, we're gonna spend the money to get my secretary's house put back together.  She lived on the outskirts of the 9th Ward in a town called Violet, Louisiana.  Fortunately her house was brick.  And, now you understand it was Christmas of this, of, of '06 [2006]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, and her, it was totally destroyed interior wise, the roof had fallen in, the furniture was all jumbled up, the mold like you wouldn't believe, the walls had all fallen in but the brick structure was still there and the studs were still there.  So went in, so what I did, is, I, I talked to my wife [Lisa Shaw Creighton] and I recruited my two brothers-in-laws and my eighteen year old stepson and the week and a half before Christmas we went down and we renovated her house.  And we, I had help 'cause before I went down, I had some friends that I called up and I got someone to go in and, and put the roof back on.  And another friend to go in and do the sheet rock and I paid 'em.  And then we came in and we did the majority of the finish work.  And, and my brothers-in-laws were real excited about doing it, both of 'em are very technical guys, you know, Ron [Ronald S. Shaw], and, and the other one is Chico [Chico Rhashiatry].  And both of 'em, you know, one is an engineer and the other, you know, does carpentry and electrical work and, and my son and I were just kind of the muscle to kind of get it all done and I know enough to be dangerous.  So we went in and, and it was a challenge.  And even the power company, which is bankrupt, couldn't even come out and hook up the power, we paid the power bill and they said, "Good luck we may get around to you."  But we knew we needed power to get it done.  So my brother-in-law got on the roof and connected the power.  And we, we put down tile and we, we, we painted and we, you know, did the trim work and we put new doors on and, and we, by the time we left, our goal was, is to get her in the house, we were 90 percent complete.  And we, we ended up getting some spot labor to help and we, we got her in the house.  I got some, I recruited some of my friends here, one of my buddies bought her a, a refrigerator, another buddy bought a stove, somebody else bought a couch, and, so, you know, it, it, it really worked out and we got her back in.  Now, the interesting story to back up, she had, she had told me the story about her grandmother, she was asking her grandmother before I called, she said, "What am I gonna do," she said, "I have no future, I have no chance, I don't know what to do, I don't know where, where my kids are gonna sleep, I have no money, I have no prospect to do anything."  And she said, "I don't even have any clothes," she said when they left New Orleans [Louisiana] they left everything there.  So she had like two outfits, she said, "I've been wearing 'em all year, I can't even go look for a job."  And so my wife sent her, you know, a five hundred dollar gift certificate to go, you know, to go buy some clothes from one of the stores.  And she said, she was embarrassed to tell me she said, "I even had to buy underthings, you know, with it, 'cause I had, you know, I had nothing."  And but her, her grandmother told her to look at this verse in the Bible and she looked at this verse and it said, fast for twenty-one days and pray, and she swears this story is true.  And on, and she said, and on the twenty-first day, you called me.  You know, and she, she said her grandmother said, you know, "God, you know," she said like, "God put that in his mind," (laughter) so.  So and hey, you know, and they, and they're firm believers in the story, so.  So, but hey, but you know what and that's what it's about, you know, you gotta give back.  I've been blessed so you gotta give back.
Story_ID: 544274
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted you to tell that story because we were talking about the hotel [New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I just--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all of a sudden went into that because I know that you have plans about how the hotel gives back to the, the city--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --itself.  So, tell me a little, you know, one thing I see that the tax rate has a lot to do with, whatever--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it is that you do.  So, explain that.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, and, and I've been asked about that a lot because, you know, having experienced all these jurisdictions, you know, having worked in Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, and Nevada, not every, not very many people have done that, nor have very many people done it from a regulatory side and transitioned to an operation side and that's how I was fortunate enough to do it.  But, but, you know, when you look at the jurisdictions and I, they called me in front of a Mississippi legislative session one time because they wanted to change the tax rate to, to be 20 percent and restrict licenses, and, and, and, you know, you can only get, you know, one license here and one license there, and I said, you know what that doesn't make sense.  I mean, you know, the one thing that works in America is, is companies having the ability to invest in their communities, as long as they do it in the right way.
Story_ID: 544275
Speaker 1: Continue about to make sure that the companies do it right.
Speaker 2: It's important for companies to do it right when they invest into the communities.  And I've seen companies that, you know, and I won't say any names in the gaming industry that, that aren't interested in that and they're only interested to the extent that they can drive business.  The one, the one thing that I like about this company [MGM Mirage; MGM Resorts International] and I'm not saying it just because I work for 'em and one of the reasons I was so excited about being recruited is that they created a foundation that kind of copied my concept that I created with, with the company [Caesars Entertainment, Inc.] I was with before.  And they created a organization called Voice Foundation [MGM Mirage Voice Foundation], and it's a foundation where employees contribute to it and, and can designate where they want their money to go and then the company contributes to it and matches it.  And we raise, I mean, millions of dollars.  And we generally do contributions in communities that we do business but just recently we contributed money to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], to specifically recruit minorities in the hotel, motel tourism school because they know that the, realistically the only way that they can impact the numbers of, of minorities that matriculate through schools like that is for the industry to support it.  And the only way that we're gonna get people in it is, is, is to, to, to do it that, is to, is to support it in that kind of way to get people to come to our company 'cause recruiting people into these jobs is, is, is a challenge.  And it's tough for me as an African American to say but it's a challenge to recruit people because they don't know enough about the industry and so 'cause we've not been in it.  You know, but it, but there are great rewards in it so we have to do more as an industry now.  The reason why that's important, and my boss who is Terry Lanni [J. Terrence Lanni] the chairman of the company understands it very well and he got a Trumpet Award this year.  He understands it very well, he says, "Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton], you know, we want the world to come gamble here and the world's gotta work here."  I mean, if you forget the social reasons, if you just focus on the business reasons, it's very important that we represent the world because we want you to come gamble.  You know, we should look like you.  And, and to that end, you know, it's a real challenge for us and we've done a, a, a good job, better than any of the other gaming companies but it's still not enough, to recruit people.  So, we're, we're working on that and that's one of my personal goals is to bring as many, you know, people in to work, but not only on the lower levels on the high end levels as well as vendor relationships.  One of the things that we've focused on as a company, we have a $7 billion project called CityCenter [Las Vegas, Nevada] which is the biggest privately funded project in the history of America that's going on next door.  And as a part of that, we're making sure that minority vendors, you know, get opportunities to, to, to be a part of that.  And all of the projects I'm doing here at New York-New York [New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada] I'm--the majority of 'em I'm bringing in minority vendors to build 'em.  So, so we know that the only way that wealth can, can trickle, you know, sideways or down, I mean, I don't like to say down--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --the only way wealth can trickle is, into the African American community and minority communities if people like me, you know, look back and make sure that it happens and work with other people to make sure that it happens.  And, you know, and to that end I've brought a lot of African Americans in and trained them in this industry.  And, and I wanna train my successor, you know, I'm looking for opportunities to bring people in to take my job.  And so, so, you know, that's just kind of another pole star of mine.
Story_ID: 544276
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you wanna tell me about the hotel industry at all?
Speaker 2: Well, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or casino or gaming industry, I should say?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it, it is a, it's growing and it's becoming international, we're now opening casinos in Macau.  Macau which is a small island off of Hong Kong, which is controlled by China, has opened up casinos and in a big way, and they've opened them up to the West.  They've had casinos for forty years but they've now allowed 'em and so Steve Wynn has a big casino, MGM Mirage [MGM Resorts International] has a big casino [MGM Macau, Macau], the Venetian [Las Vegas Sands Corporation] has opened a big casino.  It has now surpassed Las Vegas [Nevada] in gaming revenue, it is bigger than Las Vegas and will continue to grow.  We're looking at putting another casino there.  Also England is looking at expanding casino operations.  Singapore is, is, is allowing big casinos, and as everyone knows Singapore is probably the largest city [sic.] in the world, one of the largest cities in the world, if it's not the largest city in the world.  So to that end this industry is, is ripe for opportunity for, for people to get in.  The, the pay is great, I mean, it's just a great, there's great opportunity for African Americans in this business because we need to, the industry needs to look like the world.
Story_ID: 544277
Speaker 1: Do you find that with African Americans, I know that it's very, the regulations to work in a casino are very stringent.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are you finding that people cannot apply because of something in their past or is this a big issue or not?
Speaker 2: It, it is an issue and we've run into it.  And, and when you come from a state where I'm from and 47 percent of the people in prison are African American, it's pretty clear that that they've got criminal histories.  And I think it's a large reason why a lot of African American males between, I read an article recently in The New York Times that between the ages of nineteen and like twenty-seven, there's like a, a 50 plus percent unemployment rate for African American males for a whole host of reasons.  And, and one of the primary reasons is because of criminal history.  And the fact that they've had to drop out of society because if they get a job at a minimum wage, you know, then, then the, the child support recovery people go after their wages so they, so, you know, they're making six dollars an hour and half of it goes, so there's no incentive for them to, to really stay in the workforce and, and there's a lot of pressures on, on that male to, to commit crimes and to do things outside of the norm in society and it further exacerbates the problem.  And, and that has impacted their ability to get jobs in the gaming industry because it's all about integrity.  And so if you go and apply and they do a background check and you got a felony, and, and, and if it deals with anything with, related to fraud or, or any kind of a theft, you know, of material, you probably wouldn't have an opportunity to work in the industry, so that is a huge issue.  And as a regulator, I mean, I can really speak to that because we wrote the regulations and, and some of the enabling statutes because of, of gaming's history in the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], to clean it up, they wrote these regulations with maximum integrity so as to keep, you know, undesirables out and it has the effect of really having an impact, I think, on African American males who, who have kind of dropped out of the system.  Who may now have matured and want opportunity and, and understand the importance of being a part of society but they can't so, not only in gaming, in a whole host of other careers so but gaming is, is, is the most obvious one.
Story_ID: 544278
Speaker 1: So that's why going into the colleges and trying to recruit those students, you know, that haven't, you know, actually got--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --into any trouble is probably a very good way of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of recruiting the people to work in this industry.
Speaker 2: We, we've actually created scholarships specifically for minority students to try to keep them in, in school.  I was working with Tougaloo College in Mississippi [Tougaloo, Mississippi] trying to foster a relationship with UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] because they wanna develop a hotel, motel tourism, tourism school there in Jackson [Mississippi] in a private college.  And, and, so I've been working with them and, and, and a host of other, other, other academic types to try to, to push this.  But we've actually developed scholarships.  And one of the problems we have like in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] in keeping minority students in schools like UNLV, is because they can come to a casino, for example, they say they start UNLV and have all intentions of finishing school, and they'll come and work in valet and make sixty-five thousand dollars a year running cars, you know, and they look up and then they're, you know, fifty years old and, you know, and their feet are blistered and their knees are hurting because they ran on that pavement delivering cars and then, you know, they didn't finish school and they had all the, you know, all the great intentions of finishing.  So we had to create programs to give to, to give them incentive to stay in school and, and, and get your rewards after the fact--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --so.  And, and we think it's working, we're doing, we're, we're making some inroads but it's a challenge, it's a real challenge.
Story_ID: 544279
Speaker 1: We did not talk about, much about your family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So let's, let's talk about your family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, my family today, you know, I have a total of, of six kids, including my stepson.  And my oldest daughter is Charis [Charis Creighton], and she just recently moved to Des Moines, Iowa, to go back to grad school, I encouraged her to go back to grad school.  She is thirty-four.  My next is Brandon [Brandon Creighton] who lives in Iowa, he lives in Waterloo [Iowa], and he is just about to start work in the casino industry.  In my hometown, a casino was just, is just about to open I think next month and he's gonna start there in the marketing, so he's real excited about that.  And he has a, he has a son which is, which was my first grandson, and then my daughter has a son which was my second grandson.  They're both, one is six months and one is eight months so I'm a new grandfather.  My next (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are their names?
Speaker 2: The eight month old is Jonathan Lorenzo [ph.] and then the, the six month old is Austin Lorenzo [ph.], the middle name after granddad.  And my next, the next son is Cameron [Cameron Creighton] who moved here to Las Vegas [Nevada] who just got his, last year got his engineering degree from Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa].  He is twenty-three, he will be twenty-three this September and works now at a, at an architectural firm designing casinos and working on a casino project that they're building in Macau.  You know, has done, done very well.  The next son, is my stepson which is Steven [ph.], he's eighteen, just about to graduate from high school who is the artist in the family, who, who is working on, he wants to go to art, work on his art degree and wants to be an artist and has done very well and he's a good artist.  And I'm trying to move him to more of a technical part of art than the, you know, than the, the other part of art but he's kind of resistant, he wants to be a true artist and so I'm trying to get him into drafting or graphic design or do that as a hobby but he's a, he's pushing back on that.  Next one is my daughter, Alexis [Alexis Creighton] who will be fourteen this month.  She, she's still in junior high school right now and, and she's just a, you know, one of my, one of the special kids in the family.  Always a lot of fun, wants to have fun.  And then, then we have a baby, we have a two, we have a two year old who has taken over the household and she runs everything and is in charge, her name is Loren [Loren Creighton].  Oh, the fourteen year old is named Alexis and the, the two year old is Loren, L-O-R-E-N, short for Lorenzo, and she's a, she's absolutely in charge so, the, so that's six of 'em.  And I think that's the end (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And what does your wife [Lisa Shaw-Creighton] do?
Speaker 2: She, actually, she had started law school when she found out she was pregnant the last time (laughter) so she dropped out.  I don't know whether she wants to go back so she now has her hands full and, and she is kind of managing the family business.  Right now we're building a house and she's, she's gonna continue to do some, to do some real estate development stuff because it gives her an opportunity to be home and, and also kind of to do, to do a business.
Story_ID: 544280
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and, and dreams for the African American community?
Speaker 2: You, you know, I, you know, when I look at it, and I think about where I've been, you know, and the things that I have done and I grew up at kind of a unique time so I've, I've been able to see things that people who are younger than me didn't see.  You know, the riots, and, you know, people killed in the riots and buildings burning and the tanks coming down the street and, and the National Guard, you know, holding people at gun point and, you know, and seeing segregation, you know, you know, and, and, and feeling it, and, and dealing with prejudice and, and, and trying to not let it, not internalize it because I think that's what, what, what racism is about, is, is the desire for you to internalize it so you'll think less of yourself, so that you will underperform because you've got all of this stress and pressure from it.  And, and I look at the, you know, the, the African American communities today and, you know, and the Hispanic communities and, and see a lot of the same problems that, you know, in a different form than of what, what I saw in the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] and the early '70s [1970s].  And, and I had a friend and we, we were, we had an intellectual debate the other night and we're talking about African American communities.  And, and, you know, and I said, you know, 'cause I'm reading this great book called 'Team of Rivals' ['Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,' Doris Kearns Goodwin] which is about [President] Abraham Lincoln and, and, and the whole thing is, revolves around the whole racial issue and the Civil War and, and some of the same themes today, you know.  And he, and he told me, he said, "Well, Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton]," he said, "you know, people really weren't free until the late '60s [1960s]." I said, "You mean 1860?"  He says, "No, 1960s," (laughter).  And so, and then, you know, I had to stop and think about that, you know.  And, you know, and it really was that period of consciousness in the '60s [1960s] where things did change but up until that point it was really, really a challenge.  And, and, and now as a, as our communities we have some things we need to do as a people to try to overcome and, and, and self-help things and not rely on government and, and, and be real about it and say, you know, we need to, to address some of these issues.  But I, I, I think the thing that probably that, that I worry the most about is will my kids have to go through what I went through.  You know, will they have to get slapped in the face, you know, with the big handprint on their face and kicked out of school because, you know, you won't, you know, give in and do what they want you to do or, or, or not be able to go where they wanna go because you're scared of getting beat up or, or ganged up on or you'll go to jail because you're outside of the zone.  And not only my kids, and I, when I think of kids I mean, I mean all of the kids, you know, they're all our kids.  You know, you know, it's all a big village.  And I, I, I think that's the thing that probably worries me the most.  You know, I'm somewhat insulated from it, I've, I've been lucky, I've been blessed, you know.  I always, you know, and one of the things that I tell kids today is--you know, they say, "Mr. Creighton, tell, tell us what we need to do."  And I say, 'cause a lot of kids seek me out from my hometown [Waterloo, Iowa] because there's still kind of a lot of hopelessness, a lot of people have excelled, but there's still hopeless, hopelessness.  And I always tell 'em that preparation, prepare yourself to meet the opportunity.  You know, if you prepare yourself, there's a good chance that the opportunity will come along but if the opportunity comes along and you're not prepared, you won't get a chance at it.  So preparation meets opportunity, I, I think is the mantra, it has to be the mantra for, for kids coming up now.  And I preach that, I preach that to my kids, you know, I preach it to any kids that I talk to, you know.  Look, opportunity may never come along but guess what?  If it does, you need to prepare yourself for it, you need to be ready, you need to maximize your opportunity and your blessings, you know, and so that's, that's kind of, that's kind of how I look at the community today.

Speaker 1: Well, that was gonna be my next question because this information will be available about your--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --your life for generations to come--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I was going to ask you what would be the message that you would send--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to the future generations.  Is there anything else that you would say to the future generations?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I would, I would, I would stay on that theme because, you know, they say, you know, and I, when I grew up I mean, I, I wasn't a stellar kid and I was in trouble a lot and I just didn't get caught.  And but what, what's the saying, that a misspent youth builds character in a man? Well, I got a lot of character (laughter).  You know, but I, you know, I don't wish what happened to me or the things that I had to go through or the things that I did, you know, as a kid, the troubles that I probably could have gotten into, I don't wish, you shouldn't have to do those things.  You know, but preparation--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --prepare yourself.
Story_ID: 544282
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there anything that you haven't done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: You know, and, and I'm glad you mentioned that because in college [Luther College, Decorah, Iowa], you know, I was a black studies major and my emphasis, and we had to write a senior paper and my senior paper, you have to write a comprehensive paper your senior year at that college.  And for a whole host of reasons because it honed your, your writing skills, I mean, among all the other papers you write, but this is a, a comprehensive research paper, almost like a master's thesis and I wrote it over Africa and over the history of Africa, the political history of Africa and how colonialism had impacted it, and, and how it evolved and how it changed and how the boundaries were drawn but I never visited Africa.  And so I always wanted to visit and so I'm making plans to visit and it was, it was amazing because I was thinking about, okay, I'm gonna go to Africa, I finally, financially, able to do it and I, I can take the time even though I've always told myself I don't have time, I don't have time.  But I got a call from the Miss USA pageant that said, that they wanted me to be a judge for the Miss USA pageant.  I said, "Oh, okay, well, when is it and where is it," but I wasn't really, you know, I was, didn't really wanna take the time, they said, "Well, it's gonna be in Gambia."  And, and I said, "Why Gambia, West Africa?"  And they said, "Because it's gonna be at the village of Jufureh where Alex Haley, you know, his family is from."  And I said, "You're kidding me?"  And so I said, well, you know what if, if in fact it comes to fruition, I'm gonna take some time around that and, and visit, you know, different parts of Africa and, and, and take, hopefully some of the children and take them with me to see, see some parts of Africa.  So it's something I've always wanted to do that I never got an opportunity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Also when you look back over your life, is there anything that you regret or you would change?
Speaker 2: You know, I, you know, my father [David Creighton] used to say, you know, "If, if I had to live my life all over again, I wouldn't change a thing," you know, and (laughter) but, you know, I, I would have been more focused in school.  I would have been more, you know, I would have challenged myself more.  I wouldn't have been, I would have been more assertive, probably, that's, that's what I would have done.  But, but overall, I mean, I've been blessed, I've been, I've been blessed and lucky to be in the right place at the right time and, and at the right time in history.  And, and the things that I've seen and the things that I've done, you know, you know, not many people can say they have done that.  You know, I mean, I've done everything from soup to nuts almost (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: I'll ask you two ways, what do you want your legacy to be or how do you wanna be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, I wanna be remembered for having made a difference.  You know, and it's not always about self, it's not, it's not about, and, and I realized at a, at a critical point in my life it's not about Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton], it's about how you affect, you know, mankind.  How do you affect your surroundings?  How do you affect your community?  And, and that's the legacy that I wanna be remembered for, that's what I want Lorenzo to be remembered for, you know, not because Lorenzo made a lot of money and he got out and, you know, and he didn't go back and blow up Tobacco Road. Lorenzo made a difference, you know, through his personal charity or being involved with charities and he made a difference, he made a difference.
Story_ID: 544284
Speaker 1: And in that same vein, what charities and organizations are you involved with?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I in recent years joined the Delta Theta Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] which is a, an African American male fraternity.  I was never a, a fraternity guy in college [Luther College, Decorah, Iowa] 'cause of the college that I went to, but in later years I joined that which has been good.  Recently, within the last year, I was asked by Usher Raymond, the entertainer to be on his charitable foundation which is called Usher's New Look.  And I, I, I jumped at it, and, and he is an impressive, you know, young man.  I call him a young man 'cause he's younger than some of my children.  And I was just honored that he asked me to be on his, his foundation.  He has two components to it, one is to help youth, and he does his New Look camp [Camp New Look].  And the other is his program called Our Block which is his initiative in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And so I had an opportunity to go to New Orleans with him and work on some houses and help raise money and, and do, and help him with his media tour to raise money for, because and, and, he also showed me the importance of selflessness, you know, of giving back, of wanting to leave a legacy.  He personally told me that he wanted his legacy to be not that he was a great entertainer but that he was a great philanthropist.  And I said, you know, wow.  You know, that, that and he, and he puts his money where his mouth is.  And, and his Our Block, Block program in New Orleans has really made an impact, you know.  We went down there with him and we met with these community groups and they said, you know, "We hope you're not like all these other entertainers that come to New Orleans and talk a good game and don't come back and deliver."  And so he looked at me, he said, "Lorenzo [HistoryMaker Lorenzo Creighton]," he says, "I gotta go back and deliver," and he did.  And, and he's building houses and, you know, making an impact, you know, working on schools.  And, and he, and he said, "Lorenzo, I'm not just looking at this for this year or next year," he said, "this is a ten year program."  And he means it.  And but he's in the process of putting out a new CD now so he's been real busy so we, we, once he kind of gets back from that, you know, he'll, he'll get back focused on his programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I wanna thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --to give us your story.  It, it really is appreciated and thank you from The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Hey, well, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the Williams family reunion about 1979.  And it was held in a place called Winn, Alabama.  And it is the Williams family which is my [paternal] grandmother's [Dora Williams Creighton] family and my father's family and this was kind of the group photo from the family reunion.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  All right.  Ready.
