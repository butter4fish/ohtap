Speaker 1: Can you tell me your mother's name spell it out for me (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Harriet Allene Franklin Singho.
Speaker 1: And your mother was born in?
Speaker 2: New York City [New York, New York], in Hell's Kitchen they called it Hell's Kitchen it was the, in the West 30s in Manhattan [New York, New York], 30, I think 30th [Street] and 33rd Street, 32nd Street, Manhattan.  I don't remember the hospital that she was born in though.
Speaker 1: What was your mother like?
Speaker 2: She was a very, very quiet, quiet in her demeanor but very forceful in, in and committed to certain points of view.  If you met her you know she's very calm and very friendly and as a par- as a child, my remembrances of my mother was that she was, she was, she expected certain things of you and--but she had a very calm way of, of, conveying though the things that she wanted from you.  So but, and there was always a concern that if you did not sort of meet her expectations you weren't sure (laughter) how she was gonna respond.  I mean it wasn't a violent aspect, but you just weren't sure whether she was going to be angry or she was gonna scream at you or she was gonna spank you or she was gonna not speak to you.  So it was sort of, it was a very effective management style (laughter).
Speaker 1: What were some of her expectations of you?
Speaker 2: Well she definitely wanted us to I guess in her, in her view have a, a better life than she did.  She wanted us all to have a good education; she wanted us all to be very respectful of ourselves and of our parents.  And never to do anything that would dishonor them, and by her behavior, you kind of knew what that was.  You know she was pretty you know don't do what I say, don't do what I say, do you know, do what I say, do, don't do what I do.  Do what I say, wait how, how does it go?  Don't do what I tell you to do, do what I show you, so she was a very good example of things she expected from us.  Because she was you know very caring and, and pretty dependable, you could kind of depend on her, she was always there, she was a homemaker for as far back as I can remember.  She did work prior to her starting, her any my father [Albert Singho] starting a family, but she was always present and dependable and reliable and loyal.  So these were qualities that I got from her just from observing you know you wanted, you wanted to keep your word with her.  And she was very firm on, on being honest, you know and she was not tolerant very well of, of being lied to.  You know if you were supposed to be some place, you were supposed to be there, so that's, it was very good, I think now.  But when you're a kid going through these things, it can be very demanding.  But when I look back on, on how consistent they were, in devoting their lives, I think in large measure to raising their family, raising their children, it was a long strong commitment that I admire very much.
Story_ID: 296326
Speaker 1: You said that she wanted you to have a better life than she had. Let's talk about your mother's [Harriet Franklin Singho] childhood.  She grew up in New York City [New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she have any siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, I didn't know any of my, my aunts and uncles, but she had, she used to talk about her older sister, Helen [ph.], and her younger brother Rodney [ph.].  When I read my, my mother's birth--no was my grandmother's [Effie Hardy Franklin], I'm trying to remember. It was my grandmother's, I think her birth certificate when--no, my mother's birth certificate.  I'm sorry it was my mother's birth certificate and I recall when they, the question to her mother, my grandmother was how many children did you have?  My mother was the youngest, and we thought there were three, just two siblings, the three of them but there were, there was an indication that there were two other children that my mother really never talked about.  So they probably died very young, 'cause my, my mother's sister died I think she was a teenager, fifteen or sixteen and my mother's brother died when he was maybe seven or eight.  So she was the last living child of her four siblings, and it seemed to be a very difficult time for her growing up.  You know she, I think there was a loneliness, certainly she missed her, her siblings her mother died when she was, her mother was very young as well.  Her mother died when my mother was perhaps I guess in her teens, so her, her father [Charles Franklin] my matern- maternal grandfather raised her and my maternal great-grandmother, my mother's grandmother they raised her.  So and she, she said, she felt that she told us that she felt very loved and, and cared about, but she always seemed to want, she missed not having a larger family, not having her sisters and her brothers around to share the rest of her life with.  And so I think it made her very, very desirous of, of recognizing that she wanted a family perhaps or a larger family.  And, and she, she went as far as high school and I think she had regrets about that, she, she never really complained about it very much.  Because she always, she always reassured us that parenthood was her real calling you know and, and but she, she I think would've like to have probably pursued her career sometime.  I always try to elicit that from her, you know what did you wanna do when you know did you really only want to be a parent?  Only a parent as if that was from, you know minimal calling, but she, she took very much pride in the work that she did do.  The career that she pursued while--before she got married and starting having children.  And she used to speak with pride about this craft that she developed and it was the crochet beading, they used to do it by hand now whatever crochet being, beading is done, it's done by machine.  But it was a very painstaking, staking undertaking, and she took a lot of pride in the work that she did, and she always used to speak of it with some level of pleasure about you know.  She didn't miss it but she knew how to do something really well, and I think she liked the idea that she had a career.  So she had a-- I think a respect for, for honest day's work, honest day's pay, because during the time when she was brought up, there were no--the union movement hadn't taken off, and things were pretty what we, things we take for granted now, they were considerably worse then.  I mean if you worked in a factory, whatever it was one of the, the notions that you had little recourse, if your working conditions weren't the best.  I mean there were no laws at that time about working conditions or anything in, in the early 1900s so I thought they, they did extraordinary things to have survived that time.  The smokestack industries were there I mean the pollution probably before these emissions and, and controls that we have now that we take for granted were not there.  So things were tough people and I think when I mentioned that she probably wanted us to have a, a better life, I think those are some of the things that she articulated.  Or kind of sometimes without saying it but she implied and but I think she, she hearkened back to the fact that her father and her grandmother raised her.  And they had expectations of her and since she was the only child then she was really protected.  So I think there was kind of a, a tug for her because she probably wanted to accommodate them.  And they were probably things she may have wanted to do but she was apprehensive because they were very protective of her.  Perhaps maybe they discouraged her, so yes, she was a strong, quietly strong woman.
Story_ID: 296327
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors on the maternal side? And can you name the names of the people you know?
Speaker 2: Some of them my mother's mother, she, I think she was raised in, in Suffolk, Virginia, that's the area that her, her parents and grandparents were from.  My great-grandmother, my mother's mother's mother, the one that raised her, she was a daughter of a slave.  So we kind of, have a direct link with the time of slavery in the South connected to that side, my mother's [Harriet Franklin Singho] side of the family.  So Suffolk, Virginia is the base where, where they were from and her name was Effie Hardy [Effie Hardy Franklin]. And--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: E-F-F-I-E, and she, I don't remember when she moved to New York [New York], but as far back as I can remember, they were, the time that my parent, my mother talks about them, they were living in New York at the time.  And my great-grandmother, the grandparent who raised my mother died just a few weeks before I was born, so I never knew any of my aunts, uncles or grandparents, or great-grandparents.  So I feel like I really missed a relationship, those relationships, but my mother spoke angelically of her mother.  She remembers her as a child, and she always has this, she always mentioned how she thinks that her life would've been different in a positive way, had her mother lived.  And I can certainly understand how she felt, and she always I think felt that was that reinforced her loneliness I think.  You know have, having lost, having had her sisters and brothers die and her mother die when she was very young.  So I think it was a, it was some fears that were triggered by these early sad experiences on her part.  My grandmother she worked in a church as I recall on the West Side, she used to iron the, the habits of the priest the ministers and the nuns.  So it was you know hard work and handwork, but my mother, my mother told me that she used to take her to work with her sometimes.  And she would see how, how they would prepare the garments for the, for the ministers and, they all you know they all seemed to take very much pride in doing an excellent job.  You know no matter what they did, I mean, may seem somewhat meager now or menial types of work, but their character seem so strong.  They seem so, so committed to you know doing what they were doing, doing, it well, you know.  And the limits that may have been put on them at the time, they were making the best of whatever the situation was.  I don't recall what my grandmother's education level was, but I suspect that she probably didn't go past high school.  And my great, great-grandmother, I don't think she went that far in school, either.
Story_ID: 296328
Speaker 1: What about your father, what was your father like?
Speaker 2: Oh my father is a very strong, well he was quiet and I sometimes wonder if he was quiet because he did not have great command of the English, English language.  He was born in Sri Lanka and he came to the United States in the early 1920s and he didn't know English at the time.  So he spent a lot of his time here learning English and as I was growing up, we used to you know wonder why we didn't learn his language.  But when he came, he as I said his, his mission was to try to acclimate I suppose, and some of his countrymen were here at the time, so he, he had access to his language when they were here.  But over the years, many of them either moved away or they became more Americanized and they drifted away from using their language.  So he, he always had a very heavy accent, accented English and very, very caring, loving, hardworking, very affectionate.  I mean I remember little times you know there were eight--I'm one of eight--you didn't ask me those questions yet.  But I'm one of eight children. I'm the fifth of eight, and my father always you know he would get up and go to work every morning.  And I remember this so vividly, he was always up like four or five o'clock in the morning going to work, come home, whatever.  But sometimes you know, you would irritate your parent, my, my caregiver mother [Harriet Franklin Singho], my homemaker mother and she'd say you know when your father comes home, he's gonna hear about this.  And you're gonna be sorry (laughter) and my father would come home and he, he'd hear about this but he wasn't there he wasn't emotionally involved in whatever the moment was that irritated my mother.  And he would say you know things like be nice to your mother (laughter) you know and then he'd give you, he'd give you a reward you know to be nice to your mother.  So that, I don't know what signal was saying you know (laughter).  But it was really funny because he never--he rarely came through when my mother would say you know you're gonna be, you gonna be sorry about this.  But he was always, he was always you know the good guy sort of, you know she was the, she was more the disciplinarian than he.  So it was, it was kind of interesting balance, it worked for fifty-seven years and I, I have his very loving memory of my, my growing up in that household.  So I think it was good.
Speaker 1: What was your father's name can you spell it out for us, his full name (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Albert, A-L-B-E-R-T, Singho, S-I-N-G-H-O.
Story_ID: 296329
Speaker 1: And what did he [Roberts' father, Albert Singho] do for a living?
Speaker 2: His longest career, his longest career was as a longshoreman on the docks of Manhattan [New York, New York] and Brooklyn [New York].  And he worked on the docks for thirty years, prior to that he was, he was a merchant seaman when he left Sri Lanka, and we used to query him all the time.  We wanted to find out what countries he visit, and what he did, and who he met, how many girlfriends he had you know.  And he was he was not always forthcoming about where he did, or answering all of those questions, especially when it got personal.  He cut us off right away and, but he, he was a cook and I think he, he did a lots of manual labor.  But he was fine cook, I mean I would consider him a gourmet, a gourmet chef, he, he could taste something, and determine what spices were in it and come home and make it you know.  And I remember over the years when he worked on the docks, because with a diverse ethnic population there.  You know, Italians, Greeks, Asians and African Americans and a cross-section of ethnic, ethnic cultures.  And he would come home and, and whip up things that we had never seen before, I mean dishes that we had never had before.  And of course we were raised on curry, because that's a staple in his country and different spices.  And he would always go to Brooklyn and always go to these special shops to buy his spices.  I do admire my father so much for his--he always seemed to place a high premium on good food, and not cheap food, not the, the cheapest cut meat.  Even though we were considered of modest means he would always find a way to, to find like the best quality of things.  And he was a very good, very good shopper and he would do all the major shopping because he liked it.  And my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho] you know he sort of viewed things in traditional ways like you are the, you are the homemaker wife; you take care of the children.  I'll, I go to work, so it was very basic and, and a very simple kind of an understanding they had in that area.  But he liked to cook and he liked to shop and he--all the major meals, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, he would do all the cooking.  And he was a wonderful chef, he was a wonderful cook, and he loved it, even that we used to laugh sometimes because my mother you know she cooked, she was a good cook.  But she didn't seem to have the fervor and, and enthusiasm and the gusto that he would, and he, she wasn't as experimental as he was you know.  So she would, he would, she would cook something and he'd come home, if he didn't like it, he'd whip up his own dinner (laughter) and then we'd all have second dinner you know.  So it was, it was an interesting cultural differences.
Story_ID: 296330
Speaker 1: And sometimes I remember my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho] and father [Albert Singho] saying, well my mother especially because most of his, his colleagues from Sri Lanka, as I said they moved away.  Or they you know changed, you know but he lost touch with some of them.  But my mother would always say that you know some of her friends would, they were, they were sort of leery of, of a foreigner you know.  'Cause he was considered a foreigner and how my mother, you know fell in love with this guy from Sri Lanka and vice versa you know.  So you know sometimes she, she sort of took criticism for making that decision, you know she would laugh, we would laugh over the years, she said yeah, she said they would talk about me and wonder, "How could you, you know how could you marry a foreigner and blah, blah, blah like he can hardly speak English and you know what kind of future you gonna have," (laughter).  And she would say, "We're together fifty-something years and I don't you know these, these folks who are giving all these criticisms about our future together," so they defied, they defied some of the predictions.
Story_ID: 296331
Speaker 1: So when they [Roberts' parents, Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho] came together they, you have six other siblings, six or seven siblings?
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: So they had seven children together.
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: Eight children.  Can you--is it too much for you to list all of your siblings in order including yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh no. Not at all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In that order?
Speaker 2: No problem, my, my oldest brother is Romiel, R-O-M-I-E-L, Albert Singho, my second oldest brother is Rodney Bernard Singho.  They're both deceased.  My old, eldest sister is Gwendolyn Nona Singho.  She's deceased also, and my next oldest sister before me is Rosalind Norma Singho Randall, which is her married name. And my younger sister is Beverly Claire Singho, and my two younger brothers, they're twins, Darryl Lance Singho and Damon Charles Singho.  My younger brothers became Muslims as adults and changed their names, but we still use that as for family purposes because that's the given name.  But my, my oldest twin brother, my younger twin brother his name is Abdu Mohossen Kaduse [ph.] and the youngest, Damon, is Mosin Kaduse [ph.].
Story_ID: 296332
Speaker 1: So what was family life like with your mom [Harriet Franklin Singho] and dad [Albert Singho] and the seven children and these two different cultures, I mean you are half black and half Indian, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Sri Lankan.
Speaker 1: Sri Lankan.  So how did it all, how did it all play out, did it ever come into play, did you guys talk about it?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, we, we did talk about it over a period, over a period of our, of our lives, because it, it wasn't, it was somewhat of an oddity, we didn't see that, we didn't see that mixture in our community.  When I was born in the Bronx [New York] it was a fairly, fairly diverse community, but as the, the neighborhoods began to change, it was, it wasn't, it was integrated.  I mean there were, there were European Americans and they're black African Americans and there were some different ethnic groups within the European community.  Italian, Greek and there were some Latino members in the community, but it was, it was a time that more of the Europeans started to move out and it was, then it became predominately black for a you know period of time.  But I didn't necessarily see the ethnic mixture that I was, but we were we were raised as African Americans.  We weren't, we didn't emphasize at the time our, our Asian or Sri Lankan heritage.  But oft times, people would ask you well are you mixed with something? (Laughter) Are you, where do you come from or you know or we sometimes my brothers and sisters would get that and those kinds of, of queries.  And so you, you would, I never paid much attention to it but as these questions used to get asked period- periodically, it became sort of expected.  Or if it didn't, if it happened, I wasn't surprised if it didn't happen, I didn't you know I didn't make a big deal about it.  So there were times when there were, there was a, I guess we were considered somehow mixed or a little different somehow at times.  So, but you know within our own family, I mean, we were brothers and sisters, you don't you know, we, we didn't, we didn't know that we were mixed.  I mean (laughter) we were each other's siblings, and but my, you know my mother, she you know, we used to ask her about you know, how did you meet and you know.  How, did, how did you know--and my father, my mother, my mother met my father through a mutual friend.  My father roomed at a place some place in, I think it was in Manhattan [New York, New York] 'cause they, they were married in Manhattan, in Harlem [New York, New York].  And, and this mutual friend introduced my father to my mother and I guess one thing led to another and they became in love and married and so forth.  But I think at the time that they were married there wasn't, there seem to have been an influx of Asians at the time.  Maybe because of the, the passage of different ships coming through, it was a port city.  So there were a lot of ethnic groups coming in.  I mean from different places, my father didn't come through Ellis Island, so there was a lot of international travel, and, and going on at the time.  So there were, there were a number of foreigners or people from other countries coming into, into the [United] States.  Just happened where I lived, they didn't congregate there in the Bronx where I was born.
Story_ID: 296333
Speaker 1: But the first four of my siblings were born in Harlem [New York, New York] the second four were born in the Bronx [New York], so there was a--and we used to make, make, we used to make notice of that when my parents [Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho] you know like, did you all plan this?  Because (laughter) it seemed like the first four there were like a year and a half apart, and then when my sister Ro- my sister Roz [Rosalind Singho Randall] is five years older than I am.  So there was this five year hiatus you know and then I was born and then like a year a half apart the next four was born (laughter).  I said this is very interesting birth control here (laughter) so that's a very interesting plan, she used to tell us that, "We're gonna whack you."  But it was, it was, I remember it, going through every aspect of your childhood you know you're, you're a kid and you want, you can't wait to be an adult.  You can't wait to be a teenager, you can't wait to be sixteen, you can't wait to be eighteen you can't wait to get out of high school.  So I mean I went through all of those things, I guess most youngsters go through at some period of time.  But now that I look as back as an adult it was a great upbringing, it was a great thing you know this, even the things that I hated at the time.  I look back at them, look back at them as these fun, fun events and so that you know that's telling because as you moving forward in life--and my godmother [Gladys Lawson Challinor (ph.)] says this sometimes you know, you know if you're concerned or worried about something and you call up.  You know I got a problem, she'll say what will this mean in fifty years from now (laughter) she like puts it in some weird perspective.  I'm starting to see that too you know like this was not that important.   So that staying in the moment piece is starting to work, but, so it was, it was a good time.  I mean my older brother he was a wonderful big brother, he was very smart and very, very eru- erudite in fact he used to irritate my parents because he would ask questions a lot.  And he got in trouble because he would ask questions that either they didn't want to answer or they didn't know I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 295863
Speaker 1: So Mrs. Roberts [HistoryMaker Allene Singho Roberts] you were talking about your brother, Romiel [Singho].
Speaker 2: Yes, Romiel.  Yeah Romiel was as I said very smart, very bright, very precocious and sort of rebellious too.  But the, the fondest things I remember because he was thirteen years older than I, you know he was big, big brother.  He used you know he was very talented and with, with music, and he--we had a piano in the house and he taught himself how to play.  And I would follow behind him and I learned how to play from him, and he was always just so, so sweet to me.  You know I used to dance on his feet; I used to dance on my father's [Albert Singho] feet too, you know you dance, you would stand on their feet and dance with you.  And he was just so smart, he used to teach me, he taught me how to write my fir- you know when I got started school, he would help me with composition writings, just so gifted that way, and so sharing.  And but he was thirteen years older than me so he wasn't really in the house that long because he got married fell in love early and left the house, got married and left the house.  So he got married I think about eighteen or nineteen, so I was still a young child.  But those years are so vivid to me that you know how special he was, and we're you know we stayed in touch over the years.  We were just in our lives forever so that was, those were good, good memories of, of him.  And my, my second, my second oldest brother Rodney [Singho] was just the opposite Romiel.  Romiel was cantankerous, rebellious, Rodney was accommodating and wanted everybody to love him, he loved everybody, he was (laughter) one of these really affectionate kids you know.  But he, I didn't, I didn't bond as closely with him as I did with my older brother 'cause perhaps he wasn't as attentive you know.  My, my you know it was just the different relationship you know, and I think Rodney liked a lot of attention himself, so--you know maybe I was a little, little sister that you know I was there, and he loved me and we loved each other, but I don't have those vivid, those vivid of memories.  But he was so sweet, he was just a nice kid and everybody, everybody liked him, he was very likeable person.
Story_ID: 295864
Speaker 1: So tell me the story about your father [Albert Singho] because he didn't come through Ellis Island.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did end up in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a merchant seaman and his boat docked in, in New York [New York] and he came ashore he probably got sick, he got ill and went was hospitalized and while he was in the hospital, the boat left without him.  And as we, the story that we're told is that he stayed and being the resourceful man that he--turns out that he was and, and was at the time, I mean he, he could do anything.  You know he used to stoke the coals in the ships, he used to cook, he used to clean, you know he was, he was quite resourceful.  And he you know he was an excellent fisherman and he, he just--I remember my father having a view about work that there was nothing beneath him or nothing above him.  He, he whatever it took to get what he needed to get to raise his family or to survive, he did.  So I think, I think he was, he was a cook because I have letters of reference from back in the, in the '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s] references from him.  You know if you want a good cook, I recommend Albert Singho, and it was handwritten.  So he met my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho] through a mutual friend, he apparently he lived in a rooming house.  And I hear, I remember stories about these rooming houses where, you know you have a room and people would share bathrooms and things that you don't hear about anymore.  And the, the coal would be brought to the apartments and, and put down into the basement with these sto- I remember that though.  I, I vaguely remember that in the building that I grew up in you know the coal would, would be stoked and, and sent down the chute.  So I guess where they fired it up and in the, in the basement, whatever system they used at the time they were burning coal, smokestack.  But I remember the, the living conditions. I mean he didn't sound like they were horrible because he remembers his own country as being very poor.  And that may have been one of the reasons why he left, and I think he did not have the best of relationships with his father [Kali Singho].

Speaker 1: He [Roberts' father, Albert Singho] was the youngest of four sons and his mother [Nona Singho] died in childbirth with a sister, a daughter and I don't, I didn't hear much about the daughter.  So I presumed the daughter either died or--I think she did die in childbirth or near shortly thereafter, because the mother died in childbirth.  So he, he had four siblings, three siblings, he was the fourth and when he came here, he was, he was apparently in touch with his brothers for a period of time.  Because I have letters that one of his brothers Romiel, one that my brother's [Romiel Singho] named after wrote him periodically.  They had lost touch, I guess my father was at sea and perhaps didn't stay in communication or whatever, but the letters seemed to imply that had lost touch and he was glad to hear from my, my father.  And they were communicating back and forth for a few years and apparently this Rom- my Uncle Romiel, was taking care of their father [Kali Singho] because some of the letters indicated that they were having some financial problems.  Because he was responsible for his family and his father and for, for a while they were, they were trying to--I think my father was trying to get his birth certificate from Sri Lanka because he had I guess met my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho].  And found--he had started a family this is when I think he reconnected with his, his siblings.  And that, they were, they were corresponding back and forth and I remember the brother saying that he could not find the birth certificate and that the process was, was taking some resources from him.  And he said he would do his best to, to accommodate the request, and I think my father was sending money periodically to you know assist with the process and whatever.  And I think it was a notion that if you came to America that things were much, much better, even though my father was not a well-educated man, he was resourceful and he was a working person.  But over the period of their, their communications, I think that some of the letters started to you know indicate that there was a greater need for more money and my father you know kind of told them that I'm in America, but I'm not wealthy.  I don't know if he said it in those terms but it was, it was a little awkward at the time because he was you know raising his family here.  But it was, it was my last recollections of any communications with my, my family on my father's side.  We did get back--in the '70s [1970s], we got a letter from one of my father's brother's sons.  He had reconnected apparently he had gotten the address from his other Uncle Romiel.  This son, this cousin, my cousin his father was William I think.  It was William, Martin and Albert and Romiel those were the four sons.  But the cousin when we got letters from him, there was no Singho in his name, so you know we tried to figure out, we never really got it clear on how his, his last name, his name was W.A. Gnanaratne, G-N-A-N-A-R-A-T-N-E.  And we were going back and forth like how, why is your name Gnanaratne, and they're saying, he was saying why is your name Singho (laughter) so I'm saying I'm a little confused here.  I was wondering after a while it, was he really a relative, somebody who had taken my, my family's you know address of my family and communicated with us.  So I, I still haven't gotten that resolved yet, but since we have the letters from my father's brothers, and we did see pictures of one of my uncles, this Romiel, he, he was, he had a startling resemblance to my father so I'm presuming that he was a relative you know, a real relative.
Story_ID: 295866
Speaker 1: Now when your father [Albert Singho] came you said he didn't speak English that well.
Speaker 2: He didn't speak any English--
Speaker 1: Any English (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at the time.
Speaker 1: How was he received in the black community (cough)--what--did do you know was he welcomed, were there, were there problems, was he received as an African American or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no he wasn't.  He was, he was, he, he was received as a foreigner, as a you know a non-American person and I thi- I remember him saying that you know people, people called him different names you know pejoratives for an East Indian.  And when he learned what they meant, but usually when people travel, they'll learn what the bad words are first, even if you don't know the language.  You somehow, somebody tells you either call them that or don't call them that (laughter) depending on what the situation is.  So he picked up on it pretty well, I mean he was, he was smart, he was not educated but was very smart, very intelligent man.  And so he did, he did find some resistance and some discriminations but he makes, he used to always make the comparison that he was very, very gratified about making the transition from where he was [Sri Lanka] to, to this country.  He was very, very admirably with the quality of life here versus the quality of life that he left.  And for whatever reason he--'cause we used to ask him, "Don't you wanna go back and visit?  Don't you wanna take us back and visit our relatives there and or have some connection?"  So perhaps he wasn't telling us everything, or maybe, maybe you know I can feed in whatever story I want to because he wasn't really that forthcoming to tell us why you know.  "How come you don't wanna go back and visit, or how come you don't wanna go visit your uncle, your brother," you know.  But so I can say well you know maybe they didn't get along, maybe, maybe the, the poverty just overwhelmed him or maybe the loss of his mother [Nona Singho] was just too painful and, and he said his father [Kali Singho] was--he didn't speak highly, very affectingly about his father.  So it could've been some of those things, family things that drive people away or drive wedges in relationships.  I mean I've seen it here so I don't think it's limited to--you know--things are happening right in your own backyard.
Story_ID: 295867
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Speaking of backyards, can you remember what your--what the street you lived on when you were born when you guys, was it, were you born in Harlem [New York, New York] or the Bronx [New York]?
Speaker 1: I was born in the Bronx.
Speaker 2: In the Bronx, so what street do you remember living on as a little girl?
Speaker 1: Eagle Avenue, 906 Eagle Avenue, it's infamous in our minds, it was a, it was a very, very close-knit block.  And I made some of my lifelong friends there, people that I am in communication with or friends, friends 'til this day.  And it was, it was a, a very close-knit block community, families looked out for each other and, I'd like to say that I'm romanticizing about it but it was true.  I mean it was a it was--you hear the proverbial or stories about kids getting into mischief and if the neighbors saw you getting into mischief, your mother and father would hear about it, and it was, it was fun.  We used to play street games; you know it was seasons for different types of games in the summer, in the winter, in the fall, in the spring.  We'd have these seasonal games, in the summer we would make, we wo- I remember we would make scooters from these wooden milk crates.  You know and your old skates, and I mean I helped my brothers make them you know my brother Rodney [Singho].  He was very handy like that, he, he was very artistic he'd paint and draw and he was very industrious and you know he helped us do things like that.  And we'd have, you know we compete; they put all kinds of things on the bottle tops and caps to make designs on these, on these wooden scooters made of scrap stuff.  And we'd make, we used the, the sticks, the Popsicle sticks and we'd make fans and all kinds of different handicrafts from them.  It was, was really weird, we played, we had spin the top and we played jacks and we played stick ball and hide and seek, dodge ball.  I mean it was, it was really weird, but it was, you had, you had your play clothes, your Sunday clothes and your school clothes.  So that it was, it was sort of a structured, a structure in your, in your activities.
Story_ID: 295868
Speaker 1: And I see comparisons now that I, that I missed because I, I you don't see kids playing in the street like that as much, I live in an urban area.  So I know that there are concerns that people have about the safety of their children.  And even in rural areas or suburban areas for that matter, but it's a different time and I, I look back now and it was very much more innocent than it is now and, and much more free in the sense that kids, kids did feel safe in their communities.  I mean once in a while a kid would get hit by a car, but it was, it was a pre-drug era, it was not a proliferation of drugs, and it was not a proliferation of guns.  So there was a level of safety, I mean I lived; we lived on the first floor apartment A, the building is still there.  And we revere that building the two buildings that are still there 906 and 902 [Eagle Avenue, Bronx, New York].  And periodically we drive by and you know talk about all the things that happened on Eagle Avenue.  But it was a, it was a, a good time in, in comparison to some of the things that I--I wish some of the kids now experienced.  I mean they have their own reality, and, and it's different, but I think that there's a certain protectiveness and a certain sense of connectedness that I don't see now, that I saw then.  And we weren't as mobile then either you know people move around more. And at that time, the expectations were a little different.  I mean I'm a product of the '60s [1960s], the inter- the civil rights laws had not been passed and ratified I don't think they've been ratified yet.  But they hadn't passed the voters rights act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] so I'm on the cusp of those major events happening.  So the expectations for people of color at that time were different than what they are now.  So when I look back, there was a greater camaraderie because it was some issues around which people rallied I think more cohesively too.  You know, you know the segregation and the, and the voting and the lack of women's rights and, and those, those issues that's are now on in the conversation again to some extent had not really moved to where they are today.  So there were, there were a lot of expectations I mean, I, I remember going to the March on Washington with my older sister.  And that was an event that I, that I remember very vividly, I didn't realize at the time how historic the moment was, 'cause I was a teenager then.  But I was, I was glad that I, I was there and it, I think affected me moving forward.  Because something happened after that, things happened after that, jobs that we did not expect to think about started to become you know a possibility you know.  When I think about what my parents [Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho] experienced, what my, what the work opportunities were, what the career, what the educational opportunities were for them, and what they are, and what they were for me and my siblings and what they are for my nieces and nephews that are coming behind me.  It'll be different for them too hopefully, it will be better.
Story_ID: 295869
Speaker 1: So I have one last question about your community and then we're gonna move into schools; you going to first grade or kindergarten.  But before you went to school, were there people in the community that you looked up to that were community leaders?  You said something about a block association, as children; did you have people in the community that you looked up to?
Speaker 2: Well absolutely, I mean there were so many (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you name some of them?
Speaker 2: The Swanstons [ph.] across the street they were the musical family, Mr. and Mrs. Swanston, Anna [ph.] and was it Shubert [ph.], I forget his last name--his first name.  But they were, they were wonderful family, very generous and the, the thing I remember most vividly for me was that when I started to play piano, you know Mrs. Swanston and Mr. Swanston, said, "Oh you know we'll give Allene [HistoryMaker Allene Singho Roberts] lessons for free, if you- if she's willing to do it."  And my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho] was so excited you know I mean we're a big family, not a lot of money and free lessons for piano that was just such a wonderful offer, a generous thing.  And so I mean it was, it was things like that and, and the, the Mrs. Mitchell [ph.] who lived above my, my mother, she was a nurse.  And again eight children, somebody always got a cold or somebody's got chicken pox or whatever.  And Mrs. Mitchell was always there you know she would she would be our, our home doctor you know our, our interim doctor I mean unless things got really serious.  And just my godmother, my godmother Gladys Challinor, Gladys Lawson Challinor [ph.], she was a, she was, still is a major role model.  She (laughter) always reminded me too she was there when I was born, she said, "I grabbed you out of your mother's arms (laughter) and told her she's mine," (laughter).  She was seventeen at the time.  So and she's been in my life forever, I mean she's been a sister, mother friend and just somebody who an extended family.  She was like another daughter to my mother and father [Albert Singho] and always a part of our family.  So we had extended people around and people who were not there just for a year or a day or whatever, these, these are friends, these are people, you know friends that you make for life.  And I mentioned some of the kids that I went to school with.  We're still friends, kids that lived across the street, the relatives of the Swanstons, we're still friends.  So it was, it was really neat, and some of the kids went on to do very wonderful things, like the, the brothers, the, the Fulton [ph.] brothers.  One of them started a business in the community and my brother worked with him, and Ross [ph.] and Elliot [ph.], they were, they were all musicians together, these kids and one became an, an engineer an architect, so it was really nice you know.  And some of the kids that my brothers grew up with. Rob Johnson [Robert T. Johnson] he's now the district attorney here in the Bronx [New York] and grew up a kid from the community.  He's a little younger than me so he was a peer of my brothers but just a very, very caring neighborhood.  And so I, I have very good memories that--and also we wonder how eight kids, well actually ten people fit into five rooms in apartment A, at 906 [Eagle Avenue, Bronx, New York].  But it seems like not only were our fam- was our family in there, but our friend's family I mean we would, they would come and stay over and it was always somebody coming into the house.  Because my mother was always home, so some of the kids' parents either worked or they had different schedules, so since they knew my mother was always gonna be home.  "Mrs. Singho, could you look out for you know so-and-so 'til I get home from work," or if I'm gonna be away or whatever.  So a lot of those kids were almost our extended brothers and sisters, some of them remained in our lives all the way through.  Until either they died or somebody, you know the parents, my parents are deceased so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's, I'm sorry go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, it was it was very interesting in that way, that, that household was a, was a repository of, of some wonderful--the development of some wonderful relationships and very nice things that happened there.
Story_ID: 295870
Speaker 1: So I was gonna ask what smells and sounds or sights remind you of that period of time in your life?
Speaker 2: Well it, at 906 [Eagle Avenue, Bronx, New York] we had a courtyard in the back and it was always very interesting, on, on the weekend sometimes.  Because you know when you're going to school in the morning, you're rushing to get out to school.  But on the weekends sometime I had a chance to really listen to things that went on in other people's houses that, were, were you could hear from the, from the courtyard in the back.  You know there was Ross [Fulton (ph.)] and Elliott [Fulton (ph.)] practicing you know there, they had a little ensemble, a music ensemble and they would play at parties and teen parties and things.  You'd hear them banging arou- and making noise you know practicing.  And then the superintendent, Mr. Davis, [ph.] he was always admonishing the kids to get off the stoop (laughter) and you know you could hear him, "All right," that was his term for he's here move (laughter). And it was you know little things like that.
Speaker 1: Smells?
Speaker 2: Well actually I remember my father's [Albert Singho] cooking more than anybody else's because he was always doing something in the kitchen.  And we would smell his food before we would hit the apartment because curry is very, very pungent and it's very you know powerful smell, depending on how, what kind of curry you use 'cause there are different kinds of curry.  We could always smell you know when dad was cooking curry 'cause it really also we could tell when he was cooking chitterlings too.  And they would (laughter) I hated them.
Speaker 1: Now how did he know about those, he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He--
Speaker 1: --I, did he?
Speaker 2: Well he was integrated I mean actually some I mean he, he brought the, the Indian food to us and my parents' people brought the soul food to, to him.  So it was a, it was a very eclectic meals we had sometimes (laughter) you know.  And he would make, he would make soul food too, he made, he used to make head cheese, he would make chitterlings, he made when he would go fishing or crabbing, he would, he would make devil crab, he just, had great, you know great things.  He would, he would he didn't go hunting but he had friends who hunted.  So I saw things that I'd never seen before. Rabbit, and he would clean it; he would skin it and clean it.  Venison, I had venison, I didn't see the deer, but I saw the (laughter) venison meat and it's a different look and it's a different taste.  And what else I mean mountain oysters, I didn't eat any of those, and I'm not gonna tell you what they are.
Speaker 1: What are they, tell us (laughter)
Speaker 2: I can't tell you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us (laughter).
Speaker 2: A certain part of a bull's anatomy I think or something (laughter) I'll tell you off camera (laughter) some of that stuff I wouldn't eat you know.  Fish roe, I happen to like that, but you know all these very exotic foods that we were exposed to.  So my father the, the smells that came out of my father's house and my mother's [Harriet Franklin Singho] house were, his cooking, were, were the memorable ones.  And I can never, I used to watch my father make curry and especially when I was getting ready to get married and realized that I was gonna have to learn how to cook.  And I would watch him make the curry, I watched him more than once, watched him more than twice, and I cannot ever make it the way it the way it came out.  And I thought I was writing down exactly the same thing that he was writing and I would call him.  I thought would, I thought cooking was easy because it was, somebody was always cooking, my brothers used to cook, my sisters used to cook.  And my younger sister [Beverly Singho], she's an excellent cook.  She got that gene.  My brothers, I don't think I got that gene, but--and I described my cooking as nobody died from my cooking.  Nobody wants a reputation like that about their cooking (laughter). My husband [Allen Roberts] happens to be a very good cook so I really been blessed in that way.  But I really gave it an effort, and I cook, I do you know, I, I, I'm all right.  But when I went to watch him and expecting that this cooking business would be easy, it is very difficult, I mean to really take it seriously, it's chemistry in the kitchen.  And I had all the cookbooks and whatever and most of my meals started out with a cookbook.  But those were you know very interesting times.  There was a, an Italian family that lived down the street, I do remember those smells too.  This man used to cook his sauce all day and it would, you could smell it up the street, when, I don't remember their names, I don't remember.  But my father and he used to exchange dishes 'cause sometimes we had his Italian sauce and he, my father if he would either went fishing or something, he would give some of his, his food to, to them or some of the things he cooked.  And it was really funny, it's really interesting stuff.  But you know those are the things that come to mind about the smells and the sounds.
Story_ID: 296334
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to P.S. 10 [Bronx, New York], it was adjacent to the building where we lived, I could hear the bells ringing; I was so close to the school.  So it was very convenient, I think that was one of the decisions too for that Eagle Avenue was such a good place to be, the school was right there, so it was very convenient.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about it?
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a very nice school, I mean, I remember my first grade teacher more vividly than any of the other teachers.  She was so wonderful, she was so patient and so kind and, just you know I was, I had fun going to her class and it was just a peaceful place.  It was, it was really nice, it was--you know the transition from the house and we knew we were gonna go to school, and you know but it was, it wasn't a dramatic transition.  It was--she made it very easy you know you going to this strange place and strange people.  Some of the kids we knew 'cause some of the kids in the neighborhood went.  But the teacher, she just, Miss Klotz, I remember her, my sister used to make fun of her name and I would cry and get upset that they're making fun of my teacher.  But--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that name for me?
Speaker 2: K-L-O-T-Z, so that, you know that's the thing I remember most and, and the milk and cookies, I remember that.  We used to have recess. Milk and cookie recess, and you have to, we have to, we also had rest periods.  I remember you had to put your head on the desk, certain parts of the day (laughter) you know it just seem silly now that I'm looking back.  But I remember that, I remember put, putting you know rest, your, your arms on, on the desk and the milk and cookies period.  I remember that milk and cookie time was, those cookies were so good you know it was like, I'm sure I had them at home, but it was something about those cookies at, at school.  And, and so it was, you know those are some of the things that come to my mind.
Speaker 1: What did Miss Klotz look like?
Speaker 2: She was a, she was a square older woman, square, I mean that she was I guess heavy, and she used to wear you know those kind of black what, what we used to call old lady shoes.  But I remember it as being square, she you know she was kind of maybe heavy set, tall obviously to a kid.  And she had white hair, I think she wore glasses, and she was very old, I mean I was young, so maybe she was forty but she seemed like she was maybe seventy or something you know, I don't know.  But she seemed old but matronly and--but caring and loving.  At that time, though teachers, most of them were female at least in the school that I went to, they were devoted career teachers.  And it was one teacher all day, there was no teacher aid or anything like, she, they were with you all day in elementary school.  So it was something really special at those, that those teachers had at the time, that they were, they took that job so seriously.  I mean they all probably weren't as, I don't remember them all, like I remember Miss Klotz.  But I remember her, I remember Miss Schwartz [ph.], Miss Schwear [ph.] Miss Berman [ph.], but I remember Klotz most vividly.
Speaker 1: Now sounds like you had teachers that were not black, they sound like Jewish names.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Talk to me about that, did you know the difference, did, I mean, you said you'd come from a community that was segregated?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was diverse.
Speaker 1: It was diverse.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there was no, you didn't see any difference in having a black or white teacher at that time?
Speaker 2: Not at the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At the time.
Speaker 2: Not, not in elementary school, I mean I certainly saw some differences as I got into secondary school [Paul Laurence Dunbar J.H.S. 120; Paul L. Dunbar M.S. 301, Bronx, New York], secondary classes.  But in elementary school, you're a kid you don't see it, but eventually those things start to show themselves.
Speaker 1: What do you think it was about Miss Klotz that made her stand out or, or be so special to you today?
Speaker 2: I, I remember her because she, she seemed to be very matter of factly--matter of fact about what she expected from you.  And she didn't, she did it in such a way that she almost didn't have to ask you, I mean she, she was she, she, she was very respectful of us.  And I think that for the most part, I don't remember any disruptions in the class.  I always remember as this naturally lit room and she didn't, they didn't always turn on the lights until it you know got really, it was a cloudy day or something.  But seem like the natural light was enough for the class, and it was, it was--I just remember it as a, as a place that I, I look forward to going to, the class that I looked forward to going to.  Having, having it be the first time that I was being separated from my parents [Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho], you know from my household.  'Cause we were very close, we were very protected, and so it was, it was an adjustment.
Story_ID: 296335
Speaker 1: What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I also realized that I needed glasses too.
Speaker 1: Is that when you realized you needed glasses?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I first went to school [P.S. 10, Bronx, New York], because I guess they didn't test my eyes and I, I was tall, a tall kid, so I realized it later, not so much in the first grade, but I think second grade they really started to see it.  Because you know you're not learning, you're not, you're starting to learn how to read and so it wasn't as evident.  And as I started to grow, I mean because I was really tall, I would be in the back of the room and I couldn't see the board.   And you know things like that manifested themselves itself into realizing that I needed glasses, it wasn't that I couldn't read or see you know I mean I couldn't see it.  So you know you learn things you know.  I mean my parents [Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho] I guess learned things too from sending your kids to school when you're socialized.
Story_ID: 296336
Speaker 1: So if we keep moving forward as far as elementary school [P.S. 10, Bronx, New York], what else do you remember about it second grade, third grade?  Were there other teachers that stood out for you as well?
Speaker 2: Miss Mitchellson [ph.], she was the first black teacher I encountered in junior high--in elementary school.  It was high, it was a higher grade, it was fourth, fourth, fifth grade.
Speaker 1: What impact did that have on you?
Speaker 2: Now that I look back, I'm try--now that I look back, I was troubled that there weren't more black teachers because I encountered kids who came from the South who later you know would tell us that all the teachers that they knew were black.  And that there was, you know there was a different kind of perhaps expectation, there was a different dynamic between the teacher and the, and the student.  And, and you're right, there were mostly white teachers at the time.  And as I look back, in certain situations, there were low expectations; I encountered teachers that I didn't feel as comfortable with as I did Miss Klotz--or I don't remember as fondly and the higher up I went--in fact when I went to high school [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York], I encountered a teacher who when they asked what junior high school you went to, you told them.  It was, oh that school [Paul Laurence Dunbar J.H.S. 120; Paul L. Dunbar M.S. 301, Bronx, New York], you know, it was, it was at the time a predominately black school, it was getting predominately black, the neighborhood was changing.  So there was some, there was some expectations, differences, and I also realized that maybe some of the, the teaching styles and the, the--what the students were learning at certain periods were not as advanced as some other schools.  You know 'cause the expectations may have been lower, because when I went to high school, I realized that some of the students had, they, they had, I think they had changed the enrollment where you, you could go to schools outside of your, a certain radius.  And the school that I went to was in a predominately white area.  So all those, all those things started to, to be realized you know you, you just, you couldn't ignore them after a while.  And you're growing up, you realizing where you are and what the system is like and what the systems are like.  What, and you're reading the paper, you hear news and you're, you're seeing that there's different standards, you're seeing that there's--I'm a child of the '60s [1960s] there's segregation, there's you know separation of the races.  And it's disparities in, in health and housing and you know certain places you couldn't live.  There was redlining it was all these things I was starting to learn about my environment.  So you know you're growing out of your childhood and you're going into the, the world as different stages in your life, so.
Speaker 1: So when you met Miss Mitchell.
Speaker 2: Mitchellson.
Speaker 1: Miss Mitchellson.
Speaker 2: She was never a teacher, she was a guidance counselor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was guidance, okay.
Speaker 2: I think she taught my sisters, but I remember her as being a guidance counselor, she was very smart, very astute, very proper and very demanding. Demanding in that she seemed to imply that she--I don't ever remember hear her, hear her say it, but the, the sentiment came through that you know black kids, she would've never, she would've probably never agreed with open enrollment.  Where you drop the standards in order to let more kids in or something or integrate the schools, she probably would've never approved of that.  But she figured you have a good mind, you have a healthy mind and you do the work, you can learn.  She was really, I remember her in that way and I remember her in a positive way, and she was very helpful, she was there, she was committed, she was dedicated.  She was, she was a strong woman, a strong administrator there.  And she, and she seemed to be a, a very dedicated education professional.  I don't know if she ever got to be a principal, whatever, but she was going up the ranks from the classroom to administration.  So she seemed to be ambitious too, and you, you could see that, and those things appealed to me because I started to question things about power, money and economics as I was growing older, and seeing how the disparity affects, affect lives.  You know how it affects the different socioeconomic stratus whether it's you know different ethnic groups.  I mean poverty is poverty and it comes in all shades, comes in all the ethnic groups.   So I you know I was became very interested in those issues, and I think it kind of steered me in the career direction that I eventually found myself.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: New school around the corner, Junior High School 120, Paul Laurence Dunbar Junior High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar J.H.S. 120; Paul L. Dunbar M.S. 301, Bronx, New York].  And it was, it was a new school, it was a, a nicer environment in that, I mean P.S. 10 [Bronx, New York] was a great school it was just older and it was I guess the, the there was some changes in the structure.  Because I think kids used to go all the way through to secondary school in the same facility, and then you go to high school.  But there were changes in the structure where you broke it down and now that, now it's all over the place.  Charter schools, I mean there's all different configurations of schools, but at that time they were starting to change too. And you know at elementary school it was all girls and then junior high school it was boys and girls you know they--those experiments were evolving about, you know, how to integrate the classes by, by gender and that sort of thing.  So it still I guess the, the experiment is still evolving, so.
Speaker 1: So at the time that you entered into junior high school you'd become a teenager.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What year was it and how was your life different now than what it had been as a child?
Speaker 2: Oh God, the year, well you know you going through puberty, you going through the, the hormonal things and as I said the boys and girls were, were in the classes and sometimes it was disruptions.  And, and it was just those adjustments too, you know have, having going to class with boys and I, I remember a very good teacher there Mr. Liel [ph.] he was, he was one of those memorable guys who seem to--and he was one of the first male teachers too that I remember, 'cause most of the teachers were women.  There's still guys in, in junior high school, male teachers, and he seemed to be a steady, you know made you feel comfortable and had high, high expectations of you.  And he was very respected and he seemed to have an assuredness a quiet assuredness about himself that transferred you know the ki- you know the kids sometimes at that age might wanna challenge a teacher.  But this guy you didn't challenge him, but yet, you knew that he was kind of operating on your side and if you had a problem, you know kids had problems whatever--he was a kind of person that would take time to, to try to work with them.  You know, meet after school and you know that sort of thing, and there were programs after school too at the time.  I mean the budgets I guess were a different--what year was that, so it was like '50 [1950], '53 [1953], '52 [1952]? Something in there.  And there were after school programs, 'cause I was, I was on a basketball team and I was doing all, volleyball and it was, seemed like the school was open late.  Which was great, you know because if any kid--parents weren't home, it was, there was a place for them to go.  And even if your parents were home, it was a place where kids to, you could do your home, come home do your homework and then go back and have an evening, evening activities.  It was really great; I think a lot of these kids miss that, 'cause a lot of the schools don't offer that anymore, at least the public schools.  And I went to all public schools, so it was sort of on the cusp of some of the changes that were taking place before the budget crashes in the '70s [1970s] where you know a lot of the money just you know--market went down and public policy matters affected the budget in the city and, and in the education system.  The demographic changes going on, the, the civil rights stuff the, the local oversight efforts to the community.  The community could be more involved in decision making at the, at the board of, Board of Education [New York City Department of Edcuation] wasn't, it was decentralized.  So there were community boards that were established, so it was a lot of turmoil that was beginning to change as it, as it related to what was happening in the classroom.  And the, the changing dynamics of the, the makeup of the students and you know a lot of it was driven by you know the power shifts and the, the notion that since you know more people of color are moving in you know people don't wanna give up power.  So you know lot of things happen in that kind of environment, but the, the junior high school experience was you know it was, it was, it was--I don't remember it in the greatest of terms.  Because it was that tran- those transitional years you know the, the teenage years as you mentioned.
Story_ID: 296338
Speaker 1: What did you remember about that time, even if it's outside of school?  I mean at time you're becoming a teenager, when you're starting to be influenced by people that are outside of your home.  Who are your friends at the time, who's, who started to influence you in what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Well my family, my family has always been a very, a very big influence.  My, my older sisters [Gwendolyn Singho and Rosalind Singho Randall], I always looked up to them, my other brothers [Romiel Singho and Rodney Singho].  So they were, they were my first line role models actually.  I have friends, I have very, two very close friends that I kind of grew up with in elementary [P.S. 10, Bronx, New York], junior high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar J.H.S. 120; Paul L. Dunbar M.S. 301, Bronx, New York], we went to the same high school [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York].  We were sort of a triumvirate, we kind of stuck out--stuck together, Roz [ph.] and Naomi [ph.] and myself.  So you know I had some very close friends, I didn't have a lot of friends, then there were friends from Eagle Avenue [Bronx, New York]. Coretha Smith, she was a very close friend.  So you know a lot of my neighbors went, we went to school together, we weren't always in the same class, but they were connections there.  But as you're growing older, you, your personality is starting to form, you know you're, you're challenging your parents you know.  You wanna, you wanna do things that they don't want you to do, you want to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you wanna do they didn't want you to do?
Speaker 2: Well I probably wanted to stay out later than they wanted me to. You know some kids had a little more leeway.  And you know my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho] and father [Albert Singho] were very strict, so you had to be inside, you had to be in some, some of the kids could stay out on the, on the wall.  There was a, we had a, there was a lot across the street and kids used, the kids whose parents who were permissive could sit on the lot wall and you know hang out and have fun together I guess, maybe get in trouble too.  But you know we couldn't do that, and we, we could look out the window (laughter) at the kids that were there you know doing their things.
Story_ID: 296339
Speaker 1: But it was you know, I mean it was just now that I look back, I mean it was--my parents [Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho] doing the best they could and you know I used to kind of want to do other things that we're, we're unable to do.  Like you know maybe, I got into certain thing, you know you started to see your friends have things and you don't have them, and you want them.  And you know since we were not a family of means, we weren't always the first on the block to have things, maybe second third or fourth or fifth you know.  Like television, we weren't the first to have TV.
Speaker 2: Did you have a TV when you were high sch- junior high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar J.H.S. 120; Paul L. Dunbar M.S. 301, Bronx, New York]?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, when we got to junior high school yeah.  But we were late, we were late getting it, and which was fine, 'cause now (laughter) I'm glad I wasn't in tel- I wasn't raised on TV (laughter) I'm very happy.
Speaker 2: So when you watched TV, you were a radio kid you said.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: What sort of things did you listen to on the radio?
Speaker 1: Well we used to listen to 'Inner Sanctum' and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What's 'Inner Sanctum?'
Speaker 1: It was, it was a program I think as I recall it was like mystery program and it was 'The Shadow' and then it was some other creaking door thing it was, you know kind of mystery.  It was 'The Lone Ranger,' it was, what was the other one?  And my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho], there was some religious program she used to listen to 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and it was some morning programs, 'Phil Cook' ['The Phil Cook Show'], I remember some morning person who sort of, they call it drive time now, but he was the person we'd hear in the morning going to school and that sort of thing, and everybody running around getting ready and whatever.  So I--we you know we didn't have the TV, some of our neighbors got TV and we'd go look whatever, it was limited programming early on.  But we got it, telephone weren't first to have phone, we finally got the phone and we, there were limits on what you could do with the phone because for obvious reasons.  With six people in the house, we, you know we were limited on how many calls we could make and for a while it was probably only incoming calls (laughter).
Story_ID: 296340
Speaker 1: So there was all those economic things that started to be considerations. You know, kids make demands on their fam- on their parents as they get older.  I wanted a bike and it took me a long time to get a bike, I finally did get a bike and I remember it so vividly.  My sister [Gwendolyn Singho], I had learned how to ride you know single--what do you call it, the two wheelers you know--eventually you know in the midst of all these different things that we used to do in the neighborhood.  But I, I think I was a little before that I went to junior high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar J.H.S. 120; Paul L. Dunbar M.S. 301, Bronx, New York], but in elementary school [P.S. 10, Bronx, New York] and it was, it was sort of a lesson in keeping your word and not doing what you're not supposed--not doing what you're told not to do.  And I wanted a bike so badly and I--my sister told me not to go into the room because they were preparing for Christmas and that was taboo.  So of course I went and looked in the room right, and I saw this bike I said, "Oh wow I'm getting a bike, getting a bike," I was so excited. I knew that was my bike and Christmas morning came and it was no bike under any tre- that tree and I, of course I couldn't say anything 'cause I wasn't supposed to have seen what was in the room.  But I was really upset you know I was really, I was really disappointed.  And somehow, I don't know, my sister must've known that I looked in that room, she must, I don't know how she did, maybe she saw me go in there, and I didn't know she was watching me. Because after all you know opening up the presents and things like that, I was really not interested, I don't even remember what it was I got, 'cause I was just so focused on this bike.  And after everything had settled down whatever they mu- they took that bike to somebody else's house so they could store it so that I learned this lesson you know supposed be you cheated, you weren't supposed to see it.  'Cause they painted it up, it was a second-hand bike but it was a two-wheeler.  And brought the bike down and, and my sister, my oldest, my oldest sister who is deceased now she said yeah, she said I know, (laughter) I know what happened (laughter) and but it was great.  It was really you know.  It was a lesson learned but it was, I shouldn't, I shouldn't've done what I did.
Story_ID: 296341
Speaker 1: So at that time do- did you have any dreams did you think about what you wanted to be when you grew up when you got to high school [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York]?  What did you think you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: I had no idea, I mean I think I gravitated away from things and by process of elimination, I got to things.  I mean there were things that I knew that I didn't wanna do, so I thought--in fact, I used to wonder when I finally got to high school.  I was wondering whether or not when I got to high school perhaps I'd see something there that would really appeal to me 'cause I really didn't know what I wanted to do, I mean I didn't, I didn't wanna be someplace where I was confined.  I didn't want to be in a situation where you went to a place and you stayed there for whatever hours and did whatever it is people do for eight hours or whatever it was, and then come home. I seemed like I wanted something with some mobility where I didn't have to sit in a stationary sedentary work situation, and those were things that came to me.  And I you know I just started to pick up things about you know as I, as I said before that career options were somewhat limited at that time.  And I remember teachers suggesting that some of the kids take general, general degrees, which were not really college preparatory degrees, it was sort of do the best you can you know.  You're not college material or whatever.
Story_ID: 296342
Speaker 1: But you know I encountered a few teachers who were particularly helpful and again my par- my sisters, my sisters were very good students.  In fact keeping up with them was not easy because the teachers who taught them, you had to go behind them and, oh you're Gwendolyn [Singho] and Rosalind Singho's [Rosalind Singho Randall] sister, huh, how come you're not as (laughter) charming as they are?  How come you're not as smart as they are, how come A's don't come as easy to you as they come to them?  So that was another aspect of the, the anxieties that kids go through.  You know you're competing in a way even though you're not competing with your, the expectations that people have of your siblings and you know all these things.  My sister want, my sis, my oldest sister, Gwen [Gwendolyn Singho] she wanted to be a teacher and I always admired her.  She was very sickly.  She was a, she was stricken with asthma as a, as a youngster and she, she would have a weakened condition most of her life.  You know she would get these asthma attacks, she had been hospitalized for a while, and she had major surgery, she had gotten a acquired tuberculosis as a teenager.  And so she had to, she had to be educated partially in the hospital.  It was really trauma for our family too because she was our older sister and she was sort of like a--you know the older sister taking on some of the maternal things with her younger siblings. So we looked up to her and was, that was always a, a major stress for our family, because you know we, we you know we'd have to deal with her asthma, the attack she'd get and then, but she was a very strong willed woman.  She was a leader, and, and she always wanted to be a teacher, and she was, she was vigilant about her education.  I mean she cried when she couldn't go to school when she was either too weak or in the hospital, whatever.  But she always, she had home teach- schooling for a while, she was always at you know a high performing student, and it just you know just a, a great inspiration.  And I always admired her because she knew what she wanted to be and I didn't, I didn't know what I wanted to be it sort of--I know there's something out there for me, but I don't know what it is.  I love music and then I said well can I what, what can I do with this? (Laughter) I mean, I mean I didn't I didn't stay with it long enough to really pursue it seriously.  Sports, she introduced me to sports, my brother introduced me to music, my other sister [Rosalind Singho Randall] you know she, she would, she was my immediate older sister so I was I looked to her immediately.  And you know she was just was so patient too, I mean these, these are saints my sisters, you know?  We're all, we're very close, and I was just, I, I thought in a way that I was an interloper because it was the first four--and I tease my sister now.  I said you know you probably were angry at me because you were the baby for five years. (Laughter) Here, here I come took you out of your baby status you know.  You were getting all this baby attention.  But you know you have this inter sibling things that go on, but so that you know my, my sister's illness and her early death, she died when she was thirty. It was, that was the, at the time, and still is the most, among the most devastating things that I, that I experienced.  Because nobody had ever died in my family and you never expect even though you, you know you're not mortal when you're in your early twenties, and, and that was, that was an awful day. I as--I remember, I just I couldn't stop screaming, she had, you know she had you know she was in and out of health crisis, but she, she graduated, honor student.  She taught for--'cause you know it took her longer to go to school because of her illness, her intermittent illnesses and, and hospitalization, but she was determined.  And she, she must've taught for I guess about I know maybe five years before she became ill again.  And we, we didn't realize the, the severity of her, her illness, she eventually got heart failure and she was in the hospital, but nobody expected that she was going to expire.  And when I got that news, Miss Mitchell [ph.] called me, the lady, the nurse upstairs, that was you know neighbor, it was awful.  And I prayed you know when, when she was in that hospital I prayed I think it was the first time I ever asked God to, to take, you know. I'm sorry. But it didn't happen.  So you know--
Speaker 2: We'll take a break.
Story_ID: 296343
Speaker 1: So before we move on into your high school, are there any final thoughts you'd like to say about your sister [Gwendolyn Singho]?  Are there things that she left with you; is there something you learned about yourself after her passing, strength at least (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, well you know she's with me all the time in my--all of my, all my family members are in a spiritual way.  I, I it tested my faith because I was so angry, I had you know asked God to take me and I don't know if I ever asked God for anything so strongly or so sincerely that I was really upset and I, I didn't stop believing in, in my spiritual high in power but I was really challenged.  But you know she taught me and, she, she it, awakened me to things that perhaps were laying dormant like the economics, of, of our lives.  If we had more money, would she had gotten better care you know, what, what could we have done if, if you know a second guess all the, all the medical technological advances that took place after she died.  You know if this had happened you know we could've done that or you know all these what ifs and I wish we could have and, and wondering in, in making, in making decisions that and facts bear themselves out of that.  If you're in higher social economic strata you get better health care, you get better education, you get (laughter) so it didn't take me really long to figure out that--and you know all the dynamics of the, the civil rights activities these, these things started to really interest me.  In terms of directing me where I wanted to be, I mean I started, I, I moved, I had exposure to this fashion industry.  And there were aspects of it I mean I started to see where the issue of race, gender discrimination exist, you know that was a given.  I mean we didn't talk about it every day, but the, the statistics were telling us these things, so the activities was telling us these things.  That some things were happening in our country and I'm here at this time, my sister, she was preparing herself for an area that she wanted to move in.  But you know there was discrimination there too, but she, she made some choices.
Story_ID: 296344
Speaker 1: I didn't want to be a teacher, my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho], I think steered me to being a nurse, she used to say it sometimes, "Don't you wanna be a nurse?  Take care of your mother when she gets old," (laughter) you know.  And I actually I investigated, I worked in a hospital for a while as a volunteer, just to kind of get a sense of what it's like to work in a hospital every day.  And, and it was very interesting and I, they ask you as a volunteer, what area do you have a preference if you would like to work in?  I well said with children, with babies, whatever.  And I had some very heart wrenching experiences working with these babies, you know?  And one, one that I remember most was I mean if babies are in the hospital there's something wrong usually.  And some of the, some of the situations were you know benign, kids went home and whatever. But it was one memorable one where the kid was left in the hospital, I mean you didn't hear about border babies then, but this people had the baby and the baby was left in the hospital.  And I got so attached to this baby, you know like I was, I'd come in there and whatever and, and it was, it was, I got very emotionally involved with this child you know.  Trying to find out what, who the next of kin was, and the baby had some health problems, I think the baby had some debilitating gen, genetic; it was born with some, some condition.  So, so everybody sort of took care of this child, the nurses and the volunteers and the doctors 'cause the baby was a border of the hospital, a border of the hospital.  And I mean it; it told me something that service is good, helping people is good, doing good and doing well.  I mean those two things I started to come away with you know and there was this, this economic piece that we that was always show, coming to me you know.  And then you'd hear the, the counterpoints saying, well you know money is not the, money is not the solution for everything.  But I was hearing one thing and seeing conflicting behavior, yes it is, it, it can fix a lot of things.  And money is the root of all evil, power is no good, you don't wanna be powerful (laughter) you know.  Only evil bad people are powerful, so these were mixed messages that I was starting to see.  And I wasn't, I wasn't directly believing 'cause I was starting to say, money is not, money is just an adamant thing it's what you do with it.  Power, if people are megalomaniacs and they have power, they can do some bad things.  If a good person has some power, they can do some good things, I mean it was started to bet, to societal issues in things that I was gonna, my career, how was I going to function?  How was, where was I gonna direct my energies if I was going to be a working person, and, and it wasn't a situation where you were expected then to get married and then not work.
Story_ID: 296345
Speaker 1: You know those options were starting to open up to women too, that even if you got married, it didn't necessarily mean that you were going to be a career homemaker like my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho].  And I didn't really envision myself being a quite a, quite a, a homemaker as my mother was.  You know in the beginning I sort of thought I could work and I could you know have family too, but that was then and I still believe that.  And see it obviously seen it bear out with lots of women who juggle or at least they.  But my sister and my family situation and the things that I started to see beyond the, the child's eyes but you know the, the young adult eyes and the adult eyes so you know.  If you're paying attention and I, I'm very much in interested in politics and public policy matters and if, was exposed to that, as, as part of my career, but I gravitated to it with great interest.  Because the decisions that ha- may- happened in the public policy arena and they have economic implications.  And those two factors very much have great bearing on, on our quality of life here.  So it's, it these have been the, the things that I've taken away and perhaps they just got crystallize with her [Roberts' sister, Gwendolyn Singho] passing.  Because it made me realize how vulnerable we are, how mor- mortal we are, and how time is so important.  And she had a shorter life and now in deference to her and in tribute to her, I should do something you know positive with what, what our higher powers given me.  So she, she and my brothers, and my parents you know they were all collectively have had that kind of impact.  And between the work ethic and the trying to keep some you know, I guess moral compass integrated into all the things you do.  You know because there are so called temptations that can gear, steer people in, in directions that would dishonor your parents and would dishonor yourself.  So it was all those things that you factor in you know, there's corruption, there's you know, there's, there's things that you encounter that you have to work around within or overcome or.  So it's you know it's a challenge and, and various stages in your life that you, you experience.
Story_ID: 296346
Speaker 1: Tell me about your life at Evander Childs High School [Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York].
Speaker 2: Evander, it was, it was a continuation of the thoughts and the, and the, the growing, the, the growing pains of, of young adulthood.  I realized that they were kids, there were teachers who had low expect I realized very, very directly that there were you know teachers that had lower expectations of us having come from Paul Laurence Junior High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar J.H.S. 120; Paul L. Dunbar M.S. 301, Bronx, New York].  I also realized that, that dealing with, with a, a different group of individuals all the kids that I went to school with Junior High School 120  did not go to Evander Childs.  So I was introduced to new people, people I'd never know, that I didn't even know, you know different personalities.  Your, your status in the groups started to be more, more an issue you know, who, who emerges as a leader who emerges as the person who was gonna be put upon.  I mean you, you want to stake your claim, there were boys involved you know you wanna dress nicer because you're you know you're getting to be a young woman.  You're vying for their attention to some extent, you know 'cause you know some of the boys in high school were, were cute and you wanted you know, you wanted to kind of--what group you were gonna align yourself with, there were cliques in high school.  There were girls and boys that came from one area and in, in the city and there were boys and girls that came from another area.  So there were all these dynamics and part of it was, was not, part of the experience was not wonderful, I mean I can't say I had this great experience in high school.  It was a good school, I, I encountered some very nice good teachers; Mr. Sommers [ph.], he was my home--homeroom teacher was really wonderful, so understanding.  You know I seem to gravitate to these teachers who, who are, who could, who appreciate excellence and they expect it from you and they give it to you.  They respect themselves and they respect you, and they don't treat you like children, you know I mean.  And some kids you know come with issues you know so I was dealing with these diff- different types of kids.  And fortunately I had my two friends that we came from Junior High School 120 and we all went to Evander, so we would cry on each other's shoulder about the things that were happening.  Because we came from a poorer section of the Bronx [New York] than maybe some of the others.  Some kids came from Upper Manhattan [New York, New York] and they were in a higher social economic group, you know the way they dressed, and they had you know what, they were much more fashionable, and we had little issues like that or.  And I didn't, I didn't envy any of them, but you know they would, it was a reaction you know you, you I was--so I said well I'll just have to, I'll get through this (laughter) I'll get through this period.  And now that I look back on my high school experiences, it wasn't that bad, I mean it's like my godmother [Gladys Lawson Challinor (ph.)].  Fifty years from now, what will it be you know you got through it whatever, but it was, it was a stressful period.  And they you know the dating things started to you know then you had to deal with prom and who's gonna take you to the prom.  And I didn't have a boyfriend at the time, and I went to my high school prom with a guy who was not my boyfriend.  And it was just somebody that I met you meet somebody to go to the prom with, so it was more pro forma (laughter).  So it wasn't like this emotional commitment to this person vice versa.  And you know went through the whole thing, but my parents [Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho] were so good at that, you know they--we had a debutantes thing at the church.  I mean they, they really wanted to give us as much as they could given the limitations of their economic situations.  So we, so they, they were great economist now that I look back on them too, because they were able to take minimum, what I, you know I, I don't even know how they did it.  I, I used to say, how do you raise eight children you know.  My father's the only one working, my mother's home; he worked other jobs and things like that.  And he would play cards sometimes too and win money at cards.

Speaker 1: That was probably like 19- about '55 [1955], '56 [1956].  That was my cotillion, the church, the church that I was confirmed in Trinity Episcopal Church.  They had an annual cotillion where they would invite the young ladies who were about to be, what, sixteen or so when, they have this fancy ball and the gentlemen, our dates and they would select the dates would present this wonderfully elaborate affair in the neighborhood and one of the neighborhood catering places.  And we learned how to waltz and we learned how to curtsy (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay next.
Speaker 1: It was really neat, that's me.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: That was me in a, in a wedding of close family friend and I was a one of the flower girls here.  This was a family that lived across the street.  This is my friend Marlena Franklin [ph.], I used to ask her if she, she ever thought she was related to my mother's [Harriet Franklin Singho] people 'cause my mother's maiden name was Franklin.  And the family I mentioned some of our neighbors went on to be accomplished in various disciplines and Cicely Tyson.  The sister of the bride is Cicely her bride, her sister Emily [ph.] and we've known each other over many years and Cicely and Marlena and her family have been in our lives forever.  So that was a nice memory.  Emily died a few years ago, and she had, she had three children and we're all still in touch too.  This is Cicely's mother and her father.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Here's Cicely and her sister Emily.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.

Speaker 1: That was a photo from again in the early '60s [1960s] I was starting to be engaged to for some modeling photographic shoots and this was one that.  This is one that I was taken for a job and I used it as part of my portfolio.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That was one of my commercial modeling assignments and the gentleman you might recognize as Richard Roundtree with a different hairstyle.  That was back in the, oh gosh, that was the early '60s [1960s] no mid-'60s [1960s] yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, great next.
Speaker 2: Oh that's another hair commercial that I did that appeared in several magazines.  I think Ebony was one of them and some other magazines was a national, I think was a national campaign.

Speaker 2: That was, all these are in the '60s [1960s] these are in the, this is in the.  That was, that was early '60s [1960s] that was one of my first modeling assignments, maybe my second.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right, next.
Speaker 2: Here we are marketing Raven [ph.] again with Richard Roundtree and myself, that was probably I guess around. That was also in the, the '60s [1960s] probably a year later than the earlier one.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This, these photos were taken by William Helburn.  He was a very prominent photographer, and I don't know if these appeared.  But the fact that he, he shot them and, and provided them for me to enhance my portfolio, it was very, very useful.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The spelling of the photographer's name?
Speaker 1: H-E-L-B-E-R-N [sic.], I believe.

Speaker 1: My name is Shawn Wilson, I'm interviewing for The HistoryMakers. Nick Burghelea [Neculai Burghelea] is doing the videography and we are continuing our interview with Allene Roberts [HistoryMaker Allene Singho Roberts].  Today is July 28 [2005], correct?  We will start--we ended last time with you speaking about the positive influence your sister [Gwendolyn Singho], your older sister had had over your life during your teenage years.  So we will pick up there and if you can tell me what happens in your life after you graduate Evander Childs High School [Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York].
Speaker 2: Oh, after I graduated from Evander, I guess I was going through the process of trying to figure out what it was I wanted to do with my career.  I had, had and--I graduated with a, with a academic diploma which is the preparatory, college preparatory diploma.  So I knew I was gonna go to college, I didn't exactly know where, so since I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do I worked for about a year.  So before I decided to go back to school which I did, I, my first summer job after, after high school was with the parks department [New York City Department of Parks and Recreation].  I worked as a parking assist- a park assistant, as a recreational assistant with the, with the--for the kids who came to the park.  I, I worked with them for you know help to, to monitor their behavior and to engage them in, in games and spots activities and that sort of thing.  And so monitored them, it was one of those silly fun jobs but I enjoyed it.  It was outdoors and I, I liked the idea of being in a mobile situation.  Because I, I think I mentioned to you when we were off camera that I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do.  And that help to direct me to where I ended up, I, I knew I did not want a stationary position.  I did not want to go to an office every day or sit behind a desk and do routine kind of what I thought was monotonous tasks.  So that kind of led me to yes, I don't want to work in an office, I'm I want to work outside an office.  So working in the parks is certainly outside, so that was, that was my first enterprise, and I had remembered, I don't remember anybody ever telling me but our family tradition was work was going to be a part of your career--your life.  It was just an automatic, you were going to go to work and you were gonna be independent and you're going to extend your--the family tradition in that way, and of course education.  Rather than--well my sisters, my older sister, both of them went to Hunter College [New York, New York], one for social work, the other for, for teaching, for education.  And I didn't want to pursue either one of those endeavors, and as I started to kind of research careers, what curriculum I wanted to con- consider and, and explore and pursue, I thought about the altruistic parts of, of work you know doing some good.  And I thought also about the monetary reward side, you know do good, do well.  And both those things appealed to me, so I said well how can I maybe do some good and also do well?  You know to acquire some capital and, and see the rewards of my work and a, in a monetary sense too.  And intrigued with how you could combine those two things, because it, it appeared that, I mean some of my friends went to civil service jobs and they took the test for state and federal position.  And then my, my siblings, my two sisters, particularly they were going for education and social work and, and somehow, those, those while they're very noble and, and enriching in terms of public service, I didn't gravitate to that.  Because it still reminded me of, of work that would require me to go to an office every day and to be there.  So perhaps that was the, the one, among the characteristics that did not appeal to me.
Story_ID: 296349
Speaker 1: So when you decided to return to school where did you end up going to college?
Speaker 2: I started at Bronx Community College [New York, New York] because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year?
Speaker 2: When did I start, I started at going at night, I guess I started at about 1964, '64 [1964] '65 [1965], somewhere in there.  And I decided that the curriculums the curriculums that appealed to me led me to business, business administration.  It seemed to be something appealing about the prospects of, of, I guess going into an area that there were not black women traditionally involved in.  Because most of the career counseling sort of encouraged you to do work that was considered traditional, the teaching the social worker, the, the secretaries.  And, and those are all wonderful career, career paths, but I guess maybe there's a part of me that says if you should do this, then maybe I should consider something else, you know.  It was sort of a challenge and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry if you didn't go to, so you sent to Bronx in 1964, so I read from '60 [1960] like from '60 [1960] to '63 [1963] you worked for Metropolitan Life Insurance [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did you get from the park to Metropolitan Life Insurance?
Speaker 2: I, I what did I go after, oh okay between that and, and Metropolitan, I, I worked for an insurance brokerage firm.  That was my sort of my introduction to the insurance industry, and in, in between that, between my work with Haiyan Nielsen Region Reed [ph.], that was insurance brokerage and Metropolitan, I was introduced to peripherally to the, to the modeling field.
Story_ID: 296350
Speaker 1: How did that introduction come about?
Speaker 2: Well one of my friends worked at the Times, [The] New York Times and he knew several of the individuals there.  And I was introduced to one of the individuals who worked in the, the magazine development section.  Where they put together the magazine and they have a, a fashion section and that they periodically print each year.  And I guess that they were trying to integrate their modeling formats and they were looking you know for, for many women of color to participate in some of these ads.  And I, it was sort, sort of an im- impromptu thing, I met her and, she said, "Allene [HistoryMaker Allene Singho Roberts], have you ever done any modeling," and I said, "No, I haven't."  And she said, well--well I hadn't officially done modeling, I had gone to charm school Ophelia DeVore [Ophelia DeVore Charm School, New York, New York] and that was sort of a subtle pathway.  But I didn't really go there with the anticipation of becoming a model.
Speaker 1: Well what year did you go to charm school?
Speaker 2: I guess I was in my teen years; I must've been about sixteen or so?
Speaker 1: And what was the name of that charm school?
Speaker 2: Ophelia DeVore, she's [HistoryMaker Ophelia DeVore] still out there and her, her firm still participates and teaches (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just to step back a moment.  What did they teach you?
Speaker 2: I guess they were designed to teach you to become a little more poised.  I was very tall and considered somewhat awkward, tall for my age.  And one of my very close friends Marlena [Marlena Franklin (ph.)], her parents send her, sent her and she came you know to tell me how this exciting experience and I should go and I should participate and you know go to charm school with her.  So you know my mother [Harriet Franklin Singho], father [Albert Singho] sent me to this charm school and they, they would teach you things like walking erect and, and they, they really balancing the book on your head so you could walk with, with a straighter posture.  And they, they taught fencing, public speaking and at the end of it, it did evolve into a fashion sort of a fashion show.  Part of the training did include etiquette you know the proper way to set a table and to, to use utensils and prepare you for I guess a more refined, I guess, experience.
Speaker 1: So using that training when you were offered this opportunity to work as a model, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well she's, when she said she asked Carol, was her name was Carol Johnson [ph.], she asked me had I ever done any modeling and I said I really hadn't.  I mean I done my Ophelia DeVore fashion show and that sort of thing, but nothing quite that I would consider a, a career plan.  And she said well we're doing a shoot and why don't you come down, and, and I think you could, you'll work well for this particular shoot.  And I, I went down for the, for the interview for the, for the shoot, shooting and they liked me and they hired me to do that particular modeling assign- assignment.  And one thing led to another and I did, I wasn't really focusing specifically on it, I it was very serendipitous this getting into the, into the modeling field.  But in that field it's, it was rather narrow in terms of a number of African American women and men who were, who were modeling at the time.  So I, I got that one job and, and before I knew it, somebody was inviting me to be part of their modeling agency.  And Alena Brooks [ph.] was one of the, one of the first few--I mean affiliated or had a modeling agency also.  But I was approached by Alena Brooks through another model that I had met in the course of all of this.  So I, I was hired by her to be a part of their, their team of models, so I would periodically get called for different jobs in between this whole thing of go, going back to school.
Story_ID: 296351
Speaker 1: This is at the time you were also at the Bronx Community College [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I was going at night, yes.
Speaker 1: You were going at night and modeling during the day?
Speaker 2: Right.  And, and when I got the job at Metropolitan [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, New York, New York], it was sort of an interruption because it was not that much flexibility.  It was basically a nine-to-five job, and it didn't take me a long time to realize it--I was not happy there (laughter).  And so I, I as, in, in the course of my part-time modeling, I was asked to interview for the Ebony Fashion Fair and that was my transition from Metropolitan Life into a more extended modeling career path.  So I, I joined the, the Ebony Fashion Fair, I think it was 1966, '65 [1965], '66 [1966] somewhere in there. My years are perhaps not precise.  And that was an interesting experience.
Speaker 1: What made that an interesting experience?
Speaker 2: Three months on a bus, from going from one town across the country to another and sort of an, an enclosed environment.  The bus obviously so you got to know these people fairly well in a relatively short, short amount of time.  And it was, it was interesting in that--and fun too, and also kind of trying as well, because after a while, it, the routine got a little tiring.  But it was exciting in a sense that it was the first time I had traveled to so many different cities in the United States.  So that was certainly enlight- enlightening and enriching.  And I got to meet people who from other parts of the country, who I would've probably never met before.  Some of whom are st- have become long-time friends, lifelong friends.  And certainly was it, was an addition to my, my fashion portfolio that I was a part of the Ebony Fashion Fair, it became somewhat legendary in it, in itself for what it's done and longevity.  And periodically they have these reunions of, of Ebony Fashion Fair models participants and so it's sort of an extended sort of family experience that came out of it, so.  And I you know I did, I, I it took me a long time to get out of Bronx Community College because I was working as a fashion model and I had to, to combine these different activities around my, my school.  But I was determined to finish, and I did, it just took me a little longer, and I'm glad I did pursue the business administration because it was really the foundation for a lot of things that I would encounter.  Not only in my, my other career, my corporate career, but just in seeing how every entity that I worked with it was, it was a business.  And so I got to, I got to look at these enterprises from a different perspective, not just as or not as the model, but what is the executive in that organization do?  What is their responsibility how does that work, and the, the uniformity of how businesses work became very clear.  You know whether you're running a modeling agency, whether, whether you're running a, a school, whether you're running a for-profit or not-for-profit.  Small business, medium size business, large business, there some very fundamental things that had to happen for those things to, to be successful.  So that start to really intrigue me.  And I said well you know maybe there's a reason why I pursued this, this path rather than another and it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At the--
Speaker 2: Also fed to the, the notion of, of financial, financial growth and development for, for related to the work that you do.  You know that's a, there's a, there's a risk factor in, in starting a business, and they used to be a term the bigger the risk the bigger the payback.  You know and there's some truth to that I think too, that I, at least I learned and witnessed just for myself.
Story_ID: 296352
Speaker 1: So just to step back a moment into the modeling world, and Ebony Fashion [Fair] shows were pretty big throughout the country.  I remember them coming to my hometown and it was a big event every time they came.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Within that, within that culture within that community of, of you know like models or the people working on that project, did you guys feel that you were doing something like culturally for the small communities for the black community?  Did it feel in any sense that you were doing something beyond just putting on clothes and walking down a runway?  Did it feel important in any way?
Speaker 2: One of the, the fundamental goals of the, of the program was to contribute the proceeds to local not for profit organizations.  So each fashion show that was produced in each town was sponsored by a local not for profit, so it was a fundraising vehicle for that organization for that area.  So it was absolutely a, a community philanthropy and, and culture and enriching components to this, to this project.  And I thought it was very well thought out and that it, it incorporated the participation of everybody.  I mean not only the producers of the fashion show, but it engaged the communities in a very meaningful way.  In that, and I, I think it galvanized a lot of those communities you said when we come to town, we were treated very, very well.  And we're, we we're, we all felt always very welcomed and, and everybody was very gracious to us.  So yes it was, it was a very, good feeling to, to be a part of something like that.  And it was not the--the sole purpose was, was to I think bring a level of, of a cultural enriching experience and it was, it was career promoting as well.  Because some kids who had ever seen a fashion show or never seen maybe black or African American models or people of color in this venue.  'Cause you look in the magazines and you prominently did not see many people of color.  So it was another dimension for encouraging another career pursuit or the thought that somebody else could do that.  And some of the models extended their careers into acting and other, other fields in, in the creative arts.  So it was a stepping stone to a lot of different things for, for some of those who chose those, those paths.
Speaker 1: So this is the 1960s?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Were there ever any incidents or backlashes against you guys traveling around America in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: There were a few, they weren't o- overt for that particular year for me, I didn't really encounter, we didn't really encounter many things.  But the shows were predominantly, were held in predominately African American communities, so they weren't really integrated events per se.  I mean when you some of them were integrated to some extent you saw people for other cultures and ethnic groups attending them.  But it was predominantly geared to African American community, so we weren't really interloping in that sense.  And we weren't considered I guess involved in an enterprise that was disruptive in any way; it was sort of not viewed quite that way.  What, what I found was interesting though because it right on the heels of the Civil Rights Act [of 1964], the Civil Rights Movement.  That the prior year to my participation, many of the, many of the--our stays were at the people's home.  Because they were, they were towns where there were no hotels that were integrated, so the, the models had to stay you know where they could.  And that particular year, every place that we went to it was, it was evidence that the Civil Rights Act was working.  We were, we stayed in hotels at each, in each city that we that we appeared at.  So that was a major, a major breakthrough in terms of the result of a lot of, a lot of effort.
Story_ID: 296353
Speaker 1: Back in New York [New York] you became one of the first black fitting and showroom models for Bill Blass?
Speaker 2: No actually it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was Oleg Cassini.
Speaker 2: No, I was fitting model for, it was, it was Sloat and Company was the actual, was the company that I worked for, I was the first black there.  I worked in several fashion shows, Oleg Cassini among them, Oscar de la Renta.  But I was not their fitting models, I participated as you know when they, when they were showing, we would go and obviously have to fit for their, for their you know outfits.  But I was a permanent fitting model for Sloat and Company which was a first for them and one of the first I think on 7th Avenue used to be called the, the Fashion Garment District, so that was interesting too.
Speaker 1: So you were helping to integrate 7th Avenue, Fashion Avenue?
Speaker 2: In effect, I guess so.  I was among few, a few other black women and men who worked in the, in the industry, who were hired in that in those capacities.  I'm not sure if I was the first, but I was certainly among the first, I was the first at, at Sloat and Company.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did that come about at Sloat and Company?
Speaker 2: I, I interviewed, they were looking for, for a fitting model, and I interviewed and I, I was, it may have been a word of mouth, because a lot of those things happen in very somewhat small network industries.  And I went and I, I fit into the clothes that were--well they--you the pinning, the pinning model, so that you were fitting in the clothes that they were making.  And I guess the chemistry was there and, and maybe they wanted to feel that they were enlightened too, but whatever it was, it worked.  I was there and I did the work as a fitting model, and it was not always very glamorous, I must say.  I mean the fir- in the showroom, you see the showroom side, but that's when the product is finished (laughter) and the buyers come in and you come out and you model for the buyers and they buy the line or not.  But the, all the tales you might hear about the fitting models sticking, getting stuck with the pins, and, and having to be in the working with the seamstresses in the, in the so-called sweatshops at the time, that was not so, so romantic, and, and glamorous.  But it was part of the work and I found it interesting for what it was.
Story_ID: 296354
Speaker 1: So you completed the Bronx Community College [New York, New York] in what year?
Speaker 2: In '70 [1970], '70 [1970] '73 [1973] somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: In the '70s [1970s], so at what point did you join Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.] and how did that come about?
Speaker 2: That was another word of mouth thing (laughter) introduction when I, when I left Fashion Fair, Ebony Fashion Fair, I was doing part-time modeling.  And one of my, one of the women who worked at, at Fashion Fair, she was the commentator called to tell me that the company was looking for a fashion model, fashion models to promote the introduction of a new product that they were promoting.  And it was it would be a temporary position 'cause they were running this campaign for I guess a few months.  And I was doing part-time fashion anyway, so it seemed to fit in with fit in with what I was doing.  And so I went to Queens [New York] for the interview and you know they hired me right on the spot.  And we would go to events and promote the product and smile and take pictures and meet with various executives with the company.  And participate in fashion-type activities; they would have different promotions around a particular brand that it was.  And we would show up and do our fashion model presentation.
Speaker 1: Now were you promoting cigarettes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it new for them to use a black model to promote cigarettes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you promoting to a black community or that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not initially--
Speaker 1: Outreach to black community?
Speaker 2: Not initially, but that became a, a part of their, their marketing strategy after, after a period.  But initially it was a general market rollout.
Story_ID: 296355
Speaker 1: So I know in your, in the latter, now, I mean you've moved into a more environmental side of--did working for Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.] have anything to do with you later on becoming an activist for the environment people that were--what was your experience at Philip Morris I should ask.
Speaker 2: It was, it was actually quite a positive one because as I mentioned this was on, this was on the heels of the all the goals or some of the goals and, and mission of the civil rights activism.  To try to open the doors to business of business of to African Americans to, to have access to public accommodations.  And all the things that went into the struggle to, to provide for equal opportunity for people of color.  So it was it was exciting in, in that we were in a way I mean you didn't realize it at the time that you were sort of doing, some groundbreaking or door opening things.   And that your performance perhaps would influence the decision to hire more people of color.  So I didn't really feel that I was car- carrying the heaviest burden at the time, 'cause to me the heaviest burden were the people who gotten to that point who really laid their lives on the line.  So I felt that it was some, some responsibility for us to, to take advantage of the things that people were doing to, to provide for those opportunities.  So that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you feel you were doing that was groundbreaking?
Speaker 2: Well I, I guess when they keep calling you a first of some sort, I mean, I, I didn't really make that my goal to be a first, but it was coincidental.  And you know they were sometimes assumptions that were made that perhaps if you were an African American or you were a woman, that you not gonna be as competent.  So there were some perhaps unspoken and some overt assumptions that were, that were apparent after fashion.  So I mean the background my fa- you know my family orientation was that you're gonna have obstacles and you do what you can to overcome them you know.  So that's what we did and, and I came from a background where there was a work ethic that you do the job the best you can and better.
Speaker 1: What was your title at Philip Morris?
Speaker 2: It was a--first job?
Speaker 1: The first job.
Speaker 2: It was special, special promotions representative.
Speaker 1: And you went from being the special promotions representative to?
Speaker 2: Sales representative.
Speaker 1: And what was the difference in those jobs?
Speaker 2: The promotions representative did not really sell the product, you were promoting it, you participated in marketing activities and special events to give exposure to the product.  And be part of the overall presentation in those particular venues.  But in sales, you went to stores, you went to supermarkets, you went to convenience stores, you went to drugstores, drug chains.
Speaker 1: Now were you going to mainly black stores or all stores?
Speaker 2: All stores.
Speaker 1: Given that cigarettes have such a bad reputation now did it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It didn't then.
Speaker 1: It didn't then.
Speaker 2: It was emerging you know the first surgeon general's report in the early '60s [1960s] started that that snowball.  And but initially the company was promoted as a very well-run company--when I started it was of the seven major cigarette tobacco companies, they were I think fifth or sixth on the bottom.  So they were considered a, the smaller company and the period of time that I was there, it went, went from that small, very small company to a significantly large company over the twenty-six years that I was there.  A lot changed in terms of the image of tobacco and, and, and of course the legal problems that emerged over, over the years.
Story_ID: 296356
Speaker 1: Continuing on tape four when we were talking about Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.] and your job with them.  You were with the company for twenty years.
Speaker 2: Twenty-six.
Speaker 1: Twenty-six years.
Speaker 2: Almost twenty-six, yeah twenty-six years.
Speaker 1: And you started as a model basically.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so from being a model you moved into sales
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what did that mean exactly for you?
Speaker 2: It was a promotion, an opportunity to contribute directly to the bottom line.  It was a sales marketing organization so you were; you were an integral part of the growth and development of the company's, company's financial status--standing.  And fortunately or unfortunately I was a, another first there in this particular region anyway.  So I got very good reviews and very good performance appraisals and did the job. And it was primarily I had a, you know I had a territory in Queens [New York], part of Queens.  And we would the job entailed going to retail outlets as a sales rep, before I became an area manager.  Sales rep, you would go to various accounts, you were given a basic number of accounts that were pre- preplanned for you and then you could also enlist new accounts as you found, and if a new store opened or whatever you could add them on to your territory, inventory.  And we would go to this outlet and do our sales our presentation with, with the product and the promotion program at the, of the day, of the week.  And we would put up posters, we would merchandise pointed sale information that was entailed.  They gave me a car initially I had my own car they just, but they--eventually I, I was given a company car.  And that was part of the, the routine of selling for, for the product, for the company.
Speaker 1: So what year are we talking about now that you are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started with them in '67 [1967] so I was, I was a promotional representative I guess for about five or six years.  And I became a sales--that's when I became a sales rep, the opportunity presented itself and I took it, because the, the promotional position was really not gonna last, lead anywhere.  I mean it was--and after a while, it you know got pretty routine, and it was really no growth opportunity in that particular area.  And unless you were really going to contribute somehow in another way it was really a cost center you know, I mean marketing of cost, the cost of doing business.  But unless you're bringing money in, you don't have the same value to the, the enterprise, so that was I thought of an inroad and the company was growing by leaps and bounds.  The success of the products you know certain key products took off and it's a very, it's you know a very wealthy enterprise.  The mark-up on tobacco and you know the sales of the, of the growth was fairly swift for particular brands, so the return on the investment, was, was really good.  So I participated in some of those brand introductions so you sort of at the right place at the right time.  And, and that's what led me to accepting a position in sales, they were growing and they were looking to hire from within at the time.  I mean that became a philosophy of the company that they would first look to hire from within the corporation.  And, and that's that was the, the initial path to my moving up further on with the company.
Story_ID: 296357
Speaker 1: So did people--what were people's attitudes in the minority and black communities about smoking cigarettes?
Speaker 2: At the time it wasn't, it wasn't as big an issue as it became and in fact being an African American woman it was at first being a woman was a novelty because it was a very male dominated industry.  And there were no female sales reps and there were very few female--women of color in, in that industry.  So I was a novelty at first I believe, but after a while the novelty wears off and you have to produce, you have to sell the product.  You have to, to contribute, and that's what I did and you know it, it was--since I had, I had a mixed territory; it wasn't only African Americans or people of color in my territory [for Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.].  So that was a, that was a challenge because you know they weren't used to seeing a woman or a woman of color.  But after a while you get to know people, you get familiar and you, your interpersonal skills kick in and you, you become friendly with them and vice versa and they start to depend on you after a while.  And if your product is selling, they like that and if you're you know participating with various promotional programs and incentives for them, they like that too.  So it, I did it according to them, according to the company I did it very well.  So it wasn't, I wasn't evaluating myself I was just doing what, what the training program provided for, and the guidelines and you, it, it allowed for some creativity as well.  So you, you, and it's a competitive, sales was very competitive, so you have to kind of stretch and, and think of different creative ways to engage your, your customer to have them wanna do business with you versus somebody else you know.  Give, give yourself an advantage.
Story_ID: 296358
Speaker 1: So the '60s [1960s] were very turbulent times.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed Malcolm X, what do you remember about those events?
Speaker 2: I, I remember both, both very vivid, vividly, where I was, and what the, my personal feeling of loss was and certainly my family and my relatives and community at large.  It was quite devastating, and given the, the magnitude of the leadership that he provided, Mal- Malcolm, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X both of them, it was a major loss.  It was a major loss in sense that they were catalyst and, and very important, important ways.  And with Martin Luther King getting involved in, in galvanizing poor people in general and working class people and across the board.  It was, was going to be I think important for the, for the wellbeing of the country.  And I guess everybody did agree with that approach to integrate people who were working people, the poor people.  He was, he was unifying, I think and so I think that was major loss.
Speaker 1: Malcolm X was right here in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did that affect you and what was happening in your life at the time?
Speaker 2: Well he had--Malcolm X was, I met him at some of the meetings that he attended at in there, very charismatic person, intelligent, an engaging masterful speaker.  And he was saying things that, that inspired people and I guess you know that, that the mass media portrayed him, I think unfairly, so called mainstream media portrayed him unfairly.  And I think that they were, they were mechanisms in place to, to muffle his message, and I think he was moving towards a more unifying, a more unification approach to, to dealing with the issues of the day.  And perhaps that didn't sit well with people either.
Speaker 1: How were you dealing with the issues of that day?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I felt like I was a beneficiary of, of the work that people on the so-called front lines were doing.  So I felt that whatever contribution I can make to making things better for our people and for our city, for our state, for our community, for our country, whatever, whatever I did, I wanted to do it well.  And, and try to bring a level of, of the teachings that these men, these men and women too.  That if you, if you find your at- you have an opportunity to, to reach back to, to help your, your community then you do that.  So I felt that if wherever I was, if I'm working at in the corporate setting, if I'm working in fashion, whatever, I'm, I'm sharing information with other people that hopefully you'll learn just like I learned from other people.  Maybe you'll learn something or I can share something that will help you, and, and if, and I think if you do a good job at whatever you're doing, it can be helpful to other people.  It can be helpful to who you're working with and helpful to people around you who say well you know maybe I can do that too.  Or maybe I don't wanna do that, but I'm glad somebody else is doing that; somebody else is there that looks like me. And it sort of broadens, it can broaden the horizon of young people to know that you know we're, we're at different places.  We're, we're in involved in various activities and various career paths and various lines of work.  And I thi- you know I thought it was one of the goals of the Civil Rights Movement and the human rights movement for that matter, not just here in this country, but to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness you know.  But it's, be able to maximize who we are, and not get shut out.
Story_ID: 296359
Speaker 1: So you moved from sales to community relations [at Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.].
Speaker 2: No, I moved from sales to sales management.
Speaker 1: To sales management.
Speaker 2: Area manager and that required selling in, in larger volumes to the chain, chain accounts.  So I had a very large region in New York [New York] and transferred the skills from the retail level to the, the national headquarter account level.  So you're dealing with multimillions of dollars in sales, and that was, you know that was I thought an accomplishment.  'Cause again, in the, in the sales and marketing organization, people look at where the sales are and who's selling and, and those things matter.  So it was a very good experience coming in the company in a, in a line function.  I always value that because while staff functions contribute also, they, they all contribute, sort of one doesn't happen unless the other happens.  And this product doesn't get sold, the other things doesn't necessarily happen, so it's a very fundamental part of the business.  And if you have a product or a service or whatever, that's your core business, so that was a, a very positive experience.  And I think it was instrumentally reinforcing a lot of the things that I learned in school, you know one thing to learn in school when you learn theory, you learn practice, but the practical stuff comes into play when you're actually applying those things.  And so in, in this business experience I was able to apply some of those things that I learned in school [Bronx Community College, New York, New York], and both were very helpful.  Because some of the things you learned in school you have to have the practical experience you know to really bring it into focus.
Story_ID: 296360
Speaker 1: What did you see as your role to yourself and the community at large during the years in which you were at Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well it in you mean in the context of working for that industry?  Well at first I mean it, the, the controversy around the tobacco health issue was not really as, as pronounced as, as it is now and has, has become.  But as a result of that surgeon general's 19- I think it was 1963 or '62 [1962] report, that was the beginning of an emerging move.  And at first it, I didn't really feel the, the brunt of it, but as the controversy escalated, there were, there were public pressures that were brought to bear.  That I was working for a company that made a product that was not good and you know so those questions would periodically come up.  And you were challenged by the, the type of product that you were promoting and selling and advocating on behalf of the company.  So that, that did become somewhat noticeable and I, you know we dealt with it in a way that obviously the company asked us to deal with it.
Speaker 1: Which was?
Speaker 2: Was to--and depending what the issue was.  If it was an issue sa- that, that said tobacco caused this that or the other, at the time we were told that scientifically there were no direct correlations.  That they were not scientifically proven facts, that they were allegations, they were associations, but they were not really proven.  So those were the, those were the responses that we provided, because we believe, at least I did, that they were, they were telling us the truth.  And so I mean you didn't find it in every en- you didn't encounter in everywhere, but it started to grow, and it started to become a media, media pressure was brought to bear too.
Speaker 1: And I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Politically pressure to bear.
Speaker 1: Political press.  I remember growing up that you would hear that oh that they only put those ads in black neighborhoods because they wanted black people to smoke and that.  I mean I grew up I think hearing that smoking was bad because tobacco plantations and it was you know one of the big you know products of slavery or these tobacco--did any of that ever come up for you being a black woman?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And how did you deal with it?
Speaker 2: Well initially when, when I would, when I would be encountered or encounter somebody who, who would raise those issues, I would try to put it in the perspective at least to, to say that if we are, if we are a customer, if we are being asked to purchase these products, if we are advertised to and we a part of their marketing plan, then me as an employee is representing another aspect of the benefits of what can come out of that relationship.   You're not only purchasing the product, you're working for this company or you're working for the industry, so you have an interest in that area too.  There are career opportunities for, for folks in the community to, to explore, and, and if, as they were hiring more people of color, and women and other ethnic groups, and also there were other aspects of what the company was doing to broaden its image or polish its image so to speak.
Story_ID: 296361
Speaker 1: Why did they put you in community relations [at Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: They invited me to participate as a community relations representative, because as the political media pressures became more evident and growing, these departments did not exist when I first started with the company.  They emerged as a response to the growing pressures, and I had a familiar, familiarity with the product, with the company with the culture, with the community.  I mean as in sales and sales marketing you learn.
Speaker 1: So you were the perfect liaison between (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You learn a lot about the environment that you working.
Speaker 1: What were your job responsibilities, what were your tasks, what were you asked to do as a communities, as a community relations advisor?
Speaker 2: Well they, well it was, it was community relations and government relations, government affairs, so we were at the, I was one of the liaisons to the community, yes, various community organizations, leadership organizations.  And business and social services in with women's organizations, with various ethnic groups, with aggregate business groups, certainly with our elected officials and governmental organizations.  I was the company liaisons to a number of them, certainly minority ethnic groups, group organizations.  The company took the position at the time that it was, it was good corporate citizenship to participate this way.  If you live and work in a community and your product is sold in that community, you have a responsibility to participate in a wide range of areas within that community.  And since the community was, the country and international as well, that that left a very broad territory.  So I was working New York [New York] and I worked in most of the, many of the states in the country, depending on what the event required.  It may have been a convention or event or forum I would speak at various forums or related to whatever the issue might be.  Sometimes you talk the various programs that the company was promoting as it related to a particular organization or group of organizations.  We were involved in, we had what they call a minority vendor program, which I was a part of that organ- inter- intercompany organization.  Which encouraged minority and women firms to seek out business opportunities with the company.  So there were a variety of programs that the company's outreach to the various publics and we were the liaisons to, to communicate them.  And, so it was, it was positive, positive in many ways, but certainly challenging in a sense that the heat of the anti-tobacco, anti-industry movement was escalating.  And it, it created certainly a--you would encounter hostile environments and it came with the, and start to come with the territory.
Story_ID: 296362
Speaker 1: So I read that you were one of the founding members of the Minority Vendor Task Force.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was, it was a relatively, relatively new formal I mean when we do- the company was doing business with ethnic organizations and women's organizations.  But it became sort of a formalized entity within that company, and I was one of the first members of that organized effort.
Speaker 1: And the purpose of that organization was to do what with minority vendors?
Speaker 2: To encourage, to let, to let various businesses know that the company buys lots of businesses and services.  Or lots of products and services as a large corporation, i.e. consulting, consultants, we hired, they hired consultants, they, they would purchase pencils, they would purchase equipment.  They would purchase furniture, they would purchase toilet paper.
Speaker 1: And give these things to the minority communities?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: They are business buying these things so if you're a minority, so called minority owned business firm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And your selling pencils, we'll buy them from you?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was not always the pervasive practice because there was a, a competitive disadvantage sometimes if you're a small company a start-up company or a, a medium sized company competing with a very large established company, many of which, many of which were predominantly white, white male. There was a major competitive disadvantage.  So the company in it's in its effort to outreach, to expand its involvement in the community and that way was meaningful and that you're not only--it's a business relationship that you're establishing with the community.  A linkage that if, if they gonna buy, they gonna sell their product in that, in that community or those communities, they also wanna do business with the people who live and work there, and not only the big huge other entities.
Speaker 1: Now where did that idea come from, did you--were you on board that help implement like look we're selling them cigarettes, we should do business with them otherwise?
Speaker 2: Certainly, because we engaged all these organizations around the country and they would come to you and say well how do I do business with Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.]?  So you come back with a message folks wanna do business with Philip Morris and I want to intro- you know introduce them to different departments that were buying things whatever.  Then they had a purchasing department also, so the purchasing department was one of the spearheads of this too.  Because they were the ones who basically did most of the buying of businesses and services with some exceptions, because some you know some departments I guess purchased services and products on their own.  But there was a, a purchasing department within the company for I guess major purchases and a variety kinds of purchases, so most businesses have that kind of department.
Story_ID: 296363
Speaker 1: So I would imagine also during this time you were, you married and started a family.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm married.
Speaker 1: What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: Allen [Roberts] and I were married in 1977, '77 [1977]?  So yeah, no children, but we're a family.
Speaker 1: Now did Allen have any like, did you talk about this stuff at home, what were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: What were the conversations you'd have off the record about what was happening?
Speaker 2: Well I mean we were, we're very close and he's come out of a business experience as well so he could identify with some of the things that I was going through [at Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.].  And I could identify with the things that he was experiencing because he, he started out in manufacturing.  And he was one of the first blacks in his area and, and came through the ranks within the company that he started with; I think it was RCA [RCA Corporation, New York, New York] initially.  And so he, we experienced some of the similar things as, as we were pursuing our various respective careers, working experiences.
Story_ID: 296364
Speaker 1: So if we take away what we know today about cigarettes or what, what we've come to learn about the health risks of sm- of smoking--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: You would feel that Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.] was doing something really good for the community and the sense that there was this minority vendor outreach that there's community relations, you felt good about the job you were doing at Philip Morris?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I felt good about the, the fact that all companies weren't doing that, now perhaps there some pressures brought to bear to encourage them to, to promote a positive image within the various areas that they had to work.
Speaker 1: What were those pressures?
Speaker 2: Well the, obviously the, the growing concern about the health relationship between smoking and various conditions gave the company not a very favorable view in a lot of circles.  So they would, they, I think they knew wisely so I thought that they need to, to think out of the box, and, and in terms on how to respond to those kinds of observations and criticisms.  They could've done nothing, they could've just said we're gonna wat- you know we're just gonna do business as we've been doing it and.  But I think you know that there was some decisions I think that were made to, to try to, try to create, try to create an opportunity with the, the challenge that was being brought to bear.  And how to respond, and how to either to reduce the, the criticism or respond to it and, and whatever way they thought could soften the, the impact.  And, and in some, some areas within some communities around the country, they were, they were applauded for doing that, you know they were promoted in certain com- publications as forward thinking corporations.  Because they came up with certain things, I mean they were one of the first to get involved in, in promoting the arts and the museums.  And women's tennis and, and you know those the two that come to mind.  One of the first companies to invest in those kinds of cultural sport slash enterprises.  So there were you know thought of and they were, they were encouraging other companies to do similar things and, and so.  In that, in that sense it was a positive place to work, history tells us that you know certain things were not revealed and that was not good.
Story_ID: 296365
Speaker 1: So coming more towards the end of your career with them [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.], in '92 [1992] they hosted the, the Democratic National Convention [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the Republican National Convention [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were part of both of those?
Speaker 2: Right, I was committed for both.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was, it was planning major events basically, which we had done before with other activities that you're involved in government and community affairs.  So it was just a super major event in New York [New York] and in Houston [Texas], and so we had to do all the, all the task involved in getting that to happen.  You know working with the, with the host committees and the various committees within the Democratic National Office and the Republic National Office.  And site visits prior to putting together timelines for what activities had to be done by designated time, selection of venues to host events at.  Printing all kinds of invitations and programs and materials and getting guests list together for various groups that you were gonna host at a particular event or series of events.  Making sure that all the logistics were taken care of in terms of any local authorities that you have to communicate with or coordinate with.  And making sure hotels were booked, so we had you know we had a very good team putting all that together.
Story_ID: 296366
Speaker 1: We will continue with Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.] coming toward the end of your career in 1992, you were on a committee that helped to host the DNC [Democratic National Convention, New York, New York] and the NRC [sic. Republican National Convention (RNC), Houston, Texas] that was a positive experience for you?
Speaker 2: Generally yes.
Speaker 1: And that brings us to the end of your twenty-six year career with them, what happens?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately it ended with my be- becoming a plaintiff in a race/gender discrimination lawsuit against the company.  So it wasn't a pleasant departure, I certainly not anticipated anything like this happening.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well it was a new, a new management team that came in and I was basically passed over for, for opportunity for, for promotions over people I mean people new people were coming in.  And positions that were heretofore available to experienced employees were ignored, and I became a, a target of harassment.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: They accused me of malfeasances and misfeasance's and, and incorrectly falsely and just pretty much tried to make my life miserable.  And I attributed it to, to racial/gender discrimination, I sought legal counsel and all the evidences that were brought to bear indicated that.
Speaker 1: So what happened in the end?
Speaker 2: So was involved in a, in a protracted lawsuit which I'm still in litigation so I, I can't talk about all aspects of it.  But it was pretty horrendous and I begun to write, I mean I, I never imagined myself being involved in litigation of this kind.  I mean or any kind for that matter, but I certainly learned a lot about the whole process of getting justice.   So it's almost a full circle, you know I was involved in civil rights, not the being the beneficiary, beneficiary of all, of all the activism that took place in the '60s [1960s] to find myself suing the company that I had spent so much time with and had so much promise with.  Having encountered really of the kind of behavior that I did that brought me to that, to that recourse, was astounding to me.  But circumstances were such that I didn't have much of an alternative, and it turns out that I was right.  'Cause in, in litigation they have discovery and you, you exchange documents and I learned so much about what, what we thought had happened what actually happened was in term what it wasn't indeed harassment and conspiratorial behavior and just lying.  But they accused me in writing of malfeasance and they circulated memoranda around internally in the company and external to the company.  All the people that I had been dealing with, I said I have no recourse but to try to do something to retain my reputation.  I had to get some recourse for the injustice that was done.  So that was, that's the brunt of it without going into extreme details since I'm still in litigation.  It's been a protracted endeavor, and I'm writing about it because I started to write about the, the emotional impact and that it, that it had on me initially.  But over time you know it's, it's still very painful but it's been a learning experience as well.
Story_ID: 296367
Speaker 1: What have you learned?
Speaker 2: Well I've learned about my own resilience and my, my relationships that I have,  my, my own, not only my spiritual relationship but my relationship with my family.  I mean because everybody knew me as associated with this company, and when you're there for a long time, people associate you and, and your own identity gets intertwined (laughter) like that.  So they knew the loyalty that I had with this, this company and, and the positive general positive experience that I had.  So they were astounded too.  My mother [Harriet Franklin Singho], may she rest in peace, my mother, she was eighty-nine when she passed, she, she died in '93 [1993] right on the heels on all of this, this entanglement this, this lawsuit.  And I didn't, I did have a conversation with her and I told her what had happened and I told her that you know that I had no recourse but to file a suit against them.  And she said--you know it's, it's amazing because she used to admonish me sometimes because I, she thought I was extremely loyal.  She says I hope they're as loyal to you as you are to them, perhaps she saw something that I didn't see you know.  'Cause I was pursuing this career and things were not traditional to her, but she respected my, you know my choices, my decisions and my father [Albert Singho] too.  And then they always expressed their, their pride and satisfaction, but that did certainly trouble her, you know that it that it came to this.  She said well you know I trust your judgment on this, and I hope that you know the outcome is positive for you, 'cause I know what you, you know what you try to do here.  I know you in fact maybe committed a little too much you know 'cause when you're pursuing these careers, it, it's time consuming, you, you I traveled a lot, I was, I was away from my family for often times.  And my husband [Allen Roberts] certainly understood and he traveled too so we were two traveling career people.  But we understood it and we, we enjoyed it, and we you know we had goals and, and ideas.  So this was an interruption it was big interruption and it was costly in a variety of ways.  Not only financially but I'm committed to it, I gonna see it all the way through and in the meantime, I realize that there must be a life after corporate America (laughter) after this, this corporate experience, and there is.
Speaker 1: And what is, what, how did this evolve the life after Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.], so they, I assume they fired you or they asked you to leave or you left by your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After I sued them, they fired me, and so--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 2: November '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: So right at, right at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the end of the year.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Worked my bones off and then I get thrown out, you know.  So what happens after that, it was intense involvement in, in paper preparations in, in a lawsuit.  I felt like I was becoming an attorney myself because it was, I was learning terms that I never heard of, like, like EBTs, evidence before trial (laughter) and, and you know just getting loads and reams of, of documents together.  I certainly had to prepare docs- lots of documents for them and they had to prepare documents for my lawyers.  And, and a lot of reading and a lot of deciphering I mean one thing they know how to do is to pile on paper, you know so there was a lot of piling on of paper.  And meetings and court hearings and court meetings, and, and lawyers meeting and discussions about one thing or another.  And some people call it motion practice you know motions to just delay things and delay things to wear you down.  To exhaust your resources and to exhaust you in other ways and maybe you'll drop the case, you die or whatever.  I haven't done either but, so that was I was doing.  But in between, you have to figure out well I'm still relatively young, I'm still--my husband he, he had started his own company over the years.  And so he know, knew about how to start a company and as I'm trying to figure out what, what am I going to do.
Story_ID: 296368
Speaker 1: I could see the change in the--coming, over the, over the years that I worked in corporate setting.  Between the compact of employee and employer, I certainly could see that, didn't see what I saw coming directly towards me.  But I could see that there was a, a corporate cultural change that that was moving away from the culture that I initially saw.
Speaker 2: That you were going to retire and get a gold watch and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Live on yeah live on your--
Speaker 1: I, that same year, I celebrated my twenty-fifth anniversary with the company [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.], they used to have, I don't know if they still have it, they had a quarter of a century club, which a very, which was a very rarefied group, because not too many people spent twenty-five years anywhere.  But the company encouraged it at the time when I started there, you know it was a, a badge of pride and, and accomplishment.  To be a part of the quarter of the century club, and there weren't that many people of color involved in that or women for that matter. So it was really something to look forward to.  And so a lot of things converged that year '92 [1992], but I could see the change.  And that you know my colleagues and others you know would talk as we were involved in professional organizations and, and there was just a sign that, that it was sort of an indication that, that people of color, blacks were being, started to be marginalized you know?  And there was not gonna be a future corporate environment where people would look forward to twenty-five years.  And that turned out to becoming, becoming true, most people now are encouraged to have five year plan, if not three year plan for your career.  If you're planning a career someplace, you don't expect to be at one company for twenty-five years, you may not have a pension, you may not have a 401K.  I mean these were all, you may not have a health plan.  You may not have sick time.  These were all things that the company that I worked for, they instituted them and lots of other companies instituted them that were growing around that time.  And you didn't expect certain companies not be in existence, whoever thought RCA [RCA Corporation, New York, New York] would no longer be?  Pan Am [Pan American World Airways, Miami, Florida] would no longer be?  The company I worked for the name has changed (laughter) so there are lots of drastic things were happening that seem to have happened in a relatively short period of time.  That change, this change the compact that I thought I'd see now that children coming behind me may or probably will not see moving forward in that environment.  Good can come out of that too, kids can start thinking about other options which they do. I didn't have many options as kids coming up now have.  So they can think about starting their own business right away, right out of the gate, right out of college.  Not all of them do, 'cause I talk, I talk to kids and that some of them are still talking about getting a job for, you know for a large corporation or something.  There are fewer corporations and it; it astounds me that Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] is the largest employer.  An industry, a company that discourages union that discourages health insurance, that discourages beyond minimum wage almost, that's astounding.  So I, I don't like to be a negative person or pessimist but I'm troubled by the change and the dynamics that I expected to think that things would get better.  If you, you know decided to work for somebody whatever, if you decide to start your own business, wonderful.  But it you know among the, the range of selection choi- of choices that this, this negative change almost hostile relationship between worker and employer is, is troubling to me.
Story_ID: 296369
Speaker 1: But there's, you know, opportunities it, it certainly tests you, it tests your, your resolve and your resilience and your creative- creativity.  And I, I attribute much of the emergence of our, of our business to my husband, Allen [Roberts].  Because he started his own business at a time when he wasn't expected to start a business in the, in the industry that he did at the time.
Speaker 2: What industry did he start a business in?
Speaker 1: Executive search, there were very few exec, black owned or women owned executive search firms at the time.  And I was, I was surprised myself 'cause he started his company not too long after we got married (laughter) and I said are you sure you want to do this (laughter) but I look back now and I'm glad he did.  It was a sacrifice like anything you know you, you invest and you take a chance but he seems to have this ability to think out of the box.  And not only think out of the box, but operate out of the box, outside of the box you know that, he sees, he has, he has a great gift of seeing an opportunity and, and envisioning what the outcomes could be, the possibilities.  So it was, he was very, he's been a very encouraging to me because I, I worked for people, I never started my own company.  And so between his background and my background, we--and our interest in doing something that was gonna be meaningful and address an issue, address a problem (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the community?
Speaker 1: In the community, and utilize the, the skill base that we have.
Speaker 2: Which happens to be the Bronx [New York] and you started the Bronx Rese- River Research Group [Bronx River Research Group]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was in 2000?
Speaker 1: Yeah around that time.
Story_ID: 296370
Speaker 1: How did that come about, what's the mission of the Bronx River Research Group?
Speaker 2: Well it's, it's to provide information and to heighten awareness and public interest and to promote public awareness in the possibilities that are available in considering alternative and renewable energy technologies.  When the 2000, after the 2000 elections, it was signals that this energy bill was going to be devoted primarily to promoting the fossil fuels oil primarily coal, natural gas.  And that there was, with all the technology, technological research that the [U.S.] Department of Energy and a number of other research organizations have compiled tell us that we should start thinking about changing the direction.  Changing the paradigm here of how we're gonna address not only how we power our, our communities but the health impact of it.  The Bronx [New York] is considered one of the most polluted boroughs in the country, there's epidemics of asthma, emphysema and other respiratory related cancers that are pervasive in our community. And all of our leaders know it and many of them are doing positive things to try to address them.  And but like we know in many public policy initiative is, is generally a community influence or pressure combined with organizational initiatives that encourage change to happen.  So I mean one thing kind of let, we didn't wake one day and say it's gonna be Bronx River Research Group, we, we started, we read the paper every day.  We, we talk we, we meet with other, you know with our, with our elected leaders, you know we participate in community forums.  And, and we, we write letters to the editor, I mean so we, we continued basically some of the same routines that we, that I was doing when I worked for corporations.  And Allen's [Roberts' husband, Allen Roberts] always been an entrepreneur and so we, one thing just led to another.  We said well maybe we could formalize this, so we you know we started doing research with a variety of sources out there that, that is a lot of material, and with the Internet, you can find it. So we started to kind of put some of this information together, and we, we researched the various alternative energy systems that are out there.  The existing ones, the research that's been done in terms of the, the air quality issues that that face our community.  The lung associations, the health associations that have collected all kinds of data, and we started to kind of compile this.  And it became a fairly substantial collection of data and we were communicating it to our, our local elected officials, and various organizations that have similar interest.  There are a number of housing organizations there are a number of civic organizations and health organizations that know that we have an issue, we know that we have a challenge, we have a problem.  And how our, how our, our buildings are powered and the automobiles, trucks and buses that pass through the Bronx, they are contributors to this.  So okay we have a challenge, we have a problem, everybody knows what it is, our, our concern was we know what challenge is we know one of the problems, I mean there are others.  How can we, how can we contribute to the solution and, and the mantra that we were getting back kept leading us to changing the way we power our buildings, our power plants.  Of course our cars and our trucks and our buses too, you know, we, we were interested in the vehicle, vehicular side of it as well.  But for now, our focus is on trying to encourage at least let, letting the public become more aware that these technologies exist and not futuristic.  They are being used as we speak; they've been used as for over, over the last fifty, sixty years and we, we can't continue to have our economy depend on an oil, primarily oil based driven.  And I think in, in every paper almost you pick up today there's gonna be something about that.  Now, you know we're in Iraq so we it's in the forefront of our minds.
Story_ID: 296371
Speaker 1: So the conversation is starting to change and we, we're seeing it from some of the work we've been doing, we collaborate with other organizations and our elected leaders and the various governmental agencies and some of the local organizations produced a conference last year at Bronx Community College [New York, New York], which focused on various types of renewable alternative energy technology systems that are available, and we coordinate by bringing in guest speakers who are experts in these various fields.  And last year it was it was primarily focused on an audience of architects and engineers.  Because if, on, on the way that our buildings are powered has a lot to do with whose building them and whose refitting them.  And architects and engineers play a critical role in that, in those decisions obviously developers and contractors too.  But they have a major influence on how a building is gonna be powered and what kind of system should be used.  And they can encourage the developer to consider a particular kind of, of energy system.  And there are a lot of what they call green architects and engineers out there and you know there are a number of organizations that are promoting this, this is not new.  But in our community it is relatively new, because as we encounter folks who are, there a number of housing organizations who are building, building new housing, affordable housing in our communities.  You know they're saying if I'd only known, we would've pursued a microturbine or a combination of, of microturbine solar technology that would not be polluting and if there is another blackout, it won't go dark.  So it's a, it's a dual- multi benefit that the builder can attain from incorporating these kind.  And we understand that change is not easy you know these are long time relations, this is dependable and technology that's been out there and its good technology.  It's just that the next phase of the technology will be different, it will be--it will be new.  Just like the, the energy systems that we come to depend on, they were new when they first started.  We were all burning coal the turn of the century; I remember (laughter) vaguely.  So we're excited about prospects of making a positive contribution to, to this effort and hopefully cleaning up our, our communities environmentally.  And helping our, our families who are suffering from these conditions and hopefully we can try to help eradicate or minimize the impact moving forward.
Speaker 2: And you're starting to do that but 'cause you've gone from analyzing with the Bronx River Research Group to actually implementing some of this technology with the Clean Energy Systems for New York.
Speaker 1: And you're right, and we've seen the results.  We have another conference, perhaps you can even attend, in September. It's at another college in, in the Bronx [New York].  And this one will focus on multi-residential developers building managers, management firms also architects and engineers.  But other superintendents, people who are involved in the hands-on maintenance and, and building and, and retrofitting.  The, the building managers and developers are very critical and the owners.   We've encountered the architects and engineers at the first conference; they're invited back to this conference too.  It al- it also provides, and it's a, it's a, it's an American Institute of Architects approved course; it's become a course for them.  So they, they can get education units by attending, so it's another incentive for them to participate, which was good.  But the last year was the largest conference of, of its kind to have been held, we attracted nearly three hundred people.  So we anticipate a similar showing this year as well, so we, you know we taking great pride in seeing some progress.
Story_ID: 296372
Speaker 1: And we're, we're exploring a business enterprise that would, Bronx River Research Group is a business enterprise.  It's a not for profit business enterprise but a for profit enterprise that will collaborate in possibly developing a demonstration facility.  That will showcase alternate- an alternative energy system as well as having a training facility associated with it.  That will train, say kids from students from the local community college or the local technical colleges that emphasize that have on their curriculum architecture, engineering and other related fields.  And we can, we can employ some of those students to maintain to learn about maintaining these particular systems.  So even if you're coming out of a junior college, we can train them to these new technological energy systems.  So that's one of the things we're trying to put together as a demonstration. It'll have hopefully a training facility in it, in addition to I guess a--for, a place where we can host forums.  So that people can come and touch and feel and see, see the, the product or see the--
Speaker 2: How close are you to having that happen?
Speaker 1: It's still in the, still in the developmental plan stage; we're putting the, the pieces of the plan together before we you know start to try to get the financing for it.  And all the other components, we have, we have a potential site for it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the Bronx [New York]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So we're you know we're at that stage now putting the plan together to, to tell us what all the components on all the things we'll have to do to make it a reality.
Story_ID: 296373
Speaker 1: So you've had an opportunity to work in various aspects of the black community.  You, fashion you know early on and then insurance and business well with Philip Morris [Philip Morris USA; Altria Group, Inc.] in the corporate world for a very long time, and now sort of an environmental research area.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What as we move forward, what are your hopes for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well certainly that the emphases be placed on education that the kids turn off the TV and get back to the books and learn the language.  Learn math, learn the sciences, learn history, I mean knowledge is still power.  I don't hear that enough and just to enjoy learning to make it a lifelong endeavor.  That's, that's what I would like to see moving forward, 'cause I think it's, it's imperative.
Speaker 1: What would you like for us to eradicate from the African American community moving forward, what do you think is most detrimental to us being a great community?
Speaker 2: Well there, there a lot of deficits that I think across the board, not only our communities, I mean I would like to certainly see our community void of, of kids who don't have education.  Who don't drop out of, of school even if it's, I mean every kid may not go to college for four years for an academic diploma.  I would like to see there be no kid out there who doesn't know a skill of some sort, there's a def- there's a deficit there.  And there, there are careers that I think that are going un- unfilled because maybe the kids feel like every kid is not gonna go to a four-year college for a, a profession like law, law a lawyer or doctor or whatever.  But there I think I would just like to see a, a broader range of exposures to young people, so that they don't feel buttonholed in any particular area.  Just, just remain curious to, to and certainly poverty and the health problems to me they're all related.  Education and, and the other things and the acquisition of wealth and power, if you will, it's related to how far you can educate yourself.  Even if it's not formal--
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) People edu- my father [Albert Singho] was not a formally educated man but I considered him one of the smartest men that I, perhaps people that I've known.  He's a wonderfully enterprising man and, so I mean if he was, if he was formally educated my, my how, my heavens, what his accomplishments might've been.
Story_ID: 296374
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Gosh I nev- I never think about it.  I guess, I, I certainly never wanna do a--do harm (laughter). I don't want to be viewed as somebody who came around here to harm people.  And you know there's some trite things you know about leaving things better than you found them.  But I just you know like to see, I would like to feel that, that I you know that I really tried to make my parents [Harriet Franklin Singho and Albert Singho] proud of me.  I mean there, in a very fundamental way you know to not to have done anything to, to besmirch them or their--or our family reputation with whatever.  And I, I hope I tried to do that, but have some fun and to encourage other people to have, have fun and that to just--
