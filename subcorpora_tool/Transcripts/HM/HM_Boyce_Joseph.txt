Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Joseph Franklin Nelson Boyce, J-O-S-E-P-H, F-R-A-N-K-L-I-N, N-E-L-S-O-N B-O-Y-C-E.
Speaker 1: Now there's a story behind your name.  I know 'cause heard it earlier, so tell us?
Speaker 2: Well I'm named after my grandfather.  His name was Joseph Franklin Nelson, and he was born in North Carolina.  And he ran away from home when he was thirteen and hoboed his way around the country and jumped off the train at one point in Champaign, Illinois and was walking around the city and went by the high school and saw a very beautiful young lady that he decided he wanted to meet.  And so he got a young student to introduce him, and they fell in love.  Her mother worked for a prominent judge in Champaign.  And when her mother found out about this romance, she appealed to the judge to help her because she did not approve of her daughter going out with this stranger.  And so the judge spoke to the lady who was to become my grandmother.  And Stella [Estelle] Anderson was her name--and said that if she would stop seeing this Joe Nelson fellow that he would pay her way through the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Illinois].  She was a straight A student.  And she said: "Thank you very much; but I love him and I'm gonna continue to see him."  They did get married.  He was employed as a drayman, which meant that he was driving a wagon--horse and wagon, delivering furniture for a furniture company.  And when he got off in the evening, they would sit in the kitchen table--by the kitchen table with the kerosene lamp, and she would teach him arithmetic and help him read because he only had a third-grade education.  He eventually opened up his own store and became very popular and began buying up property and ultimately became the wealthiest black person in the whole Champaign-Urbana area.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna stop you right there, and we're gonna pick that back up with the--with the answers.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there's more story that I have--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --just as an introduction.  So that's who you're named after?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The--a teenage--I mean, he started off as a teenage hobo and became the richest man in Champaign?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Richest black man.
Speaker 1: Right (unclear).  So and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on April 18, 1937.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm retired right now.  But when I retired, I was a senior editor at the "Wall Street Journal."  I'm a journalist.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: And, and a musician (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  Now, okay, before we--oh, what, what is today's date?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 12th of December, 2012.
Speaker 1: Twelve, Twelve, Twelve.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at my apartment in Atlanta, in Atlantic Station area of Atlanta in Georgia.
Story_ID: 56710
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now before we go into depth, which we've already gotten into depth (unclear) (laughter), we're supposed to ask these five questions--
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: --that only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Lightweight questions--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --as a kind of warm-up.  First one is, do you have a favorite color and what is it?
Speaker 2: Green is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: That's true.  All right, and do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I have several (laughter).  I, I like fried chicken and I like steak, even though it's not good for me.  And I have sweet tooth; I like pastry.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: June.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: It's, it's a place where I lived, but I also like to go there, it's New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Can we come back to that one (laughter)?  Okay.
Story_ID: 56711
Speaker 1: All right, well in the in--interim, we're gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: About your mother's [Sadie Nelson] side of the family and your father's [John Boyce] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Try to keep them separate and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Well there's not much to say about my father's side.  I, I never knew him well.
Speaker 1: Okay, well we're gonna ask anyway so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, but your mother--can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name was Sadie Ruth Nelson; that was her maiden name, S-A-D-I-E R-U-T-H N-E-L-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was June the 1st, 1903, in Champaign, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we just had a taste of some of that family history, but what do you know about your mother's side of the family, and how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know much.  I, I understand that my father--my grandfather [Joseph Nelson] was born in a tobacco field in, in South Carolina.  There's--either his mother or grandmother was full-blooded Cherokee, so there's--
Speaker 1: South, south, South Carolina or North--
Speaker 2: North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: North Carolina.  I'm sorry if I said south.  Full-blooded Cherokee, so we have some of that.  I really don't know that much about his side of the family.  I don't think he ever talked much about it.
Story_ID: 56712
Speaker 1: Is there a story about why he [Joseph Nelson] left.  I mean--I mean, I guess we could surmise it was bad that he left, but is there a story about it?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  I, I think he just probably wanted to get away, as so many blacks did, from segregation.  And that existed in, in the South at that time.
Speaker 1: And so he kinda took a, a common but dangerous route, being a hobo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you know, he was a, a very creative, inventive individual.  He--very little stopped him.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that come down about his family at all in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: No, about--'bout--'about him, though, he was--I mean, he was a fairly--a very, very honest person but a very, very tough cookie.  His doctor told him that he needed his tonsils out.  And he didn't want the doctor to do it, so he went and cauterized it himself.  His doctor diagnosed him with diabetes.  And, and when he got the diagnosis, he came home and told my step-grandmother that "Nellie I love your cakes and pies; keep on baking 'em."  And so he died from diabetes complications, but he was--he was a very determined guy--very strong-willed person.
Speaker 1: What kind of walks you would have?  Now, you, you said that he--when he met your, your grandmother--and now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Estelle Nelson--I mean, sorry--Estelle Anderson; that was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: And she was an A student.
Speaker 2: At, at the high school in Champaign.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--oh, well--it--well--(unclear)--what's her side of the family (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It's the Anderson side.  And she had sisters, my Aunt Clara, my Great Aunt Clara, and my Great Aunt Eunice.  But my, my grandmother died when my mother was eight years old, and so my grandfather married again twice.  And, and the second wife passed away, but the third wife, who I knew as my grandmother, Nellie outlived him.  And so I, I always referred to her as Momma Nellie.  And she came from Mississippi.  She moved from Mississippi with a white family that she had worked for in Mississippi from the time she was fourteen.  And she moved with them; and she worked in their house in Champaign as a domestic, but they treated her like part of the family.  And after she married my grandfather, she was probably wealthier than they were, but she continued to work for them because they had such a close tie.  I remember as a kid my grandmother going to work--which she didn't have to work--for this family.  And almost assuredly, she was wealthier than they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, because of her son-in-law's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --wealth.
Story_ID: 56713
Speaker 1: Now my--now my--
Speaker 2: Now this--okay--
Speaker 1: Oh, I was just gonna say, my, my, my mother [Sadie Nelson] had siblings.  She had a brother, Leslie, who, when he became an adult, left and moved to Montana I believe, or Wyoming, and became a pilot and really wasn't heard from much again. Because I think he--he was very light; I think he passed over and, and passed for white.  She had a brother, Cecil, who joined--put up his age and joined the Army when he was sixteen where he became a buffalo soldier, fought in World War I, came home with the Croix de guerre, and was the most decorated World War I veteran in Champaign-Urbana County.  She had another brother, Wendell.  And Wendell became a mathematics instructor and taught school in St. Louis [Missouri].  My mother got scholarships and worked her way through the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] and became one of the few black women in the 1920s to get a master's degree from the University of Illinois.
Story_ID: 56714
Speaker 1: Okay, now I gotta go back a little bit to the great grandfather side--the great grandfather story.  So your great grandfather--
Speaker 2: No, that's my grandfather [Joseph Nelson] we're talking about.
Speaker 1: Oh, your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --grandfather who, who was actually--okay, your grandfather was taught by--
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Estelle Anderson].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Estelle Anderson, right?
Speaker 2: Right, Estelle Anderson.
Speaker 1: She--you know, she, she brought him up from a third-grade educational level to--
Speaker 2: To where he could, you know, operate the store without any problems by himself.  So obviously he could do bookkeeping and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And certainly read enough to, you know, read invoices and orders and everything else. I mean, he, he was a bright man, he just didn't have a lot of formal education to begin with.
Speaker 1: So what kind of bit--bit--business was he engaged in?
Speaker 2: It was a grocery store.
Speaker 1: Grocery store?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And when I was a child, it was still--he had a very big house, and the grocery store was part of that.  And he owned the house behind him, and he owned the house on the same street next to him, among other properties throughout Champaign-Urbana [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So grocery store, real estate.
Speaker 2: Real estate, that's basically it.
Speaker 1: And, okay.
Speaker 2: He was basically in, in, in merchandise and real estate.
Speaker 1: So what was the net--is the name of the store--
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't--I don't know, I don't know.  When I was a child, it was--it was closed.  It was almost left like it was when he died.  And it became sort of a storage space, but--
Speaker 1: Was this like a typical general store you see--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, sort of like that.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, he got a reputation for honesty; they used to call him "Honest Joe Nelson"; that was his nickname.
Story_ID: 56715
Speaker 1: Okay, now there's a story back in the Depression that you told me before.  Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the story goes that during the Depression, the bank that my grandfather [Joseph Nelson] dealt with--one of the bank officers wanted meet with him at his house--at my grandfather's house.  And he came to my grandfather's house that evening and told my grandfather that the Ford dealership in Champaign was about to go under, which sort of would have been disastrous back then because the automotive dealerships were all American back then.  And they were like the pillars of the financial community in these towns.  But it was about to go under, and the bank didn't have the money to loan them to stay afloat.  And--but my grandfather had the money in his account, and he wondered would my grandfather lend them the money.  And so my grandfather said, yes he would.  And the bank executive thanked him and got up to leave, and when he got to the door, he turned around and looked at my grandfather and said, "Mr. Nelson, could we please just keep this between us.  It wouldn't do for the community to know that a Negro loaned the Ford dealership money to stay in business."
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.  That would ruin society (laughter).  Any more stories about, about him?
Speaker 2: He was a--he was an honorary deputy sheriff, which I, I don't think it ever happened to a person of color there in Champaign at that time.  He was a funny guy.  He, he, he, he didn't believe that women needed an education above high school, so he refused to give my mother [Sadie Nelson] any money towards her education.  But her brother helped her out, Wendell.  And she worked, and she had scholarships.  And so when she graduated, my grandfather attended the graduation and took full credit for (laughter) his, his daughter's success in college.  But my mother adored him, so she just went along with it.
Story_ID: 56716
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now is there a stor--this--I'm intrigued by your mother's brother or the uncle that--you know, won the Croix de Guerre in France.
Speaker 2: Cecil [Cecil Nelson].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cecil.  Is there a story associated with what he did do when he went in?
Speaker 2: Well he was with a unit, and I think maybe the entire unit won the Croix de Guerre.  And I can't remember the name of the unit.  But he, he was a, a tough cookie.  And one of his good friends from the area was killed over in France.  And he had--this guy had a sister, and he would tell my uncle about his sister.  And so when my uncle came back from overseas, he went to this small town where this woman lived.  Her name was Carrie, Carrie Ernest I believe.  And he, he, he went to this small town because he had some personal items I think that he wanted to give her and tell her that her brother always talked about her.  Anyway, they met and fell in love, and they got married and stayed married.  My uncle Cecil was very active in the American Legion and became the first person of color to be a national officer for the Illinois American Legion.
Speaker 1: Okay, wow.
Speaker 2: He was elected Sergeant of Arms for the--for the state.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 56717
Speaker 1: Well that's quite a story too, so.  So anymore stories about your mother's relatives or ancestors or?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean, you know, we could go on and on with that.  My, my grandfather, when he married the third time, he had two more children, Leonard and Frances.  They both went to the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign].  Leonard became a college professor.  Frances married my--but Charles McGee, who was a Tuskegee Airman and who went on to earn the record for more combat missions flown in the history of the Air Force in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam combined, he retired as a colonel--full colonel from the Air Force and is now ninety two years old and still active.  He was a technical consultant on the film "Red Tails."
Speaker 1: Ninety--ninety years old--
Speaker 2: He's ninety two.
Speaker 1: Ninety-two years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--his, his daughter--he had--they had a son and two daughters.  The son is a law professor.  One daughter became--she got a PhD and became dean--associate dean of the medical school at the University of Ohio Athens [Ohio].  And another daughter became a television editor and won three Emmys for her work and also started her own scuba diving training business.  And their kids--among their children is a son-in-law, Michael Strautmanis, is with the Obama Administration.  I'm tryin' to think of who else.  All, all their kids seem to be, you know, successful.  So there's lawyers and, and it goes on and on.  Oh, I'm sorry, I made a mistake.  The lawyer--the law professor is their grandson.  Their son--my uncle Charles' son is also a pilot, and he retired as a full captain with Northwest Airlines.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ronald McGee.  And he was in the Air Force as well.  And he flew, yeah, during the Vietnam War.
Story_ID: 56718
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now your mother, she went to school in Champaign [Illinois]?  She grew up in Champaign?
Speaker 2: Yes, and she went to the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] and then she went South to teach.  So she taught at Prairie View [Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas]; she taught in Mississippi; she taught at--she taught a New Orleans [Louisiana] at Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  At one time, she was a head of the English department at Xavier.
Story_ID: 56719
Speaker 1: She [Boyce's mother, Sadie Nelson] met my father [John Boyce] at Prairie View [Praire View A&M University, Praire View, Texas].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was an Episcopal priest.  And he was from Barbados [Antilles] and educated in Panama.  And he was the Reverend John B. Boyce.  I never got to know him well.  My mother [Sadie Nelson] and father separated when I was three months old.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, now, well let's go to your father's side then.  So his name is John B. Boy--
Speaker 1: Boyce.
Speaker 2: Boyce, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's about the extent of what I know about his family period, that they were from Barbados.  We didn't have a close relationship.
Speaker 2: Now were they still in Bar--did, did his family stay in Barbados?  Was he the only person--
Speaker 1: Some of them moved to New York [New York], and he eventually moved to New York.  He and my mother lived in New Orleans [Louisiana].  He was a parish priest in New Orleans, and that's where I was born.  And then three months later, my mother moved my brother and I to Danville, Illinois.  She wanted to be near her family in Champaign [Illinois], but not too close.
Story_ID: 56720
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And things were tough back then.  I mean, we, we lived in a rooming house.  We had one room in the--in the rooming house.  It was three families, and we shared one bathroom and one kitchen.
Speaker 1: Okay, well those were the days when a lot of people were in that situation.
Speaker 2: Right, right, well my mother [Sadie Nelson] couldn't get a job because, even though her specialty--her area of expertise was education.  There was only one out of eighteen grammar schools in Danville--only one hired black teachers.  And somebody had to die or retire before there was an opening.  The principal of that school had two years of college.  My mother had a master's degree and had been accepted for doctoral work at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and she couldn't get a job.  And so she became a social worker.  And eventually we moved out of the one room, and she bought that house that we were in.  And so I ended up growing up in that house.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, in Danville.
Speaker 1: In Danville--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I didn't move to Chicago--we didn't move to Chicago until I was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was a social worker in Danville, Illinois?
Speaker 2: Yes, and then--and then in Chicago later.
Speaker 1: Okay, you moved to Chicago when you were (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Fifteen.
Story_ID: 56721
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so--but back to your father for a minute.  I just had to ask, so he didn't--there's no relationship between them after that where he contacted--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I would visit him.  We would visit him every once in a while.  He moved to New York [New York], and we would go to New York.  Maybe we went to New York twice when he was alive.  And he would come to Champaign [Illinois] on occasion.  So I saw him maybe a handful of times, but he didn't care for me very much, and he didn't try to hide it.  And I think maybe he blamed me for their split, even though I was a baby.  So I, I could never--I could never figure it out, and after a while, I stopped trying.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And he died in 1954.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a long time ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was he a priest in New York?
Speaker 2: He was a priest in New York, yeah.  He was the rike--Riker's Island [New York City, New York] prisoner chap--prison chaplain, and he was Episcopal.  And he was also with St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Harlem [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did, did you have any idea where he went to school or anything?
Speaker 2: I know he went to school in Panama.  I know he was accepted for his doctoral program at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] too.  And he told my mother that there was only room for one doctor's degree, and it was gonna be his.  So, she didn't go and he went, but he didn't finish.  She would have finished.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) true stories kinda ruin male (laughter) bigotry.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that was kind of the way things were done.  And you know, it wasn't that he was a bad person.  I think he just grew up in a society--I mean, I remember her telling me when they first started dating that she felt that he kept running away from her when they were walking.  And she caught up with him and said, "Why do you keep walking away from me?"  And he said, "Well the woman is supposed to walk ten paces behind the man."  That's what he was brought up to believe, that a woman's supposed to walk ten paces behind the man, even though they're supposed to be together.  And she basically said, not this woman; you got another thing coming.  And that was the end of that.
Speaker 1: Well he was raised in Barbados, 'cause I've never seen that happen here, so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, in, in other countries, they, they do have--
Speaker 1: That seems like a Muslim kinda stuff too, rather than a Christian, you know?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  He was more British than the British.  So he was definitely--definitely an Anglican.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you know--I, I think that we were talking before we started, and I mentioned some--somebody you associated with in the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association]--was he associated with that at all?
Speaker 2: With the what?
Speaker 1: the UNIA--the--
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of, no.  No, I--he wasn't very political at all?
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: As far as I know.
Speaker 1: He was a chaplain and an Episcopal priest?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 56722
Speaker 1: Okay, so after '38 [1938], after you--around--was it around 1940 or so that your mother [Sadie Nelson] moved to Danville [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) it must have been right at '37 [1937] 'cause I was--I was only three months old, so it was the late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I grew up in Danville until I was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to Danville High School [Danville, Illinois].  And I went to Franklin Grade School [Danville, Illinois], during, during which time--for most of that time I was the only black student in the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--but I had to work because we never had much money.  So I've been--I've been working since I was nine years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had the, the regular paper route after school, and then I got two.  And then I had a paper route in the morning before I went to school.  So for a while I had three paper routes.  And then I started a lawn cuttin' business.  And when I was fourteen, my mother had a stroke.  And so my brother and I went to work full time in the summer.  And I got a job washing dishes for fourteen dollars a week, forty hours a week.  And I franchised out my paper routes and my lawn cutting business.  And my brother was sixteen, and he got a job digging graves by hand for thirty dollars a week for forty hours.  And that's how we survived my mother being sick from the stroke.
Story_ID: 56723
Speaker 1: All right, now we always ask this question, and I know probably what the answer is already.  But when you consider your parents' personalities and talents, their dispositions, their looks, the way they walk, talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, undoubtedly, my mother [Sadie Nelson].  My mother is, is, is the most impressive--she's the most interesting--she's--she--she is--that I've ever met--person I've ever met.  She is definitely my hero.  I mean, she had a--she had it all--brains, grit, determination, love, humor.  She, she was--yeah, she was just about the end all be all for me.
Story_ID: 56724
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now, now you've got a brother, right?  You mentioned him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's, he's deceased, Robert [Robert Boyce].
Speaker 1: And he's, he's younger than you?
Speaker 2: No, he's older.
Speaker 1: Older, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--he was a couple of years older.  Actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he, he was my--my mother [Sadie Nelson] adopted him before I, I was born, but we grew up as brothers.  And, and we couldn't be any, any more brothers than if we shared the same blood and everything else.  He was just a wonderful guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right, and wha--wha--what did--what did he go on to do?
Speaker 2: He was in the military.  At first he was in the Navy Reserve; and then he joined the Army; and then he was in the Air Force; and then he just held a, a number of different jobs in security.  He was an operator in a photo duplicating studio.  He, he just did a number of jobs.  He--you know, he--career wasn't that important to him.  He, he liked to make things and, and to be sort of free and do his own thing, and as long as he made enough money to, to live and get by and take care of his family he was happy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the family growing up was: you and your mother and your brother--
Speaker 2: My brother.
Speaker 1: Your brother.
Speaker 2: Just the three of us.
Story_ID: 56725
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did your mother [Sadie Nelson] ever consider going back to Champaign [Illinois] since her [Joseph Nelson] father was the richest man in Cham--
Speaker 2: No, he had died.  He died two years before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No, she never--she didn't wanna get too close to--my mother was a--my mother was as stubborn and determined as my grandfather.  And, and Champaign would have been too many people tryin' to tell her what she should do with her sons--what she should do with her life, and respectfully she didn't wanna hear that.  And so she, she wanted to be close, but she wanted to keep a respectful distance.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there, there any particular rift with her and the rest of the family?
Speaker 2: No, no, um-hmm.  No, they all got along, and--but she just--they just knew Sadie was independent; and you just did not wanna mess with Sadie.
Story_ID: 56726
Speaker 1: Okay, and in terms of your father--your grandfather's [Joseph Nelson] wealth and all of that--now I've heard lots of stories of people that are prom--prom--prominent at one time, then they--when they pass away there's no con--contingency plan for how it's gonna go on without 'em.  And it's--was that the case with your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about that.  I know my mother [Sadie Nelson] got a couple of houses, and, and she sold those to make ends meet as we were going.  And it was good for a little while.  And then there was other property around that eventually got sold off.  He certainly left my grandmother enough to keep her comfortable for the rest of her life.  And, and the kids, I think, you know, each of them got, you know, something--you know, pieces of property and stuff like that.  But, you know, we're talking about a time when $2,000 dollars was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I just wondered what, what had happened--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when he passed, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I mean, nobody--nobody ended up poor.  I mean, they all--they all were able to, you know, do what they wanted and accomplish their dreams.  And they all were able--if they wanted to buy a house they could buy a house and things like that.  Yeah, so there's no great, you know, legacy of, of, of wealth (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your mother, like, use some of the--I guess the residual wealth of your grandfather--
Speaker 2: To pay bills.
Speaker 1: --to buy the house in Danville [Illinois], or?
Speaker 2: She might have, you know, but I know we had a mortgage.  It was a small one but, I mean, that was when--you know, if, if you made--if you were a professional and you were making a $100 dollars a week you were making a lot of money.  Yeah, and I remember the north end of downtown in Danville was where a lot of the wealthy people lived.  And everybody was talking about this new house this fellow built, and it was a huge ranch-type house, beautiful.  It cost $25,000 dollars.  You know, what could you buy for $25,000 dollars today in a house, you know?  But that was the way things were; it's all relative.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, the money was a lot different then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56727
Speaker 1: So, well we ask this question: can you describe the house you grew up in, and what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--it was a, a frame house; it had a brick porch.  There was a living room on the first floor, a dining room, a bedroom, a hallway that--and off the hallway was a kitchen and a bathroom.  That was the only bathroom in the house.  And upstairs there was kind of a loft area and a bedroom and then a very small bedroom that was intended to be a large bathroom but turned into a bedroom; and then it had a back porch and had a basement.  And we always had dogs usually--a dog or two.  And at, at, at one period of time we had horses; and another period we had chickens; another time we had rabbits.  You know, that's small town Illinois; people kept animals; they, they ate 'em.  We ate all the chickens and we ate all the rabbits.
Speaker 1: Oh--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know, eventually ended up--you know, and you could--you could have a garden.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) pretty big lot.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It wasn't really hard.  We had a barn.  And what we did was we, we built a stall in the barn for the horses.  But people did that; they kept animals on their property back then.  It wasn't any zoning regulation that you, you couldn't do that.
Speaker 1: Now did you use the horses for, for--
Speaker 2: Oh, I rode 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We rode 'em, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you could ride around town?
Speaker 2: Sure, ride right down the street, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there was other--there are other horses in the neighborhood too.  I mean, it wasn't just--I mean, it was a different time.  You know, people weren't--we, we had BB guns and, and I mean, I got my first rifle when I was 10 years old.  You know, we--the--the--there weren't all the constraints that there are today.  Somebody told my mother that when I got my rifle you'd better--you'd better give him a, a shooting lesson, and my mother gave me the most commonsense shooting lesson that I ever got in my life.  She said before you pull that trigger, think about what you'll hit if you miss.  That was--that summed it all up.  But that was the way she was.  She was a no-nonsense person of few words, but you'd better listen 'cause they made sense.  But we grew up like that.  We used to have rock fights and--you know kids (laughter), we--we're always outside playing.  If you were in the house, it was 'cause you were sick or you were being punished.  We didn't have Little League; we just put together a team from kids in the neighborhood.  And so football season, we played football; baseball, we played baseball, you know.  It was constantly outside, constantly playin' and/or fighting.  You know, everybody had to test themselves up and down the street, you know.  And so you, you grew up, and if, you know, you got cut or you got hurt you didn't run home and cry and carried on; I mean, gee whiz, you know.  And you rode bicycles; nobody said anything about a helmet or any of that stuff.  I'm not sayin' that was necessarily a good thing.  That was just the way it was and, you know, we survived.  But you did see kids back then who lived on farms, and sometimes they, you know, had an arm off or hand 'cause they were caught in a farm accident or something like that; I mean, there was danger out there.
Story_ID: 56728
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear) wasn't out there, but, but I know what you're talking about.  It's a different way of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a different way, but--I mean, you know, you learn to--you know, they have AD--what ADHD now or whatever; that, that, that was called fidgeting.  Calm down; that's how you cured it.  You didn't take medicine. You didn't go to a psychiatrist.  Your teacher said calm down, and you calmed down; that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you never had a case of a kid that was-- just couldn't be controlled in a classroom or, or?
Speaker 2: Well I, I think everybody had those problems, but they, they usually had special classes for those, those kids.  But I don't think anybody ever really went bonkers.  I mean, some of the stuff that goes on now is absolutely unheard of then.  I mean, you just didn't do it.  You know, it was--it was crazy.  I mean, even the kids that were kind of wild knew their limits.
Speaker 1: Now did you live on what would be considered the black side of town, or was there--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --any such thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a black side of town.  Actually, there were two: the east end or the--part of that was the bottoms.  There used to be a creek that ran through Danville [Illinois].  There still is--called Stony Creek.  And over, over the centuries, you know, there was kinda like a valley, and that was in the eastern side of town.  And a lot of black people lived in the east end.  And then other black people moved to the northern part of town, and that was called the north end.  And then we didn't live in either one of those places.  We lived on a street that was mostly all white at the time.  And there were--there was one other--there were two other black families down the street from us, Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, who were very, very old.  And then--I'm trying to remember the last name; I think it was Hall.  And there was a black family, and their son was a friend of mine.  But they didn't live there very long; they moved.  And that arrangement, living in that neighborhood, brought its own set of interesting problems because a lot of people--some people didn't want us there, and other people were very friendly.
Speaker 1: What was that--what was the eth--ethnic makeup of the white pop--population?  Was it--or could you tell or did it even matter then?
Speaker 2: Well then there was no--people weren't--you know, in small towns like that people weren't worry about ethnic makeup.  It was you're white or you're black.  There wasn't any Hispanic population.  There wasn't any Asian population to speak of.  Now when I moved to Chicago [Illinois], that's when I discovered all these different ethnicities where, you know, it, it really counted if you were Serb or Croatian or Italian or German.  In, in Danville, you were white or you were black (laughter).  And they didn't say black; they said colored or Negro.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And, and so some of the people were, you know, very, very nice, and other people didn't want anything to do with you.  And, of course, the "N" word was tossed around, you know, with frequency, but I wouldn't stand for it; I was taught not to stand for it.  So I ended up pretty much beating up everybody in my neighborhood over that.  And then we became friends and went out and played, once they realized what the rules were.
Story_ID: 56729
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now was school integrated?  I guess they had--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you, you--it was neighborhoods.  So if you were black, but you lived in a neighborhood like I did, you still went to the school in your neighborhood.  Now a lot of the kids in the east end went to an all-black school called Jackson school.  That's the one where my mother wanted to teach.  I went to Franklin [Grade School, Danville, Illinois].  And like I said, Floyd--we used to call him Flute (ph.), was my friend from down the street.  And he and I were together from I think the first through the third grade or something like that, and then his family moved.  And so after that, I was the only black kid in the grammar school for most of that time--never got invited to any parties--never included in any of their activities, and that was okay; I worked after school un--until around the sixth grade.  A girl who was a cousin of a girl in my class moved from Detroit [Michigan], and she had a birthday party.  And it was the first time I was ever invited to any of their functions.  And the theme of the birthday party was like a quiz show.  And the mother of the--of, of this, this girl--because in Detroit they didn't--they didn't make those distinctions like they did in little Danville about black and white like--you know, not like they did there.  The mother said, "Who wants to be the master of ceremonies?"  Nobody put up their hand.  I put up my hand, and so I became master of ceremonies.  I told jokes.  And these kids had never seen me like this before.  It was a side of me they had never seen.  And I was basically the life of the party.  And, and, and after that, I, I was a patrol boy; I was elected captain of patrol boys; I was elected to the student council; I was elected president of the student council; I was elected president of the science club; I was elected most popular boy in the class.  All of those things happened, as a result of them seeing that, geez whiz, you know, this, this guy, you know, is not so bad.  And all those things happened in the seventh and eighth grade whereas before I was never invited to anything.  Now when we went to high school, those same kids that I'd gone to school eight years with, when they would be with their friends in high school--their white friends, many of them would act like they didn't know me when they would see me; so it's the same old, same old.
Story_ID: 56730
Speaker 1: The dynamics of race in America, so.  Okay, so--all right, so now what--so, so most of your social interaction up until this point took place I guess in a--in a home.  You and your brother--
Speaker 2: Well I mean, I had black friends in the community [Danville, Illinois] too, in the east end and, and the north end.  But the problem was that because of where I lived, some of the black people were hostile.  You know, like I remember one guy who, who later became a very good friend of mine, you know, call me--the first time I ever heard the term Uncle Tom, he called me an Uncle Tom.  I didn't even know what it meant.  I asked him, well what, what are you talking about?  And he said you living up there with all those white people, and I said yeah; I mean, that's just where I live, you know.  And even though I was carrying my newspaper route in his neighborhood every day, but because I lived in a white neighborhood, you know, he was--he was running that game.  So there were some people like that.  He and I became very, very good friends later on, but you had that sort of provincial kind of thinking among both whites and blacks.  It still exists in the Midwest.  They, they spend hours thinking about stuff that people in New York [New York] don't even give seconds to, you know, nonsense.  But, no, I mean, I had--I had a lot of black friends, and, and, and later on when I started playing jazz, then I was totally accepted in the community; you know, this was a whole different thing.
Story_ID: 56731
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about being a newsboy, 'cause you, you mentioned that.  And you act like--you had like--you had three routes at one time?
Speaker 2: Well I started out helping my brother on, on his paper route, and then I took his paper route over.  And there was another paper route that was bigger that came open next to it, and so I took it.  And then I found out that there was a paper route that was open in the morning carrying the Chicago [Illinois] papers.  It, it was the "Chicago Daily News," the "Journal of Commerce," and the "Wall Street Journal."  So I would get up in the morning before school, and I'd carry that route, and then after school, I'd go carry my other two routes.  And at that time, you, you had to collect yourself; you collected the money.  And I remember it was amazing the, the excuses--the paper was thirty cents a week for most of the time; then it came--went up to thirty five.  But the excuses that people used that they couldn't pay you-thirty five cents was, was, was amazing.  I mean, it was an experience.  I did that for about six years, carried papers.  And then I got a lawn cuttin' business.  But I couldn't afford a, a power mower, so I had a push mower by hand.  And so I'd, I'd cut grass with a push mower--good exercise.
Story_ID: 56732
Speaker 1: Now back to the newspaper business.  So since you became a journalist, I just wondered, like, what did you notice about that business, or did you--I mean.
Speaker 2: I had no intention ever to become a journalist.  You have to remember the time.  Black parents did not encourage their children.  Even though my mother never told me there was something I couldn't do--she never said you can't do this, you can't do that.  She always told me I could do whatever I wanted, but there were just certain things you knew you weren't gonna do.  You, you weren't gonna be a journalist; you weren't gonna be a banker; you weren't gonna be--I mean, there were so many jobs that were closed to us.  When I was a kid, if you went to downtown Chicago [Illinois], you went in the bank, the only person you would see of color in a--in the bank working there was, was the porter.  You go to Marshall Field's; you'd go to Woolworth's; you go--there were no, no black clerks.  It just didn't happen.  The only black people you saw were couriers.  They were ridin' bicycles delivering things.    You jus--it just didn't happen.  The--there weren't black bankers; there weren't black architects; there weren't--I had a, a, cousin, an older, who had a PhD in engineering.  He spent his whole life teaching other blacks to be engineers, and they weren't gonna get hired either.  The only project he did was in South America 'cause he wasn't able to do anything here in the United States.  I worked at the post office in Chicago, the main post office.  One time they help my--pay my way through college.  And you had black guys there who were pharmacists.  They had degrees and so forth.  They couldn't get jobs like you can now.  This was in the '50s [1950s].  They couldn't get jobs like you can now--didn't make any difference how talented you were, what you had to offer.  You know, and this is--this is one of the sad things about America, which is--America's a wonderful country.  But I, I wonder how much greater we could've been had we not excluded the talents and abilities and the cons--and the contributions of more than half of our population over the years, on the basis of race and gender.  We sit up there; we take pride in what we've become as a country.  The sad thing is how much greater we could've been had we not systematically excluded more than half the population and their contribution, because of their color or their, their sex.
Story_ID: 56733
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you--were you aware at all of any of the black papers when you were--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, "Chicago Defender" and, and so forth.  But, I mean, they could only hire so many.  "Ebony" could only hire so many.  And they didn't pay very much.  And so--
Speaker 1: I was thinking, though, you, you--you're in a unique position to even know the names of all these papers.  I mean, you're seein' 'em come--you know, coming in and out and--I mean, I don't know.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well they had "Muhammad Speaks."  A good friend of mine worked for "Muhammad Speaks," Billy Quinn.  Dick--
Speaker 1: Durham.
Speaker 2: Durham, yeah; Dick was there.  I mean, they had good people--Louie Martin at, at, the "Defender."  Lou Palmer started at the "Defender"--Betty Washington.  You had some good journalists there.  And I mean, they really, really took chances back then, 'cause a lot of the things they reported on were dangerous to report on.  But the white media didn't consider them, you know, to be significant.  When I started--when I--when I went into the city room from the Neighborhood News with the "Chicago Tribune," the city editor called me in his office and said, "Look, I know you're coming in here as a general assignment reporter, but I'm gonna put you on the copy desk for two weeks just for the people in the room to get use to your presence."  That's the way things were then.  You had no human resources; they didn't call it that.  You had no political correctness; you had no affirmative action.  You had to be smart.
Speaker 1: Now, now I was just thinking for a minute.  At age nine or ten, as a kid, you know, delivering papers, I'm just thinking, like, what your impression of the papers actually were, 'cause you're seeing 'em everyday all these different papers--
Speaker 2: They were a commodity that I just rolled up and threw on, on people's porches and made sure I tried to get, you know, in the--in the right place.  And I was just tryin' to get that done and, and do my job.  And you got to reme--realize this is the Midwest.  So just like the post office, you know, through rain, snow, sleet, whatever.  And, you know, my mother would help me out sometimes.  If she could, she'd take the car and we'd--on Sundays, you know, you had the big bundles and--but, you know, I also had to watch, you know, some of the guys at the other paper carriers.  'Cause I had to, you know, impress them that they couldn't run over me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I know it--
Speaker 2: And, and--
Speaker 1: --could be dangerous--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and it was painful for them sometimes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It wasn't for me, but it was painful for them.
Speaker 1: Da--did, did, did you ever sell papers downtown or in the--in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have any of that.  Then everybody got their paper delivered.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did--I did have a downtown route.  In the morning route, I had some downtown customers, 'cause it was "Wall Street Journal" and stuff like that.  And-
Story_ID: 56734
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there's a whole website devoted to Chicago [Illinois] newsies, you know, guys that stood on the corner as kids, and like you fought over the corners sometimes--you know, who's gonna get what corner?
Speaker 2: Well we would--we didn't fight over the corners.  I mean, the, the, the one--the, the fight--one fight I got into--they used to deliver--Thursday nights were always late, 'cause they always had ads.  So they'd drop off the truck--they'd, they'd dropped the, the bundles off at this main place here.  And then we'd all pick up our bundles and then go on our various routes.  And the--so they were late, and we were all waiting one night; then the truck came and dropped the bundles.  And I was gettin' ready to get my bundle, and another guy came and took my papers and threw 'em out in the street to get to his.  And I called him on it.  And I was--I was only the black newsboy.  And he was older than I was, actually, because his birthday was the same day as mine, but he was a year older than mine--me.  And so we got in a fight.  And, of course, everybody was rootin' for him, so I had to make a point.  So not only did I win, but I humiliated him on purpose.  Because he wanted to quit, and I just went behind him and said, no, you started it; you know, you st--and you're a coward and you're scared.  I just talked about him like a dog.  And, and the message wasn't for him; it was for the rest of them.  And then the next day, knowing how things work--I, I, I had a white guy who was a friend of mine who was my assistant working with me, and we didn't go to the pa--I said, "We're not going to the paper stop; we're going to the library."  And he said, "Why the library?"  I said, "We're just going to the library."  And we went to the library.  And we waited until I figured everybody else had got their papers, and then we went and got our papers.  'Cause sure enough the next day they were waitin' for me; they were all gonna jump me.  And then after that things calmed down.  But you did stuff like that.  You, you, you figured it out--okay, this is gonna happen if--'cause I did this.  And so it's never gonna be one on one.  It's always gonna be more than one on one, and you gotta deal with more than one; that's the nature of racism.
Story_ID: 56735
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you this too: In terms of--now your mother [Sadie Nelson] is a college professor, and, you know, she's a teacher by training.  And she was doing social work I think in Danville [Illinois] you said, but she was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, a literature professor, and, and--
Speaker 2: Well yeah, but it's interesting--
Speaker 1: --so what, what was going on in (unclear), in terms of the literature coming in and reading and--
Speaker 2: Oh, but she had a lot of books.  And I always was a reader, and she had quite a bit of books.  And she spoke Latin and Greek because she studied both of those in college.  And she was a grammarian; her major had been English too.  And she was very, very, very careful about the way we spoke and, and correct us--I mean, to the point where, you know, some kids used to say you guys talk like white people--whatever that means.  And--but, you know, she was very, very careful about the English language, you know, which makes sense.  I mean, if that's the language of the land you should probably know it.  No, she was--she was--she was a very, very bright, bright person, and so we always had books and I always read.  In fact, when I was in grade school I used to get done with my work really fast, and then I'd pull out a book.  So finally, the teachers use--they would put me next to the bookshelves, and I'd just reach over and take a book while the rest of the class did whatever that was they were doing.
Story_ID: 56736
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, te--tell the story about this?
Speaker 2: Well I was just saying--talk--talking about racism.  Yeah, there, there were racism--there was racism there in Danville [Illinois], but there were a lot of good people too.  And, and I remember a classmate of mine when I was in grammar school, Leslie O'Neal, a very good friend of mine.  And, and a lot of the kids would stop at this, this one kinda variety store and soda shop after school.  I could never stop there 'cause they didn't serve Negroes.  And--but all the kids would stop there.  And one time I was with Leslie, and he said let's go in and get a soda.  And I said na--na--no--we can't--I can't--I can't get a soda.  He said, why not?  And I said you know they won't serve me.  He said yes, they will; come on let's go in.  So he finally talked me into it, and I went in there and we sat down.  And he said I want a strawberry soda, and then I said I, I, want a strawberry soda too.  And the guy behind the counter was a middle-aged guy (unclear), and he looked at Leslie; he said, I'll serve you but I'm not serving them--him, pointing at me.  He said we don't serve them in here.  And so I looked at--I said see, I told you, and we got up.  And I was really embarrassed and, you know, mad, so we went home to my house and I told my mother about it.  And my mother said okay, you know what--that's it; I'm not gonna put up with this.  She said I want you to turn around, and I want you to go back there.  And you sit down at that counter and you order again.  And if they don't serve you this time, we'll get in touch with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Chicago [Illinois] and see about filing a suit.  Well when my mother told me to do something it was wise to do it, so I turned around and started back.  I got about halfway down the block and I looked around, and here's Leslie O'Neal right behind me.  And I said where are you going?  And he said I'm going with you.  And I said no, you don't wanna get in the middle of this, and I said you'd better go on home; I said I'll, I'll, I'll handle this.  He said you're going; I'm going with you.  So I said okay.  So we went back to the place and we opened the door.  We walked in; we sat back down at the counter.  The guy came down, and before I had a chance to open my mouth, Leslie O'Neal said: "I want a strawberry soda.  My friend wants a strawberry soda, and we're gonna drink it here."  And the guy hesitated.  I had never seen a look of hatred like he gave Leslie O'Neal.  And he turned around and fixed two strawberry sodas, and we sat there and we drank those sodas.  And so, so you had guys like him too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it sounds like--you know, that's that--yeah, kind of--I've heard stories like that--kind of a mushy line (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) it's there until somebody actually challenges it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and, and, and, you know, a lot of people wouldn't wanna get involved, but he chose to get involved.  And, in fact, surprisingly to me, took the lead.  He later became a minister.
Story_ID: 56737
Speaker 1: All right, so we were just talkin' about--you were just talkin' about this soda incident.  But now--'cause I'm just--I was interested in like--it--were you in, in--interested in--at all in the news when you were growing up, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've always been curious about things going on around me, and I think that's almost a prerequisite for being a journalist.  You have to be curious about your environment and I've always have been that, but I never looked at it in terms of this is something I wanna report on and write about.  And I've always considered myself to be fairly observant, because I, I used to like to travel all the time and go places.  And I remember I'd be in the car and I'd look and I'd say, wow, this is--did you see this or did you see that.  People would say no, I didn't pay any attention.  And I could never figure out how, how could they not look at things or see things.  So maybe that had something to do with me--but I got into journalism more out of curiosity than anything else, because it was something we were being kept from, and I wanted to know why.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know it's a long--it's kind of a zigzag route to it, but we'll, we'll get to that.  I just--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 56738
Speaker 1: --I just was wondering if you--now did--so, so your mother [Sadie Nelson], was she a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I don't think so, but she may have been.
Speaker 1: And in terms of--now did you all attend an Episcopal church in Danville [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: We--no, and we started when I was little, like four or five.  And we went to about two or three services, and then the priest got my mother aside and said that some of the parishioners had objected to drinking out of the same chalice for communion with us and--because we were the only black family--and he would be willing to give us communion with a separate chalice.
Speaker 1: Separate but equal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and my mother said that was unacceptable, and so I started going to the Baptist church. And then we went to the Methodist church.  I joined the Methodist children's choir called the Angel Choir.  And then I went to St. Patrick's and took Catholic instruction.  And I really didn't come back to the Episcopal church.  Oh, when that happened in Danville, my mother did take us to the Episcopal church in Champaign [Illinois], but it was a seventy-mile roundtrip drive and it was expensive.  But I took instruction there and I was confirmed at the age of eight, and I became the youngest person confirmed in the history of that church in Champaign.  But they never asked us to drink out of a separate chalice.  The problem was it was too far to travel all the time, so we started going to these other churches and--which was good 'cause I got an exposure to other, other--you know, other denominations and so forth.  And I really didn't come back to the Episcopal Church until I was in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, wa--was church very important when you were growing up?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Not really.  I grew--I--my belief was; I've always been a believer and I'd, I'd like to think I've always been a Christian, but I didn't see that I had to go to church in order to be a Christian.  I mean, it doesn't help when the religion that you're baptized in tells you that they want you to drink out of another cup.

Speaker 1: Okay, now let--let's go to school and get you through school.  Now Franklin Elementary School [Danville, Illinois], did--were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.  And that was about the end of it right there, in terms of school--as--in terms of my being a serious student until years and years later.  'Cause after that I became a goof-off.  I started in Danville High School [Danville, Illinois], and then when I was fifteen I moved to Chicago [Illinois].  And I think I graduated from Hyde Park [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in the lower third or fourth in my class.  If you look at the Hyde Park High yearbook for 1955--you know how they have names of the students and all the activities they participated in?  There's just my name, Joseph Boyce.
Speaker 1: No activities--
Speaker 2: Nothing.  Well I worked after school, but that wasn't the only reason.  I was interested in doing two things.  I was interested in playing jazz, and I had a motorcycle.  And those were the people I hung out with: the people who were interested in jazz and the people who liked motorcycles.  And I used to go to school wearin' a black jacket with a skull and crossbones on the back.  And if I wasn't dressed for that, I was dressed with my sunglasses and my things, 'cause that was my musician days so I was either one or the other.  And I still have--for years and years I had nightmares about homework not completed, assignments not read, tests failed.  I was telling my son the other day in Hyde Park they used to have a course book system where you'd start in the morning in your homeroom, and they give you this gray book.  And you take it around to each of your teachers, and they would put in your grade for that class.  And at the end of the day, you'd take the course book and, and take it home.  And I remember I'd gone through the day at this particular grading period.  I think I was a senior.  And I was in--and my last class was chemistry, and my teacher was Mrs. Kaplan--really smart lady.  And when they graded course books you did your own study or something, but the--but the--but the students were pretty much given an assignment, to be quiet and do something while the teacher went through the course books and put in the grades.  So the room was really quiet, as everybody was hunkered down doing what they were supposed to do.  And all of a sudden I heard Mr.--Mrs. Kaplan say, "Mr. Boyce."  And I looked up and she looked.  And she said, "I think I will make it unanimous."  And I knew exactly what she meant.  That was my final F in a series of F's all day (laughter).
Speaker 1: Unanimous.
Speaker 2: And so--but I did graduate.  And I remember years later they invited me back as a guest speaker (laughter).
Story_ID: 56740
Speaker 1: Now, now let me just ask you if in grade school were there any special teachers that either through example or because they were interested in what you were doing that, that stand out?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Mrs. Bean (ph.)--my second grade teacher was really nice; Mrs. Hunsacher (ph.)--my third grade teacher was very strict, but she taught me how to write as a left-handed person.  Because prior to that time, I had been taught to turn my paper the same way as a right-handed person, and--which meant, like many left-handed people today, I wrote upside down like this.  If you'll notice, many right-handed people--I mean left-handed people--they write op--upside down.  That's because nobody ever taught them that for a left-handed person, you turn the paper the opposite way than I--Mrs. Hunsacher knew that and she did that, and so consequently, I, I, I stopped writing upside down.  Mrs. Arnold, loved her, my fourth grade teacher-- sweet, really nice; Mrs. McDuffy, also a good teacher; Mrs. Harris, strict but--we had an incident in the class that really kinda turned me off against her.  We were--it was Christmastime, and the kids were bringing in their--asked to bring in their nuts.  And so she was saying okay, how many can identify these nuts?  And she'd hold this nut and then say oh, it's a pecan; and she'd hold up another--it's a walnut; and then she held up a Brazil nut, and the whole class said nigger toe and she smiled.  And I stood up and I said no, it isn't.  I said it's a Brazil nut; it's not a nigger toe.  Yes it is!  Yes it is!  It's a nigger toe!  Yes it is!  And she just sat there and smiled and never corrected them--never said a word.  And so I said okay and--but I was furious.  And then the seventh grade was Mrs. Lee (ph.), and she was from Virginia and she brought Virginia with her.  And then my eighth grade teacher was Mr. Klayman (ph.), and he was one of these teachers that right after the war these guys would come back from the war and they'd go get their degrees; and then they'd become teachers, but they had been in the military.  And so he and his brother-in-law both were teaching at the school, and they were great guys--Mr. Denman (ph.) and Mr. Klayman.  And they were really, really great.  In fact, I talked to Mr. Klayman; he's in his late 80s now I guess.  I talked to him just two or three years ago.  We, we hooked up some kinda way and--but he was my eighth grade teacher.  And, of course, you know, to them--to, to Danville [Illinois] because the newspaper had done stories on me and so forth--I'm kind of a success story to, to them.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you, you had your, your best academic years in, in grade school or freshman--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when I was serious, and I really worked hard to make good grades.
Speaker 1: I guess af--after you became a celebrity there after the party, you were, you know--you know, did better or?
Speaker 2: No, I became--I, I, I became cocky and a jerk (laughter) for a little while there, until one of my classmates, a young woman, straightened me out in front of everybody (laughter).  So I needed it.
Speaker 1: What did she--what did she tell you--what did she tell you?
Speaker 2: She just said something like you--she got mad at me one day in the class--said, you used to be really nice, but now you're really stuck up; you're full of yourself.  And she said it right in front of everybody, and nobody said that's not true.  And so I said yeah, maybe I'd better think about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56741
Speaker 1: All right, so now you start off at Danville High school [Danville, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were there until you were fifteen you said?
Speaker 2: Yes, I--I'd--in, in the--at the--towards the end of my sophomore year, I moved to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was--what had happened was my mother was named to a committee by the State of Illinois to examine all of the social work cases in Illinois, and the committee was supposed to convene in Chicago.  And they were from different places in the state.  The committee was made up of people from different agencies in the state, and they were to review all of the welfare cases and their disposition.  And it was supposed to have lasted three months, and so my mother moved to Chicago to the Sutherland Hotel.  And the Sutherland was on 47th and Drexel, and it was the mecca.  It was to Chicago what the [Hotel] Theresa was to New York [New York City, New York].  It was a full service hotel--had a beauty shop, a barber shop, a drugstore with a lunch counter; it had a restaurant; it had a bar.  Later the Sutherland Lounge opened up and had some of the greatest musicians in the United States play there.  And then some of its guests were famous--Louis Armstrong, Joe Williams.  I saw them--W.E.B. Du Bois.  And the manager was Earl Ormes, and his wife was Jackie Ormes who was a cartoonist, and she--and she wrote for--did cartoons for the Defender [the Chicago Defender] and so forth.
Speaker 1: Is that the guy that did Bungleton Green, the cartoon in the Defender?
Speaker 2: No, she did a woman.
Speaker 1: Oh, she's a--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think.  And Earl, I think he was an accountant by trade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, my mother asked did I wanna go to Chicago and live with her for those three months, and I said--I was dying to get out of Danville, and I said yeah.  And my brother decided he was gonna stay in Danville.  Like I said, he was older.
Speaker 1: Now, now, now tell me, like, you said that in high school you started really cuttin' up.  Did this start in Danville?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I just--I just really wasn't--I, I did pretty well in Danville, but it was really in Chicago when I really started, you know, going off the deep end.  And, and, and I wasn't a delinquent or anything.  I just--I just wasn't interested and motivated in school.
Story_ID: 56742
Speaker 1: Now had you at this point started any kind of music instruction or how did you start to play the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Wh--what happened was, was my--we always played instruments.  My brother [Robert Boyce] played piano--very good piano player, and I used to wanna play drums.  And I started--I played cornet in grade school, but I couldn't hit the high notes 'cause it, it put too much pressure on my glands in my throat; so that one didn't work; I played drums.  And my brother and I were listening to George Shearing one day, and we heard the vibes.  And, and he said what is that?  And I said it's a xylophone.  And he said no, it isn't; he said, it's something else.  And so on the 78's you could look and see who was playing what, and we took it off the spindle and looked at it.  And it was Marjorie Hyams, and it said "vibraharp."  And my brother said I think I'm gonna play that next, and I remember thinking no, you're not; you play everything; I'm, I'm gonna play that.  And so I, I went downtown to the music store in Danville [Illinois], and they had a little xylophone there.  And I asked the guy was it a vibraharp, and he said yes.  And I said how much is it?  And he said $100 dollars.  And I said will you take a down payment?  He said $10 dollars.  And I went home and begged my mother for $10 dollars to buy this xylophone which I thought was a vibraharp 'cause that's what he said.  And she said we don't have the money.  And thank goodness, because I would have bought that, and I would have been frustrated 'cause it didn't sound like I thought it was gonna sound.
Story_ID: 56743
Speaker 1: Now what is the difference between a vibraphone and a--
Speaker 2: A, a, a xylophone has wooden keys; it's, it's an octave higher; it's--you need two octaves.  It doesn't have a sustaining peddle to sustain the sound, and it doesn't have the rotors--the fans that vibrate the sound.  The vibraharp has metal keys, three octaves, has a sustaining bar.  And the reason they call it vibraharp is because the pipes underneath are sealed at the bottom.  When you hit the metal key the sound goes through the pipe, hits the bottom, rebounds, comes back up.  And while it does there's a little fan that turns, and it breaks up the sound waves so you get that wa-wa-wa-wa sound.  And that's why it's called the vibraharp.  It's called the vibraharp, the vibraphone.  Sometimes it's called the vibra bells, or more commonly the vibes.  And so when I went to Chicago [Illinois]--oh, my brother meanwhile went to the [military] service.  And after, after we became--well let me back up.  My mother's position lasted more than three months; it was made permanent.  And she had to make a decision whether she wanted to go back to her regular job in Danville [Illinois] or stay on the commission, and she decided to stay on the commission.  And so I was just taken with Chicago because for the first time in my life I was in a real diverse place.  At Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois] it was known then for its academics.  And for the first time rather than just black kids and white kids there were Asian kids; there were Hispanic kids; they had a Puerto Rican population there; there were Hispanic kids; they, they-- there were very, very strong Jewish population.  I mean, I thought I'd, I'd, I'd died and gone to heaven.  I had Japanese friends; I had Chinese fri--I knew.  It was just amazing to me this diversity, and I really loved it.  And living in the Sutherland [Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] was, was marvelous.  We had a small suite on the 6th floor with a balcony that faced downtown Chicago, and I could see the skyline from there.  And, I mean, gee whiz, I saw this upper black middle class, you know, business people, shop owners--I mean, I got a part-time job at South Central--South Center Department Store-it was a black department, and for the first time I saw black people as merchandisers selling materials.  Now white people owned the store, but you had black people who were employed as clerks.  I had never seen that before.  And then you had a black buyer, Bernadine Caracut (ph.), who later became Bernadine [C.] Washington.  She was the buyer for the women's department, and she was gorgeous.  And she always dressed--that--the accountant for the store was black, Cecil Bogan (ph.).  Cecil also played drums in Morris Ellis's Big Band.
Story_ID: 56744
Speaker 1: Yeah, just a minute on Bernadine C. Washington.  She became like a real, real distinctive voice on WVON [radio].
Speaker 2: Oh, I know, I know.
Speaker 1: Almost like Carol Simpson with the hard pronunciation--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well at that time she was the buyer, and she was absolutely beautiful.  And I mean, she--there was no doubt about who was in charge.  And I was a stock boy in the curtains and draperies, and I cut window shades.  The personnel director was black.  The main guy who managed the pharmacy in the drugstore part was black.  I mean, I had never seen any of that before.
Speaker 1: Now where was South Center Department Store?
Speaker 2: It was on 47th and Drexel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And across the street was Morrissey Shop and around the corner was the Regal Theater.  And catty-cornered was the Met Theater, and on the corner was--I'm tryin' to remember this guy who was an alderman; he had a--he had a title company there; he was bald-headed.  I'm tryin' to remember his name.  But anyway, it was the heart of black Chicago.  And you had stores up and down--
Speaker 1: Is that--
Speaker 2: --47th Street.
Speaker 1: Is that Claude Homan, the owner?
Speaker 2: No, it was the guy he--who was bald-headed and, and used to ride--used to drive a Rolls Royce.  I'm tryin' to remember his name, but--I mean, you had some, some flamboyant characters back in those days.  And, and--but because my mother decided to take this job permanently, the per diem that she was on, her expense account, stopped.  And so we had to pay the hotel bill ourselves.  So in order to do that, I took a job in the Sutherland as a bellboy.  So I was a bellboy in the Sutherland; I was a janitor in the Sutherland; I was a waiter in the Sutherland at various times; I was a night switchboard operator.  I lived in the Sutherland Hotel for six years and learned stuff and saw stuff that I would never ever had seen growing up in a normal atmosphere.
Speaker 1: I could imagine.
Speaker 2: And they all knew me by--you know, after a while they called me the kid.  And I knew everybody there.  I--you know, (unclear) because you had the--you had everybody come in.  You had the rich; you had the famous; you had the pimps; you had the gamblers; you had the women of the night; you had everything.  And it was--it was--it was just a wonderful, great experience and place to live.  And when they opened up the lounge, Allport (ph.) bought the lounge.  And they began to bring in people like Miles [Davis] and, and, and Oscar Peterson, and Cannonball Adderley.  And all the--all the great jazz musicians would come there and play--Thelonious Monk.  And then finally, you know, we ended up playin' on the--on the off nights for a while.
Speaker 1: Now was--
Speaker 2: With Herbie Hancock and, and me and, and some--and Harold Jones who went with Count Basie as his drummer and who now--the last time I looked he was with Tony Bennett.  But we all grew up together in Chicago.
Story_ID: 56745
Speaker 1: Now, I guess--now you--did anyone give you a vibraphone lesson--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, what happened was after I had moved and settled in Chicago [Illinois] and found out what a vibraphone was--they used to have Fisher's (ph.) Music downtown in Chicago.  That was when they had big music stores that sold things besides guitars.  And, and they sold everything.  And they had a set of vibes for sale--Jenco--for like $600 and something dollars.  And if you bought it, you could buy on time.  And if you bought it, you got six months of free lessons.  So I went down there and bought it on time, and I had six months of free lessons.  And the lessons were in the Fisher Building.  And I remember my teacher was Marvin Kaplan.  And I always liked the arts when I was a kid.  I used to go downtown by myself on the Cottage Grove streetcar, and listen to the jazz on Randolph Street 'cause I was too young to go in the places.  But I also would go to the theater.  I saw "New Faces of 1954" by myself; I saw "Porgy and Bess" by myself.  When I was a teenager I would go down and look at--you know, go to these places, 'cause other teenagers weren't interested in that.  And I remember in the studio there was a, a marimba--(unclear) like a xylophone.  And I, I told my teacher, Marvin Kaplan, I said gee, you know I love the, the intro--the prelude to "Porgy and Bess;" there's this wonderful xylophone song.  And he said I know.  I said can you play it.  He said, I'm the one who played it.  He was the Civic Opera percussionist who played it.  And, of course, I said oh, no, you're kidding me.  And he proceeded to play it and so I was amazed.  But every time I had a lesson with Marvin Kaplan, it was during his--the dinner hour.  And he loved corned beef sandwiches on rye with lettuce.  And he'd be teaching me the same time he'd eat these corned beef--and he wouldn't let me touch the vibes.  It was all theory--everything that was written down, theory, theory, theory.  The whole--
Speaker 1: So he didn't let you touch this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no--learn--learn your theory.  And so he started doing that.  And after a while I started listening to records.  And after my six months were up, I started playing, you know, along with the records.  And I got better and better, and I started playing around the city.  The first--the first nightclub gig I got--of course, I was playing at the high school [Hyde Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] with Herbie--Herbie Hancock and Don Goldberg.  Herbie's dad ran a grocery store on 61st, and Herbie lived on Langley--I think between 60th and 61st--he and his family.  And his dad had a '50 [1950] Plymouth, and they would come by the hotel and pick me up when we were playing at school.  And I'd put the vibes in the back, and then he'd drive us to school.  And, and the first gig I got was with Henry Morrison and Abe Booker at the Avenue Lounge on 64th and South Parkway on King Drive; that was my first.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was eighteen I think.
Story_ID: 56746
Speaker 1: You were telling me off-camera that you knew Don Cornelius.  So, so you, you, you met him when you were a teenager too?
Speaker 2: No, no that was later, but--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so that was later.  Wa--wa--wa--will just skip this part--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and go--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well I started playing and then when I--when I was nineteen--
Speaker 1: Now you're out of high school now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm out of high school now--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --and I started at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, well tell us about--now you said you kinda graduated towards the lower third--
Speaker 2: Towards the--yeah, the--
Speaker 1: --of the class.
Speaker 2: --lower part--lower place of my--lower part of my class.
Speaker 1: You had a motorcycle, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, I did.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But I had sold that by the time I graduated.  I'd gotten rid of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I started at Roosevelt.  I started--I, I, I was going to go to the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois], and we went to Navy Pier for an orientation.  And so you went in--and Navy Pier at that time was where the University of Illinois Chicago Campus was--and we walked down all the way a mile down to the end of the pier for orientation.  And then when orientation was over, they said okay, now you go back to register.  So we had to walk a mile back down the other way.  And I said this is nuts, and I just kept on going; I just walked right out of the--right off the pier and out and went over to Roosevelt University.  And--which at that time people called the "Communist school."  And
Speaker 1: Right, your real left--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and so I enrolled at Uni--at Roosevelt in pre-med; I wanted to be a doctor.  And I started at Roosevelt in pre-med.  And when I was nineteen in my sophomore year I got a call--by this time I'd started playing here and there around Chicago.  And I got a call from a group called the Dozier Boys which was fairly well known; they traveled a lot.  And they wanted me to audition for them.  They, they sang and they played; it was a quintet.  And so they were from the West Side, and I went over to the West Side.  I was recommended by a guy by the name of Frank Bell who was a tenor player, who had heard me play.  And I auditioned for them and they hired me, but we had--I had to get it past my mom.  So Cornell Wiley, the band leader, went to the hotel with me and sat down and talked to my mother for about an hour to convince her to let them hire me with the band.  And I, I told my mother that I would only go with them for a year, 'cause she was insisting on my returning to college.  So I said I would go--be on the road with them for a year and I'd go back--and come back and go to college.  So she agreed and so I joined the band.  And on December 16th, 1956, we opened up at the Key Club in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  We played seven nights a week for five weeks straight.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  And I stayed with the Dozier Boys for a year, and we played around the country and did a couple of records.  And so I, I just--I had a grand time.  I think I laughed more in that year than I had ever laughed before or since (laughter).  It was just that much fun.  And, and that was my transition for--from a boy to a man, in that year.
Speaker 1: Okay this is--this is like 1957--
Speaker 2: That was--yeah, I, I, I, I joined them in December of '56 [1956] and left at the beginning of February in 1957 and came back to go back to college.  But I had to work, and I got a job in the post office as a substitute clerk in the parcel post section at the main post office.
Story_ID: 56747
Speaker 1: Now at--now music--you know, it sound like you had a lot of fun and everything.  Was--were you tempted to stay out there and play music?
Speaker 2: No, because I realized how tough it can be, and I figured I'd better get something under my belt besides just depending on, on music.  And besides, you know, vibraharp is not like a piano or a bass where you can pretty much get a lot of work.  I mean, there's not a big demand for vibraharp players.
Speaker 1: It's like a luxury in a band to have a vibe player.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's, it's the instrument itself is expensive, and it's very hard to carry around.  And, and so--but people, when they hear it, they love it, but it's--you can't find a vibraharp in a music store today.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a--well, Lionel Hampton, of course, is the biggest name--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Lionel Hampton was an influence.  Milt Jackson was a bigger influence.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Bags was a--and it's interesting because later on, years later, I became a board member of Jazzmobile [Inc.] in New York.  And he played--he would do concerts for Jazzmobile and I emceed one of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it must have been--so it was the first time you met him?
Speaker 2: No, the first time I met him was at the Blue Note [Records].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was still a young guy and still in college.  And, in fact, I was--I was too young--they used to have a place in the Blue Note in Chicago [Illinois] called The Kitty Corner, where if you were underage they would put you over there and, and you couldn't drink alcohol.  And so Les Rout (ph.) who was in the band with me in Chicago and--I don't know if Herbie [Hancock] was with us or not, but we, we went to hear Milt Jackson.  And I remember we got up our courage and we went over to speak to him; he was sitting with another member of the band, and we introduced ourselves.  And I said I played vibes, and I was really, you know, glad to meet him and everything.  And, and I remember him looking over my shoulder and said yeah, yeah, all that's nice man; why don't you introduce us to the girls you're with (laughter)?  And, you know, later on--I met him years later, and it was a totally different thing.  But then, you know, I was kind of crushed (laughter) because he was more interested in the girls we were out with than he was in talking music.
Speaker 1: What about Johnny Lidell (ph.), did you remember him?
Speaker 2: I never liked--you know, I remember him; I never liked his style.  I, I, I never was interested in how he played.  And--no, the, the people I liked were:  Milt mainly; I liked Hamp [Lionel Hampton]; Kal Chadar (ph.).  There's a--there's a guy--I'm tryin' to remember his name--out of England.  He put out a record called Lydia M-1, and I'm tryin' to remember his name, but he, he is really, really good; I liked him; Lynn (ph.) Winchester was nice;  Roy Ayers before he got into too much of the fusion stuff; I mean, I listened to him.  Today, Stefon Harris is a good player.  Bobby Hutcherson's a good player.  But nobody--the, the two top players are, are Lionel Hampton, who has a totally different style than Milt.  But nobody touches Milt Jackson for subtlety, style--just nobody touches him, but he's got perfect pitch and a photographic memory.  So that--that's almost unheard of in music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Herbie's got perfect pitch.  I have 94 percent.
Speaker 1: So you know exactly (laughter)?
Speaker 2: There's a big difference in that six percent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Between ninety-four and a hundred.
Story_ID: 56748
Speaker 1: All right, so, so you're back at Roosevelt and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm at Roosevelt--mediocre grades--not really serious because every time I got a chance to play, rather than study I played.  Every time I got a chance to go out on a date or to a party I did that, rather than study.  So that even though I took all these courses, you know, comparative anatomy, embryology, histology, and so forth, if I had really applied at a medical school and was accepted, you would only be able to identify it by longitude and latitude.  It'd be in an island somewhere (laughter).  You know, such and such college of medicine and body and fender repair (laughter).  So--but, but, but--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: So I decided to change to psychology.
Speaker 1: So, but you did like--now you, you did graduate from Roosevelt with a--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --bachelor's degree in biolo--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay--.
Speaker 2: No, no I didn't.  I--you know, it's funny, I never finished anything unfortunately.  I did get serious, though.  I went to Roosevelt and then I left 'cause I had to work and would go at night.  And then I, I switched to psychology--took a bunch of psych courses.  And then somebody--then I--then there was a time when I, I got married.
Story_ID: 56749
Speaker 1: Ha--how, how old were you when you got married?
Speaker 2: When I got married I was twenty-four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I met a young lady who saw me play in a club, and she was eighteen.  And we got married, and a year later we had a daughter.  I already had a daughter from a relationship before I had gotten married, but the family really didn't want me involved.  But I did keep track of her, and incidentally she ended up living with me years later.
Speaker 1: Wa--what was the issue with the family.  I mean, was it a--
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't know.  They--I really--the girl and I had broken up before I found out she was pregnant.  And I think probably it could have been that the girl just didn't wanna marry me or anything.  But I was gonna be a, a father, you know, to the daughter, but what happened was she, she married another guy not too long after that.  And my daughter grew up thinking he was her real father, and it wasn't until she was in her teens that she found out about me.  And she eventually ended up living with me, and we're very close now.  But my, my other daughter from my first marriage--I had--I had sort of dropped out of school, left the post office and went to the John Crerar Library [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and worked in the photo lab.  And I was going to school part time--college.  And I walked in the class one day, and one of my classmates was wearing a police uniform.  And I said, Sandy, you're a cop.  I didn't know you were a cop.  He said yeah.  And I said, well, how can you do that and go to college?  And he said the police department will arrange your shift so you can go to college.
Speaker 1: Oh, is this a white guy?
Speaker 2: No, a black guy.
Speaker 1: Black guy, okay.
Speaker 2: He said yeah, the police department will arrange your shift so you can go to college.  So I said, wow!  Well, that was not long after the Summerdale Scandal.  And they had just brought in Orlando Wilson, and they were reforming the police department.
Speaker 1: The famous O.W. Wilson.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so they started the new cops that they were hiring were called the "new breed" because they were the best educated, the--you know, the smartest, the most--you know, the most qualified police they'd ever hired.
Story_ID: 56750
Speaker 1: Okay, now the Summerdale Scandal, is that the one where they--someone in the Justice Department proclaimed that the Chicago Police Department was the most corrupt in the nation?
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't know.  What caused the Summerdale scandal was there was a burglar working in the Summerdale district that had an agreement with the cops to allow him to commit burglaries if he split the proceeds with the police.  And he got caught, but the whole department was corrupt on many levels.  And anyway, I took the test, because for the first time you didn't have to pay your alderman.  Because before that the word was you had to pay your alderman $300 bucks if you wanted to get on the police department.  And so I took the test, and somebody came to me and said did you see the "Chicago Tribune?"  And I said no, why?  And they said you're in it.  And I looked at the "Tribune," and I was number ten on the list of all the people who took the test.  And so I went through all their examinations and then went to the police academy.  And so I had not been mar--you know, I'd been married shortly before that, just right before that.  I started the police academy in September and I got married in August.  And we were living in a one-bedroom flat in the back of a brownstone on the corner of 50th and Blackstone.  And I passed the academy and got assigned to Grand Crossing, the 3rd District as a--as a beat officer.  And then eventually I had to take a second job to make ends meet, and so I, I worked at the post office for four hours a day and worked at the police department.  I worked at the police shift and then went to the post office and worked four hours.  And the post office would arrange a policeman's shift--they would arrange the four-hour shift to coincide with your police officer's shift.
Speaker 1: So the poli--the police officer's shift was for how long kinda?
Speaker 2: For eight--you know--
Speaker 1: Eight hours, okay.
Speaker 2: --a regular eight-hour shift, yeah.
Speaker 1: So to make ends meet with being a police officer and--
Speaker 2: I had--yeah.
Speaker 1: --you had to work at the post office for (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what you started out--my salary starting with the police department in '61 [1961] was $5,280 dollars a year.  You didn't have a uniform allowance.  They gave you six bullets, and a belt, and a baton, and that was it.  The rest was you.  You bought your uniform; you bought your shoes; you bought--you bought your gun.  You made $5,280 dollars a year and that was it, but you had heck of a good benefit program.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the--yeah, $5,000 wasn't bad in those days for--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't all that good--
Speaker 1: The beginning--
Speaker 2: --but you had a lot cops--
Speaker 1: --beginning--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that had their own houses and you know, but you also had a lot of cops that supplemented their incomes too.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 56751
Speaker 1: You had a lot of them [Chicago police officers] who worked the post office and then you had a lot of them who worked the street, if you understand what I mean.  I chose not to work the street, and as a result, some of my colleagues--I thought I had a reputation as a good cop, but, but you had to be careful because even, even with the reforms, there was still a lot of corruption.  Years later I met a cop, and he said I know you, when I was introduced.  And I said, have we met?  He said no.  I said well, how do you know me?  And he said, you were in 3rd District, right?  I said yeah.  And he said, I was on the shift after yours.  He said one day you were getting out of your squad car down below--Grand Crossing was on 75th and, and Maryland at that time, and the cars used to double park when they changed shifts--and he said their captain, a guy by the name of Ronnie Nash, called the whole roll call over the window and pointed me out to them as I was gettin' out of the squad car--said watch him; he's from IID-Internal Investigations Division.  And the reason that he pointed me out as from being downtown is because I didn't take money, and they figured because I didn't take money that I had to be a spy.
Speaker 2: Now who did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And this is the captain telling them that, a captain, so who could you go to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've, I've heard lots of these kinds of stories.  And when you were in the department, I believe--were you there the same--you were--you were the same time as Ed Palmer [Edward L. "Buzz" Palmer], right?  bu--bu--Buzz (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Buzz came after me.
Speaker 2: Did he?  Okay, so you, you, you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was there from '61 [1961]--
Speaker 2: --had left before--
Speaker 1: --to '66 [1966].  I think we might have overlapped the last year or two, but I didn't know Buzz.
Speaker 2: What, what about ja--ja--Jack DeBonnett or DeBonnet or (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know him, uh-um.  I mean, I knew most of the guys in Grand Crossing.  And then after a couple of years, I became an evidence technician.  And I did that for a couple of years, and then I became an instructor in law in the police academy.
Story_ID: 56752
Speaker 1: Okay, now you started going to law school at a certain point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I, I switched to law.  I went back to college, and this time I got serious 'cause I was married and I had a family.  And I made good grades and qualified for law school.
Speaker 1: So e--even though--so you, you, you could do that in those days without finishing a bachelor's degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a program at John Marshall [Law School] where if you had three years of college, they would give you credit for your fourth year.  You would get a degree from your regular college.  When you finish law school, you would get a law degree and then you would get your regular bachelor's degree.  So I opted for that program.  Because I made bad grades was not because I was bad with--I was intellectually deficient.  I made bad grades 'cause I didn't give a care for a long time.  And so I started law school and--part time at night--and at--when I started I was an evidence technician.  And this was a time in Chicago when there were demonstrations daily in the city against the Board of Education, [Reverend] Jesse [Jackson]--I mean, just--Martin Luther King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Gage Park--there were demonstrations all the time in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was the Willis Wagon--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The Willis Wagon thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: Willis and, and, and as a policeman, we were often assigned to those.  And I remember going along with the, the civil rights marchers and singing along with them in my police uniform.  But what they did was they used evidence technicians because we were adept with cameras.  They didn't want us to take surveillance 'cause I wouldn't have wanted to do that.  They had other people doing that in plainclothes.  But what they did was because there were mass arrests, and one officer might arrest 20, 30 people at a time, well when they got to court they couldn't remember who they arrested.  Also, some of these people said that the officers were unnecessarily rough, and that was a no-no too.  So in order to make sure we documented these arrests so that the police could remember who they arrested and so the people arrested would be treated fairly, evidence technicians were brought aboard to take pictures just of arrests, to make sure that nothing, you know, untoward would happen.  And so that's what I did.  Well there was a lot of stand around time because of that, because many of these demonstrations and arrests were orchestrated.  What would happen was the demonstrator would come to the police commander who was in charge and they'd say, okay at 2:30, thirty of us are gonna lie down in the street.  And so the commander would say how many, thirty?  And say yeah, and so we're not gonna resist.  He say okay, well we'll, we'll arrest you; we'll bring the wagons in about 2:25 and, and so we'll--so, so you pick out your thirty and--it was all orchestrated.  So, there was just a lot of stand around time.
Story_ID: 56753
Speaker 1: This particular demonstration was House Un-American Activities Committee, HUAC, at the old Federal District Court of Appeals on North Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois].  And I'm standing there on a Saturday, and this guy comes up to me while the demonstration's going on and starts asking questions.  And I said are you with the press?  He said yes, and I said well I'm not authorized to talk to you; you need to speak to the lieutenant.  He said, no, no, no, this is my day off; he said, I just live across the street.  And he pointed to this fabulous apartment on Lake Shore Drive, and I said, what do you do?  Well it turned out he was the foreign editor at the Chicago Tribune.  So I said whoa!  I said were you ever a foreign correspondent in World War II?  He said yeah.  And I said tell me about it, so we stood there chatting.  And the next day he came back again, and we chatted again.  And he asked me about me and what I was doing.  I told him I was in law school [John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois].  And at the end of that period, I said well it was great speaking with you; maybe I'll see you again sometime.  He said wait a minute, don't go; how would you like to be a newspaper reporter?  And for the first time I really thought about being a journalist.  Not because I was enamored of journalism, but because I knew that they had--mainstream media had kept blacks out, and I wondered why.  What was the secret?  I wanted to peer behind that curtain, so I told him yeah, I'd be interested.  So he took my information; we said goodbye, and I didn't hear from him for a while.  I forgot about him as a matter of fact.  And he called me up and I was at my mother's apartment.  And he called me up and he reminded me who he was.  And he said, are you still interested?  And I said, well yeah, and so we decided that when I took my vacation from the police department, and because of my seniority it was in January--or lack of seniority--it was agreed that I would come to the "Chicago Tribune" for one week and--in the Neighborhood News where they trained all their people--and see if they liked me and if I liked them.  I had never written a news story in my life, and I went down there and--because police--I was still on the police department, and because I was a policeman you had to carry a gun off duty or you got suspended.  And I remember walking in there the first thing was I was the only black person in the room of this whole room of young reporters.  And then when I took off my jack I had a snub nose .38 on my hip, and they'd never seen anything like that before.  And I sat down and for a week I wrote little stories.  My first story was a three 'graph story and you work with a partner, and I remember handing my story to my partner, a young woman by the name of Anne Gets (ph.).  And I said what do you think?  And she read it, and she said well it's okay, but let me ask you a question.  She said have you ever heard of the inverted pyramid style of writing?  I said no, what's that?  And she explained about how you put the most important thing in the lead and, and then you write down from there.  And I didn't know that, that was a fundamental principal of journalism 'cause I responded, hey, you know that makes a lot of sense; I think I'll write all my stories like that from now on.  And she gave me this crazy look and said okay.  And that was my first journalism lesson.
Story_ID: 56754
Speaker 1: And a week later at the end of the week they offered me a job, and I turned them down because I wasn't makin' as much as I was on the police department.  And they called me back a few weeks later and wanted to know could I come back in for more interviews.  And this time I was interviewed by the city editor, Harold Hutchings, and we had what I thought was a great interview.  And then we went out into the sitting room of the Chicago Tribune.  He was gonna introduce me to the mag--to the managing editor, Clayton Kirkpatrick, who later became a really great--we became friendly.  I mean, he was really a gr--a gr--a great editor and--but at that time, like I said there were no black reporters in the sitting room with the Chicago Tribune.  And so--it was morning and with the--with the morning paper nobody is usually in the place in the morning.  It starts to fill up in the afternoon, but Kirk was there sitting at this great big chair where the top editors sit and (unclear) out the paper.  And he was about the only one in this huge sitting room in the Chicago Tribune, and I walked in there and he had his back turned to me.  And he was sitting in the chair, and when I looked over his shoulder, there as a, a black guy--a middle-aged black guy down shining his shoes.  And, and, and he was a really nice guy.  That's what he did; he carried a shoebox around and shined people's shoes in the--in the building.  And he was shining--and he looked up at me 'cause he had never a black guy, and I looked down at him and we said a thousand words without speaking.  We later became, you know--we knew each other.  But I remember Hutchings saying to Kirkpatrick, "Kirk, there's somebody I want you to meet."  And Kirkpatrick swiveled around in the chair with a smile on his face, and when he saw me the smile froze and his eyes just glazed over.  And so the first question he asked me, he said, how much--he said, how much experience have you had in the news business?  And I said well none unless you consider carrying the Danville [Illinois] commercial news for six years.  And I laughed and he didn't, and basically it was well, don't call us, we'll call you.  And I remember going to the elevator after that and saying I am never coming back to this building again; they called me; I didn't call them; the heck with this.  And I remember taking the elevator down saying that's that.  Oh, and when, when Kirk said that Hutchings leaned over his shoulder and pointed at me and said "at your age too."  This is the guy I just had this great interview with.  I was 28, so I said I don't need this.  And two or three days later I get a phone call and it's Hutchings, and he said can you come back in and talk to us; I like you; Kirk likes you; everybody likes you.  We really--it just was blew me away.  Would you really come back in?  So I came back in and talked.  They started me at $5 dollars a week more than I was making on the police department.
Story_ID: 56755
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So anyway, I started out in the Neighborhood News [at the Chicago Tribune], which was a training ground.  And I remember after about three--I took a leave of absence from the police department.  And after about three months, I went into my editor's office.  His name was Russell McFall.  He was a really great guy.  And he, he said--he complimented me on my work, you know, and he asked me did I like it.  And I said I really did, and I'm--I really liked it there.  And he said, well how are you doing?  And I said, well I think that's for you to say, Mr. McFall.  And he said something that you never hear in today's workplace; he said, I think if you wanted a job for the rest of your life at the Chicago Tribune, you got it.  And so I said, Mr. McFall, thank you; can I have a long lunch?  And he said yes, and he allowed me to have a long lunch.  And I went down to the police department and resigned.  And I remember Orlando [O.W.] Wilson.  I got a thing that Orlando Wilson called me up to his office and, and at one point--and, and said why do we lose people like you, which I thought was really a compliment, but a little bit too little too late.  And so I, I went back to the "Trib" [the Chicago Tribune] and I said okay, this is what I'm gonna do for a while.  And--
Speaker 1: Now just for, for the sake of chronology, this is 1965?
Speaker 2: This is 1966.
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].  You're, you're like twenty eight--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I was twenty eight until that April, so by the time I started I was twenty nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so-
Story_ID: 56756
Speaker 1: So '66 [1966] now this--another just a point of referencing--now this is a year--and I don't know if this happens yet--but Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] comes to Chicago and lives on the West Side, right in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --marched in Gage Park while I was still working for the [Chicago] Tribune, but I did it on my own time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And that's interesting because they had a white reporter there that I think was somewhat uncomfortable about them hiring me.  I don't know if he was or not, but he was covering Gage Park for the Neighborhood News.  He hadn't moved in the city room yet.  I remember he walked in the Neighborhood News one day and he said, "He was there!" and pointed me out because I had been marching.  And I said yeah, I was there when it was my own time.
Speaker 1: Now also--now so the Tribune--the Tribune historically has been the Republican paper and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Back when re--re--Republicans were sensible.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is a--(unclear), not to mean that they're aren't right-wing people they are now, but it was a Republic paper.  And the Democratic pa--paper was the [Chicago] Sun-Times ba--basically, which is more--
Speaker 2: We--they were supposed to be more liberal.  All the other papers report--were supposed to be more liberal than the "Tribune," but interestingly enough, I never had any of my stories spiked.  And I would talk to my colleagues with the other papers.  They had their stories spiked.
Speaker 1: Do you think it was because of the political pressure of being allied (unclear) with the--you know, I don't know if these other papers are allied with the Daley administration, but they were supposed to be more Democratic or whatever.  Is that, that the reason?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a lot of so-called liberals aren't liberal.  And I think some of my colleagues realized that once they got there.
Speaker 1: But Chicago is a city where Democrats basically are in charge of the machine.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which was a lot different from, you know, the liberal, you know, maverick type-
Story_ID: 56757
Speaker 1: But the black community would read the other papers.  And, and it's not just because they preferred them.  The [Chicago] Tribune, which was a problem of mine with them, a lot of times did not distribute in black neighborhoods.  And that was one of the things that we worked on when I was there, to get more circulation.  But there were some interesting stories at the "Tribune."  I think they learned from me as much as I learned from them.  After I was there for a year, even though I had no journalism experience when I--when I got there, after a year I knew how to put that paper together by myself.  If everybody in there had a heart attack, I knew how to put out the Chicago Tribune because I made sure.  And when I started--when they were negotiating and hiring me, I said if you are hiring me to cover the black community, talk to somebody else because I'm not gonna do it.  Don't hire me if you think I'm gonna cover the black community.  And it was not because I didn't think the black community needed covering.  Of course it did; it'd been ignored for years or misrepresented for years.  But I knew being the first that if all I did was cover the black community they would put me in a desk over in the corner.  I'd be the best source reporter in there when it came to the black community, but my colleagues would say well, he's kind of a reporter, but he covers the black community; he covers what he knows.  So I wanted to make sure I knew how to cover the courts, the water department, the city council, all this other stuff as well or better than my white colleagues to get that respect, not for me but for the people who were gonna come after me.  And I knew that there would be black people coming after me if I did a good job.  And I didn't want to start out by setting a precedent.  And so they agreed.  Now later on I did cover a lot of things in the black community, but it was because I chose to do it, not because they chose to do it.  I covered what I wanted to, but first I had to build a rep.  So after a year I matriculated into the city room.  And as--and, and, and the city editor called me in his office before I went out there and said he was putting me on the copy desk just to get the people in the room used to my presence.  And it was a--I was a little offended at first, but it turned out to be the smartest thing in the world because the copy desk was on--I was on was the copy desk that read my copy.  So I got to know these guys for two weeks.  I got to go out drinking with them and everything else, and it was different.  And back in those days newspaper people drank.  It was different than if I had just gone in there and taken a desk.  So that when I turned in my copy as a reporter, these guys would be screaming at other reporters who made mistakes, but with me they'd say hey, Joe, come over here; I wanna--I wanna show you something.  So they always treated me very nicely.
Story_ID: 56758
Speaker 1: But we did have--there were incidents.  I remember in the Neighborhood News there was one copy editor there who had been in the city room for the daily paper.  And he was older and he had had a stroke, so they had put him in the Neighborhood News because the pace was slower.  He refused to read my copy; he, he wouldn't do it.  And, and all the people in the Neighborhood News were mostly young, and the slot man was young.  And I found out by accident that this guy would refuse to read my copy, and I said, well wh--why is that?  And he said, it's your writing.  And I said, what is that?  He said, well he says you can't.  I said, can't what?  He said, can't write.  And I said, well do you--do you agree with that?  Do you believe that?  'Cause he was in charge of the desk.  He said no, of course not.  He said, now I'll tell you, when I hand him one of your pieces and take your name off of it, he'll hand it back and say, who is this guy?  He's pretty good.  So one day everybody was out to lunch and I was working, and this guy used to eat his lunch at the desk.  And he would just pick up the copy and edit it 'cause he didn't have anything else to do.  And he accidentally picked up one of my pieces.  And I remember him coming over to my desk.  His name was Bud Schodder (ph.), and he said, "He said, he said, he said!"  I said, "Excuse me, yes?"  He said, "You just keep sayin' 'he said.'"  He said, "You need to vary that.  You say he said too much, too much; change it.  Say he declared, he explained."  So I said, "Okay, I'll, I'll change it."  And so he turned around, I said, "Mr. Schodder?"  And he said, "What?"  And I said, you know, I said, "I appreciate you coming over here and telling me that."  I said, "You know I'm trying to do the best I can and learn, so anytime you see something like that that you think I can improve on, I really appreciate you coming over and telling me."  He said, "Well yes, well yes."  And so I went ahead and changed it and came back.  He said, "That's much better."  So by the time it was my time to come on the copy desk--it was his desk, that he was on, and I remember him saying, "Joe, sit next to me; sit next to me; I'll, I'll, I'll show you everything I know."  Shows you how people can change.
Story_ID: 56759
Speaker 1: Another time the Black Panther Party called a press conference, and they called me up.  And so I, I was in the city room then, and I called the desk and I--
Speaker 2: Is this in '69 [1969] after the Fred Hampton [assassination] (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was after Fred.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and so I said Black Panther Party is calling a kress--press conference; I need to go.  I said I need a photographer.  And I remember ph--ph--photography editor said--this is in the city room; everybody can hear everybody.  He said well we don't have anybody to send.  I said what do you mean?  He said well Ovie Carter is off.  Well Ovie Carter was the first black photographer the [Chicago] Tribune had hired.  And I said wait a minute.  I said are you telling me that if you can't send a black photographer to cover the Black Panther Party, then you don't have anybody.  I said what the hell kinda newspaper is this anyway?  Are we are newspaper?  I just raised hell in the city room.  And they apologized, and they sent me a photographer.  And I remember the first time after Ovie had been hired.  And I worked with Ovie and we went out on an assignment together.  I came back and one of the editors approached me and said, "How was it working with Ovie?"  I said, "It was fine."  He said, "Well, how did he do?"  And I said, "I'm not a photographer; I don't know."  And he said, "Well I don't mean that."  He said, "How did he conduct himself?"  And I said, "He conducted himself fine, just fine."  So a couple of years later when I was with TIME magazine, and Ovie had become the first photographer ever with the Chicago Tribune to win a Pulitzer Prize.  TIME magazine's office is right next door to the "Tribune."  I remember going over to the Tribune city room and, and going in the city room and say:  "Hey, how does Ovie Carter conduct himself now? (Laughter) Is he conducting himself okay?  He won you guys the first Pulitzer you ever had in photography.  Is he conducting..."--I just rubbed it in.  And I could do it 'cause I knew those guys, and we liked each other, but they knew.
Speaker 2: Okay, now (unclear) this is '69 [1969] the Ovie Carter--the--what you call story--and he, he won the Pulitzer much later; this is in the sev--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well that--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --by that time I was with TIME magazine.
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I went with TIME magazine in 1970.
Story_ID: 56760
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, let me go back to--I have a note on here about the Nigerian civil war--
Speaker 2: Nigerian-Biafran War [1967-1970].
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you--did you cover it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, that was the same guy, Don Starr, the guy that first hired me and met me.  And he was an interesting guy, a, a real short guy.  And he was the foreign editor, like I said.  And about three months after I was hired at the--at the Trib [the Chicago Tribune], he had a cocktail party at his house, and he invited me and his--and, and my wife at the time.  And he had, like I said, this beautiful apartment on Lake Shore Drive.  And while we're at the--at the--at his apartment, he invited me into this library, and when he got in the library he shut the door.  And he was a short guy.  He looked up and he said, "So how are you liking it?"  And I said, "Fine."  He said, "Good, good."  He said, "I'm glad you're enjoying it."  I said, "I really like it."  And I said, "Mr. Starr"--I said--"I just wanna thank you and the Chicago Tribune for giving me this opportunity; I really do."  And I never will forget all of a sudden his face changed; he got angry; he stood up and he pointed his finger in my face, and he said, "Don't you ever let me hear you say that again."  And I was surprised.  "What did I say?"  And he said, "Listen."  He said, "You don't owe them anything."  He said, "The reason they hired you was because they need you."  He said, "They're not doing you any favors, and you don't have to be grateful to them or anybody else.  You're there because you are doing what they need to have done.  They need you.  Don't you ever tell them how grateful you are to be to them 'cause they're not doing you any favors."  You know, that was a lesson that I never, ever forgot in any job I ever had after that.  And this guy was telling me that, but I never will forget the look on his face.  He was furious.  And what he was basically saying is do your job; do it to the best of your ability, and you don't have to go around being grateful to anybody.  That's being grateful, doing your job.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, the Nigerian-Biafran War [1967-1970].  Starr [Don Starr] came to me and at that time they were getting a lot of publicity because Biafra, which was the part of Nigeria that had seceded and was mainly the home of the Igbo Tribe, had been cordoned off or sealed off by the federal troops.  And they were experiencing a lot of starvation and hunger.  And [Chief Chukwuemeka] Odumegwu Ojukwu, who was the--was the colonel who was the head of the Biafran forces, had hired a public relations firm in--a Swiss public relations firm called Mark Press.  And so they had capitalized on these starving children.  And so in magazines and, and on television around the world you were shown these pictures of these starving Biafran children suffering from a disease called Kwashiorkor, which was a vitamin [sic, protein] deficiency.  And so it, it became a big issue--a human rights issue.  And Starr just felt that it wasn't being covered.  It was--our London [England] bureau was responsible for Africa, and they just--they were phoning it in.  They just weren't--you know, the [Chicago] Tribune's London bureau just wasn't doing the job, and, and, and like much of the media back then, the mainstream media, if it happened in Africa it wasn't worth covering.  And Star didn't feel that way, so he wanted to know did I wanna go over there and do it.  And so my wife was pregnant and I really didn't, but I did.  And at the time things were really up in the air.  I thought I was gone get myself killed, because you don't have the backup today--then that you do today.
Speaker 1: Now this is your first trip abroad.
Speaker 2: No I'd been--
Speaker 1: Had, had you been?
Speaker 2: --in Africa before with the Navy Reserve, but it was a different situation; it was Morocco.  Now I'm sub-Saharan Africa and I'm by myself.  I gotta take my own pictures and everything.  But I did a lot of research, and finally--in preparation for the trip--and then finally I stopped in Washington [D.C.] on my way and went to the [U.S.] State Department and was supposed to be debriefed by the State Department guy who was the charge of the African desk.  And I found out that I knew more about what was going on than he did.  And I remember going back.  That was--I don't drink anymore; I haven't drunk since nine--I don't--I haven't had a drink since 1980.  But then--I wasn't a drunk, but I would--I would--I would drink.  I remember going back to the hotel having a couple of drinks 'cause I knew I was gon' get killed.  I knew I wasn't coming back 'cause it was crazy--and thinking, gee, if I know more than the guy in the State Department, you know, where is my backup?  So I went--went to--flew to--flew to Lagos [Nigeria] and stayed at the Bristol Hotel in downtown Lagos.
Speaker 1: Now, now is this 19--well--
Speaker 2: It's 1969.
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969].  Okay, so this is first year of Nixon administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 56762
Speaker 1: And so I'm downtown Lagos [Nigeria] and, gee whiz, I got--my hotel [The Bristol Hotel] room looked like a cell.  I mean, I just hated it.  And so then I walk over to the American Embassy.  I don't know how to get around Lagos, so I'm walkin'--so it's hot and I'm walkin'.  And then the American Embassy is closed because it's a holiday.  And then on the way back, I decided I wanted to take pictures, 'cause I had to take my own pictures.  So I'm taking pictures of these military convoys going through Lagos, and this military policeman stops me and asked me what I'm doing.  Make as long story, I get arrested, 'cause I'm standing in front of the, the medical--the headquarters for the medical department of the [Nigerian] Army.  This, this sergeant that arrested me, this guy won't let me go.  I mean, he just is determined--I'm--to get me charged as a spy.  So we end up working our way through the ranks to a--finally I get to a lieutenant colonel who has me sign a statement about what I'm doing.  He lets me keep my camera and lets me keep my film and then lets me go with a warning that if I'm caught again, it's gonna be a different situation.  And then they give me a machine gun escort back to my hotel with a machine gun in my back.  And then when I get in the hotel, I'd already been bar the day before--the night before, and I'd left--I didn't know anything about Africa at that time, and I left the guy a tip that must have been equivalent to his week's salary, and so he obviously remembered me.  They've nev--they know Americans best, as opposed to Africans anyway.  And he was black--I mean, you know.  And, and, and I'm sitting at the bar.  The guy comes over, an African guy, and he starts talking to me.  And after he's talking to me for a while, the bartender comes over and says to me, "Here's your check."  And I said, "You know, I'm just talking; I'm not ready to go."  He said, "I told you, here's your check."  So I said, "Okay."  So I looked at my check, and he had written, "Be careful, this man watched you for a half hour before he moved."  So I said uh-oh.  So then I said, well look, to this guy; I said I gotta go, you know.  And he said no, I wanna talk to you some more; I wanna go to the United States; my friends and I wanna go to the United States; we wanna know if you can help us.  And I said well I really can't.  I said I've got--gotta go to my room;  I said I'm gettin' ready to leave; I gotta check out.  And he said, well we'll go to your room with you; we'll talk to you.  And I said no, you can't do that; I'm getting ready to leave.  So anyway, I got them off my back, and then I went to the desk.  And the clerk had had a confrontation with the [Nigerian Army] sergeant who had arrested me because when he--when they walked me in--marched me into the hotel, he started giving the third degree to the clerk--"Who is this man" about me.  "Why do you have him in your hotel?; what do you know about him?"  And the clerk bit him back and said you don't come in here and behave like this.  And I found out that the reason he did it.  They had just had a directive issue that the soldiers were supposed to treat the citizens with respect, and so he backed off.  So I told the clerk, I said where can I go?  You know, I need to get out of here; I need to go.  So I bribed him to not tell anybody where I went.  And so I packed my stuff up, and I moved to the Palace Hotel out on Akoya Island.  And, and I re--I remember, though, after that I would see these same two guys like in the marketplace behind me.  I mean, they were obviously--And then when they realized I realized that they were there, then they kinda--
Speaker 2: 'Cause these are white guys?
Speaker 1: --disappeared.  No, these are all black.
Speaker 2: These are all black; these are all Africans.
Speaker 1: All Africans--all Africans--all Africans.
Story_ID: 56763
Speaker 1: And so I stayed there [the Palace Hotel, Akoya Island, Nigeria] for two weeks, and then it was time to get into Biafra.  And there were only two ways to get into Biafra: you either flew in through an island--a Portuguese island called Sao Tome; or you flew in through Cotonou Dahomey [now Benin].  And so I chose Dahomey.  I couldn't get in through Sao Tome, and you, you had to have a visa; you couldn't get a visa.  The Biafrans had barred all press, but I needed to get--to get in there.  So I went to Cotonou and I was--meanwhile I was sick as a dog.  I didn't realize it but I had contracted amoebic dysentery.  And so in Cotonou I was there with Bill Beutel from ABC, Michael Maude (ph.) from LIFE [Magazine].  And they stayed there for a couple of days.  And when they realized they couldn't get in they left, but I stayed.  And I teamed up with Horace Grim (ph.) from Deutsche Press Agency and another guy who was there who had been a Nazi soldier who was a communications expert.  And the three of us hung out together.  And then we were joined by James Wilde with TIME magazine, and the three of us were there until finally I, I--oh, I tried to sneak into Biafra because, like I said, they were barring journalists.  But the Red Cross was flying flights from Dahomey--Cotonou Dahomey, which is now Benin, but then it was Dahomey.  They were flying flights, and so what I did was I went to a bar and I started drinking with the pilots.  And then they agreed to sneak me aboard the plane into Biafra.  And the deal was that they would--when the--when the--when the--the planes left at midnight.  And when the--when the planes loaded up, I would be on the tarmac off to the side; and then they would flash a flashlight from the cabin three times; and I would come out with my gear and run and get aboard, and they would take me to Biafra.  And after that they weren't responsible for me.  I didn't realize I would have probably been killed immediately in Biafra as a spy with no visa, no nothing.  But anyway I remember running towards the plane after I saw the flashlight.  And I'm running across the tarmac with my--had this little bag with my stuff in it, and I'm running as fast as I can.  All of a sudden all the lights in the airport flashed on; all the spotlights had hit me.  And on this speaker came out and said "Stop where you are, stop!"  And it was the head of the Red Cross Mission and--you know, 'cause they were--they were conducting the flights.  And I remember he caught me; they, they apprehended me and, and brought me into the office.  And boy he dressed me down and told me that I was on the verge of creating an international incident because if I had snuck in, they would have just messed up all the relief flights and everything 'cause they had snuck what they call a spy, you know.  So after a while--but I still did stories; I talked to people and, and finally when I realized I just could--there is no way to get in at that time, I, I went back to the United States and straight into the hospital where I stayed for two weeks.
Speaker 2: You still had dysentery that bad huh?
Speaker 1: It still was--I was still bleeding.  The dysentery part was over, but I was still bleeding and they couldn't figure out from where so I went to the hospital for two weeks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I did about fourteen stories.
Story_ID: 56764
Speaker 1: Did you--what did you find out that was different from what we all--we thought we knew already about the war?  'Cause this is a war where the Igbo--a, a faction of the Igbos [Tribe] were--had declared independence, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, you know, it was--it was--what had happened was before independence, the Igbos were the tribe favorite by the British.  And so they were the ones who were given all the good jobs and, and, and even though they were most educated and, and, and they were also--you know, the Igbos were very proud to be Igbos and didn't mind lettin' you know.  And--but they weren't the biggest tribe.  So you had the Hausas and you had the Fulanis, and you had like 250 tribes, but, but the Igbos weren't the big--but they were the chosen ones so to speak.  And so there was a lot of resentment.  And so when independence came, it was payback time for some of the people that had been--felt that they had been discriminated against by the British in favor of the Igbos.  So they started going after the jobs and puttin' the Igbos out and so forth.  The other part of that equation was that a lot of Nigeria's oil is in the bite of Biafra.  And so when Biafra seceded, they took the oil.  I mean, you know, if they could do it successfully you take the oil with you.  And so that was another issue.  And so that--those were the things that were at stake.  But strategically, they were situated so that it was fairly easy for the federals to just cut off access.  And, of course, the other countries, still wanting good relations with Africa's largest country in terms of population, they weren't gonna start bringing supplies into Biafra from the other side and the other border, 'cause they didn't wanna enrage the federals.  So they were pretty much--the Biafrans are pretty much isolated.  And so it was just a pincher--I mean, just a--just an isolation movement that really did--it wasn't so much warfare, but, you know, it--but it was new for me 'cause, you know, I'd been to Morocco, but that's not black Africa.  And so much of black Africa at that time, you know, you picked up from the movies.  You know, even like Tarzan movies, which if you look at in retrospect, never made any logical sense at all.  I mean, you know, here's this young white guy who's in some kind of shipwreck or something like that from England raised by apes, and yet and still, he's the only one who can talk to the animals.  And when the natives, who have lived there since the beginning of time, have problems they go to him; they don't know how to solve 'em?  He solves them?  Please!  But as kids, you know, we all sat up there in the movies and still ate up that stuff just like everybody else and never really took the time to ask ourselves, does this really make any sense?  And so we had some preconceived notions.  So when I--when I first went there and I had this room that looked a cell, and, and I noticed that in the park in, in, in Lagos [Nigeria], people would sleep in the park at night, and I remember sittin' in my room and said I wanna go back to the United States; my wife is pregnant; I wanna go back; you know, I don't--I don't like it here.  And then, then, then I had a conversation with myself.  I said, you know, you idiot, if you don't like your room why don't you ask for another one?  And isn't it nice to be in a place where people can sleep in the park and feel safe?  So I had to just do a whole turnaround with my attitude.  I went down; I got a bigger room.  And so, you know, I conformed and I, I started to have a good time, and I started to really appreciate and enjoy and love Africa.  And I've been back since, except when I came back after that I didn't come back the same way; I came back pretty much aware of what I was gonna find and, and pleasantly, enjoyably, you know.
Story_ID: 56765
Speaker 1: We were talking the Biafran War [Nigerian-Biafran War, 1967-1970], but we can--we can switch off of that if you want to.
Speaker 2: Well, you had come back from that, you know, I guess--so how long did you really stay over in Ni--Nigeria?
Speaker 1: I, I think I was there about four weeks all together [in 1969].  I--you know--two weeks in Nigeria; two weeks in Cotonou [now Benin].  Because we didn't have a bureau there, so it was like, you know, you're going in there as an assignment to, to do, you know, a series of pieces on the war, but not to continually cover it.
Speaker 2: Okay, and were there any people that you met there that you are (unclear), you know, like, that stand out as, you know, (unclear) it was it that--
Speaker 1: You know, I don't remember the government officials too well.  The, the people I remember are the regular people.  Like, I had a guy, a room attendant, who-- I would come in sometimes at night and be so tired that I'd just take my pants off to crawl in the bed, and the money would fall out on the floor.  And the next morning, I'd have an interview or something, and I'd get up early and just leave it there and go.  And I would come back and find the, the money stacked neatly in--by denomination.  And, you know, this is in a country where, you know, compared to the United States people are really poor and, you know, and here's a guy that's so honest that, you know, he takes the money--he could have put it in his pocket; I wouldn't have noticed it--and stacks it up.  Another--another thing that happened that just said a lot to me about Africa and Nigeria was I used to file my copy at the--at the--at the Reuter's office in the British High Commission in downtown Lagos [Nigeria].  And when I moved to the hotel out on the highland I used to take a cab in, and I used to pay a, a rate.  And I remember--it was about four bob, four shillings.  And, and I remember one time I took a cab in, and I got there and the guy said five bob.  I said no, it's four bob, and we got in an argument in downtown Lagos in the car.  And I said to him, let's call that policeman over there and ask him how much.  And he jumped out of the car--out of the cab, and I got out of the cab.  And then he pointed to his cab number--say, you see this cab number?  This is cab number 74; don't you ever get in my cab again.  And I said I don't wanna get in your cab again; anybody that tries to cheat me--I said, here's four bob; that's all you're gonna get.  Meanwhile, we got a crowd around us because, you know, we were having this argument.  And it's very bad form to hit somebody, so there wasn't a fight.  You know, there wasn't gonna be a fight, but we just really back and forth.  And so I gave him fought--four bob and that was it.  And I walked away and did my business at the British High Commission, took a cab back to the hotel, and I'm still mad.  So I go to the doorman of the hotel--a big huge guy--and I said, tell me this: how much is the cab fare from here to the British High Commission?  And he looked around and--all the cabdrivers used to be under a big banyan tree down next to the hotel--he started to reach for them.  I said don't call those guys; I said they're gonna cheat me; I said you know how much it is; how much is the price?  He said five bob, and I said, oh; I said, okay.  So I went in; and I got a shilling; and I put it in an envelope; and I went out to the doorman, and I said, can you do me a favor?  Can you give this to the driver of cab 74 and tell him it's from the black American?  And he said yes.  I said 'cause I don't--and tell him I said I don't like being cheated, but I don't wanna cheat anybody.  And he said okay.  I thought that was the end of it.  The next morning I come down in the hotel.  The desk clerk stops me.  He says, Mr. Boyce; I said, what?  He said you have a letter, and I said I do?  I couldn't figure out who it was from.  He said yes.  It was an envelope.  I opened it up.  It was a sixpence, and I knew where it was from.  He split the difference.  And that taught me as much about the richness and, and, and the, the people and, and the honesty and, and everything, as anything I could've ever gotten out of a book--that this guy was saying okay, I'm gonna split the difference with you; we're gonna be fair.  And I knew--nobody had to tell me where it was from.  There was no note, nothing, just a sixpence.  And I never for--I've never forgot that.
Story_ID: 56766
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.  So, now '69 [1969]--the fall of '69 [1969] is when Fred Hampton is murdered in Chicago [Illinois] and, and you were talking about going to the press conference with O--Ovie Carter.
Speaker 2: Well before that, they had sent--when the shootout happened and Fred was killed, they had sent a reporter--the Chicago Tribune had sent reporters over to cover it, and I wasn't sent.  And I knew I had met Fred, and I knew his brother [Bill Hampton] and so forth.  I'd covered, you know, some of the things that they had done.  And so I went in to my editor and I said, you know, how come I'd never been asked to, you know, go over there?  I said--you know, because the question was, who shot what?--who fired what?
Speaker 1: They had the door with the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --bullet holes coming in instead of out.
Speaker 2: But I had been an evidence technician with the Chicago Police Department.  This was the kind of stuff I knew something about.  And he said, oh, my goodness; he said, I forgot you had that background.  So they sent me over there, and I went through the house and did a story about how it really looked like a shoot-in instead of a shootout.  Because from everything I saw, all the gunfire came from outside.
Speaker 1: Now were you the first to poi--point that out?
Speaker 2: No, there was a guy with the New York Times, but he hired a forensic specialist or something.  And so I don't know if our articles ran at the same time or if his was before mine.  I don't think his was after mine, but he hired somebody.  I knew from my training.  I was the first reporter to ask Eddie Hanrahan [Edward Hanrahan, Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney] was he gonna resign at a press conference.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the state's attorney--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was the one--
Speaker 1: --of Cook County.
Speaker 2: --if you go back and look at, at those tapes at the press conferences, I was the guy that said, "Are you gonna resign?"
Speaker 1: Now--I had another ques--
Speaker 2: And that was basically the end of his career.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ed--Edward Hanrahan; he tried--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get re-elected again, but it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did not work.
Speaker 2: Oh, and then a--oh, I'm sorry; I did a piece on Fred and his background.  And Mark Clark was the other guy that was killed, and very few people knew about him.  And I remember I went down to Peoria [Illinois] and did an interview with his family and ran a story in the Tribune about him.  And I think that was the only story that was actually done just on him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, yeah, a lot of people don't even remember Mark Clark at all.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that--yeah.
Speaker 2: But I, I went down to Peoria and interviewed that family--spent a day with them--a good day.
Story_ID: 56767
Speaker 1: Now something happened that I would imagine--I wasn't in Chicago [Illinois], but I imagine it would probably have rocked the black journalists in Chicago is that [Lutrell] Lu Palmer actually was--lost his job at the Chicago Daily News over the [Black] Panther issue.
Speaker 2: You know, he might have--you know, that was--you know, Lu and I were friends and--you know, and I think that was another example of how the so-called "liberal papers" really weren't as liberal as they pretended to be.  Because I remember Lu used to complain to me about stuff that he couldn't do that he wanted to do, and Lu was doggone good journalist.  And Betty--now Betty was very sweet--Betty Washington.  She had been with the [Chicago] Defender.  She was very, very good, but she, she wasn't a complaining type; she just did her, her job.  And, and Lou wasn't a complaining type either, but he was--he was rather militant.
Story_ID: 56768
Speaker 1: Now what--I didn't--I don't even know the Betty Washington story, but--
Speaker 2: Well Betty, I think she died of cancer at a fairly early age, but she had been with the Chicago Defender, one of their top reporters.  And she was hired by the [Chicago] Daily News, so she and [Lutrell] Lu Palmer and there at the Daily News.  And then after I left, Vernon Jarrett was hired by the Tribune, and--as a columnist.  Clarence Page was hired while I was there.  The second person they hired--black person they hired after they hired me was Pam Johnson, who, the last time I heard was the head of the journalism department at Western Kentucky University [Bowling Green, Kentucky].  She was the first person of color to be an editor for Gannett--I mean a publisher for Gannett paper.  She went back to school and got her PhD.  And then after Pam they hired Angela Parker.  I can't remember whether they hired Clarence Page or Angela Parker first.  But I remember when they hired Clarence Page because I was invited to a cocktail party for new recruits that they were tryin' to recruit.  And they said they had two black possible candidates they were interested in, and I--I remember they said could I come to the party.  And I remember telling them, I said if you are asking me to come to the party just so you can show that you've got a black person on staff--I said forget it; I'm not gonna do that.  And they said no, it's just that we'd like you there because there may be some questions they're uncomfortable asking us that they wouldn't mind asking you.  I said okay, if that's the circumstance I'll go.  And I remember I went to the party and it was-Clarence was there in a dashiki and a big fro.  And they had another black guy who was conservatively dressed, wore glasses.  I think he was from the University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska].  Clarence made it clear through his body language when I got there that he did not want to talk to me, 'cause I think I he thought I was their token and so I wasn't gonna push it.  But the other guy was, you know, amenable to talking, so I chatted with him.  Clarence, meanwhile, was surrounded by some of these other younger white candidates, and you know, he was in his militant phrase--big fro, dashiki, and they were just fascinated with him.  And so after the--after the cocktail party, the editor came to me and they said, well what did you think?  And I said, well, I didn't--I didn't talk to the--to the--to the guy from Ohio; and I said, but the other guy seemed like he was really nice; he's really sharp.  He said, well we're not gonna be able to get him; the New York Times already hired him.  And so--and they said, well what about the other guy?  I said, well I didn't really get a chance to talk to him.  They said, well he's kinda militant, isn't he?  And I said I don't know, but--I mean, isn't that what--isn't that a good thing in a way?  Don't you want some diversity on this--on this paper, maybe somebody to ask some questions?  And so that's--that was my comment about Clarence, even though I hadn't talked to him.  About three or four days later I'm walking down the hall and here comes this brother--three-piece suit, glasses, dressed to the nines--and he sees me, and I don't recognize him.  He says hi, and I said hi.  He said they called me back; they called me back.  I said, yeah, who-- who?"  He said, remember me, I was at the--it was Clarence.  He cut his fro.  He had a three-piece suit on.  They had called him back for another interview.  And so I said--but now he's talkin'--so I said hey, man; I said that's great; I said that's wonderful, good luck.  And so they hired him.
Story_ID: 56769
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story (laughter).  I wish I could--I think we--well I think we finished his [Clarence Page] interview.  I wish I could ask him about that now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well he wrote--he wrote a column about me one time.  I think it was for Emerge [Magazine], and it was how when he came to the [Chicago] Tribune he didn't wanna have much to do with me because he thought I was a sellout, and he knew I had to be a token.  And then he went on in the column to explain that he later realized that he had made a mistake and that he was wrong and that he--he basically apologized in the column.  And, and, and we did have an, an, an, an incident.  And I like Clarence; I like him a lot, and I think he's very talented.  But I remember when he was still in the Neighborhood News, I had a friend of mine--a very good friend of mine, a white guy, who was in the Neighborhood News as an editor.  And he went to a party and he told me about it.  And Clarence was there, and Clarence was the only black guy there of Tribune people.  And my friend was gettin' ready to leave the party and somebody--my name came up.  And Clarence, when he heard my name, spoke up among all these people and said, oh, yeah, well him, he's an Uncle Tom, he's a this, and that.  And I remember my friend stopping at the door.  He said, I stopped at the door and I turned around and looked him and I said, how dare you say that?  You don't even know him.  He's my friend and you don't know anything about him.  And he--we, we saw the ironic situation of a white guy defending a black guy to a black guy in a room full of white people.  And he told me about that.  He told me about doing it.  And I didn't think anything of it.  Shortly after that, Clarence was drafted.  Clarence said--he let everybody around the Tribune know that he was not going to go if he was drafted.  He was not going to Vietnam.  He was drafted; he went to Vietnam.  He went to Vietnam as public relations.  He served his time in Vietnam; he came back.  There used to be a bar and restaurant across the street from the Trib [Chicago Tribune] that when I was with TIME magazine, I was--I went there when I was with the Trib.  When I was with the TIME--TIME magazine, I used to go there too.  And I remember I went in there one day for lunch and some Tribune people were in there and they called me over--'cause Clarence had just come back from the service.  And they said they were having lunch and would I join them, and I did.  And they said, well why don't you sit next to Clarence?  And so I hadn't seen Clarence since I heard that story.  So Clarence sat down next to me, and I really didn't say much.  And Clarence started a--started a conversation, and I said, you know what, Clarence?  I said, I gotta be honest with--I gotta tell you somethin'.  I said, I was a little bothered by something I heard.  And so I told him what my friend had said.  And I remember him saying--looking at me and saying, you know, I guess all I can say to that is I think I've grown up a lot since then, and I'm sorry.  And I said, hey, man, it's all cool.  And we've been friends ever since.  And he's--I like him a lot; he's one of my favorite people, and I--he's--he deserves the Pulitzers [Pulitzer Prizes] he won; he's smart and he's a good guy, and I like him.
Story_ID: 56770
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, that's a good story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now let's see, in--
Speaker 2: I'm proud of him [Clarence Page] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't why I didn't do this, but--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --I didn't--I didn't cover the assassination of Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  We didn't talk about that and the [Chicago] Tribune and what was going on at the Tri--Tribune in those days.  What, what--
Speaker 2: The--you know, I didn't have anything to do with assassination of Dr. King.  I wasn't down in Memphis [Tennessee].  What did happen, however, was after that, that same year--
Speaker 1: This is '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].  The SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] decided they were gonna hold their convention in Memphis just to show that they could.  So I went down to Memphis for the Tribune to cover it.  Like I said, I'd gotten to the point where I could pick and choose, and so I was interested in covering things in the black community.  I always was, but I just wanted to make sure everybody knew I could do all the other stuff too.  And so I went down there and like I said, it was the first convention they'd had since Dr. King was killed.  Reverend [Ralph] Abernathy was there.  The convention was scheduled for Chicago [Illinois], and part of it was we wanted to know--that they wanted to know what SCLC had planned for the Democratic Convention, in terms of demonstrations and so forth.  'Cause everybody was talking about what they were gonna do at the [1968] Democratic Convention.  And while I was down there I hung out with a, a woman reporter--a white woman reporter for the Washington Post and a white guy from UPI [United Press Internationl], both of whom had covered civil rights.  And we were together when we heard a rumor that Andrew Young had been given 24 hours to get out of town.  And the guy that had given him twenty-four hours to get out of town was a guy by the name of [Lance] "Sweet Willie Wine" [Watson].  Sweet Willie Wine lived in Memphis.  He was the head of a group called--I'm tryin' to remember the name of the group; it was a--it was a group; some people said it was a gang; some people said it was a--
Speaker 1: Oh, the Invaders.
Speaker 2: Invaders--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that were involved in the parade when Dr. King left--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and came back, and that's when he was assassinated.  Apparently, Willie Wine and Andrew had gotten in an argument.  And Andrew said if it hadn't been for you Dr. King would be alive today or words to that effect.  To which Willie Wine responded, you got twenty-four hours to get out of town or I'm gone burn this place down.
Speaker 1: What, what place.
Speaker 2: Memphis.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they wanted to make sure.  This is the first time they had a convention after Dr. King's assassination, and they went back to make a point symbolically.  And here now we've got this guy who was in the Invaders saying if Andrew Young is not out of town in twenty-four hours, he's gone burn the place down, he and his people.  That was the biggest story that we had gotten so far.  So we needed to find out.  I mean, this--we could just--the press was still not that fair-minded when it came to issues of race as it is today.  So there were still a lot of people in the mainstream media who would love to have written a story about how everything broke down and Andrew Young threatened, and it's a fiasco.  But there were only three of us knew it; nobody else knew it.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: We three, we're the only three reporters who knew it.
Story_ID: 56771
Speaker 1: And you didn't pad--pass it--
Speaker 2: So we [a Washington Post Reporter, a UPI Reporter, and Joseph Boyce] went together to Jesse [Jackson], and we asked Jesse--he was on--standing on the steps of the--of the--of the convention place.  And we asked Jesse was it true what we had heard.  And instead of answering us, Jesse said, "Now y'all got something to write about.  Why don't y'all go write about that now?"  He was mad, but that confirmed that something happened, so we found out where Andrew [Young] was, and we went to this hotel.  And we went to his hotel room and we let us in--he let us in, and we asked him was it true and he said yes.  And he said in the heat of the discussion he had said something like that, and he had been given twenty-four hours to get out of town.  And we said, well what are you gonna do?  And he said he didn't know; he was gonna try to smooth things over, but he admitted it happened and that he had been threatened.  And the three of us left his apartment and stood in the--in the hallway outside of his hotel room, and I remember saying, how long you been covering civil rights?  And how long have you been covering civil rights?  And so the three of us talked, and we said if this story gets out this is gonna be the headline from Memphis [Tennessee].  And so the three of us made a decision then that we were gonna give Andrew a certain amount of time, and we were not gonna write about it until that time had passed.  So we went back and we told him.  And it was a few hours and he managed to smooth it over, and that story never ran. Nobody ever knew about it because the three of us agreed that, even though we were competitors, we were never gonna write that story.  Because we knew because we had covered civil rights what that could have done to The [Civil Rights] Movement at that crucial time in Tennessee.  Because people would have said--people who were anti-civil rights, anti-SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Convention] see there, they just can't get it together; they threaten each other; the whole thing is coming apart now that King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is dead, blah, blah, blah.  Fast forward to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: This is still '68' [1968], right?
Speaker 2: Still '68' [1968].
Story_ID: 56772
Speaker 1: --the convention [1968 Democratic National Convention].  Jerry Rubin (ph.), the yippies, the hippies, all in Chicago [Illinois]; Jerry Yu--Rubin, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, all these people are in Chicago.  The city is in an uproar.  The Sunday before the convention week I'm at a party with my fiancee who became my second wife.  We were married actually for forty-two years, but then we were dating. I'm at a [Chicago] Tribune--a Tribune staffer had a party up on the North Shore [Illinois] somewhere.  And I'm up there tryin' to impress my wife with my skills at badminton, and I do something to my foot, my ankle.  And so I'm on medical.  I mean, I can't go out and cover the convention until Wednesday; meanwhile, reporters are gettin' beaten and arrested in Lincoln Park [Chicago, Illinois]; fights are breaking out; people are gettin' arrested.  People were saying that it's no longer meet the press, it's beat the press.  And all that stuff is, is leading up and the convention hadn't even really actually started yet.  So on Wednesday--that Wednesday, I am, am, am okay to go out on the street, and so I, I go to work.  I'm not supposed to start 'til 12:30.  So I go to work and I'm driving and I come off Lake Shore Drive [Chicago, Illinois], and I go over to Bal-Balboa [sic, Balbo Drive], over towards the Conrad Hilton [Hotel], because I wanna see what's going on.  And I remember stopping at, at Columbus Drive there between the outer drive and, and Michigan [Avenue], and an unmarked squad car pulls up alongside me with six plainclothes cops.  And the window rolls down, and it's the sergeant who recognizes me, because a lot of cops got to know me as a evidence technician 'cause I was all over the city.  And the guy looks at me, he says, hey, Boyce; he says, how's it going?  And so I said, well fine.  I've been sick, I said.  But, I said, I'm, I'm out and I'm gonna cover this today.  I said, but I was sick.  And he laughed and he said, our guys didn't get to you in Lincoln Park last night, did they, ha, ha, ha?  And the other cops in the squad car they all laughed too.  And I looked down and I said, you didn't have to go to emergency and sign out your cops did you?  And they stopped laughing and I stopped laughing.  And they rolled their window up and I rolled my window up.  And I said this is gonna be a bad day.  So when I got into the office, I was assigned to cover the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] Mule Train which started on the West Side.  It was an actual mule train, and at that time symbolically they used to wear the bib overalls.  And they were gonna roll--march into the Loop [Chicago] area as a demonstration.
Story_ID: 56773
Speaker 1: This--
Speaker 2: Now this is getting to what really happened in front of the Conrad Hilton [Hotel] and why it happened, which you have not seen anywhere.  You've read about what happened, but you have not read about why it happened.  And so I'm marching with the Mule Train; meanwhile, the cops in front of the Conrad Hilton have cordoned off an area across Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois] over to Grant Park [Chicago] and sides of the Hilton.  Because the [1968 Democratic National Convention] delegates were in the Hilton, that was a convention hotel.  And I remember they had the cameras up on the--on the second and third mezzanine and all that looking out.  By this time things had gotten better between the demonstrators, the white demon--they were all whites mostly--the demonstrators and the police.  And one of the reasons they were all white was because Rennie Davis and some of the others had tried to recruit some of the black leaders in Chicago to bring their people out to demonstrate.  One of the guys I knew was George Lucas with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  Now I was a reporter, but I was also a member of CORE.  And CORE knew I was a reporter, but they let me attend their meetings.  And I remember talking to George before the convention started, and he said Rennie Davis had called him and wanted him to get people out to demonstrate.  And in his words, he said, "I told Rennie you can go to hell."  And I said, "George, why did you say that?"  He said, "'Cause this is a white man's thing; this ain't no black man's thing."  Because he was prescient, he knew that if there was gone be violence, he knew who was gonna bear the brunt of it, and he didn't wanna subject people to that.  And sure enough, he was right.  Because when we--by the time we got to the perimeter around the Conrad Hilton, it looked like things had really--the tensions had really eased between the demonstrators and the cops.  'Cause I remember seeing demonstrators sitting on the back--the cops used to ride these three-wheel motorcycles--and they were sitting on the back of the motorcycles, the demonstrators were, chattin' with the cops and everything.  So when we got to the perimeter, the Mule Train, Reverend [Ralph] Abernathy asked one of the police commanders can we go inside the perimeter as a symbolic gesture?  I just wanna make a few words--say a few words.  'Cause he knew all the cameras were--would be on there, and it was an open space and would great symbolically for them to pull the mule train and the wagons in there and he'd say a few words.  And the cop was--the commander was kind of reluctant, but he let them through, and I went through with them 'cause I was with them.  And all of a sudden, one of the demonstrators--one of the white guys said, what about us?  'Cause they wanted to get in there too, and they'd, they'd been kept from it all day.  And they said, what about us?  And the chant took up: "What about us?" "What about us?" "What about us?" "What about us?"  And it started getting nasty, and the police started to get nervous.  And they started, you know, backing up towards the crowd, and all of a sudden--I don't know, somebody threw something or something.  And it sounded like--I heard a sound like a wind; it was--ssshhhswooosh--and to my left--I was facing the Conrad Hilton--to my left they broke through the police barrier, and all hell broke loose.  And so the police were fightin' the demonstrators; the demonstrators were fightin' the police; the Mule Train, those people didn't know what to do 'cause they were in the middle of it.  I looked around and there was a guy who had been in the police academy with me who had been a semi-pro football player.  And he said, Boyce, grab my belt.  And I reached over--he was a cop; he was in uniform.  I grabbed his belt and he was fightin', and I held onto his belt.  When, when I grabbed his belt, two or three other policemen saw me grab his belt, and they came after me.  And he said, no, no, no, he's all right, he's all right, he's all right, and they left me alone.  And I held onto his belt while he was wailing away, and it was chaos, absolute chaos.
Story_ID: 56774
Speaker 1: All right, all right, okay, continue.
Speaker 2: So, meanwhile, like I said, it was chaos.  And then all of a sudden, the police start pushing the crowd--the crowd back on the sidewalk at the Conrad Hilton [Hotel] to get them back up on the sidewalk.  What they didn't realize was there was no place for them to go.  They were up against the building.  And as the police were pushing these people back, they were pushed up against the plate glass windows of the drugstore and the stores at the Conrad Hilton, and they broke the plate glass window.  Some of these people were delegates.  They broke the plate glass windows and fell in, and when the--you could hear the plate glass windows crack and shatter.  Then the police really went crazy 'cause they thought that the demonstrators were breaking the windows.  And they were beatin' people with clubs, and a photographer from the Chicago Defender ran up to the police commander and said stop your men; stop your men; these people have no place to go; you're, you're pushin 'em up.  And the commander, he was lost.  And he looked and he told his men to stop.  They were beyond control.  They didn't listen to him, and he went over to his own men and began physically pulling them off of people.  Meanwhile, people were falling inside the stores in the Conrad Hilton and, of course, they were running in the stores trying to get out.  Some of 'em were cut and so forth.  And then the police went crazy.  So that's what happened.  That's what caused it.  Meanwhile, the Mule Train that I was with said, let's get out of here; let's get out of here.  And so they hooked up the horses--the mules--and they broke through the crowd going south and turned right at the south end of the Conrad Hilton, and I went with him.  And just as we got around the corner there was a 15-year-old boy on the mule train, and he passed out in my arms.  And I waited 'til somebody looked after him on, on the--on the ground, and then I started to go back to work.  I went to police headquarters first, and I ran into Paul Delaney with the New York Times, who was covering it.  Then I saw a woman that I knew.  She had lived in Cuba.  She was a lawyer.  And I knew her and I told her to go home--get out of the area as fast as she can--and then I went to the Chicago Tribune.  And I remember going into the city room, and I'm saying you are not gone believe what happened out there.  And I started telling people in the city room what had happened, and so somebody said you need to talk to--and his last name was Murray; I can't remember his first name--who was the news editor.  And he was a big kinda gruff conservative guy--said you need to talk to him to tell him what happened; that's a story.  So I, I--he came over and I told him--explained what happened.  And I never will forget he only had one comment to make.  He said, I cannot believe that the Chicago Police would ever behave in that fashion, and he turned around on his heel and walked away.  And if you look at the newspapers back at that time, every paper in Chicago, including papers also in New York and other places had that story and the Chicago Tribune did not have it.  The only time the Chicago Tribune wrote about it was at the end of the week they put out a special issue on the convention.  And one of the editors was a young reporter/writer who later became a columnist by the name of Michael Killian.  And Michael got that story in the paper.  But nobody ever came back to me and asked me what happened.  What it was written from was accounts that had been in other newspapers.  But that's not the first time that the Chicago Tribune changed a story I did or did something.  There was one other time, and other than that it's a great paper.  It was a great paper with me, but there were just a couple of the old guard there that you just couldn't deal with.  One of them was Don Maxwell, who was the editor.  He was the first editor after Robert McCormick.
Story_ID: 56775
Speaker 1: He [Don Maxwell] was also a trustee of Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  And in the '60's [1960s] Northwestern University administration was taken over by black students, including a guy by the name of James Turner who was a student there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's now a famous political scientist and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --historian-
Speaker 1: Well they took over--
Speaker 2: --at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 1: --the administration building [Bursar's Office], and there was a great deal of concern because they had just bought a new mainframe computer and it was in the basement of that building.  And these students had taken over the administration building on a Friday night.  On a Saturday--no, it was on Sut--I wasn't sent out there 'til I think a Sunday.  And I got out there--I was the only black reporter out there standing outside.  And I'm standing there outside the administration building, and I hear something--pssst, pssst, hey, hey--and I'm wonderin' who's calling me, and I look and it's somebody in the administration building.  The window was cracked open.  They said, who are you?  And I said I'm Joe Boyce; they said, who are you with?  I said Chicago Tribune.  They say, you are?  I said yeah.  They say, you coverin' this?  I said yeah.  They say, you wanna come inside?  I said yeah.  They snuck me in through the window.  I climbed in through the window and spent the day inside the building--the only reporter--and wrote about what they were doing.  And what they were doing was preparing for exams.  And to make sure that nobody got too rambunctious, they put two people on the mainframe computer in the basement to make sure that nobody would mess with it, to protect it.  At some point during that day, they reached a rapprochement with the administration.  And they agreed to exit the building, but the administration wanted to do a walkthrough to make sure everything was okay.  I was inside with the students when the administration came in and did the walkthrough.  And I remember them saying stuff like: my goodness, this place was cleaner than it was when the people left it Friday; they even washed the dishes.  And they had.  The students left it immaculate, okay.  I phoned in my story to a rewrite guy who was a buddy of mine by the name of Rod Gibson.  This was actually on a Saturday night.  I'm sorry; it wasn't a Sunday.  Because their story appeared in Sunday's paper, and it was an eight banner--it was an eight column banner headline in the next day's paper, but it didn't have my byline on it.  Rod had called me up the night before at home and said, Joe, your story is done, but I didn't put your byline on it.  And I said, oh, why not?  He said, because I didn't think you'd want it.  And what had happened was, he had written the story the way I had dictated it, and Don Maxwell happened to be in the city room that night.  And like I said, he was a Northwestern trustee, and he was very much against these demonstrators.  And when he saw the story that was prepared from the paper, even though he had not been there--he had not covered it, and I had--he rewrote the first three paragraphs of the story.  And the lead was something like Northwestern University administrator's capitulated to the demands of angry black radicals.  I mean, it was very negative.  He wrote his own story based on his own biases, and Rod didn't put my name on it.  That's the only other time at the Tribune where you could say that it was censored--something that I had done was censored.
Story_ID: 56776
Speaker 1: So is it often the case that things that--these kind of things are done by--or, or, or a rewrite of a story like this or de--decisions are made by individuals that don't necessarily reflect a policy or anything or just they're things that are just done because--
Speaker 2: Rare.
Speaker 1: --they can be done.
Speaker 2: Really rare.  Really rare.  The [Chicago] Tribune--I was there four years (1966-1970), wrote many, many stories--nobody ever tampered with them.  No, in fact, I got along with--very well with editors, 'cause the first question I always ask when I saw an editor do something to my copy which doesn't make it better.  And if the answer was yes, that was the end of discussion.  And it usually was yes.  But this was an egregious--but Maxwell--I mean, you know, he was the old guard, and he, he just felt that he could--he could do that 'cause he was the boss.  But he had long, probably, since abandoned the ethics of journalism and the standards if it conflicted with his personal beliefs.
Story_ID: 56777
Speaker 1: Okay, now, '68 [1968] and '69 [1969]--in '69 [1969] you covered Resurrection City [Washington, D.C.] too.  That's an extension of the--
Speaker 2: Resurrection City.
Speaker 1: --Poor People's Campaign--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the Mule Train and all that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and going out to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Well I continued on.  Yeah, I--the reason I, I covered Resurrection City was that was not something the [Chicago] Tribune assigned me to.  Wha--you know, that was making a lot of news and, and, and the stuff I was reading in the Chicago papers was what I call drive-by journalism.  And like they would go--and you'd have a columnist or something and--no, no black reporters--and, and, and, they would go and they'd spend an afternoon in Resurrection City.  And it rained a lot (unclear) and it was really muddy, and they'd, they'd write--instead of writing about the movement and what it meant and what they were tryin' to accomplish, they'd write about how muddy it was, how dirty everything was, how unorganized everything was, and I said, no, that's not the story.  And I said I, I wanna know what it's like to live there.  So I got 'em to send me--and I took a room in The Hay-Adams [Hotel, Washington, D.C.], and I put on my African stuff and went over to Resurrection City with a toothbrush and a few things.  And I went over there to move in and join the movement.  And they had a city hall, and I remember going to city hall 'cause that's where you had to register.  And there was a young woman there, and she said, well, you need to see Hosea Williams.  'Cause my story was: I didn't have a place to stay, and I wanted to join the movement--stuff like that that probably ethically, you know, I should have let 'em know I was a reporter.  And eventually they knew I was a reporter.  But Hosea was givin' the speech, and when he--when he got through with his speech, I stopped him and, and told him who I wa--you know, that I was there and I wanted to join the movement and could he help me register.  And he said, stand right here; I'll be right back, and he left and I didn't see it begin.  So the young lady came out and she said, you still here?  And I said, yeah, I--I've been waitin' for Hosea.  And she said well--she said come on; I'll, I'll, I'll give you--you had to wear a wristband--she said I'll, I'll give you a wristband.  I said, how can you get a wristband?  She said, I'm the one who makes it.  So she made me a wristband, and the quid pro quo for that was that I had to move in--she and her sister were livin' in the A-frame [shacks].  She was from Wilmington, Delaware, and I had to move in with them.  There had been several rapes in Resurrection City, and they wanted a male in their A-frame.  And so she took me to the A-frame, introduced me to the sister, then looked under a cot on the ground and pulled out a plastic bag.  And in the plastic bag was a .32 Automatic and a box shells.  And she said okay, this is where it is.  And I said okay.  And so they put up a blanket and essentially made it two rooms, and I had one room and they had another.  And so I lived there, and so I started going out on demonstrations.
Story_ID: 56778
Speaker 1: I went to non-violent training where they beat you up, and if, if you--if you responded or reacted in a violent way, then they throw you out; so you just had to take it, 'cause they weren't gone let you demonstrate if you could not be beat up.  So they did that; that was at an Episcopal church somewhere in Washington [D.C].  And so one day I'm in a march, and this guy comes up to me and he says I know you.  He says you're a cop.  He had been a field organizer in Chicago [Illinois] when I'd been a cop, and he thought I was there to spy.  And I told him no, you know, that I wasn't and that I was a reporter.  And he thought it was all a lie and all a cover.  And so he finally said I--so I finally said, well, I can't convince you.  I said, what do you plan to do?  He said, I'm gonna wait for you to do your thing, then I'm gonna do mine.  Well, he was from Wilmington, Delaware, the same place the two girls that I was staying with was, but he headed a group from Wilmington called the Blackie Blacks; it was another gang.  'Cause you had gang representation in (unclear), so that was the deal.  So the next morning we were supposed to go on another demonstration.  And the sister in the same A-frame with me said, don't go back to the camp while we're in the march.  And I said, why not?  She said, the word is out on you.  So I could just see myself lying face down in the reflecting pool.  So the only possibility I had was Jesse [Jackson].  And so I, I, I--so I approach this guy and I said--I said, look--I said, let me talk to you.  He said, I ain't--I've got nothin' to say to you.  And so I said, I just wanna tell you something--I got nothing to say to you.  I said, look, you gone talk to me now or it's gone be you and me right here.  And he stopped; he said okay.  I said, let's go see Jesse.  So we went to Jesse and I said, Jesse, you know who I am.  I said, will you tell this guy I'm not a policeman anymore?  So Jesse told him, and so later on the guy came to me and said, yeah, I knew you weren't a policeman.  He said, I, I already knew you weren't a policeman.  He said, but I thought you were gonna--he said, I knew who you were staying with; I thought you were gonna write somethin' about the Wilmington delegation and some money that went missing.  Well I knew about the money and I knew how much, and I knew it had gone missing, but that wasn't the story I was gonna write about.  But anyway, that took the heat off.
Story_ID: 56779
Speaker 1: Now let me--let me back up on this kinda.  This is--now this is a microcosm or somethin' that might have greater implications.  What--so what, what happened in the Wilmington [Delaware] delegation with some money?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well what had happened was they had apparently had some contributions from people in Wilmington to help pay for part of the Wilmington delegation, and about $2,000 apparently had been misappropriated.  And I knew about it; it had heard about it, but that's not what I was gone write about.  Because you needed proof to write about something like that, and I didn't have any proof; it was just rumor.  But that's what he thought I was gonna write about, and I told--I told him no.  So anyway, that took the heat off of me there.  And I remember I stayed a couple of days longer, and the last thing we did was a twenty four-hour vigil--vigil around the agricultural department.  And we walked around the block for twenty four hours, and I, I stayed there and slept out in the rain; it rained that night.  We stayed out in the rain, and the next morning I walked around the building again.  I was carrying a sign, and when we got to the corner of the agricultural building, they turned and the group--the, the, the marchers turned and went to the right, and I kept on going with my sign.  I just walked down the street with my sign straight to The Hay-Adams Hotel and, and went to my room and, and, and went to bed and went back and wrote a story.  And it was two columns on the--on the front page of the Sunday paper and all of page two, with no ads, about what right--life was supposedly really like in Resurrection City [Washington, D.C.].  And I still have those boots that I wore in Resurrection City with the Resurrection City mud on 'em.  I never wore 'em again after that.  I kept 'em with the mud on 'em 'cause it was so historic.

Speaker 1: In retrospect, what did--do, do you think that that accomplished anything?  I mean, the, the Resurrection City [Washington, D.C.] and the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Everything that occurred in The Civil Rights Movement had a purpose.  It, it didn't have to be "successful"--and successful by whose definition?  If you look at the way things are today and the, the strides that have been made since the Movement really took hold.  I mean, we've had a civil rights movement in this country every since we've been a country.  But what people commonly refer to The Civil Rights Movement began with Birmingham bus boycott [1955].  If you look at everything that has occurred in race relations since then and, and the timeframe in which its occurred, it's very, very difficult to say that The Civil Rights Movement was not successful, ex--except for people who have--who don't--who may not understand what The Civil Rights Movement is about.  A lot--a lot of people thought, and maybe some still think, that The Civil Rights Movement was about integration; it was not; it was not about integration.  I mean, I even had to tell people at the Wall Street Journal that I work with who wanted to do a story about the success of the Civil Rights Movement and whether it achieved integration.  We never did that series because I told them it wasn't about integration to begin with, and if you said that, you were wrong.  It was about desegregation, and there's a difference.  It was to bring an end to the laws, the traditions, the practices, the customs that made African Americans second class citizens in this country.  It was not about African Americans fighting for the right to live next to, eat next to, sleep next to white people.  We just wanted the same opportunities to succeed and fail and to live in this country as everybody else.  Integration can be a byproduct of desegregation, but that's not what it was about.  It was about getting rid of those laws and customs that made us second class citizens.  I never heard a black kid say, gee whiz, I, I--I've been dying to sit next to a white kid in class.  I never heard a black person say I'm dying next to a white person in a restaurant.  I'm dying to live next to a white person in their neighborhood.  It's I'd like the choice to eat where I wanna eat, be educated where I wanna be educated, and live where I wanna live like anybody else; that's what it was about.  And if you look about it--if you look at it in that frame of reference, there was very, very little that I can think of--I can't think of anything in The Civil Rights Movement that was done that in some way or another did not have a purpose or some kind of positive effect.  Mistakes were made, strategies sometimes failed, but it was all towards an end.  It was a work in progress, and it still is.  You know, the problem is, is that so many people today who should be involved in a different way, in trying to reach this kind of parody, are not involved anymore.  We, we live in what is called a post-racial society--no such thing.
Story_ID: 56781
Speaker 1: Okay, now in 1970 is a big transition.  You, you go, go over to TIME magazine.  Now, now TIME is physically, as you were saying, located--
Speaker 2: In New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --when the headquarters were in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: There was a guy by the name of Paul Hathaway who was a correspondent with TIME magazine.  First time I had ever seen a black correspondent with TIME magazine.  And I'd met him, you know, coverin' stories with national interests.  And there were so few black reporters for mainstream media; we all knew each other.  And most of us did.  And we'd all joked, and we had our own little fraternity, so to speak, or, or--there were woman too, so--in the fraternity--but we all knew each other.  You could count us on the fingers of both hands.  And so Paul Hathaway--I always used to kid Paul Hathaway when he'd come--when he'd come in the newsroom or something like that.  And I'd say, oh, Mr. Hathaway, TIME magazine; can I carry your typewriter, please, please?  What can I do for you Mr. Hathaway?  Do you have a phone?  And everybody would crack up, and he'd laugh and everybody'd get, get a kick out of it.  And I thought that was all there was.  You know, he was just a good guy.  And I got a letter, and it was from Bill Trent, who was with TIME, Inc. in, in personnel.  And Bill Trent had been formerly the head of the United Negro College Fund, but now he was working for TIME, Inc. trying to help diversify them.  And he wrote me a letter, and he said, Paul Hathaway tells me--and he said some good things about me.  And he says I'm coming to Chicago [Illinois] on business.  Can you and I get together for a drink?  And I wrote him back.  We'd do things by letters then, not email.  I wrote him back, and I said sure, you know, boom, boom.  And then he wrote me another letter back and said, look, my plans have changed I can't come to Chicago.  Can you send me some samples of your work?  And so I did.  And right away in the next said, can you come to New York?  We'd like to talk to you about job.  So they flew me to New York.  And I sat down, and that day I had interviews one after the other with eight different editors at TIME, including Henry Grunwald, the managing editor.  And after the day was over I flew back to Chicago.  And a couple of days later, Murray Gart, who was the chief of correspondents, called me and offered me a job at considerably more money than I was making at the "Tribune."  So I went in to see Clayton Kirkpatrick, who was the editor, and I asked Kirk--I said, I wanted to talk to you.  I said, I--I'm not trying to bargain with you; I'm not trying to use leverage, but I should tell you that I have been offered this position and--you know, with TIME magazine.  But first I said, I'd like to--I have a few questions.  And I said--so what--I said, well, you know, I've always been interested in management here.  And if I decided to stay, you know, what are my possibilities?  And I remember him say--he said, I don't think there's a management job in this paper that you couldn't do.  So that was no problem.  The other thing I asked him--I said, I've always wanted to--been interested in working in the Washington Bureau.  Well up to that time the Washington Bureau had never had a black reporter.  And he said, I don't think there's a problem with that; I don't see any problem.  He said--oh, what was the guy's name, the Washington Bureau chief--a guy I knew.  He said, he's been sayin' for months that he'd like for you to be in his bureau.  And that's the moment I decided I was leaving the Chicago Tribune.
Story_ID: 56782
Speaker 1: Oh, and why is that?
Speaker 2: Because he [Clayton Kirkpatrick] told me that the Washington Bureau chief had been saying for months that he wanted me in his bureau--
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: --and nobody had told me.  And if I had been a white reporter, I would have known right away.  They would have groomed me.  And I'm sayin' because I'm few and far between they're not sayin' anything until maybe, you know.  But, the only way I find out is when I talked about having another opportunity.  So I decided then I'm leaving; I'm quittin'.  I didn't say that to him, but I did leave and I started at TIME in the Chicago [Illinois] bureau.  I went from sharing a desk in the Chicago Tribune newsroom to having my own office on the 30th floor of the Equitable Building, looking out on Lake Michigan with, you know, with privacy.  I remember the bureau chief taking me around saying, hey, listen, let me show you the bureau, and he took me around.  We went into the wire room and there's a file cabinet, and I thought he was gonna show me the files.  And he opened the drawers and they were full of liquor.  And he said, five o'clock we usually break for a cocktail, but you don't have to wait for five if you don't want to.  And then he said, oh, by the way--he said, if you need to cover a story and you can't get a, a flight, charter a plane.  I mean, that was the way they did things back then.  It was amazing; I'd never experienced that before.
Speaker 1: Big difference.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the--so that's why I started.  I was at the Chicago bureau for three years, and then I was promoted to bureau chief of the San Francisco bureau and actually became the first person of color to be a bureau chief for any TIME, Inc. publication.
Story_ID: 56783
Speaker 1: Okay, so TIME magazine, you're there for two years, right?  So what happened in those two years?  What were the--
Speaker 2: Well I was actually here in Chicago [Illinois] for three years with TIME.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was with TIME seventeen years all together.
Speaker 1: Okay, '70 [1970] to '73 [1973] in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right, and then I was in San Francisco [California] from 1973 to 1979.  And that was during the Patty Hearst case and the--and the assassination of Mayor Moscone; we covered that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I--I'll get to that, but I just wanna know what happened in Chicago from '70 [1970] to '73 [1973].  I mean, was there anything notable?
Speaker 2: No, not, not a whole--not a whole lot.
Speaker 1: I know that was a--the '72 [1972] [Democratic National] Convention, you covered that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I traveled around Chicago.  I mean--so I--you know, I, I--you know, I, I covered--I--you know, I, I covered some bombings in Kansas City [Kansas].  I covered student, student demonstrations at, at Kansas--
Speaker 1: Now were the trials--
Speaker 2: --University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm sorry, but, but were the Chicago Seven going on then?
Speaker 2: Chicago Seven, yeah I--that was a little bit before me I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't cover those.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're pretty much--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I did a story, though.  I did the first national story on [James] Jim Thompson, who was the state's attorney--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the U.S. Attorney there.  And, and at the time, he was prosecuting the Chicago mob figures, and we did a story on him.  It was the first national piece that had been done on him, and he never forgot it.  He was always very nice to me after that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jim Thompson became the governor of Illinois--
Speaker 2: Became, became governor, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the, the state building in Chicago is named after him.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Jim Thompson Center.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was--he was--he was--he was quite a good guy, an interesting guy, smart guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And, and, and his press aid was a guy that had worked at the [Chicago] Tribune with me.  Dave Gilbert was a really good reporter, a really nice guy.  And he became Thompson's press aid when he was governor.
Story_ID: 56784
Speaker 1: This is interesting 'cause this is--these are the days when--these are Chica--Illinois Republicans.  They were a little bit different from the ones that exist today.
Speaker 2: Well the--you know, the, the party--the party had a lot of wa--what you would call moderates in them and even some liberals.  And, and, you know, and they--and they had conservatives in the best sense of the word, if conservative means being cautious and careful, rather than being kooky and crazy and, and far out.  They--the party, you know, let themselves be held hostage by the religious right and--you know, the far right-wing conservatives.  And they purged all those people.  But John Lindsay was a Republican; Nelson Rockefeller was a Republican; Tom McCall was a Republican.  You know, Jim Thompson--
Speaker 1: And Dirksen--
Speaker 2: --you know, was a Republican.
Speaker 1: --and Percy in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Illinois, yep.
Speaker 2: You know, and they just got rid of the last guy, you know, that was, you know, the same type of Republican that--Richard Lugar in Indiana, you know.  They, they seem too determine to, to get--rid themselves of all the rational intelligent people and, and allow themselves to be commandeered by the wackos and the nuts.
Story_ID: 56785
Speaker 1: And now did you--(unclear) during this period that the book about Jesse Jackson by Barbara Reynolds was published--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during this--
Speaker 2: I think so; I didn't read it.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what do you think about that?  Do you have thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, I didn't have any thoughts about that.  I mean, I knew Jesse [Jackson].  I mean, I, I knew Jesse--I remember the first time I met Jesse.  He was holding [SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference) Operation] Breadbasket meetings above the--above the cafeteria at the--at the Chicago Theological Semin--Seminary on, on--at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And he was telling black people that--black--black men that they shouldn't wear afros because it put black barbers out of business.  You know, Jesse hadn't been there very long.  I mean, Jesse and I have a long, long history.  That kind that goes back.  We were never friends, but, you know, I respected him on, on, on a lot of levels, and I think he respected me as a journalist.  And, you know, I mean, there, there are certain things that he's done that, you know--that--I, I guess I could be critical of, but, you know, I wasn't walking in his shoes.  And I think on the whole--I mean, I saw this guy, you know, more than once--many, many, many, many times--risk his life.  I mean, he literally lit--risked his life, and he did a lot of good.  I mean, he still does.  You know, I mean, he likes the cameras, you know, and, and that's, that's not a crime.  But, you know, I, I think he could have been--you know, I think he could have been even greater, but, you know, we all have--but, but, but, I mean, I have to hand it to him.  I mean, you know, he was willing to put himself out there on the line when a lot of people weren't.  And, you know, and he put--you know, and he put his actions behind his words in many ways.  I mean, you know, he's, he's responsible largely for getting better food in, in the black community in Chicago [Illinois], when he--when he waged his campaign against the Red Roosters stores, which they used to be a chain.  Most people don't even remember 'em now, because Jesse closed them down.  And it was because of Jesse that Jane Byrne, who was the--then the, the head of the Department of Weights and Measures, was able to get the kind of publicity that had resulted in her ending up being elected mayor.  Because she would--she decided to go out with her weights and measures people, accompanying Jesse on these demonstrations at these places that were givin' low weights--false weights and stuff like that.  And she'd go in with her city inspectors, and they'd, they'd cite these stores.  And that's how she became well known enough to get a lot of the black vote that allowed her to be the mayor.  So Jes--I mean, Jesse did a whole lot of--I mean, the construction workers, the buildings trades--I mean, Jesse did a whole lot of things.  But then, you know, he, he, he did some things that he shouldn't have.  Angela Parker wrote a series for the Chicago Tribune on Operation Breadbasket and how all the money that was sup--supposed to be going to SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] wasn't gettin' there.  And, you know, they treated her something terrible, Breadbasket did, including Jesse.  And all she was doing was doing her job.  So, I mean, you know, in a way you could sa--you could argue that Jesse made it possible for the emergence of someone like [President] Barack Obama.
Story_ID: 56786
Speaker 1: I mean, I, I was on his [Jesse Jackson] campaign for a while; I covered part of his campaign.  And we'd go through the Deep South, and, and, and white people would turn out, you know, in large numbers to support him and cheer him and--you know, so he was--he was not just a black candidate; he was a crossover in many, many, many ways.  You know, he really--he really made some, some breakthroughs.  And when you--when you--when you do things like that, it's, it's really hard not to have a kind of ego.  And, and when--you know, as a young guy, he was really, really very good lookin' and very impressive and, and, you know, I mean, the women used to just, you know, I mean, flock around--just very hard to resist temptation.  I'm not--I never saw him doing anything with a woman that he shouldn't, but, you know, I read a couple of stories; I don't know if they're true or not, but--I mean, I know he admitted to one, but the thing about it is, is in all things considered, you know, Jesse did (unclear).  You know, sometime you needed to keep him on track.  Like he had that Wall Street thing in, in, in New York [New York City, New York], you know, with this Wall Street project where he, he rounded up a whole lot of money from people like Merrill Lynch and stuff like that to, to help educate black people on the--you know, the financial industry and investments and so forth.  I mean, that never went anywhere, and thousands--hundreds of thousands went into that.  And, you know, I approached him about that 'cause I was covering it for the Wall Street Journal, and he was in New York at the time, and I said, where is your plan?  Yeah, what do you mean?  I asked, well, you collected all this money, what's your plan?  I said, I'm giving you 24 hours to come up with a plan or I'm gone write you don't have any plan.  'Cause I was calling Merrill Lynch and these people and talkin' to 'em.  And they were givin' him--you know, I think Merrill gave him $500,000.  They gave him--I know they gave him a hundred thousand.  I don't know how much, but, but the point--the point is, these companies like that--I mean, as far as they were concerned, they weren't buying financial education for black people; they were buying peace and tranquility.  You know, especially with the banks, with the--you know, the community responsibility, the thing--you know, the, the, the act that they have to show, that there contributing a certain amount to the community (unclear) Community Reinvestment Act or whatever they call it.  I mean, you know, that's the way--let's keep these people off our back.  And, and a hundred thousand dollars to Merrill Lynch was chump change; it was no money at all, and they, they didn't care what Jesse did with it.  They weren't gonna follow up six months later and say, what did you do with this money?  And Jesse knew that.  The Wall Street Journal--I mean, the Wall Street project, you never heard about it now; you never hear about it and, you know--you don't know what happened to the money.  They opened up an office on Wall Street.  After about six months or so, it closed down; nothing happened.  So there were things like that, you know, that raised questions.  But on the whole, like I say, I mean, this guy has made a significant contribution, you know, in his life to the betterment of conditions for black people.
Story_ID: 56787
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now '73 [1973], you're promoted to the chief of the San Francisco [California] bureau (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --TIME, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you want that position or, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I wanted the--yeah, I was interested in San Francisco, and I wanted to make more money.  And I wanted the--I thought that, you know, that, that, that I, I would be a good bureau chief.  And I, I--and I wanted to show that a person of color can be a bureau chief and do it well, since they had never had one before--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in any publication that they had.  So I went out there, you know, pretty confident.  You know, I found out that when I got out there, you know, that I was working with people that never had a black boss.  So that took a little adjustment.
Speaker 1: You have a story about that, about how--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know--I mean, the same thing happened when I first came to Atlanta [Georgia].  They'd never had a black boss either.  And so the thing you have to do is, is gain credibility because the assumption often is that, well, you know, you're not--you're not gonna be as good; you're not gonna be as decisive, or that--you know, we know you're the boss, but we'll tell you how things work here, you know.  And so I had--I had to get a couple of people, you know, straightened out in a--in a very pleasant way.  And, and so when I did lose a, a person who was my administrative assistant, I hired a black person.  I didn't particularly look to hire a black person, but I opened the interview process I think for the first time to someone who wasn't white, and she happened to get the job.  And she turned out to be so good that they--everybody in the company loved her.  So she moved on up in the company herself.  I remember she went to New York, and my boss met her.  And I remember he called me from New York and said, my goodness, do you know what you've got there?  And I said, Murray, I hired her, remember?
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: But it was the first black secretary that they ever had in any bureau of TIME magazine.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was--when I hired her, it was Olivia Moss; it's Olivia Stewart now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she married a, a, a guy who joined the fire department in San Francisco [California], and he became one of the--one of the first black fire lieutenants.  And then--I think he might be a fire captain now.  I played at their wedding; my band played at their wedding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she (unclear) very beautiful, very, very smart.  But she just happened to be the best person that I interviewed for the job.
Story_ID: 56788
Speaker 1: Okay, now 19--well, in San Francisco [California], I mean, you--do you look at this period and say you were awful lucky or something, 'cause a lot of the national stories broke in the Bay area [San Francisco Bay Area, California]--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it--
Speaker 1: --in those days.
Speaker 2: --it did--they did at that time.  It was just happenstance.  So we did--we had, you know, they tried to assassinate [President] Gerald Ford there, so our bureau was very busy.  We got a lot of good stories in.  I was in the magazine--in the pub letter a lot.  I really, you know, sort of got my reputation in San Francisco.
Speaker 1: So that, that was the [Lynette] "Squeaky" Fromme and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: "Squeaky" Fromme, they threatened us.
Speaker 1: --on Gerald Ford.
Speaker 2: They said the guys--the guys in--at the--at--in the bureau.  They said the guys in the TIME bureau in San Francisco are gonna have their balls cut off.  "Squeaky" Fromme said that; she threatened us.  Yeah.  Patty Hearst case--
Speaker 1: This is the Symbionese Liberation Army--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we--
Speaker 1: --kidnapping of Patty Hearst--Hearst.
Speaker 2: Kidnappin'--before that, though, they had committed murder.  People forgot that.  Yeah, [Joseph] Remiro--two guys--Remiro and [Russell] Little, they, they shot the, the superintendant and assistant superintendant of the Oakland schools.  They ambushed them and shot 'em, and one of 'em died.  And they were part of the Symbionese Liberation Army--that was before Patty Hearst got kidnapped.
Speaker 1: Is it su--the superintendant of San Francisco schools?
Speaker 2: Oakland.
Speaker 1: Oakland, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when Patty Hearst got kidnapped, she was with her boyfriend, Steven Weed, who I got to know.  He used to come by the bureau and sit.  I got to know the Hearst family a little bit--Willie, her cousin; Randy, her father--Randolph Hearst; Mrs. Hearst, Catherine; and she-her sisters.  I covered that trial; I covered the kidnapping; covered the Symbionese Liberation Army and what we could find out about them; covered Patty Hearst trial; did a cover on F. Lee Bailey.
Speaker 1: What, what about Donald DeFreeze or--wa--what was--did you ever have a chance--
Speaker 2: Oh Cinque [Donald Defreeze] [Mtume]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Didn't know much about him.  I mean, basically, those people were just mouth.  You know, they, they, they--you know, a lot of, you know, self-styled revolutionaries--and, and half of 'em were, were gangsters--I mean, criminals, you know.  Very few people were really motivated by any, any political philosophy.  They were either rich kids rebelling against mommy and daddy, or they were genuine, you know, black kids from the ghetto who were tryin' to get over--you know, score some with some, some girls and, and do whatever.  But very few people were really politically and philosophically committed to what they talked about.  I mean, they could--they could talk the talk and preach all that stuff, but they were enamored with, you know, with, with, with all the, the flamboyance of it--the guns, the mystery, the press, the attention--not about any real, you know, social change.
Story_ID: 56789
Speaker 1: Well there were two big stories I guess in '78 [1978].  One was the assassination of the mayor [of San Francisco, California], Joseph [sic, George] Moscone, and Harvey Milk, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, George Moscone.
Speaker 1: Yeah, George Mos--
Speaker 2: Yeah, George Moscone and Harvey Milk.  Yeah, we, we were in the bureau when we heard about that.  We ran down to city hall, and everything was still chaotic.  So I was with a photographer, Chris Springman.  So we went up on the floor of the mayor's office, and so there was a--it was anteroom--an anteroom outside the mayor's office that let onto a balcony.  And we went out on the balcony, and we saw that it connected with another balcony that was outside the mayor's office.  And so we climbed over that balcony to get to the other balcony.  And you could look inside the mayor's office, and you could see the blood pattern on the rug in the mayor's office.  And we took that picture and it ran.  In the papers it was the only picture that anybody got of that.  Some people thought it was in poor taste to run that picture, and it well might have been.
Speaker 1: Do, do you have philosophy about that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know, ex--exclusivity is one thing, but does it really tell a story and, and how much?  So on, on something like I would have been torn about whether to publish that picture or not.  I might have gone ahead and done it.  I wouldn't--depending on what else I had to run.  But I cannot really make a very strong and convincing argument that it had to be in the magazine.  But I think in a very competitive business, you know, you say, well, we're not showing him on the floor being shot.  And nobody else has this picture, and it does show where it happened and how it happened.  And it illustrates that this is an assassination; a crime was committed, you know.  So there are arguments pro and, and, and con for, you know, showing that picture.
Story_ID: 56790
Speaker 1: Okay, now 1978 also was the, the year, I believe, of the Jim Jones People's Temple--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that actually happened in Guyana, but he was in San Francisco [California], so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a San Francisco guy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: --and his parishioners were from San Francisco.
Speaker 2: So there wasn't really a lot to write about San Francisco.  I mean, that, that thing had roots that went all the way back to Indiana and everything.  And the real story there was what happened on the ground in Guyana with the Congressman [Leo Ryan] coming down there and all that.  They were kinda low key in San Francisco.  The only thing I remembered about that was that morning when we heard about it.  I was driving to work, and I, I had a van, a Ford van, and I went by the People's Temple.  And there were a whole lot of people around there just looking.  And I was stopped by the police because my van had tinted windows and, of course, I'm a black guy driving it.  And they wanted to, you know, to, you know strong-arm me--I mean, you know, get rough, you know--what are you doing?  What are you doing with this van?  What's in this van?--and so forth.  And I said, you know, basically, I didn't even tell 'em I was a cop right away, but I said, you know, I'd been a cop.  I said, why are you stopping me?  And when they said, well, your, your van fits the description of another car that was involved in a robbery, and that's when I said, bull.  I said, come on; it's full of crap.  I said, we used to use that old argument ourselves when we wanted to, you know, find out what's goin' on.  I said, give me a break; you stopped because I'm black and I'm driving a van with tinted windows.  And, and their captain came up at that point and said, what's goin' on here?  And they--and they said, well, we stopped him because he had a van.  I said, they stopped me 'cause I'm black.  And I said, you know, they talking about my car fits the description.  I said, you know that's bull and I know that's bull.  And the captain said, whoa, I don't want any part of this, and he backed off.  And when they realized that he wasn't gonna support 'em, they let me go.  They said, oh, you can go ahead; you can go.  And I went ahead.  But that's--actually, we didn't have a lot to do with that.  And maybe some--but maybe we, we contributed to that story, but I didn't personally; maybe one of my people did.
Speaker 1: On the--
Speaker 2: One of my reporters.
Story_ID: 56791
Speaker 1: All right now, anything else about San Francisco [California], the Bay area [San Francisco, California], in--
Speaker 2: Well we didn't--
Speaker 1: --those days.
Speaker 2: --just cover the Bay area.  That bureau was responsible for Northern California, Washington, Oregon, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the whole operation out there was called West Edit.  And West Edit was headquartered in Los Angeles [California].  And the Los Angeles bureau covered Arizona, New Mexico, Denver--Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii.  And the--and the Los Angeles bureau chief was the West Edit bureau chief, and I was deputy West Ed--Edit bureau chief.  So I would go down to Los Angeles often when the--when the bureau chief was there and, and run both bureaus from LA [Los Angeles, California].  And it was kinda fun because the bureau was in Beverly Hills [Los Angeles, California].  And so I would stay in Beverly Hills and, and hang out.  I stayed at the--I usually stayed at the Beverly Wilshire, but every once in a while I'd stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  And that was always--that was always fun; that was always an experience.
Story_ID: 56792
Speaker 1: Okay, now these are the days I think of the Alaska pipeline--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Oh, that's funny; that's funny.  I went up there.  TIME magazine--you know, at that time, you know, it's, it's so different.  The magazine's so different than it is now, because now it's mostly pundits talking, columns.  But then we actually went up and covered the news, but we still had this New York [New York City, New York] bias where the, the dog wagged the tail.  In other words, we were the tail, the bureaus, and the dog was New York.  And so you had these editors in New York often who never left New York City except to go out to the Hamptons [Long Island, New York] or to go to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] or something like that.  So they had not a clue what was happening in the rest of the country.  So everything began and ended in New York.  And so the--they had all these stereotypes about what the rest of the country was.  So they wanted to do an American scene about all these oil wildcatters from Texas who were going up to Alaska and mingling with the Eskimos and their musk--mukluks.  And they had all these guys with their--in their vision there were all these guys with these 10-gallon hats and, and cowboy boots and snakeskin boots, you know, and their culture mingling with the culture of, of the Alaskans with their fur coats and the mukluks and all--this is the kinda idea they had; they wanted me to go up there and do that story.  So--and, and they--and when--they used to say, you know, fly up to Fairbanks [Alaska] like it was nothin'.  Well it, it takes longer to fly a flight--it's, it's farther away to fly to Fairbanks from San Francisco than it is to fly to New York from San Francisco.  And you know, you gotta stop in Seattle [Washington], and then, you know, you take another plane, and you go to Anchorage [Alaska], and you take another plane.  So anyway, I ended up in Fairbanks, and it's like July or August.  And Fairbanks in July and August--you might as well be in Peoria, Illinois.  The only way you can tell you're in Alaska--cause there's flowers all around and trees and everything.  And there's the dime store and the Wal-Mart and every--the only way you could tell you're in Alaska is look at the parking meters.  And, and they have light sockets--electric sockets in 'em, so in the wintertime, you can plug your car engine into the parking meters to keep your engine warm 'cause it gets sev--seventy degrees below zero.  So all the parking me--that's the only way in August that you could tell you're in Alaska really, you know, or look at the license plates.  So here I am in Fairbanks; well, it wasn't like anything they said.  And the first place, the pipeline really hadn't got started.  You didn't have all these--you didn't have people walking around in mukluks and all that.  You had 'em walking around in t-shirts and pants and jeans and everything (laughter).  So they were really disa--you know, I--disabused.  So I went back to Anchorage and, and, and, and met with our guy there who was our stringer in Anchorage, a young guy who worked for the "Anchorage Daily News," a young fella who grew up in Alaska by the name of Howard Weaver.  If, if you're--if you're not familiar with that name, Howard We--Weaver later became editor-in-chief of all of the McClatchy newspaper publications.  But then he was a young guy who was--who was just a young reporter on the "Anchorage Daily News."  And, and so we never--we never did that story (laughter) on, on the pipeline in Prudhoe Bay because (laughter), you know, we had the--we had a disabuse New York of all their preconceived, you know, Hollywood notions of, of cowboys and Eskimos.
Story_ID: 56793
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's see now in '79 [1979], you joined the Atlanta [Georgia] bureau as the bureau--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was transferred--
Speaker 1: --as chief, right?
Speaker 2: --to Atlanta as bureau chief.
Speaker 1: For Atlanta and--and the Southern region of TIME.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had eleven states; I was responsible for eleven states.
Speaker 1: Now, during this period, if I'm not wrong, I guess the, the Atlanta child murders, did that take place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Atlanta missing and murder cases happened [1979-1981], and that was really, really, really hard to cover, because there was very little information that was forthcoming from the police or from anybody else.  You know, but we covered that case, and it was difficult for everybody to cover.  But it was--became a national story.
Speaker 1: A lot of conspiracy theories and--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, there were conspiracy theories but, you know, I don't--I don't--you know, I don't--I don't believe anyone--like, there was one that the Centers for Disease Control was responsible and--you know, and New York asked me that and, and, and, you know, the--with TIME--what about that?--you know, and I--and I said, you know, please, let's get real; you know, don't get off on that.
Speaker 1: Dick Gregory had a theory--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that's Dick [Gregory]; I like Dick, you know.  And, and--but, but he was totally, absolutely I think wrong on that.  I, I have a theory of my own.  Wayne Williams didn't do it all.  I think Wayne Williams was a scapegoat, and whoever was doing it was smart enough to stop.
Speaker 1: So do you--do you think he did any of them?
Speaker 2: I knew a--I knew a person who was on the defense team, who was my source.  That person was so scared after that trial that they moved to Alaska.  And before they moved, they told me in their words Wayne [Williams] was not a baby killer and that other people were involved, and that Wayne got into it by accident.  They were supposedly doing snuff films of the Omni.  Wayne's dad was a photographer.  He was involved in that somehow, and Wayne went there to see him and accidentally stumbled on what was going on, and they involved him.  But it was already started before he--and I never heard a name, but I kept hearing a police lieutenant at the airport, but I don't know.  But this person who was on the defense team was certain that--she said, Wa--Wayne--she said Wayne was the delivery boy; he was a gopher.
Story_ID: 56794
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just--you just mentioned that during the break that Lee P. Brown was director of pub-public safety.
Speaker 2: Lee P. Brown was the director of public safety.  And I, I thought he was quite a good law enforcement professional.  I am not sure that all the information that was supposed to have been--come up the pipeline to him about the missing murdered kids eventually got to him.  That I think on some other level that there may have been information that stopped and didn't go any further.  I mean, twenty one murders and today--you ask anybody in Atlanta [Georgia] today about the missing and murdered kids, and I'll bet you five out of six of 'em would--they don't know what you're talking about.  Because once--it was like once Wayne Williams was convicted and sent off to jail it's--that's it; we're done.  We don't have to worry about it anymore.  It was just too convenient and too easy to dismiss everything and lay it all on Wayne Williams.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now--
Speaker 2: And I'm not sh--you know, I'm not saying he shouldn't be in jail, but I certainly don't think he acted alone.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) said it had somethin' to do--you heard it had something to do with snuff films, which are films about--
Speaker 2: That originally they were doin' snuff films.  That's what I heard--in the Omni.  And Wayne stumbled in, and his dad was involved.  And once he had seen too much, he was in; he was part of it.  And my--what I had heard, and I don't know if any of this is true--I don't know if any of this is true.  What I had heard was that he was more or less a--an errand boy, a messenger boy.  And that the reason he was standing on that bridge when they caught him was that he was just checking to make sure that the body was--but he didn't do it.  And so when they caught him, he's standing on the bridge; put two and two together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's why a lot of things don't jive, in terms of the timing and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: There was a--there, there were a whole lot of unanswered questions about that, and everybody was so glad we finally got a killer.  And, of course, everything stopped after the so people said well it must be--he must be the guy 'cause nobody else was killed after that.  Well you know what?  Nobody else was killed until they were killed to begin with.
Story_ID: 56795
Speaker 1: Okay.  What other stories were going down in the South in those days from '79 [1979] to I guess '80 [1980]--'85 [1985], right?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot of things were going--we had the Mariel [boatlift], the boat people from Cuba, coming into Miami [Florida].  I didn't do a lot on that.  I had stringers working on that.  And then we got a guy that was working out of Miami, a guy by the name of Bill McQuarter (ph.).  And things were heatin' up in the Caribbean, so he really kind of took over Miami and the Caribbean.  So I didn't have a lot to do with the Cuban Mariel boat people.  And then I had a sub-bureau in Houston [Texas] and another sub-bureau--well I had a sub-bureau in Miami, a sub-bureau in Houston, and seems like I had another one.  I'm tryin' to think of where that one was.  No, Houston and Miami were the two sub-bureaus, yeah.  Those were the main stories.  I mean, we did stories like--we did the story on the Voting Rights Act [1965].  We went to--I went to Greene County, Alabama and profiled Greene County, which as a result of the original Voting Rights Act, all the main officials in that county went from white to black.  And I remember they had a sheriff there, a black sheriff-- that I spent a lot of time with who never wore a gun, and just really, you know, and some interesting people there, you know.  And, and, you know, this is in, in an area in Alabama that--my goodness, you know, way back woodsy kinda, kinda place.  But I went throughout the South; I was all over the South.  I did cover Jesse Helms' race for the Senate.  We did a cover on Jesse Helms, so I spent some time in Raleigh and, and North Carolina.  He was a character.
Story_ID: 56796
Speaker 1: Who, Jesse Helms?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--
Speaker 1: I could--
Speaker 2: --really a very strange guy.
Speaker 1: I could never figure out why with the big black population in South Carolina that he was continually elected.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you why.  Because one of the things I found out--that he was excellent when it came to constituent services and--whether you were black or white, you know.  I mean, you know, from what I understand that they were very, very good about looking after the constituents, and that can make a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and some of the things I found out that were said about his past were either exaggerated or they weren't true.  We did probably the most in-depth look at him that had ever been done.
Speaker 1: Now what were they saying about him?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they said that he was responsible for a program in an earlier Senate race that he wasn't involved in that, that besmirched the reputation of a young black student that had been accepted at West Point [the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York] as an alternate.  And this guy, who, who was a senator had, had, had been one of his sponsors, this guy.  And there was a picture of this kid that was just a horrible picture taken at a horrible time where it made the kid look like an idiot, although he was very smart.  And they, they posted--they put up posters, and they said that this candidate would have this, this kid go to West Point.  Is this the guy you want representing you?  You know, and Jesse [Helms] took the heat from that.  And it--and it turned out--I, I did some digging and found out that it wasn't Jesse who did that, that it was a, a, a white guy who--maybe Jesse was running earlier--and it was a white guy who had gotten in touch with this guy's mother.  He was a businessman, and he had driven up in a limo to the mother of this kid that, that was gon--gonna try to go to West Point and, and got her to talk to him under the guise of he was really proud of this boy; and he was really interested; and he--you know, he was interested in talking to the mother and being supportive.  She invited him into her home and he sat there and talked about this boy.  And then he said, oh--he saw that picture--he said, oh, that's such a nice picture; could I have it?  You know, I'll, I'll--you know, I'll get it back to you--you know.  And, and so she gave it to 'em, and then that's when he did that and printed it up.  And he went to the, the Helms people with it first, and they rejected him--told him to get out.  And so he paid for it and did it on his own.  That's one thing I heard was not true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there were the--a coup--couple of other things that weren't true, but there was enough that was true (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, specifically, he might not have been guilty of some specific things that people thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I was the first person I was told that they ever let look at the radio archives of his radio talks when he was there on radio.  And they let me go through all of his radio commentaries from years and years back.  And, look, you know, this guy was a pistol.  Let, let there be no doubt about it.  You know, he was--he was definitely a racist.  There was no question about it.  But, you know, his family loved him.  He had an adopted son who loved him.  I talked to his family, and they were crazy about him.  But, but, you know, I asked, you know, what kind of dad was he--he was great.  What do--what do you guys do for fun, you know--oh, we--nothing we'd love better than poppin' popcorn and watching movies and things like that, so.
Story_ID: 56797
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, well now 1987 you joined the Wall Street Journal.  Now, wha--what--how did this--
Speaker 2: Well I had--I wanted to go to Rio [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil] as bureau chief after I left Atlanta [Georgia].  And I got a call from the then chief of correspondents, Dick Dutkin (ph.), who had been the chief of West Edit when I was deputy chief of West Edit, so we had a history of working together, and, and we got along well.  And I told Dick I wanted to go to Rio, and he said, look, I really need you in New York [New York City, New York].  The New York bureau had a problem.  It was coming apart at the seams.  People were arguing with each other and this and that.  And they just had some personnel problems.  And so I had gotten a reputation at times for, for being somebody who could straighten out problem people.  They would send them to me--that they wanted to keep, but were problems.  And I'd got a reputation for being able to work well with them, and get 'em on the right track.  So he wanted me to do that kind of thing in New York.  And--but I wasn't gonna be able to go as bureau chief, because they needed to move another person there as bureau chief from London [England, United Kingdom] who had more time and grade than I did.  And I was the deputy chief; I would go as deputy chief, and then when this person retired or moved on, I would--the idea was I'd be the bureau chief.  So I really didn't wanna go to New York, but I'd been out there in the hinterlands.  I mean, there's nothing greater.  The only thing greater than being a TIME bureau chief in the United States is being a TIME bureau chief overseas, at that time--'cause you, you might as well be the king of the country.  I mean, you lived like a king.  You had servants, drivers, cars, everything.  And in the United States you lived well.  The idea was, stay the hell away from New York if you could.  But I'd been out there for like sixteen years, so I couldn't very well argue that it wasn't my turn to come to New York.  So I, I came to New York--the other--the other job that was open to me--the other job that was open to me was all of Canada or the Supreme Court.  So I, I remember telling my boss--I said, let me go up to Ottawa [Canada]--where the bureau was--let me go up to Ottawa for a couple of weeks and look it over, and I'll, I'll, I'll tell you whether I want Canada or not.  And I remember him saying, look, I really wanna resolve this New York issue before you go anywhere else, which told me (laughter) I want you in New York.  So anyway, I took that job.  Within three months I had those problems, I thought, solved.  So I was ready to do something else.  Meanwhile, Dick [Dutkin (ph.)] had moved on.  He had been promoted to another job.  And they brought a guy in that I really didn't know very well and I really wasn't "his guy."  And so I decided I wanted to go to Chicago [Illinois] as bureau chief, but it didn't look like that was gonna happen.  And so I started gettin' restless.  And I got a call, and it was from Norm Pearlstine, who is the managing editor of the Wall Street Journal.  And he wanted to sit and have lunch me.  And the result was that they ended up offering me a job there as a senior editor.  And, you know, I love Time.  I'd been there for a long time, but the personnel had changed that I had worked with, and it didn't look like, you know, I might be able to get some of the things I wanted to do there, if I stayed there.  So I said, well maybe it's time to go.  And so I went to The Journal [Wall Street Journal].
Story_ID: 56798
Speaker 1: Okay, now your job was there as senior editor of--for, for public and social policy, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what they said.  That was what it was technically, but really it was--it was almost do anything you want.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  At first, until I realized that there was no "there, there."  I mean, there was really no job description.  At the time there were three senior editors: myself and two other long-term "Wall Street Journal" news executives.  And after I got there, they found--I found out that they had a name for us, "the Bolivian admirals."  Well, you know, Bolivia is landlocked (laughter).  And so I remember talking to my friend Jack White, who was at TIME--as an editor at TIME.  And we were walking down Fifth Avenue one day at lunch.  And I told Jack--I said, you know, I think I can walk out along the esplanade along the Hudson [River]--because The Wall Street Journal was near the Hudson River; it was down at the World Financial Center--I said, I think I can--I can--I can just walk there all afternoon, and I wouldn't even be missed in the office.  I, I don't think anybody would care if I was there or not.  And I remember him stopping in the--in the street and, and looking at me and--like I was crazy.  He said, don't you know what freedom is?  And that was Jack's way--Jack's way of telling me--'cause we have all--always consulted with each other on our careers for years and years and years.  And that was Jack's way of telling me: use that freedom to do--be creative; do what you want.  So I went back with a different attitude and start--started doing some stories for the front page.  Paul Steiger, who was the assistant managing editor, and my immediate superior, an excellent editor, began--oh, he, he assigned me to--he assigned a group of reporters to me whose specialty would be urban affairs.  I went on the corporate side and got involved in the corporate side.  And the way that happened was that I, I got two speaking invitations at the same time.  Not for the same time, but the invitations came in at about the same time.  One from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Flint, Michigan, and the other from the Urban League in Columbia, South Carolina, both asking me to speak at their annual dinners.  And I remember I accepted both invitations.  And then right away they both called me back separately--neither one knew the other had invited me--and said please send your picture as soon as possible.  And I said why?  And they said, well our people here wanna know why we're inviting a white man from The Wall Street Journal to speak to us at our annual dinner.  I said, well I'm black; tell 'em I'm black.  And they said, we did; they don't believe us.  Both of these people said--because I was the first person to ever be at that level of senior editor at The Wall Street Journal.  So black people, a lot of them, didn't read The Journal, and even those in media didn't see anybody of--you know, of, of high editorial standing at The Journal, even though there were people there when I got there who were perfectly qualified and capable of handling my job, doing what I did and more.
Story_ID: 56799
Speaker 1: But--you know, and that's the thing about this business about being first.  Just because you're first in something doesn't necessarily mean you're the best person ever for that job.  No matter what I was first in, whether it was The Chicago Tribune, TIME Magazine, or The Wall Street Journal.  There were always people of color out there who are every bit as capable, if not more so, than I.  It was just that none of these places ever did a diligent--and still in many cases don't--don't do a diligent search to find the best and the brightest.  And so much of these kind of jobs are, are filled on the basis of word of mouth--who do you know?  And the people doing the filling know people who look like they do.  And if most of the management staff is Caucasian, they may not think they're racist; they think that I'm hiring with people that I know, but they just know people who look like them.  And so my being first didn't mean that Joe Boyce came along 'cause he was better at this than anybody else and the most qualified ever.  It's just a--an accident of chance.  My job was to do the best I could so as not to let down the team, so to speak, and myself.  So anyway, I went back and so I realized when they--and then they wrote me--and when they came back and said, well, they don't believe us, that we really had a, a gap, that there's this whole area of minority businesspeople who were not familiar with The Wall Street Journal, didn't care about it, didn't think it had anything to offer them, didn't think it cared about them, and yet and still we're talking about the most influential and largest financial publication in the world.  When I went with The Wall Street Journal, we had two million readers.  The average household income of The Wall Street Journal subscriber was $274,000 a year.  Look at who you're talking to.  We need to know about that and be a part of that.  So I had given a couple of speeches, and I remember they had a clipping service.  And I remember the chairman [of Dow Jones & Company], Peter Kaan, had read about a speech that I had given somewhere up in New England.  And he liked it, and he sent me a thing that he really liked, what I had to say in the speech.  And Don Miller was a senior vice president--a black guy, the only upper executive with the company Dow Jones.  And he was the senior vice president in charge of personnel.  And he called me up and said, I just ran into Peter Kaan, the chairman; he said, he really liked what you said.  I said, look, if Peter likes what I had to say about that, maybe he'd like what I have to say about this paper.  And so we set up a meeting, a luncheon meeting, offsite somewhere, between the chairman, Don, and myself.  And I made this pitch that we need to outreach to these black and minority businesspeople because the country is changing--the population; the demographics are changing.  We don't wanna be the tail bringing up the end of the train.
Story_ID: 56800
Speaker 1: We wanna be there at the beginning to let these people know that we have something to offer and that we think they have something to offer us.  He [Don Miller] agreed.  The result was the first special section on black entrepreneurship ever done by The Wall Street Journal.  We did two of them.  The first time it was very difficult to get the bureau chiefs, all of whom were white, on board, because they thought this was a black thing.  It was a business thing.  It was a smart thing.  That first special section became the most profitable, in terms of ra--advertising revenues than any first-time special section in the history of the paper.  So the next time it was easy to get them on board.  So we did two of those, and I was the co-editor of both of those special sections.  But that's how I got involved on, on the corporate level, to try to get the paper more exposure in the African American community.  Because--and, and I did the same thing at TIME Magazine.  Because I knew some very bright, very intelligent people who would confuse the TIME Magazine with, with The New York Times.  They would introduce me and say he works for The Times.  Or they'd say he works for The Times Magazine, which told me they really weren't that familiar with it.  And then when I went to The Wall Street Journal I'd be introduced as "this is Joe Boyce; he's with The Wall Street"--not The WWall Street Journal, The Wall Street.  He's just with The Wall Street.  These were not illiterate people; these were bright people--successful people.  They just didn't care that much about the paper to--you know, that was it.  They were glad to see me there.  They were glad to see what I did.  They knew what the paper did, but they didn't think it was relevant to what they were doing.  And I'm saying, hey, don't get left out.  You don't have to love it; just know about it; read it.  Information is power.
Story_ID: 56801
Speaker 1: Okay, so did circulation increase amongst--
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I, I never--I never even checked to, to make sure.  I--like I said, it was a very successful insert.  What we also did was we, we started a--a black entrepren--entrepreneurship forum, a conference, and we did it by ourselves the first year, which was really well attended.  And then the next year we partnered with Black Enterprise.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna say that should be a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And, and we did--we did a partnership with Black Enterprise for two years.  And then I retired, and the people who came in--who could have--of color--who could have carried it on dropped the ball.  And, in fact, there was someone that, that I would have hoped would have continued, who, who really came to the company and really showed no interest in any of that, and so it died.  And she was African American, but that's not what she was interested in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were at Wall Street Journal from '87 [1987] to--
Speaker 2: To '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: To '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: I retired on December 31, 1998.  By that time, I had had a qui--quadruple heart bypass surgery.  And my wife, in '92 [1992], had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.  And so, you know, I, I thought maybe, you know, they were offering a buyout, and I thought maybe this would be a good time to take it.  And, and, and it turns out it was the best buyout package that they ever offered ever before since.  And so I was able to retire.  We lived in New York [New York City, New York] another year and suffered New York, and then we moved to Indianapolis [Indiana].
Story_ID: 56802
Speaker 1: That was your--your wife [Carol Boyce] in Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: My second wife.
Speaker 1: Second wife, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I married her in 1968, on December the 21st, 1968, which was also her birthday.  And we were married until she passed away in February of 2011.  Her name was Carol.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was absolutely wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And wa--wa--what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a registered nurse.  But she was, you know, just overall very, very smart.  When she took her nursing boards--she went to the nursing school in Mt. Sinai [Hospital] in Chicago.  And when she took her nursing boards--she entered nursing school at seventeen.  When she took her nursing boards, she scored so high that she had license reciprocity in all fifty of the United States.  She could--she could practice in any state.

Speaker 1: Now, now is there a story about how, how you all met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess.  I was still with the [Chicago] police department, and I was with the evidence technicians.  And they would meet in a small building just south of police headquarters at 12th--11th [Street] and State [Street] [Chicago, Illinois].  And this building was close--closer to 12th [Street] Roosevelt Road, and State [Street].  And right in front of this small building where the evidence techs would meet was a staircase going up to Roosevelt Road one way, and if you went down the other way you'd go down in the subway.  And so we would rotate whose job it was to get coffee for the unit, and it was my turn.  And it was eight o'clock in the morning.  And I was going to get coffee for the unit, and I saw this woman comin' down the stairs.  And she was dressed in a uniform of an Infant Welfare nurse.  Well I had seen Infant Welfare nurses all around Chicago.  This [Infant Welfare Society of Chicago] was a nonprofit organization, an NGO [non-governmental Organization] that provided registered nurses for poor families, poor young mothers.  And they would go into the neighborhoods and into the houses.  And, of course, as a policeman, I would see them in different neighborhoods going to some of these houses in some of the poorest neighborhoods and wondering how courageous--admiring how courageous they were to go in by themselves in some of these places to help these mothers with their children.  And so here she was coming down the stairs.  But I had never seen an Infant Welfare nurse that fine.  I mean, she was drop dead gorgeous.  I couldn't believe it.  And so I looked at my watch to make sure--'cause I thought maybe she was going to work, and it was eight o'clock.  So after that, I positioned myself out there every time I could to be standing there in case I would see her again.  And I saw her a couple more times--two or three more times, and I, I was in uniform.  And I would say hello, and she would just speak and keep on going.  And one night I got off of work and I was walking down Roosevelt Road to catch the--this--the bus that go South Side where I lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And there's this beautiful woman in front of me.  I could just tell from the--from lookin' at the per--be--behind--from behind her that she was really pretty.  And I realized that that's her.  And so I said it's now or never, you know.  And so I got caught up with her and I said, Hi, and she looked at me.  And I said, do you know there's four million people in the City of Chicago?  She looked at me and kinda--she kinda laughed.  She said yes.  And, and I said, and you look to me like someone who has to be formally introduced, but with four million people it's highly unlikely that you know the same people that I know.  So we're probably never gonna be introduced, so I'm gonna introduce myself now.  And I told her my name, and she laughed.  And she told me her name.  And we started walking along and talking, and I said, do you have--she was on her way home.  She lived at 16th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue] with two other girls that had been in nursing school with her.  No, another girl had been to nursing school with her and that girl's sister.  They had shared an apartment on 16th and Michigan, and she was walking home.  And so I said, do you have time for a cup of coffee, and so she did.  And so we sat there for two hours talking, and finally, I said, I guess you noticed the wedding ring on my finger and she hadn't.  And boy her whole attitude changed.
Story_ID: 56804
Speaker 1: And I said, I'm not tryin' to hit on you; I said, you're just really nice; I'd just like to be your friend; I'm not, you know.  She wasn't having any of it, and that was the end of that.  She was ready to go, and she wa--wasn't really talking to me anymore.  And she left, and that was that.  Well I was married, but I wasn't--we weren't getting along.  We weren't happily married.  And--but that was that.  And I didn't see her again--I saw her once when I was leaving Roosevelt University when I had gone back to college.  It was a Saturday, and I saw this--and she had civilian--regular clothes on, and I saw--first thing I noticed was how--who's this beautiful woman?  And I--oh, that's her.  And I went up to her and I said, Hi, you remember me?  And she did, but she was not havin' any conversation with me.  She really just wanted to move on; thank you very much.  And she was polite, but she was definite and that was that.  So three years passed and I went out to California.  We always had a dream, my brother and my mother and I, of going to California together.  And we--so we decided to go out to California in April that year.  That was 1968.  And I asked my wife did she wanna go with me--said she didn't.  So I went out to California with my mother and my brother.  We went on the train, and while I was there [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed.  And I needed to get back to Chicago [Illinois], because riots were breakin' out.  I was worried about my family, and I also thought about the newspaper.  And so I left early, and I went back to Chicago.  And the second day I was back, my wife asked me for a divorce.  She had met somebody else.  And I was just really shocked and surprised.  And for a couple of days I tried to talk her out of it, and then I said to myself, you know, you're really not happy, you know; shut up (laughter).  So I stopped tryin' to talk her out of it, and I said well we'll see what happens next.
Story_ID: 156839
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, so I, I, stopped tryin' to talk my wife out of it and just was gettin' myself ready for whatever is to come, you know, separation or whatever.  And I went back to work at the--at The Trib [Chicago Tribune].  And my first day back in the office I had all of this mail that accumulated.  And I'm going through my mail and there's a card, and I open it up and it says, you know, I'm, I'm, I just wanna tell you it was so nice to have known you.  And I'm so glad to see you're not on the police department anymore and that you're a reporter--Sincerely, Carol Hill.  I said Carol Hill--who's Carol Hill?  I don't know a Carol Hill.  Who's Carol Hill?  And then I remembered there was a girl in my law school class who was real cute, and she was black--the only black girl in our law school class.  And my buddy, Melvin May, who was also a cop in law school with me, we used to look at her 'cause she was cute, but we never, you know, said anything to her.  And she was friendly, but she was, you know, serious about going through law school.  And so I called Melvin up on the phone.  I said, Melvin--I said, guess who wrote me a card--'cause I was gonna stick it to 'em, you know.  He said, who?  I said, remember that pretty in our law school class?  I said, Carol Hill.  He said, who's Carol Hill?  I said, the girl who was at our law school class.  He said, you mean Virginia Hill.  I said, right, that's her name.  I said, well then who's Carol Hill?  And he said, I don't know; you're the one that got the letter; I don't know.  So I--then I thought and I remembered who she was, and I said, I gotta hang up.  And I hung up and I looked at the address on the back--on the--on the envelope, and it was a Gary, Indiana address.  Well I'm working at the paper; they had these cross-reference phonebooks.  So I went in and looked at the cross-reference address, and sure enough there was a phone number.  And I called it and she answered, and I told her who I was.  And she said, look, I didn't send you that card for you to call me.  I just wanted you to know that I was happy to have met you and that I'm glad to see that you're with the "Chicago Tribune" and not on the police department anymore.  My intention wasn't that you call me.  And so I said, well look, you know, can I see you?  No, and (unclear).  So I just got fed up.  I said listen, things have changed in my life; things have changed.  I said, I need to explain to you what's changed; I said, can I just see you for twenty minutes?  Just hear me out for twenty minutes.  And I said, if you don't wanna see me again in the twenty minutes, I'll never bother you; I'll never talk to you again.  So she paused and she waited.  So she said, okay.  And so I was supposed to go over to Gary [Indiana] the next day to see her, and I had a gig that night on Wells Street in Old Town [Chicago, Illinois].  And I remember I couldn't hardly play the gig thinking about the next day.  And I went over there--she had moved back--she had gone back to college to get a degree in public health administration, and she had moved back with her parents and--where she had grown up and was born and raised in Gary.  And I remember going to the house, and she opened the door and I walked in.  And her two sisters are sitting in the living room, and both of them got their arms folded looking at me like, you know, I'm on the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] most wanted list.  And so I'm, I'm talkin' to her; I meet her parents; and I really am under the microscope.  And so finally I said, look, you know, it's really hard to talk to you here.  I said, can, can we get in the car and dr--and just take a ride?  And so she said, okay, so we got in the car and I drove all the way back to Chicago [Illinois], to Jackson Park.  And for the next three or four hours in Jackson Park I told her everything that had happened and that my marriage was coming to an end, and I'd never forgotten about her, and blah, blah, blah.  And she told me she had never forgotten about me and that--she eventually told me that she had fallen in love with me on the first day we had met; and she had never forgotten me; and there had never been anybody else since then.  So we ended up gettin' married and having two sons.  And then my daughter from my first marriage moved with us, and then my daughter from before I was married moved with us, so all four of my kids ended up living with us.  And I'm very proud of 'em all and I'm very close to 'em all, and they've all done good things with their lives.
Story_ID: 156840
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I'm gone ask you more about your children in a minute--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I just wanted--it's interesting, that story--that's, that's where that comes--that's the way it ought to happen in life.  Okay, so in 2008 and when you retired from--in '98 [1998] rather--you retired from "Wall Street Journal," you spent some time as a teacher, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my first, my first ro--well I had done some, some, some lecturing/teaching--they, they had a program called the Summer Program for Minority Journalists, and that was headquartered at the time at Berkeley [the University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  And it was a summer program that accepted minorities with college degrees who wanted to be journalists, but for one reason or another needed to add to their skill-set.  So it was a very intensive eleven-week program, where they came out and they lived in dorms.  And if they were accepted, they lived in dorms; they got a hundred dollar a week stipend; and they were guaranteed a job for a year, if they successfully completed the program--completed the program.  And the graduates of that program had done some amazing things in journalism.  So I was a visiting faculty member for several years with that program.  One of the directors when I was there was a, a good friend of mine, Ellis Cose.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I also was involved in a program for minority high school journalists at the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] in the summer, and they would go for a two-week summer workshop--I think it was two weeks--summer workshop.  And these were minority kids--high school kids from Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.  And they would spend two weeks, and we--I was part of the faculty for that.  And, and, and, again, graduates of that program have done some amazing things.  But when I left, I became an adjunct at Columbia University School of Journalism in New York [New York].  And I did that up until we moved, and then when we moved to Atlanta--I mean, to Indianapolis [Indiana].  After I was there for a while, I became an adjunct journalism professor at Indiana University--Purdue University at Indianapolis [IUPUI], and I actually did that up until last spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I basically started moving to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: That's what they call IUPUI--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, IUPUI, as they used to say, IUPUI [pronounced it oohwee-poohwee] (laughter).
Speaker 1: I never heard that--that's--yeah.  I've heard 'em talk about it otherwise.  Now tell us about--now there's an organization that--now you're a member of the National Association of Black Journalists, right?
Speaker 2: I have been on and off.  I've let my membership maybe lapse for a year and then I just will renew it, but I'm, I'm a supporter.  I'm, I'm very strong--you know, strongly support it.
Speaker 1: Were you a founding member?
Speaker 2: No, I was not a founding member, but we had our own little journalism group in Chicago [Illinois] before there was any national group.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause it--the founder Vernon Jarett, was one of the founders--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Vernon Jarett was one of the founders.  A lot of my friends were founders--DeWayne Wickham, [Leslie] Les Payne--you know, really a bunch of good people.
Speaker 1: Francis Ward, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Paul Delaney, Francis Ward, yeah.  Francis is a good friend of mine--Val Gray Ward, his wife, yeah.  I mean, all of the--we all used to know each other and, and--I mean, you're talkin' about some really talented, nice, dedicated people.
Story_ID: 156841
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but there's another organization here--I have listed here too called the National Association of Minority Media Executives (NAMME).
Speaker 2: Yeah, we call that NAMME.  It don't--it no longer exists.  I was one of the founders of that, and I was a board member, but I left because I had a philosophical disagreement with them.  These were minority media executives, and yet and still when we talked about raising money, we would talk about getting money from the same news organizations that we could potentially be in conflict with over issues of diversity and fairness.  And to me it didn't make sense to keep running to Gannett [Company] and [The] New York Times and so forth and say give me, give me, give me, give me, when you also are tryin' to hold them accountable for fairness in hiring and promotion.  And they looked at me like I was nuts.  Because I think what had happened--and, and, and I may be wrong about this, but a lot of, of well-educated, middle-class black people who developed in the--in the post-civil rights era in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] and the early '80s [1980s] sort of adopted what I call a grant mentality, so that if you ever wanted to accomplish anything or do anything, you couldn't do it without a grant.  And so who did you go to for the grant?  You went to the same power structure that you--either, either governmental or businesswise--that you were supposed to be holding accountable, so that by the time you formed organizations, a lot of these people--and not just in journalism, but in the teaching professions and other professions--they, they really found it very difficult to talk about doing anything creative on their own without "going to the man" and asking for money, which meant that the man basically controls the purse strings, they control you.  And I was saying no.  We need to figure out how we can become independent financially.  And I think some of that people in the organization had become so used to thinking in terms of let's go to this company, or let's go to this foundation, or let's go--(unclear) to be paid.  And I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  I mean, I think for an organization like [The] HistoryMakers, for example, the, the, the grant idea is a marvelous idea.  But if you're--if you--a--are an advocacy journalism group and you are going to be, in a way, opposed to these companies over issues of diversity in hiring and promotion, it's a conflict of interest to ask these same people to finance you.  The HistoryMakers doesn't do that, you know.  And, and, and, and so organizations like that or if it's the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or the Urban League [National Urban League], that makes sense.  But it doesn't make sense to me for an advocacy organization that's gonna hold these institutions accountable to still go to these institutions and say give me money.  Anyway--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --obviously, everybody in the organization almost disagreed with me, so I just resigned; I left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they eventually--they stopped; they--
Speaker 1: Folded.
Speaker 2: --there's--yeah, there's no longer that organization, and that's unfortunate because I think they were a good organization.  I just disagreed with their fundraising, that's all.
Story_ID: 156842
Speaker 1: Okay, now in 2006, IUPUI [Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana] presented you the Alfred Bynum Award (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's an award--it's a--it's a--it's a university-wide award for mentoring by a non-tenured faculty--you know, non-fulltime faculty member.  And I, I think that was basically because, you know, a couple of people and my dean really, you know, liked me and thought I was making a contribution.  And I don't really know if there's a lot of competition for that award (laughter), so maybe I, I won it because maybe I was the only person nominated.  I don't know (laughter).  I, I never--I never explored it to find out, but I thought it was a nice honor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in addition to National Association of Black Journalists, I hear that--well I have a note here that you're a member of that Asian-American Journalists Association.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I joined that, and I was a member of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.  You know, I--one of the things I did when I left The Wall Street Journal was I became--I still remained a consultant for them.  And I was a consultant up until last year.  And what I did as a consultant was I looked for talent for them and interviewed prospective hires.  And so they would pay for my membership to these other organizations because--you know, I, I got to know friends and to know people in these organizations, again, because I've always been dedicated to diversifying the, the news industry, and, and that means, you know everybody, in--including hiring--diversity to me means everybody--white people, black people, everybody, you know.  If you exclude anybody then you're not being diverse.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now--
Speaker 2: I also belonged to--in fact, I was the Indiana Pro Chapter president of the Society for Professional Journalists, which did not have any black members until I think early 1970, when they first admitted--I'm tryin' to remember; it was in Chicago [Illinois] with ABC--Les Brownlee was the first member of the Society for Professional Journalists.  And that's the largest journalism organization in the country, and they didn't have a black member until I think 1970 or the late '60s [1960s].  But I ended up as the Indiana Pro Chapter president.
Speaker 1: Yes, Les Brownlee, we--yeah, we've--I'm surprised we haven't men--mentioned him before now.  I should have said something about him.
Speaker 2: Well he was Pam Johnson's almost like adoptive father.  And I think that he's the one that really got her started on the journalism path.  Remember I mentioned her as the second person they [The Chicago Tribune] hired--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --after me.
Speaker 1: Who's now in Kentucky, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Western Kentucky University [Bowling Green, Kentucky], the last time I heard.  But like I said, she went back to I think Wisconsin [the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] and got a PhD.
Story_ID: 156843
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear)--Now you've been a member of the Chicago Federation of Musicians Union for--
Speaker 2: I'm a life member.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of the Chicago Federation of Musicians.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I've been there for like 46--47 years.
Speaker 1: And you've, you've continued to play, right?
Speaker 2: I still continue to play, play.
Speaker 1: Vibraphone and you--tell us about--now did, did you--did you're playing like pick up steam after you retired?  Did you play more?
Speaker 2: No, no, but I still played, but I, I did most of my playing in Chicago [Illinois] when, when--you know, when I was on the road.  And, and like I say, you know, I really started out because I was surrounded by really good people in Chicago in Hyde Park.  Herbie Hancock was our piano player.  He--we, we formed a group, and there were four of us.  It was Leslie Rout who--he's, he's dead now, but he was someone that you sh--would certainly have made a wonderful HistoryMaker.  Leslie grew up in Ida B. Wells projects when I met him as a freshman at Loyola [Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois].  He went on to become a Fulbright Scholar; get a PhD; he was an expert in Latin American History.  From the time he was in kindergarten to the time he got his PhD, he made one B.  Everything else was an A.  So he was a saxophone player, and he was extremely good.
Speaker 1: And he's no longer with us--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, he was in--he died.  He, he was a professor--a full professor at the University of Michigan I think or Michigan State. Billy Johns, who I lost track of was the bass player.  Ralph King--no, Billy Quinn was the drummer.  Billy and his family owned a house at 4928 S. Greenwood.  It was a huge house with a ballroom on the 3rd floor.  His doc--his father was Dr. William P. Quinn, who was a well-known radiologist.  And they had this beautiful house on Greenwood, and we would rehearse in the ballroom on the 3rd floor.  And I'm tryin' to think.  Billy--yeah, so there were four of us, and I was on vibes.
Story_ID: 156844
Speaker 1: So, we needed a piano player, and someone said, well there's this fourteen-year-old kid in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], but he's a freshman but he's good.  And so we said, well let's invite him to the next rehearsal and we did, and that's the first time I met Herbie [Hancock].  And he walked in and sat down at the piano, and, and we said, well what do you wanna--he asked us what we wanted to play.  And we said, what do you wanna play?  And he said, I wanna play "Frosty the Snowman."  And we all said, this is what happens when you get a fourteen-year-old kid.  We said, no, man, we wanna be jazz musicians; what are you talkin' about?  And I never will forget, Herbie said, well let me just play a--I got, got an idea.  And he played "Frosty the Snowman" like we had never heard it played before.  And, of course, we never questioned him again.  But he started playing piano with us, and Herbie and I played on and off for several years after that.  I was the first one to go on the road.  Herbie graduated from Hyde Park and won a scholarship--full academic ride--to Grinnell [Grinnell College, Grinnell, Iowa].  And Herbie was really, really good in math and physics.  And also winning--he didn't get a scholarship, but he was the guy--the other guy that went to Grinnell, and who also hung out with us, was Donald Stewart, later to become Dr. Donald Stewart, the first male president of Spelman College and now in Chicago [Illinois] is the head of some foundation.  But Donald grew up with all of us in Hyde Park--Billy, Herbie, everything.  And Donald was the alternate for the scholarship that Herbie got.  And Donald's dad worked in the post office, and so they were struggling to keep his tuition up.  And Herbie's dad had a grocery store on 61st and Evans, so they didn't have a lot of money.  So Herbie had the scholarship, but he was always shy around girls.  And so he started--he realized that when he played the piano in the student lounge all the girls would come around.  So he started spending more time playing the piano in the student lounge, and his grades suffered, and he lost the scholarship.  And Donald Stewart was an alternate, and he got it.  So we all used to laugh as we grew up, you know, that Donald probably wouldn't have been Dr. Donald Stewart, and blah, blah, blah, if Herbie hadn't (laughter) been playin' the piano in the student lounge.
Story_ID: 156845
Speaker 1: So Herbie came back to Chicago, and lo and behold, he enrolled at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] where I was.  And so Joe Segal was havin' his jam sessions at Roosevelt at that time.  He used to run a record store on Wabash Avenue in the Roosevelt University building.  So this was just a mecca for jazz at the Roose--at Roosevelt.  And we used to do little jazz concerts down there plus Joe Segal did his thing.  And Herbie and I were playing around Chicago, sometimes together sometimes not.  And Herbie was gettin' a reputation, and I was beginning to get a reputation, even though he's ten times more talented than I am.  Donald Byrd came to town, and he had Duke Pearson on piano, and Duke was--got sick and was sort of a prelude to the, the sickness that eventually he died from.  And Donald needed a piano player, and somebody suggested Herbie.  And Herbie--they were playin' up on Rush Street, and Herbie took the gig.  And Donald let Herbie take Duke's place while Duke was out and eventually kept him, and Herbie moved to New York to play with Donald Byrd.  And then Donald decided that he was gonna go back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and get a PhD, and he broke up the band.  In the meantime, Herbie had written "Watermelon Man," so he had enough money from "Watermelon Man" to live and stay in New York [New York].  And while he was in New York, he met a young guy called Tony Williams, who was a drummer who had just recently been hired by Miles Davis.  Miles was lookin' for a piano player and Tony brought Herbie to Miles' brownstone.  And Herbie auditioned for Miles at Miles' brownstone, and Miles hired Herbie for his group, and the rest is history.  And meanwhile, I, I kept playin' around Chicago and played with different groups, and--the Northern Jazz Quartet; then I played with people like Wallace Burton, Dave Ship, George Hunter and the Moonlighters.  So I played with a number of different groups as a side man.  And, of course, you know I told you I had gone on the road with the Dozier Boys.
Speaker 2: Right, right, in Minnesota.
Speaker 1: And-
Story_ID: 156846
Speaker 1: Now there's a--you were telling me this story before we started.  We, we were mentioning the Rahsaan Roland Kirk.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we'll never get a chance to interview because he's gone.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it's such a great story how--could you retell that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--I was playing with the Northern Jazz Quintet at a place called the Wonder Inn on 75th and Cottage Grove, and we played there on Friday and Saturday nights.  And Herbie had a group.  Herbie Hancock had a group that played on, on Sunday and Monday, and then Sun Ra and his orchestra played on Tuesday, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.  And a lot of musicians used to come into the Wonder Inn to hear us play.  And one night Joe Segal walks in and he's with this--with this guy, and he wants to know can the guy sit in.  And, and, and I said, what does he play?  He said he plays tenor.  And I remember asking Joe--he said, he just moved here from Columbus Ohio.  So I asked Joe, I, I, I said, well can he play?  And, and Joe said, would I bring you anybody who couldn't play?  And I said, oh, okay, 'cause Joe Segal had quite a reputation, a good one, as, as being a sort of connoisseur of good musicians.  And so when it came time I said, we'll bring him up on the next set.  And so when it came time to bring him up, you entered the bandstand behind the bar, and you had to climb some stairs to the stage and then you got on the stage behind the bar.  And I noticed that this guy was being led by Joe Segal, and I realized he was blind.  And then as he was climbing up the stairs, I turned around and looked at him, and I saw he had three horns around his neck.  And I'm--one I recognize as a tenor saxophone, but the other two I didn't know, so I said, hey, man--I said, what, what are--what are those horns?  And he said, well this is a tenor, but this is a manzella (ph.)--and he pointed to one; and he pointed at the other and said, this is a stritch.  Well I'd never heard of those horns before, so I asked Les Rout, who was our, our baritone player.  I said--in (unclear)--I said, Les, have you ever heard of a manzella or a stritch.  He said, no, man, never heard of it.  So then I calculated that this a novelty act.  This is a blind guy playing novelty instruments, and the idea is to get him off the bandstand as soon as possible.  And the way to do that is to play something really fast so that he'll embarrass himself and leave.  So I decided--I was calling the tunes--I decided we're gone play "They'll Never Be Another You" way up, very fast.  And he said okay.  So he played the head of the tune way up, and when it came time for the first solo, because he couldn't see, I just called out, you.  And he picked up the tenor and he started playin'.  This guy, I mean, he cut through those changes in that song like I--like I say "a hot knife in butter."  I mean, he was runnin' that song forwards, backwards, upside down with ease.  My mouth dropped open.  Everybody in the band was lookin'.  Then he took one of the other horns and put it in his mouth at the same time he had the tenor, and began to play counterpoint on the two horns for a couple of choruses.  And then after that he took all three horns and put them in his mouth and played chords through the whole song for a couple of choruses.  And when he finished nobody else came in.  All you could hear was the rhythm section.  The place was quiet; the audience didn't clap; nobody said anything; he just stood there.  All, all you heard was this silence.  And then somebody in the office--and the audience screamed--aaaahhhhhh--and the place went crazy.  That guy was Roland Kirk, later to be known as Rahsaan Roland Kirk.  And he had first come to Chicago.  And to make matters worse, he knew what I had done.  He was such a good musician, he knew I had tried to lay him out there.  And he was such a gentleman that he never mentioned--he never held it against me, and we became--we got to know each other a little better.  He was always really nice to me, and I learned a lesson: don't ever do anything like that again, and especially since he was playin' rings around me to boot.

Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now you--you're back in Atlanta [Georgia].  You've just moved, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've, I've, I've sort of been moving ever since last January.  So I go up to my place, and it's, it's on the market for sale in, in, in Indianapolis [Indiana].  It's much bigger than, than my apartment here, and I bring items and objects back little by little.  But I really decided to furnish this place, you know, brand new, fresh out.  And so that's what, what I've been doing.  But I have a buyer for my house now.  We're on contract.  We'll see if the deal goes through, but if it does then that'll pretty much cut my ties to Indianapolis, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, do you have children here in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: I have a son here and his family.  You know, my kids grew up in the different places that I was stationed, whether with TIME Magazine or The Wall Street Journal.  And so they picked the places to live that they liked growing up.  So I have two kids in New York; I have one here; and I have a daughter in California.
Story_ID: 56814
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us a little, little bit about your family--I mean, your, your children and what they're doing.
Speaker 2: Well my oldest daughter is Beverly; Beverly Griffith is her name, and she was a product of a romance that I had before I ever got married.  I wanted to step up and do the right thing.  Her family wasn't interested in having me be a part of that.  And, in fact, the young woman got married to another person right after that, and for many years my daughter thought her real father was the guy that she grew up with as her father; they did--they didn't tell her about me.  That ended badly.  The mother got divorced.  My daughter wasn't treated very well in that relationship, and so she was not close to that gentleman at all.  And the mother got in touch with me years, years later and I was able to reconcile with my daughter, and she realized that I was her real father and she eventually moved in with me and our family.  And I love her crazily, and she's my daughter.  My, my next oldest is my--another daughter from my first marriage, and she lives in New York.  The, the first daughter lives in San Diego; she's a banker.  The daughter who lives in New York is an office manager, but she recently got certified as a yoga instructor; so she's a yogi and she's getting ready to open up her own studio.  After that are the two boys that Carol and I had; we had two sons.  My daughter in New York, her name is Leslie, Leslie Boyce Morana; her husband is named Pete Morana.  Beverly, my oldest daughter, her name is Beverly Griffith; she was married, and she's divorced.  She has a daughter who's my granddaughter Ashley, and Ashley has--is married and Ashley has two daughters, Natalia and--my goodness, I'm, I'm doing a--there--there's a--there's a senior--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: --senior moment.  She was born not too long ago.  It'll, it'll definitely come--it'll definitely come to me before I'm through, but she's a sweet little girl; she's about one and a half years old.  And this is the first time I've ever blanked on a name.  Leslie doesn't have any children and her husband, like I said, is Pete Morana.  Nelson is my oldest son.  He is a senior vice president for adver--Eastern advertising for BET [Black Entertain Television], and so he's with Viacom; he's married; his wife is Michelle; they have a, a son, Pharaoh; and they live in New Rochelle, New York; and he works in Manhattan [New York City, New York].  And my younger son is Joel, who lives here, and he started out in advertising in Manhattan and decided he wanted to give back to the community and so he applied for, and was accepted, by Teach for America.  And he started teaching for Teach for America in Houston [Texas] and taught two years, got certified, taught there for a while.  He had friends that he had made when we lived in Atlanta [Georgia].   He wanted to come back here.  He got certified in Atlanta so now he teaches in Clayton County schools. He's married; he has two sons, Rowan (ph.) and Remy (ph.); and his wife's name is Lauren.  And so those are my kids and I love 'em madly and they're all great, great kids, and, and we're all very, very close.
Story_ID: 56815
Speaker 1: It's interesting because Beverly [Griffith] moved with us when she was an adult and, in fact, moved her daughter with us.  And we had a special room built in the house with a--with an extra bathroom to accommodate the extra space.  And she went to junior college and Nelson [Boyce] went to junior college at the same time in New York, but most people didn't know they were brother and sister because they didn't have the same last name.  And they both excelled.  Nelson got accepted at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  She got accepted at Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts].  She had a double major and a 4.0 plus GPA.  Nelson had a 3.8 GPA and was chairman of all student activities and an athlete.  And I remember when they both graduated, the newspapers ran separate stories on them and still didn't know they were brother and sister.  But the president of the junior college, which is one of the highest ranked junior colleges in the country, came to me at graduation and got me aside and said, this institution will never, never be the same because of your son and your daughter.  Because when he was there he helped found an African-African Students Association, and they went out and did oral histories on common black people in the community.  And she got a woman studies program--she got the women's faculty--as a student, she got the women faculty to launch a women's studies program at, at, at the college.  And she graduated from Smith with a degree in economics, and he graduated from Harvard in government.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: They both wanted to go--both of my sons wanted to go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 56816
Speaker 1: Let me ask about your mother [Sadie Nelson] now.  Your, your mother passed in 2001, was it?
Speaker 2: She passed--no, my mother passed away in 1979.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a long time ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what, what did she think about your career?
Speaker 2: I was able to--I was honored in New York with an award by the New York YMCAs [Young Men's Christian Association]--an achievement award--in 1970 or '71 [1971].  And so TIME [Magazine] flew me to New York to receive that.  They had a big banquet, and I was able to take her to that with me.  And we stayed at the Hilton [Hotel] and, and so she was able to do that.  And then the local paper in Danville [Illinois]--'cause she had moved back to Danville when she retired--and the local paper in Danville did an article--a couple of articles maybe--on me when I was with TIME Magazine.  So she was able to see that, that I had managed to do some things, even, even though she, you know, must have gritted her teeth when I ended up, you know, graduating in the late--you know, lat--in the lower third or fourth in my class in high school.  You know, and she had been a real scholar, but she never really gave me a lot of grief, and she never told me there was anything I couldn't do.  She was always extremely encouraging and supporting.  And at--I've learned since, that's really, really, really important for children to have the--you know, their parents telling them you can do, you can do, rather than you can't.
Story_ID: 56817
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there a major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would--I would get a college degree and I'd graduate from law school definitely, and I highly recommend it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that, that, that still kinda bo--bothers you after all--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's hindered me.  You know, I don't think it's hindered me, but it's just, you know, something I've left undone that--you know, I don't like to leave things undone.  I--you know, I, I like to--I like to feel that, you know, I do my best, and I, I didn't do my best academically.  And today--in today's world with the credentials that I had then, and if I'd brought them today, probably none of the things that I managed to do would have been possible today, because--I would have just been eliminated before I even had a chance to show what I could do.  Because the threshold now in many places is they don't care how promising you may seem you never get a chance to display it, because if you don't have that degree they don't even wanna talk to you.  I mean, you never get past the door.  I don't think that's necessarily a good thing, but that's the way it is.  But back then--I mean, this fella [Don] Starr that I told you about, who was the foreign editor of the Chicago Tribune, I think he had maybe two, three years of college; he didn't have a degree.  But you had a lot of really, really bright, bright people then who didn't have degrees.  And then you had people like my mother, who was brilliant in my opinion, who couldn't get a job as a teacher because only one school would hire black teachers.  The principal of that school had two years of education.  My mother had a master's; she couldn't get a job.
Speaker 1: So many contradictions.
Speaker 2: There is always contradictions around nonsense, and racism is absolute utter nonsense; there's no logic to it.  It just does--doesn't make any, any sense at all.  But insecure, weak people hold onto it because in many cases that's all they have to hold onto.
Story_ID: 56818
Speaker 1: Okay, now once again when you look back at all your accomplishments to this point, and you're still doing some things, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I guess from a journalistic standpoint, I think the nicest thing that could ever be said about my career in journalism is for someone to say we know it happened that way because Joe Boyce wrote it.  That would be the biggest compliment I could ever get.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the biggest compliments I, I think I ever got in music was I, I was playing a gig in, in Champaign, Illinois.  And in Champaign a lot of the people of the University of Illinois music school play gigs, including the doctoral candidates.  And there was a guy from--I think he was from Brazil or somewhere--who was a tremendous saxophone player who was on, on, on this gig, and, and he was really a really good player, and we--and it was the first time we ever played together.  And, and we didn't really talk much, but, but I admired his playing and I guess he liked mine.  And a few months later I was on another gig, and it was in a hotel and I was setting up my stuff.  And I had come downstairs and he was entering the building with another friend, and it turned out he had been called for the band too for the gig.  And I remember he opened the door as I was going off, and I said, "Hi" to him and he said, "Hi".  And he looked me and he looked at his friend, and he said, "This is a serious gig".  And that was one of the nicest compliments I had ever received in music.  'Cause I admired the heck out of him and I mean, you know, he's--he got his PhD in, in, you know.  And he, he just looked at his friend and said this is a serious gig after he saw me.  And I thought that that was a great thing for him to say.
Story_ID: 56819
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything we have not discussed, and it's probably a million things we could probably still talk about, but is there any ma--ma--major thing before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: By now anybody looking at this tape has probably had enough of me, so I can't really think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good father.  My wife [Carol Boyce] is gone, so I would say as a good husband, but she's gone.  To those friends I have, as a good friend.  And to my colleagues in journalism, as someone who believed in and tried to uphold the best, in, in terms of ethics and standards in journalism.  You know, time moves on and, you know, people make a contribution.  And you hope to leave one or two things that people remember maybe later and think about, and, and you hope it's something good.  And it does a little bit to improve things, the world maybe.  You know, I think the purpose in life is to leave it a little better than we were when we came in it.  And if you can say that then I think you've been a success.  If you can wake up in the morning and you can look forward to the rest of the day, you're a success; I don't care what you do.  If you can wake up and look forward to the rest of the day, your life is a success.  And that's what I would say.  You know, and--you know, and to those, you know, who are close to me, don't mourn me; you know, I had a good life; keep on truckin'.
Story_ID: 56820
Speaker 1: Okay, I, I thought of one more thing to ask you--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and that's--and that's what I--I should have asked it before.  But what are some of your concerns for the black community today?  And--like, this is a two-part thing--and then what advice would you offer young aspiring black journalists?
Speaker 2: Well let me start with the black journalists.  Read, read, read.  Embrace the English language; learn it well, back and forth.  It is your language.  It's simple as that.  It's not--it doesn't belong to any certain group of people.  It belongs to you as much as anybody else.  It is the currency in which we communicate; learn it well, if you wanna be a good journalist, and try to concern yourself with substantive things.  You know, because sometimes the why of what happened is far more important than what happened, you know.  Or what happened is not as important without the why, so go a little deeper; always be curious; never lose your curiosity or your sense of wonder, and be fair.  Don't let your personal feelings and biases, regardless of what they are, enter into your work because that's not your job.  Your job is to present the facts as best you can and as comprehensively as you can.  Nobody gives a care about what you think.  If you give people the right information, they can make up their own minds about what they think.
Story_ID: 56821
Speaker 1: We have two black Americas and it's unfortunate.  We have the black America that tends to be successful, tends to be educated, tends to be motivated, tends to be driven.  And then we have the black America that seems to have decided that it's okay to be ignorant; that it's okay to be disrespectful of other people; and it's okay to commit violence against other people; it's okay to mistreat women and disrespect women.  You know, we have people who have become millionaires denigrating black females and exploiting the notion of it's okay to kill other black people.  It's called the record industry.  And we have people who are millionaires because they have made a fortune disrespecting and downgrading black women and by creating a culture where it's okay to have a gun and shoot somebody if they disagree with you, as long as a black--is a--it's a black--another black person.  And yet and still these people are looked at as some kind of heroes.  And I don't care if they spend $500 dollars to send some kid to summer camp.  That doesn't make up for the damage they do.  I don't care if they belong to some kind of charity--doesn't make up for the damage they do.  You know, there's no way that what they have done and are doing can be justified, and if they wanna argue that it's freedom of expression, my answer to that is, on your next album say Jew bitch one time and see how long you stay in the music business.  So we have that and then we have young people who look at these folks as some kind of heroes and role models.
Story_ID: 56822
Speaker 1: We've gotten into a situation where if you study hard, attend class, make good grades, speak English properly, you're accused of acting white, not only by your peers, but by some adults and sometimes your own relatives.  And my question to that is, if that is acting white, please explain to me what is acting black?  You'll never get an answer to that, not by the ones who accuse you of acting white.  So I'm concerned.  I mean, do we really want our legacy to be the degree to which we can lower our pants and show our underwear and our ass.  Is that really what we wanna be known for--or how loud we can talk in public?  When people say, well, you know, you're being unfair because other people do that too; it's not just black people.  And I'm saying that's true, but they don't have some of the obstructions and the impediments that black people have.  And you know what?  I'm black; I'm concerned about black people, you know.  I love black people; I'm concerned about black people.  And so if a brother or sister is out of line, I feel it's my responsibility, if I can, to try to get 'em back in, because in so many ways there is so much potential and brilliance and talent and beauty in the black community.  It just runs over and overflows with that.  And that's not to say other groups don't do that too; it's in other groups too, but we're not talking about other groups; we're talking about the black community.  And so there's this wealth of ability and talent, and I just hate to see it squandered.  And I hate to see so much attention and time spent on morons and misfits.  We have two things to worry about: those outside our community who would oppress us; but more dangerous are those inside our community who would oppress us, and they are there.
Story_ID: 56823
Speaker 1: Okay, so your hopes for, for the community is?
Speaker 2: Stop the nonsense.  It's about as plain as it can get.  Stop the silliness.  Let's get with the program.  That doesn't mean you have to conform to everything society wants you to do, but be smart.  Behave in a way that makes sense, not just to me, but--because I'm not anybody's judge--but makes sense.  You know, try to do things that are gonna elevate you, that are gonna make you a better person, that'll help you achieve those goals you wanna achieve.  Parents don't let your kids tell you that they don't need to study 'cause their gonna go to the NFL [National Football League], 'cause the chances are one in a million that it's gonna happen.  Tell 'em, well that's fine, but wouldn't it be great, you know, if you were an all star linebacker and you knew how to spell correctly?  You know?  Parents get involved with your kids in school.  Stop going down to school just to fight the teacher all the time--things like that.  You know what?  People criticize Bill Cosby.  Bill Cosby was right.  And I'm gone say one last thing.  When people here talk like I'm doing, they say stop airing our dirty laundry.  And my answer to that is, rather than being worried about people airing dirty laundry, you should be more concerned that there is dirty laundry to air.  Do somethin' about that.
