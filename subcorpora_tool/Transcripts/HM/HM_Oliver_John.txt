Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --they only require and deserve a short answer.  And the first one is sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I like all food.  I--it's hard for me to say what my favorite is 'cause I will eat just about anything other than raw cheese.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue and gray.
Speaker 1: Okay, like Civil War (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (laughter), Confederate.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, I don't seem to be that one-dimensional.  It's, you know, I'm, I will grab on to, on to any phrase that I think aptly describes a particular set of values or situation that I think is useful at the moment.
Story_ID: 191835
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you about your family history.  And I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John Oliver, Sr.] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side and we'll start with you giving us your mother's full name and spelling it for us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name is, was, or still is, Marye Thompson Oliver.  It's Thompson, it's T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N, and Oliver is the same as my last name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Marye with an "e"--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: M-A-R-Y-E.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was 1911 and she was born in Somerset, Pennsylvania.  And she died 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I know her mother [Fanny Thompson] and her father [George Thompson].  I know very little about, very much beyond that.  I know their names.  I have a sense of where her mother was born but not a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there, are there any, any stories or, or situations that are passed down about that side of the family, you know, what they were doing--are they descended from free people or slaves, or are they--
Speaker 2: It's hard for me to say.  I know that my grandfather, my, my mother's father was a barber in Somerset, Pennsylvania.  I, and I know my grandmother, for, from what I can glean, was a housewife who raised her children.  My mother had three sisters and two brothers, and one adopted sister.  And since Somerset was a, a fairly rural town in western Pennsylvania, they were very, very close, as I imagine most African American families were when they were located in communities that really didn't have sizeable numbers of African Americans.
Speaker 1: Now Somerset is a, from what I understand, is right off of I-70, right, going through the Pennsylvania Turnpike?
Speaker 2: Off of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, that's correct.  It is--Pennsylvania Turnpike runs right through it almost.  It's a very pretty place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think a lot of black people have been there on their way to [Washington] D.C. or back from D.C., probably on--
Speaker 2: Between Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and D.C.
Speaker 1: --or the, yeah, Pittsburgh and D.C., right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that is the route that people take.
Speaker 1: Okay so is there anything else about your mother's family that you, you know?  Were they--
Speaker 2: I was probably very--far more closer to them than I was with members of my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was very tight with her sisters, so I was, I became very close with all the families of her sisters and their children.  And we are still fairly close.  We communicate.  We just had a, a form of a family reunion two weeks ago celebrating the birthday--I think it was the eighty-fourth or the eighty-third birthday of the only surviving sister of my mother, and at that point, many members of the family came back together and spent an enjoyable few hours looking at old pictures and, and remembering the good ole times.
Speaker 1: So, do you have a lot of cousins on that side?
Speaker 2: Lots and lots of cousins.  Interesting aspect of that side of the family is that the generations that exist right now are fairly diverse as a result of some of the cousins passing.  You don't hear from them for several years.  And part of the excitement over the last couple of years has been the children of some of the members of that side of the family becoming aware that they are connected to an entire segment of African Americans.  And, suddenly, we have cousins popping up who are part black; part, part Japanese; part black; part Iraqi, or whatever.  It's to, you know, it's a very interesting evolution that we're seeing in the family because everyone is becoming reconnected.  And not only is it a thrill for the younger members who are now basically for the first time realizing that this family is very broad and multicultural, but it is, you know, excitement coming from meeting the unknown and realizing that they're related.
Story_ID: 191836
Speaker 1: Now, well, while we're on your mother's side of the family, can you tell us about your mother [Marye Thompson Oliver]?  What was she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was a school teacher and a very committed school teacher who spent lots of her time working on her, her teaching plans.  She taught grades four through six.  She was like a reading specialist, I glean.
Speaker 1: So did she, she had a chance to go to college and everything, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a graduate of a--what they call a normal school in those days which was a teachers college for African Americans here in Baltimore [Maryland].  She's a graduate of [Fanny Jackson] Coppin [Normal School, Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Normal School which became Coppin, Coppin State University [Baltimore, Maryland] or State College.
Speaker 1: Did most of her sisters go to school, too?
Speaker 2: I think one of her sisters went to college.  Hazel [ph.], her youngest sister, who is the only surviving one left, went to college.  Her other two sisters did not.  I'm pretty certain they did not.  And the adopted sister did not either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And neither one of her brothers did.
Speaker 1: So she was raised in Somerset [Pennsylvania] and then, then went to school here in Baltimore at Coppin?
Speaker 2: Came to school in Baltimore and stayed here after she got married to my dad [John Oliver, Sr.] who she met.  She had known for quite a while because my dad, being part of the Murphy family, my dad's aunt had--lived in--one of his aunts, rather, lived in Somerset, Pennsylvania.  So, as a kid, my father would go to Somerset to spend the summer.  And that's where he more or less was introduced to the Thompson family, and so they knew each other, or as kids, and they sort of grew up in the summertime.  So when he came to Baltimore from Indiana, which is where he was born and raised, it was probably no surprise that, you know, he just gravitated to the people that he knew.
Story_ID: 191837
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.  What was his full name and can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: His name is John J. Oliver, Sr., same as mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is October, I'm sorry, August the 16th, 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what do you know about that side of the family?  This is a family with, with the most well-known history, I guess--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --going, going back aways.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's the Murphys.  My father is grandson of John H. Murphy, Sr. who is the founder of the Afro-American Newspaper.  He is the son of one of the daughters.  John H. Murphy, Sr. had five sons and five daughters.  I believe Rose [Murphy Oliver]--it's, it's hard for me to remember exactly whether she was one of the oldest or one of the youngest.  But nevertheless, she was a daughter who got married to a doctor who is not located in Baltimore [Maryland] but, instead, indeed was located in Brazil, Indiana.  And so she moved, or rather escaped, the family (laughter).
Speaker 1: Escaped the family.   Now, now why do you say that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I, I--because of the fact that I--it's hard for me to believe that in those days, it was easy for any member of a family that was so closely knit to really, easily leave that comforting nest or cocoon that had more or less nurtured them to adulthood.  I, I just, you know, you didn't have cars.  You didn't have airplanes to see someone of the family go off far, far away was probably a very difficult and very complicated process.
Speaker 1: And leaving Baltimore to--for Brazil, Indiana had to be a big change.
Speaker 2: That's incredible.  I just don't know how that happened--
Story_ID: 191838
Speaker 1: Now where is Brazil, Indiana at?
Speaker 2: That's in the southwestern sector of Indiana.  It's--
Speaker 1: So it's near Kentucky and southern Illinois?
Speaker 2: It's getting close to that.  It's getting close to southern Illinois.  It's, it's not too far from--well, it's--I was there two weeks ago but I wasn't in Brazil.  I was in Greencastle, Indiana which is where my father [John Oliver, Sr.] went to college at a college called DePauw [University, Greencastle, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Yeah, DePauw, P-A-U-W, right?
Speaker 2: With a "w."  That is most noted as being the alma mater of one of the founders of Dow Jones [& Company], but also [Vice President] Dan Quayle and [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jordan.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Willis Bing Davis, the artist, too, is from--yep.
Speaker 2: And Percy Julian--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who, while I was there that weekend, they were rededicating the biggest building on campus to Dr. Percy Julian, probably one of the best known African American chemists of our time.  But I was there at Greencastle to receive, for my father, two awards as a distinguished alumni which was reflected in a plaque being dedicated to him in the student union, and also another plaque being dedicated to him in the media building which is a brand new building on campus, and then also a resident building that was named after him for seniors.  It was interesting because as I cheered with the gathering at the awards ceremony one of those evenings that I was there with my sister [Marilyn Thompson-Pickett], I, I told them that being an African American in something as middle America as Greencastle, Indiana in 1933 must have been, to say the least, a very interesting experience.
Speaker 1: 'Cause now Indiana had a reputation for being the southern state up north really.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was very tough.  And I think my dad once told me about how he got into a fight with probably one of the most noted members of Brazil in high school--fight that they got into.  Jimmy Hoffa was from Brazil, Indiana.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Jimmy Hoffa.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Hoffa?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Of the [International Brotherhood of] Teamsters [Union]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Union, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And he sort of shared with me how--not a pleasant person, he didn't seem to be at that time, particularly to black folks but, yeah, maybe as he grew older, that changed.  I don't know.  But he didn't seem to be one of my dad's favorite people.  But just the experience of being black in Middle America in those years must have been fairly trying.  I do know that at the time they were--there were four or five blacks, I believe, on campus at DePauw at that time.  And all of them were relegated to living in one little white building on the corner of the campus.  And they probably were fairly well restricted in what they could do or where they could go, but they all seemed to enjoy their experience.  I think the only reason why they went is because they really respected the opportunity that of the education that was being extended to them.  And I think that is probably one of the things that he instilled in me and my sister, you know, to not ignore the value of particularly higher education opportunities.
Story_ID: 191839
Speaker 1: Your father [John Oliver, Sr.] then returned to Baltimore [Maryland].  I mean, he moved to Baltimore 'cause he was born, I suppose, in Brazil, Indiana?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: After Greencastle [Indiana], yeah, after he graduated [from DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana], he came to Baltimore and got a job at the only place he ever worked in his life, the Afro [Afro-American Company, later Afro-American Newspapers]-
Speaker 1: The Afro-American.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Came in to Baltimore, moved into, moved in with two of his cousins.  The brother of his mother [Rose Murphy Oliver], George B. Murphy, was--had a family on Druid Hill Avenue in Baltimore.  And my dad moved into the top back bedroom with one of George's sons, [HistoryMaker] William [H.] Murphy [Sr.].  So my dad and William Murphy and another cousin, who joined them, [HistoryMaker] John Murphy, III, they all lived in one room, slept, I believe, in the same bed (laughter).  So, they sort of bonded, I suppose, you know, but an interesting thing, they were each distinctly different individuals.  And, and it was like dad and John were more or less incorporated until--into the ritual and the process of the George B. Murphy family.  And I, I remember they were all required to meet at dinner and be at the table at a particular time each day for dinner.  And there was a strict adherence to the manners and what could be talked about, and what couldn't be talked about, but talking to dad, that appeared to be one of the most pleasant times in his life 'cause I, I think he really loved that family.  I mean it was--
Speaker 1: But highly structured family.
Speaker 2: It was a very structured--but I think George B. was a very interesting, complicated man who was head of the Baltimore School System [Baltimore City Public Schools].  He was the only one of the Murphy brothers who was not actively involved in the management of the Afro.  His wife was a little itty, bitty, very cute little member of the upper class families of Baltimore society, Grace [Murphy].  And they must have made the--well I remember seeing her and I remember seeing him once or twice before he died, but they were a very impressive and interesting couple.  I think, again, that that was probably one of my dad's most pleasant periods of his life--not to say that it wasn't pleasant in Brazil, but I think he enjoyed the newness of more or less seeing the other segments of his family that he may have known, but probably had not spent a whole lot of time with.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you said he met your mother [Marye Thompson Oliver] in, in Somerset [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: He met, he knew, met my mother in Somerset, and he sort of they became reacquainted when he moved back to Baltimore after he graduated from DePauw [University] and started working at the Afro.
Story_ID: 191840
Speaker 1: Now how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her name is Marilyn, M-A-R-I-L-Y-N, T, Thompson-Pickett.
Speaker 1: Is she older or younger?
Speaker 2: She's one year younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your, your household consisted of--I know your, you and your sister and your mother [Marye Thompson Oliver] and father [John Oliver, Sr.], but were there any other members of the, the family in the household with you?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean we, at times, we had people living on our third floor, sometimes for short periods of time and they were relatives.  My father had a sister, Elizabeth [ph.], and I remember once or twice Elizabeth and her family lived upstairs.  And then I remember for a period of time, my, my Aunt Hazel's [ph.] family, my mother's sister, lived up on the third floor until they found an apartment or a house.  But most of the times, it was just, just us in a very big house on Madison Avenue [Baltimore, Maryland] which, at that time, was still viewed as the center of the, the black neighborhood.  The, the black middle class neighborhood 'cause everybody, you know, the old, the old concept of, you know, the village and the children and, you know, it's everybody, every kid is a member of the village family.  It was exactly that way.  I mean every--when we walked outside, everybody knew who we were.  There was very little that we could get away with that my parents weren't appraised about because everybody knew who we were and we knew everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As long as I can remember.
Story_ID: 191841
Speaker 1: What position did your father [John Oliver, Sr.] hold at the Afro [Afro-American Company, later Afro-American Newspapers]?
Speaker 2: He was the mechanical department superintendent when I was a kid.  And then he became a vice president when I--
Speaker 1: Now mechanical department superintendent would mean that he--
Speaker 2: Head of production.
Speaker 1: --actually, you know, 'cause they were printing the paper on site, yeah.
Speaker 2: That was hot type so he was in charge of the production, the linotype machines, the flowing of the type, the printing press--that was all him.  And it was a tough job but he loved it and he was very much involved in always figuring out ways to improve that process.  He was very much involved in the early stages of, of the movement or the evolution from hot type to offset cold type printing, teletype, eliminating the hot type, type flowing processes.  And then eventually, introduction of, of the uses of computerization in various early segments of the process.  It was interesting because I remember when he was taking computer classes in the middle '60s [1960s], he was very much involved in learning about the computers and excited about how the programming and the computer process was going to sort of abbreviate certain segments of the teletype process.  And then, when he came back, one of his visits in the early '90s [1990s], he walked through the office, this new location, this new building that we reside in currently, he had no idea about any means by which the paper was being produced.  The computerization had completely taken over everything that he had basically known as being how to produce a newspaper.  And he was lost conceptually in trying to understand how a Macintosh can do all the things that it normally would take in his day roughly five to ten people to do 'cause the production department in 19-, let's say the, the middle '80s [1980s], consisted of roughly seventeen people in the height of--let's say, my dad's age.  And probably between '55 [1955] and maybe '75 [1975], you probably have as many as maybe twenty-five, thirty people involved in the production process.  Now we do everything that he did with five people.
Story_ID: 191842
Speaker 1: Can you give us a sense of what it was like growing up--now you grew up here in Baltimore [Maryland] and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question 'cause I often think about how it has changed and it's also a function of, of growing old.  The older you get, the more you sort of cherish some of the old things that you know don't exist anymore.  As a kid, my mother [Marye Thompson Oliver] taught at the same school that my sister [Marilyn Thompson-Pickett] and I attended. Like any--
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was the name of that--I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: The name of the school was William Alexander Elementary School [P.S. 112, Baltimore, Maryland] and it was located on Calhoun [Street] and Lawrence Street in Baltimore.  It was about an eight-block walk from our house and like any family, the mornings were very dramatic--hard for kids to wake up on time every day.  The excitement of running to classroom wasn't always as consistent as my mother would have liked it to been.  And since she was a teacher, she had to be there a little bit earlier.  So she had to fight twice as hard to get us out a little bit earlier than most of the other students.  Sometimes I would be late and my mother would leave me, and I would have to walk to school as punishment.
Speaker 1: How far was that?
Speaker 2: Eight blocks, and it was a direct line.  I would go down a half a block to Lawrence Street and walk across Lawrence Street going across McCulloh [Street] through a hill, Pennsylvania Avenue, the famous Pennsylvania Avenue, and two or three other streets on the other side.  During those days, once you crossed Pennsylvania Avenue, the last four blocks between Pennsylvania Avenue and the elementary school, [P.S.] 112, was on both sides populated by nothing but bars.  And picture, you know, an eight, nine, ten-year old kid walking to school Monday morning, or maybe better yet, a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday morning, and there was always the same smell, always the same pictures.  Alcoholism just simply ravaged the neighborhood.  I mean, you could smell it all over the place.  You can see the devastation that it was more or less impacting on the humanity, the waste.  It was, it was very, it was a sad last four blocks.  And then a half a block before the school, it sort of stopped.  And there was a bakery right across the, the street from the school called Schmidt's Bakery [Schmidt Baking Company, Baltimore, Maryland], and suddenly the smell changed and you've got the smell of fresh bread in the morning.  And it sort of made you quickly forget all the devastation you had to go through.  And it was at that point, you were focused on your school.
Story_ID: 191843
Speaker 1: School, you're going, you were talking about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Baltimore, Maryland] and all those bars on the way to school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then at, at school.  Then you could focus on school again.  The name of your school was William Alexander School, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, William Alexander Elementary School [P.S. 112, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Was that named after a famous black person in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: It was, and I feel embarrassed that I don't remember who exactly it is, but it was--no, I should know but I don't.  It--but it was one of the early major black elementary schools.  And practically everyone that I knew went to either that school or one of three others and, you know, because that was in segregated Baltimore before 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it, it and that's a good thing because everybody knew each other then.  I don't believe that's the case now.
Speaker 1: Well, how--did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I enjoyed the teachers.  In elementary school, I enjoyed the teachers.  I had great teachers.  They were caring.  They were energetic.  They were--most of them knew my mother [Marye Thompson Oliver].  Most, most of them really did not tolerate any foolishness.  If I acted up, I'd be sent to my mother's class and she'd take care of me.
Speaker 1: Did you act up a lot?
Speaker 2: I'd try not to but at times, you know, as a kid, it's difficult (laughter).  You just gotta stretch out once in a while.  I mean, particularly, when there's girls around (laughter).  And, you know, it was always exciting, you know.  Elementary school was nice.  Junior high school was a different experience.  But just before I started junior high school in the seventh grade, I, I went to a brand--a, a different environment because after Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], my mother wanted me to get experience of a more diverse environment.  So she took me out of the cocoon of William Alexander Elementary School where she was sort of watching.  And I think she really wanted more or less me to begin to evolve without being within the protectiveness of her particular environment.  And I got sent to one of the first integrated schools in Baltimore City and it was--
Speaker 1: What was that name?
Speaker 2: It was [P.S.] 61 [John Eager Howard Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].  It was, matter of fact, it was right around the corner from the house.  It was not more than four blocks away from the house.  And I transferred there in the sixth grade.  I was not happy.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: John Eager Howard.
Speaker 1: John--
Speaker 2: Eager Howard School.
Speaker 1: Eager?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's the Revolutionary War general or something, but I was not happy doing that.  I had no idea what I was in for.  I was just overwhelmed with insecurity.  After watching all the violence that was on TV when you would see certain schools being integrated, I just didn't know what it was gonna be like.  Both my sister [Marilyn Thompson-Pickett] and I were more or less carted up the street to that school.  My sister went to her class; I went to my class.  I was in the sixth grade.  It was--the first couple of days, I think, it was fairly difficult.  Because it was a--there was only about one or two other black kids in that class.  And it was like the rest of the white kids were from the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 191844
Speaker 1: I lived on Madison Avenue [Baltimore, Maryland].  I would go one block east, and there would be a complete change in the neighborhood because there was a square called Eutaw Place Square [Baltimore, Maryland].  On the other side of that square were white folks, and they were all hillbillies from the hills of whatever.  And it was a stark sort of change.  Now, it isn't that I never saw them before because I'd always go up to--you'd have to walk through that area to get to the stores that were really near, in the middle of that particular segment of, of, of Baltimore [Maryland].  And so, you know, but you were always walking through, but you'd never spend any time there.  Some of my early exposures was not good because you'd go to the black neighborhoods, there was always drunks.  You'd go to the white neighborhoods, there was violence.  I had never seen people beat each other up that way.  And, you know, when you were going to let's say, the five and ten cents store to get something, and you walk across the street, and there were be two white guys fighting and drunk over something.  And blood was everywhere, and you're just nine or ten years old and you're just looking at this, and you just can't believe that this is happening.  You don't understand how people can be that violent.  So, when we were--
Speaker 2: These are white adults that are fighting?
Speaker 1: White adults fighting each other.  And it was, you know, on Friday nights, it was ugly, not every Friday night.  But, you know, you only have to see it two or three times.  The first time, it is a shock.   You know, I think the first time, my mother [Marye Thompson Oliver] grabbed me.  We ran across the--we, we left the sidewalk.  We ran in the middle of the street and went around, you know, because the fight was just--and it, it was shocking because I'm looking at it, you know--oh, my eyes are wide open.  And I'm seeing blood coming everywhere and I'm just--how could people do this?
Speaker 2: And other, other adults are standing around watching this or what are they--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's nothing big.  So, going to school [John Eager Howard Elementary School, P.S. 61, Baltimore, Maryland], I didn't know.  Am I going to do that?  I, I just don't know.  I, I mean, I'm sort of shocked and sort of reserved, but it wasn't anywhere, anything like I feared.  And I really developed very good, close relationships, really loved the folks, you know.  I mean, they were, they were (laughter)--I used to (unclear) closest friends were, were there, you know.  I mean and I had more difficulty, I guess, with some of the black guys than I did with any of the white guys.  I, I can't remember ever being called a name and that was, I guess, as I look now back at that rather shocking.
Story_ID: 191845
Speaker 1: When I graduated from sixth grade [at John Eager Howard Elementary School, P.S. 61, Baltimore, Maryland], I went directly to a junior high school called Garrison Junior High School [later, Garrison Middle School] in Baltimore [Maryland].  And that was, again, a different era, I mean, a different, different segment of Baltimore.  I went from a middle class black section to a poor white section for the sixth grade, and then from a poor white section for the sixth grade to Garrison Junior High School which was probably about five miles.  It took an hour to get there by bus, and it was in the middle of the Jewish section of Baltimore.  It's what we call the New World (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, now was it named for William Lloyd Garrison or--
Speaker 1: I have no idea.  I, we just knew it was Garrison and it was like most of it was Jewish, white.  They were--it was totally different from anything I've seen.  And so once again, I'm getting exposed to a different culture, a different diversity.  There was no violence--none.  Everything was academic.  Everything was very focused on organizing yourself for absorbing these new courses like geometry and, and the new advances in, advanced courses in science and everything.  It was puberty.  It was an experience.  I mean I had a ball.  I mean I really was not probably the best student because I was, on one hand, beginning to discover girls even more, and just beginning to enjoy all these new friends that I had never met who were all different types of people.
Speaker 2: Was there a racial challenge in, in the, in terms of dating and so forth?  This was mostly a white school, right?
Speaker 1: I never thought about dating any, anyone other than--I never--the thought never occurred to me.  I mean, it's just, I mean, there were white girls sitting in front of me, and white girls sitting in back.  But I was--the sisters were awesome.  So I, I really never gave it a thought.
Speaker 2: And there were some at the school?
Speaker 1: Oh, there was lots and lots of them.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I mean, we were--
Speaker 2: So this is a school that's got a more diverse population.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was--it's diverse population and the girls were beautiful and friendly.  And everybody just got along, you know.  I mean it--we played, we spent all day long playing baseball or, or there was a baseball game using a pink, a little pink ball that everybody used to hit with their fists.  And, you know, you'd throw it up and you'd hit it, and you--if no one caught it, then you'd go around the bases.  Or you played touch football.  And then also the excitement of this was also that for the first time, I began to become really exposed because of now being in junior high school, you are now being mixed with other guys from different segments of the city.  So I mean, I'm getting, I'm meeting guys from Poplar Grove [Baltimore, Maryland].  I'm meeting guys from Walbrook [Baltimore, Maryland].  I'm--I mean, and, and so, for the first time, you're looking at all these brothers and you don't think of them as brothers.  You see all the guys who were black, you know, you begin to check each other out.  And you realize that, you know, the neighborhoods do begin to make--mean something.  It's not exactly gangs but the guys who knew each other were--knew each other because they were all in the same neighborhood.  And if you didn't know someone, it's primarily because they were of a different neighborhood.  And until you got to know them, there was always that, you know, that you're sort of checking them out, you know, finding out, well, is he any good at football or is he any good at playing the baseball, or what can he do?  You know, and, and, but after you get through the seventh grade, you begin to gel.  And you're sort of the--the hesitation begins to disappear.  And for the first time, you really are enjoying getting to know people who are not around you, you know, who don't come from the same neighborhood who--and then you begin to learn more about other segments of, of Baltimore because you may go out on Friday night to a party over in Poplar Grove or--and the excitement of walking to a party in, in a different segment of Baltimore looking up and seeing someone who you know--that was electric.  And so, it was a lot of fun--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 191846
Speaker 1: When'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school in--started high school in 1960.  I went to Baltimore City College [Baltimore, Maryland] which is a public school focused on college preparatory--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was indeed a, a, that was a different, that was an even further broadening because whereas Garrison [Junior High School, later, Garrison Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland], you more or less became aware of guys and girls who were from different neighborhoods.  But all those neighborhoods were on west side Baltimore [Maryland].  When you went to City, it was all-male and you basically, for the first time, began to become exposed to the east side group.  In addition to the west siders, but I mean, everybody in high school who could get into City College, these--there's a lot of them who came from the east side and the west side.  Now, up to that point, there is a, a real distinct line.  You did not go east when you were in that, at that age because it was like Hatfields and McCoys.  You knew no one.  They know, they didn't know you and, invariably, you were gonna end up in a fight somewhere.  And you would have to probably end up being chased home or running home invariably, but all that was part of the excitement.  But City College suddenly threw you into an environment that forced you to meet the east siders.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the west siders always looked down their noses at the east siders.  But once you sort of got to know them, just like the experience in the seventh grade--not bad.  And you'd begin to forge even additional relationships with the guys who, you know, sort of began to knit, you know.  Can you swim?  Can you play lacrosse?  Can you play football?  Is he smart?  You know, where are the things that sort of begin to identify those people who you begin to associate, associate yourself with for various reasons, you know?  And at that time, I began to expand the sports that I played.  I never really played any organized sports in elementary or junior high school, but in senior high school, I swam--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I played lacrosse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In, in '60 [1960], '61 [1961], there weren't many brothers playing lacrosse which was kind of interesting.  It was a new game.   My mother [Marye Thompson Oliver] wouldn't let me play football, my mother and father [John Oliver, Sr.] would not let me play football.  So I sort of cheated by playing lacrosse until my mother went to a first game and realized what that was.  And then that, together with some serious knocking, I--that ended (laughter).  I guess my lacrosse career really ended when I was--I was on a freshman-sophomore team and I was attack.  That was my position and, you know, you got to be fast.  You're running, you know, back and forth across.  And one of the defensemen, a white guy, who is now Congressman Dutch Schutzberger [sic. Congressman C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger], he was on my, he was on, he was the defenseman on the other, other team.  And I was, I was dead in for a, a goal.  I mean, I was moving fast.  He jumped out of nowhere and blocked me, and I have never been hit that hard in my whole life.  I mean he knocked me twenty yards, and then to turn around and look, and there was a white dude who did it.  That even made it worse, but I knew that if they're gonna be hitting this hard, this is something that I probably have no business being involved in.  To this day, Dutch and I have a good laugh about how he ended my lacrosse career.  But that and swimming really were the only two sports that I participated in, but I continued to do swimming the entire time that I was at City.

Speaker 1: How were your grades in school and did you get good grades?
Speaker 2: My grades at [Baltimore] City [College, Baltimore, Maryland] were okay, you know.  I was probably a B- or C+, you know, I really didn't try very hard.  I mean it was like--you're doing swimming from four until seven o'clock.  By the time you get out of the pool after doing all the laps that they required you to do, and the City College pool was the, the largest pool next to the [United States] Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland] pool on the East Coast.  So it was so big, it was like it had tides, and the chlorine was so intense that from October through April, you're really fighting just trying to see.  You get out at night, a winter night in November, it's generally cold.  You're on top of the hill 'cause the City College is like a castle, and it's located on a very high point in Baltimore [Maryland].  The winds are whipping.  I have a cane because I can't see, and that's the only way I can get down the hill because the chlorine is eating your eyes up.  And you're catching a bus, and probably isn't until about 7:30, 8:00 that you get home and you try and sneak in a little time to read, but it's very difficult to read through all the--but you make it anyway.  And the teachers, they compensate for that.  They know that you, as a sports person, you are trying to balance time, and so to give you a little bit extra time to, you know, they spend a little extra time with you.  I enjoyed some of the classes.  Some of the classes, I did not enjoy.  I never did (unclear)--
Speaker 1: What were your favorite classes?
Speaker 2: I had a good time in--I liked German, don't know why.  I, I just enjoyed it, you know.  I, maybe I think it was because of the teacher.  To a certain extent, I liked physics, I don't know why.  I probably had no business liking physics.  I had no business trying to learn geometry because I just--maybe it was my approach, but it was just boring.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And it was--math really was never, at that time, a very good--history was something I just never spent any time in.  It was just natural.  I mean, I was into why things happened and understanding and remembering the underpinnings of various periods of time.
Story_ID: 191848
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that really stood out [at Baltimore City College, Baltimore, Maryland] who were, who you really admired or took an interest in you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were--well, there was, there was a black homeroom teacher who was a linguistic teacher.  He never taught me Spanish, but because I was homeroom, he took a special interest in everyone in his class.  It doesn't matter whether he was colored, whether he was black, colored, or white, black or white, but everyone in that homeroom class, he took special interest in.  So, you know, I mean if he knew that you weren't really pushing it, he'd be calling your moms.  And, you know, I mean he just did some extra special stuff that I think sort of short circuited some of the, you know, distractive maneuvers that I may have been entertaining, you know, so as to get me back on track.  And I appreciate that, you know.  But [Baltimore] City College was okay.  It was, it was fun.  It was the Cuban [Missile] Crisis.  It was the, you know, it was all-boys, but it was, at the same time, you had an all-girls school right next door.  So, it was--
Speaker 1: So you didn't suffer really bad (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't, we didn't.  I mean, I remember Michael Olesker, who is a columnist for the daily newspaper [Baltimore Sun] here, he was in--he was always seated in front of me throughout my entire--he was at Garrison [Junior High School, later, Garrison Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland] also.  So I mean it was just Olesker, [HistoryMaker John Jacob "Jake"] Oliver, so he was in front of me in my homerooms in Garrison.  He was in front of me in my homerooms in City College.  So I know every hair on the back of that man's head, you know 'cause I smacked it enough when he'd get on my nerves.  But we really became good buddies.  And I remember the day of the Cuban Crisis.  And we were all called back to homeroom because we weren't sure whether or not [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was gonna really pull the plug.  And we didn't know what exercises, I mean, if you're gonna duck and cover, or were we going to get sent home.  So we're sitting there trying to figure out--well, when it starts, what it's gonna be like, and what am I going to do?  And I remember reading a column that Michael wrote couple of years ago where he came up with a plan.  And his plan, I remember the plan as I read the article where if the bomb happened to be pulled, his theory was that we were gonna go over to Eastern High School [Baltimore, Maryland] and because you might as well die where the girls are, instead of being over there where the guys are.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, so we had a route where we were gonna begin to, you know.  As soon as the lights begin to get bright, everybody was gonna cut out the homeroom, and just make it over there and find out where the chicks were, and grab some lady that they'd been looking at and just say, if this is gonna be the end of it, I might as well be with you.  And thinking about it, it was not a bad idea (laughter).  But City was nice.  It was an exposure of an even more diverse culture and I made some very long lasting friendships.
Story_ID: 191849
Speaker 1: You came out of [Baltimore] City College in was it '62 [1962] or--
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960], '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], okay.
Speaker 2: June '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: So that was your senior year when [Cuban Missile Crisis]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was the year of the March on Washington, too.  Did you, did you pay attention to that or--and the--
Speaker 2: I did a little, you know.  In the early age, in the, in the '50s [1950s] and to a lesser extent, in the '60s [1960s], I really didn't think too much about "civil rights."
Speaker 1: Even with all the activity around the paper [Afro-American] and your, your relatives (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not at all.  I could not understand why daddy [John Oliver, Sr.] always thought in terms of wanting to inject color into every conversation.  I really resented that, you know. I--you know, when I was in the fourth grade, third grade, daddy would always wonder--well, where are the black people, where are the Africa, where are the colored people?  How come colored people can't do this?  I never thought about it.  I never cared 'cause all my friends were colored.  I didn't really miss anything until I really began to become exposed to the more--the greater diversity that I began to become exposed to in '56 [1956] and thereafter.  I guess the turning point, like probably, practically every other black male, a seed was planted in 1953 or '54 [1954] [sic. 1955] when I opened up the Afro [Afro-American] and saw the front page of what was done to Emmett Till.  And then my mother [Marye Thompson Oliver] spent a lot of nights whispering in my ear, "You mess with white women, this is what's gonna happen to you."  And I think that began to change a lot about my expectations, my desire.  I could never understand how anyone could do anything so violent to anyone else.  I mean, I couldn't--when they ran that picture in the front page of the Afro, you didn't know what it was.  It was so disfigured.
Speaker 1: It was the body of Emmett Till, and then soaked in the river for--
Speaker 2: It soaked in the river.  It was only the tors- the upper part of the torso, the head down to the mid-stomach.  And then the legs and everything were washed up, other places.  But they shot that picture and they ran it on the front page.  And I think that did more to change the generation thought, from my generation at least, about white folks and white women.  It just--quite frankly, and my mother worked on me.  I mean--
Speaker 1: It's funny.  It's a generational gap there somewhere between the pictures that would appear in the Afro-American and, and the [Chicago] Defender in the 1930s and even in the early '40s [1940s], '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] of lynchings in the South.  Some of the, especially I know the Defender carried the most--some of the most lurid photographs of lynchings.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: And, you know, it was laying around in people's homes all the time.  The--this is an omnipresent threat--
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Back in the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But by the time I came through, I'd, you know, '45 [1945] to '55 [1955], that ten-year period, there wasn't very much until you got to the Emmett Till case.  And then the Afro ran that picture on the front page.  Chicago Defender ran it on the front page and then it appeared in Jet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then I don't know of any black man during that ten-year period who was not impacted by that, those pictures.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it was--
Speaker 1: And the children that were impacted by it, I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: My generation was really traumatized by it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I tell you, it, it, it sort of--so, answer to your question no, wasn't interested in white chicks.  I was not, you know, and, and, believe me, every black mother was working on her son because I think they were just as trauma- the, the women were just as traumatized as, as the kids were.  And particularly, the mothers thinking about their sons, and just saying, don't even think about it.  And so it, I--it's different today, obviously.  But the point is, is that, that is a scar and it became even deeper when these guys got off.  And that showed us that there is no justice, or at least there was no justice as we saw it at that time, you know.  And I think that motivated a lot of the determination that began to grow in me shortly thereafter.  But as I grew older and into the '60s [1960s], that really, you know, I, I--where at one point, I really didn't think about the color.  But as I grew older, post-Emmett Till, I was focused on the injustice of what was going on based upon people's colors.  And with the advent in my last two years of high school with the Freedom Riders, and then the Afro would run these front page pictures of the freedom buses being burnt down, you began to get a sense of the fact that not only is there extreme violence, but it is held by a lot of folks out there against you simply because of your color.

Speaker 1: So when I graduated from high school [Baltimore City College, Baltimore, Maryland] and when I went to University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], I was to a certain extent substantially intimidated, even before I got there because I knew that out of fifteen thousand students, there was only about a hundred blacks on one of the biggest campuses, if not the biggest campus in the state.  And I wasn't sure--I didn't think that the dream of a college life was going to be something that I would get.
Story_ID: 191851
Speaker 1: So, high school [Baltimore City College, Baltimore, Maryland] graduation 19--
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Three [1963].  And you, you go to University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] this--
Speaker 2: University of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was probably the first time that I'd really been exposed to active racism, first time that I'd ever really been called a nigger by someone standing in front of me.  And--
Speaker 1: What were the circumstances for that?
Speaker 2: It was my second night in the dorm.  And, of course, I had two roommates.  They were both, of course, black.  We were just, you know, unpacking stuff--walked into the bathroom, and there was a guy who was--I guess they called him an up back.  He was on the football team.  His name was Bob Burton.  And he just walked in, slammed the door open.  He was a big guy and just said, "Oh, the niggers are here," and it--as if somebody had fired a gun point blank at me.  I just, you know, you read about this, but this guy has never seen me.  He doesn't know me or do--know anything about me--just the niggers are here.  And I'm just--I think it just froze me.  I just--either, I mean, this guy was so big and he, he was.  And the other, my other two roommates, we just looked at each other and went back into the room and closed the door, and sort of really began to get a sense that welcome to University of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Did you sort of--did you think about, you know, watching each other's back at the--I mean, was that part, part of the discussion that you all had?
Speaker 2: I don't think that we felt--
Speaker 1: Threatened really?
Speaker 2: --threatened.  It was just that we really had a clear sense that we were not welcome.  And that was in, that was in September of '63 [1963].  And on November the 22nd--my sister [Marilyn Thompson-Pickett] was also at University of Maryland.  She was all way across the campus.  We were in one class together on that day.  And that was the day that [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy got shot.  And the first thing that came to both of our minds when it was broadcast across campus through the intercom systems and everything, was that I don't know if we can get back to the dorm safely because the first thing that came to my mind is they gonna think some black person did this.  And I had to quickly get her up to her dorm and made sure that she was safe.  Then I had to walk, somehow winded my way back across the campus, hiding behind bushes and stuff till I got back to the dorm, locked the door.  But it was clear that there was talk about niggers probably did it, and until a day or so later when I guess it became clear that it was this white guy who did it.  It just was uncomfortable.
Speaker 1: Now you know, I think that same day, or the day after, was the day that Malcolm X made his statement about the chickens coming home to roost, which frightened the Nation of Islam even.  You know, so much that they censored him, you know, and disavow, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now, the Nation of Islam is one place that you could go and you could hear a lot of black talk.
Speaker 2: Exactly but--
Speaker 1: They said the white man was a devil.
Speaker 2: --they backed up.
Speaker 1: But they backed up on that one, didn't they?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause they didn't want them because they would have been deported and God knows else, what else, you know, so you're right.  I mean, America's sensitivities were reflective of their very visible racism.  And, you know, so, you know, everybody was just looking around at us and we just said, oops, time to disappear.  I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 191852
Speaker 1: I never really liked University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] because of the just--fact that University of Maryland really clearly didn't like us.
Speaker 2: Did--
Speaker 1: It's interesting how times change because I am now the chairman of the [Maryland] Commission of Higher Education.  And my commission oversees the approval of the budgets and the curricula of all higher education institutions of the state.  University of Maryland [University System of Maryland] is just simply one of 'em.  It's one of my colleges or one of my universities.
Story_ID: 191853
Speaker 1: Any professor or administrator, anybody on campus that you connected with?
Speaker 2: No, none.  I did, I really did not do well at University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].  I mean, I, it was one of these things where your parents just forced you to do it.  They wanted you to get a good education.  They wanted you to be out of town and, but I was miserable.  And my sister [Marilyn Thompson-Pickett] did okay, she graduated.  But I just wasted their money, you know--I mean I just I really didn't get my feet on the ground until I left University of Maryland and really got down to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--how long were you at the University of Maryland?
Speaker 2: Till '65 [1965].  And then I spent, I think, about six months at home.  And then in '66 [1966], I started--well, in Sep- it may have been, yeah, it was until, it was until December '65 [1965], and then in the winter of '60 [1960]--in January '66 [1966], I didn't go back.  And then in September of '66 [1966], I went to Fisk--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --so I took six months off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Fisk, now that, yeah, that's Fisk University in the early '60s [1960s] I know was really jumping.  I don't know what was going on.  I'm not quite sure what was going on after '65 [1965], but it was--that's where the sit-ins were going on, and there's a lot of campus activism, radical politics.
Speaker 2: The activism on campus was--it was like it, it had subsided.  It didn't pop up until '68 [1968] and then by that point, I was hooked up, connected, and in the middle of it.  I was the publisher of the newspaper [Fisk Forum] by then.  But I--the moment I walked on, to Fisk campus, it was like--first of all, I did not want to go.  I was seriously considering volunteering to go to Vietnam [War].  I was--I, I--there was no way that you're gonna get me to go to the South.  I've already been at the University of Maryland.  They were gonna ship me to Nashville, Tennessee.  I knew that I was going to either get shot or lynched before I got out of the airport, 'cause I knew my attitude was not gonna be acceptable to these folks.  And my image of southern blacks wasn't too good either.  I was very angry.  They put a foot locker, they gave me a foot locker--said you go to Fisk.  If you don't like it, you can go over to whatever [U.S.] Army place you want.  You can sign up, but you are going to Fisk and at least, we're going to send you Fisk.  It's up to you.  I got to Nashville, put the foot locker in a cab.  They drove me up to Fisk campus.  I saw--first thing I saw was some old rickety buildings.  And they drove me up to a new men's dorm.  And I told the cop--I, I told the cab driver, I'm not going to go here.  So, look, I'm just going--keep the motor running.  I'm going to go in here to this dorm, and I'm going to make a phone call to, to my mom [Marye Thompson Oliver] and dad [John Oliver, Sr.] just to let 'em know that there's no way I'm, I can do this.  And I walked up the first flight of steps heading towards the main door.  And the first Fisk woman that I'd ever seen walked down there and everything changed.  I had never seen anything like it.  I just looked at her.
Speaker 1: Something about youth, isn't it?
Speaker 2: I tell you--I had never seen anything so gorgeous.  Her name was Margo McKay and I just--my mouth just dropped and I said, I'm staying.  Told the cab, bring the foot locker.  If this is the first indication of what it's gonna be like, I think I will--I'll deal with it.
Story_ID: 191854
Speaker 1: And it was at that point, probably one of the happiest periods in my life because of--I really, for the first time, felt comfortable, secure [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  My feet was on the ground.  I became a serious student, a real serious student.  I really wasn't wasting my time trying to become socially comfortable because I was.  And I began to see that beyond social necessities, the interest of being in such a historically significant place in a segment of America that was historically significant for black folks because of the Civil War and, and everything like that.  It was the home of Arna Bontemps, many people who were important in the Harlem Renaissance even.  I just went crazy.  I mean, I did studying all the time.  I pledged [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] my first--the second month there, I pledged, you know, 'cause we made arrangements.  Normally, you'd have to be there a year, but I had some church strings pulled with some of my buddies from Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and I pledged six weeks.  It was tough.  It was like, it was hell.  But after I pledged, I really became very comfortable.  I, I really didn't party that much anymore.  I, I just spent my time in the history library as, as a student assistant to one of the professors doing research.  At that time, I was analyzing Loving v. Virginia [1967], which was the series of cases that evolved around miscegenation, and which eventually resulted in the [U.S.] Supreme Court saying that these statutes are, are illegal.  But I, I mean, it was just so much going on there.  And my grades reflected that.  And then in the fall--I mean, in that spring, I, I sort of inherited the, the newspaper--the Fisk Forum.  And I spent that summer in Nashville [Tennessee].  And when I started in August of '67 [1967], that was probably my most radical period because I--the first time I had been given a brand new newspaper to manage.  I knew nothing about it.  They had this thing called a budget that I viewed only as an impediment, but I knew that I wanted to ignite a concept that I was so swept up about, called black power.  And I began to, to listen a lot to Stokely [Carmichael, later, Kwame Ture].  I really loved what he was saying.
Speaker 2: Did he come to the campus?
Speaker 1: He came to the campus.  And when Stokely came to the campus, that same weekend, Eldridge [Cleaver] was over at Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I came out with a front page graphic on the Fisk Forum that said, "The only light left in the world is blackness."  And it was reversed with a light house that showed blackness coming down to the reader.  It was powerful.  It got everybody's attention--
Story_ID: 191855
Speaker 1: Stokely [Carmichael, later, Kwame Ture] came up to the campus [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and that is when the riots in Nashville [Tennessee] started.  And we got nasty.  I mean, it was--
Speaker 2: Now, what started the riots?  How did they start?
Speaker 1: The specific event, I do not know.  I know that I was coming back with my girlfriend at that time--well, she was my girlfriend the entire time.
Speaker 2: This is, yeah, this is a set of riots, I guess, that--I know there were riots, summer of '66 [1966] in Watts [Los Angeles, California]--or '65 [1965], summer of '65 [1965] in Watts--
Speaker 1: Yeah, before--
Speaker 2: Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: And then you had the '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Then it's gonna be, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you had '68 [1968] following [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But the '67 [1967] stuff was, by and large, it was Cleave [Eldridge Cleaver] and Stokely hooking up.  Bobby Seale was down there somewhere as--and everybody was just ready because we hooked up with some of the brothers over at--there weren't a whole lot over at, at, Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And then--I mean, the thing got powerful when we hooked up with the A&I [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, later, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] group.  I mean, Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], they had the soulful brothers down there.  I mean, it was a huge group of brothers down there.  And it was like, when everybody just sort of convened, I guess the thing that sparked it was one of the doggone redneck cops did something on campus that the folks just said, this is enough.  And I was coming back from a party, and only thing I realized is that in the middle of the quadrangle, there were a whole bunch of cops beating up a whole lot of students with night, nightstand--nightsticks.  And my girlfriend runs in the middle of this and starts kicking a cop.  And he, he lifts up this billy club to get ready to hit her, and I jump on him, and there we are on CBS that night.  And my father [John Oliver, Sr.] is about to have a heart attack, saying I'm not sending him down to Fisk [University] to be on CBS--beat, get into a fight with a, a southern cop who's got a gun and a nightstick.  It really got crazy because everybody got sort of like locked into the dorms--not locked into the dorms, but the cops, you know, we fought the cops, threw bottles and everything.  And then the cops sort of blocked the entire campus off.  And then I remember at one point, the cops wanted to come into the dorms, and then some of the brothers broke out with their guns and their rifles, and then there was shooting from the roof.  It was like the wild, Wild West.  And I'm sitting there writing about it.  And we created a network of reporting.  It was almost like the drum of campus newspapers because all the other campuses were eager to get news of what was happening at Fisk, what was happening in Atlanta [Georgia], what was happening up at Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], what was--and I mean we connected.  I mean, we were on the phone.  We were doing things, trading stories.  I was having a ball.  And it was my first experience really with, with not only getting involved in, in representing news events.  But it was also the first time that I had the responsibility of managing a news enterprise.
Story_ID: 191856
Speaker 1: School [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] started in September.  I had spent the budget [of the Fisk Forum] by the middle part of October 'cause I put colored pages on the front.  I just didn't care, but the impact that I made on those first four to five weeks, even though I spent my budget, President [James Raymond] Lawson said, "Look, you've made such an impact.  We will replenish your budget.  Just be a little bit more responsible, but don't stop what you're doing."  And we started to really pump the students in connection with what really was going on, not only in Nashville [Tennessee], but also giving a picture of what was going on up and down the East Coast, and other places with the other schools, the African American schools [Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs] that were doing similar things.  It was a good time, a very good time.  Believe it or not, the grades were almost perfect.  I mean, I, I think it was one semester I came up with a 4.0 and it was like--I just, you know, you were always writing.  And the interesting thing about that also was I'm printing a newspaper once a week, and it's not in Nashville though.  I would have to go to Gathers- no, not Gaithersburg [ph.].
Speaker 2: To Gallatin [Tennessee] or--
Speaker 1: Gal- no, not Gallatin.  It's, it's southwest.  Where's Jack Daniels [Distillery, Lynchburg, Tennessee]?  It's, it's not Lynchburg, but it's near Lynchburg, Tennessee, in Lynchburg?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: No, Gatlinburg [Tennessee] is in the, is in, is in the east.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the east, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's in the mountains.  This is southwest of Nashville and Murfreesboro [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Murfreesboro.
Speaker 1: Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  I would have to drive there and, mind you, I'm driving there with a Triumph GT6 Spitfire, and my father pay [John Oliver, Sr.]--I mean, it's six cylinder.  It's fast as hell.  And I've got a big sticker on this sports car that says, "If you liked [Adolf] Hitler, you'll love [George] Wallace."  And I'm, you know, and I'm zipping down Murfree- towards Murfreesboro at night, staying over in Murfreesboro until two or three o'clock in the morning, and zipping back.  And these ole boys in these Hemis, these Dodge Hemis, would see this thing 'cause Wallace was big in Tennessee.  Man, they start chasing me, but that six cylinder would kick in and they would be so far left behind, I had a ball.  I literally had a ball.  It was dangerous but the point was--
Speaker 2: Which is, I, I must ask this question though.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: This is just a technical--the, the Triumphs were notorious for breaking down (laughter).  So did you, you never had--
Speaker 1: The Triumph GT6 Spitfire, I didn't have any problem with that.  My biggest problem, 'cause after that, I always had a sports car.  The second one was an MGB, an MGB.  That was the worst sports car I've ever had.  That would break down every place.  But the Triumph GT6, man, that was a sweet car.  I mean that, that was real fast.  That six cylinder would pop in, and there were very few cars that could catch me.  And, you know, I would be sassy.  You know, I mean, I would have that, that sticker on the back.  And then, also I remember I had this big poster in, in the Fisk Forum main office, and it was a (laughter), it was a picture of a Black Panther, a woman, a black woman with a big Afro, and she was pregnant.  And right across her belly said, "[President Richard Milhous] Nixon did it" (laughter).  We were irreverent.  We were having fun, but I, I think it really taught me a lot, you know, because mixed with the danger and the excitement, and all the cops and everything else, we were still about trying to accomplish a purpose, which was to get credible news and articles out to people, who we really felt had an extreme thirst to get that news.  And it was, intoxicating to see these people respond the way they did.  That was my, I guess, my major first time that really even thinking about becoming involved with journalism.
Story_ID: 191857
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers and advisors at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in those days?
Speaker 2: The best, the one that becomes, the one that influenced practically all the guys who, all the students who really went to postgraduate was Theodore Currier, Dr. Currier.  He was an old white historian who was an exquisite teacher, and he was also the man who taught, who indeed cultivated [HistoryMaker] Dr. John Hope Franklin.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: Okay.  His name was, the most outstanding teacher was Dr. Theodore, Theodore Currier.  He was a white professor of American history.  He was an exquisite teacher.  He was a passionate teacher.  He was probably responsible for sending more black students to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Columbia [University, New York, New York], and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] than probably anyone else.  He was also the one who ignited, taught John Hope Franklin.  I think if John Hope Franklin were to look back, probably Currier was probably the most impactful professor on him as well as the rest of the students.  Currier was just an amazing man.  I mean, he would, he would give us these, these Antebellum South lectures that were just literally riveting, not because of fixating on the events, but he would examine the rationale underneath of it, so that you could really get a sense of why possibly these things happened, and why, what precipitated afterwards was what probably should have been expected.  He ignited more students than any one professor that I know, and he was a jovial, lovable old man, and he was everybody's favorite.
Speaker 1: So, on campus, you had, you had him and you had--what's--
Speaker 2: I had Dr. [James Raymond] Jimmy Lawson who was the president of Fisk.  He was a, just a tremendous supporter of me and what I was trying to do with the newspaper [Fisk Forum].  You had--
Speaker 1: Now, he's different from James Lawson, the activist, reverend, isn't he?
Speaker 2: Yes, he is.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. Lawson is now in, and at--he, he resides in [Washington] D.C.  He had been--I think, after he left Fisk, he became involved in several branches of the government, but he's still very much well respected.  [HistoryMaker] Dr. [David] Driskell was at Fisk, and he was very much impactful in opening up sort of excitement about art, cultural art, respect for it.  There were so many exciting people at Fisk.  I mean, I had the teachers were just all--I, I can't think of--I don't think I ever had any bad teachers there.  I mean, and, and it was because everybody was so comfortable.  Everyone was, everyone was just, everybody was equal in every--
Speaker 1: Was Gerald McWhorter [Abdul Alkalimat] at Fisk in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, Gerald McWhorter was at Fisk.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was one of the--ones who ignited a lot of thought, a lot of excitement, black power.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's continued to--under the name of Abdul Alkalimat and--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --yeah, he changed his name and he, you know, I mean he uses both names, I think, but he's--
Speaker 2: I remember, I think I remember him vaguely--he had a motorcycle and he'd be zipping up and down.  Then there was Von Winbush, Raymond Von Winbush, I believe.  And then there was--Arna Bontemps was still around.  And then, gosh, Fisk was it.
Story_ID: 191858
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a history major [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was, it was, I was so much involved in so many different things.  I, I mean I was, I was the vice president of the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], as they call vice polemarch of the campus.  I was a regional vice polemarch which meant that I was vice president of the entire western Tennessee region of the Kappas.  And then I was, I really controlled maybe about one-half of the student legislature because of the newspaper [Fisk Forum] and various organizations.  And it was, you know, everything was very much involved in black power, trying to basically make a change.  Understanding what was going on in society--getting a sense of the excitement coming out of the flower child movement coming from the West Coast because the West Coast began to beckon a lot of folks.  You had, again, Stokely [Carmichael, later, Kwame Ture].  You had--Cleave [Eldridge Cleaver] probably was the most impactful person.  You had--
Speaker 1: Eldridge Cleaver?
Speaker 2: Eldridge Cleaver.   Bobby Seale wasn't that prominent.  [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga was, was--I mean he had just started the Simbas [Simba Wachanga] in Watts [Los Angeles, California], and he was beginning to make an impact. And I mean, and then, you know, I mean bellbottoms came out, and all this other stuff happens and, and it was just electric.  And before you knew it, it was over.  I mean, it was graduation.  I really hadn't thought about doing anything until I got a phone call from, literally, it was a recruiter from Columbia [University, New York, New York] saying, had you considered?  Because I had also been a stringer for Newsweek, so I wrote some stuff that we had basically written about what was going on at Fisk [University] that they ran.  And, or they made a part of a, of a series that ran describing what was going on with all the riots and stuff.  And then, when the phone call came in, and I, I really never had given a thought.  Then [Theodore] Currier started sort of dropping suggestions that maybe you need to consider this, that, or another, you know, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Columbia, or NYU [New York University, New York, New York], or something, but you ought to consider law school.  And, you know, I guess it wasn't until April or May that I just said, well, let me think about law school.  So I joined up in the CLEO [Council on Legal Education Opportunity] Program, which was a program that they basically created to ease the cultural change from historically black college [and university, HBCU] students into law school.  And I got appointed to go to the CLEO Program in New York at--in the [Greenwich] Village.
Story_ID: 191859
Speaker 1: New York [New York] was another radical change.  I went to New York, attended the CLEO [Council on Legal Education Opportunity], I guess, sessions, workshops, or course from the early part of June of '69 [1969] and through--it must have been third week of, from the first week of June to the third week of June.  And then, I got accepted at Columbia [University, New York, New York] and NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  I lived in Washington Square South which was a dorm right on Washington Square [Manhattan, New York, New York].  So, keep in mind, I'm coming from Nashville [Tennessee], drove up in my Triumph [GT6 Spitfire], moved into Washington Square which is a far cry from Nashville.
Speaker 2: So now you're in Greenwich Village, right?
Speaker 1: Greenwich Village, right in the middle of--this is in '69 [1969].  The entire strategy was me to get through CLEO and then, I had a job as assistant to the night editor of the New York Times that I was going to start when I finished.  And I was allowed to stay at Washington Square for the entire summer 'cause it was cheap and it was great just to be in Greenwich Village in the summer time when you're twenty-one years old.  It was electric.  The first experience of note was--I believe it was around June, the 20-something.  I had finished CLEO.  I was starting to work.  I had started to work at, at the New York Times and I was working the night, late shift.  I think I had to go to work at something, like eight o'clock at night, and I got off at two or three o'clock in the morning.  And I'd catch the, the local IRT [Interborough Rapid Transit Company] from Washington, from Times Square down to Sheridan Square, and come up Sheridan Square and walk two blocks north over to NYU to the Washington Square.  That night, I walked out of Sheridan Square Station right into the middle of the Stonehenge [sic. Stonewall] riots.  I had no idea what was going on.
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean, the Stonewall [riots]--I mean the, where the gay--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stonewall, they call it.
Speaker 1: Stonewall, it, it was like total chaos.  I mean, I had no idea--it, it was like all these transvestites, cross-dressers, gays, like--I mean, they were all running up and down screaming.  Cops were just like in Nashville (laughter), but there was blood everywhere.  And I'm just standing there with my cord [corduroy] jacket on, and my button-down shirt, and my blue tie, and my khaki pants, and my blue shoes, and just looking at these folks, and saying, my father [John Oliver, Sr.] will never understand this, and I'm not sure I do either.  It was, it was very complexing [ph.].  It wasn't until many years later that I really realized the significance of the history that I was witnessing.  But it was very bothersome because, again, once again, you're being exposed to a level of violence that it was just terrible, just absolutely terrible.
Story_ID: 191860
Speaker 1: And I'd like to backtrack because I don't mean to underplay something that really had a significant impact on my life was that when I was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], my fourth month at Fisk, my mother [Marye Thompson Oliver] died.  And I never really had a chance to sort of, you know, when your mother dies, I guess it's pretty much when you're young.  It's like probably almost equivalent to like losing a kid, and that's unimaginable, but, you know, when you're young, you really do depend upon your mother, more so than your dad, I think.  I mean, at least I did, you know.  She was always an adversary.  She was always establishing goals or benchmarks.  I was always defending why they weren't important.  She was always dictating relationships.  I was always dictating or resenting them, or just denying them.  And it was a very complicated relationship.  But when the suddenness of her death occurred, the--I guess the loneliness, particularly when you're so far away from her, or, or so far away from home, and then you realize that your mom is gone, and you're twenty-one.  Oh, no, you're, you're twenty--I think I was about nineteen or twenty.  And you don't have someone who is so terribly important to a whole lot of things that you had taken for granted going forward.  That had a major impact also in more or less maturing me, as far as trying to anticipate what is it that she would want me to do.  And I guess, to a certain extent, the last part of my existence at Fisk, I have to attribute to me trying to please her posthumously.  And I wish I could have done it without her having to more or less leave me and my sister [Marilyn Thompson-Pickett] the way that she did.
Story_ID: 191861
Speaker 1: But going back to New York [New York], the experience after the Stonewall riots was really mostly centered around that summer.  Just experiencing the New York Times, being in the same room with Carol, Carolyn, not Carolyn, but Charlayne Hunter, or Gault-Hunter [sic. HM Charlayne Hunter-Gault], being in conversations with Seymour Topping or [Abraham Michael] Abe Rosenthal, or having a conversation with [James Barrett] Scotty Reston.  It was just a rare experience to be exposed to the best writers, the best thinkers, the most accomplished journalists probably of the time.  And they were just regular people.  It was also an additional treat to be in the New York Times newsroom at night and experience the excitement when certain tragedies or extreme enjoyable events should occur, and witnessing how a well-run newsroom does operate.  So you're there on an August night when Rocky Marciano happens to die because--in a plane crash and you suddenly witnessed the scary of, of pulling the news coming through lawyers, and watching it being rewritten or helping it being rewritten and getting it corrected and focusing on the issues, getting things verified, and then witnessing the pleasure of something that you contributed to appear in print.  It, it was electric.  And then, you also witness the, the joy of the [New York] Mets winning the World Series.  Nothing can compare to the wildness of looking at Times Square from the fourth floor, or third floor, I don't remember, of the New York Times building overlooking Times Square and watching all that madness of happiness.
Speaker 2: That's the Miracle Mets?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].  That excitement is only balanced with the depression of Chicago [Cubs] fans (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You're right.
Speaker 2: You know, that's only thing that can match this, I'll say that.  If that was energy, I was a void in a sense (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right, but it--
Speaker 2: But I, I didn't even live there, but I've experienced it vicariously now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it, it--I tell you, it, it was pure magic.  The other aspect of being at the Times experience was you meet all these people.  You talk to 'em casually.  You get a sense what's it like to be that, what's it like to be in Russia [sic. Soviet Union], what is it like to do this.  Harrison Salisbury, who is a real famous international author, was there.  He was one of the managers, or he was just a contributing writer, but he was just--and his Pul- everybody had a, had a Pulitzer.  Just they're, they're like nothing.  You know, so it, it, but these are great writers.  And they, I mean the thing that makes them so great is because they have insight.  They, they have, they look into, and they can sort of mold an event into something that really is so terribly enjoyable, but significant intellectually.  But still, the most interesting people that I remember today are the guys in the pressroom.
Story_ID: 191862
Speaker 1: Pressroom in the New York Times in 1969 consisted of the basement.  I never could understand where things were because there was nothing but cylinders upon cylinders of big, big press cylinders making a lot of noise and everywhere they were.  You know, and I couldn't understand the organization of it, but there was just thousands of them it appeared.  And when they were running, you could feel the building shake, and you could hear them on the third and fourth floor.  But when I would go down there for lunch or if I'd go down there for, you know, 'cause I had to drop off a message or to pick up something, I'd invariably would get into conversation 'cause the guys who were operating, were Polish and German.  They were all big strapping brutes, big, big dudes, you know, I mean, with thick New York accents, the kind of folks that you look at and say, well, no, I have no business being down here.  And then they would sit and maybe say something smart and you'd look at 'em, and then they would say something that was drawing you into a conversation.  And then lo and behold, you'd end up talking to 'em.  And you found out quickly that they were experts on, on Native American history which was one of the things that I was interested in as well.  They had been to every major Native American battlefield.  They knew everything that there was to know about the Sioux and the Iroquois and Cherokee, you know.  And they would give you--you'd walk down, you'd drop up something off--said, well, you can only have it if you can name quickly the seven nations of the Sioux.  And they would--boom, you'd whip them off, you know, because they--I mean, you'd be learning things from these guys, but they'd be so fascinating because they would talk about aspects, like Professor [Theodore] Currier.  They would focus in every conversation on a segment that really most people never thought about.  Maybe one afternoon it was a segment of the Wounded Knee Battle [Massacre at Wounded Knee] that most people's not aware--most people would not be aware of.  Other days, they'd be talking about a segment of, of the Little Bighorn Massacre [Battle of the Little Bighorn] that was--and, and they were always thrilled when, when the Indians won--I mean, which was also very interesting.  I spent probably more, most of my time, most, more time than I probably should have in the pressroom talking to these guys, learning a lot more than I'd ever known about Native American history which I really felt was fascinating--
Story_ID: 191863
Speaker 1: The other aspect of the New York Times was when I would come out at night.  The New York [New York], the Times Square was alive--I mean, it was alive at eleven, twelve, one, or two o'clock.  It was just thousands of people, and most of 'em were hookers and they were all gorgeous.
Speaker 2: Most of them?
Speaker 1: Most of them--I tell you, between the 43rd Street entrance of the New York Times, going down to the, to the IRT [Interborough Rapid Transit Company], which is on 8th [Avenue], there had to be at least fifty hookers just stationed on both sides.  And then, you'd make a left going over to 42nd [Street], to go on down to the subway, and there were just hundreds of them.  I mean every--I mean, at that time, there were so many hookers on Times Square.  It was just amazing, and they were all gorgeous and they were all talking to me.  You know, and, you know, I was talking back, you know--I was saying, you know, 'cause after the second and third night, they began to say, "Wait a minute, weren't you here last night?"  And I'm just walking by, minding my business.  I'm smiling.  I'm saying, "You noticed me?"  And they said, "Now you know you're not supposed to be here at two o'clock in the morning.  How come you're showing up every night at two A.M.?"  I said, "I work up the street, for God's sake."  They said, "Where do you work?"  "New York Times."  And then, at that point, you sit down and talk to them.  They were interested in about what was going on in New York Times, what was hot news.  I was interested in well, why you do what you do?  And, you know, you begin to get to know them, you know.  You never really, you know, get involved with them, but you sit down and begin to understand, or try to understand, why they do what they do.  I enjoyed them, you know.  I, I think they probably enjoyed me because most of them were a lot older than I was, but it was like, you know, here's this kid who's coming through here with his cord [corduroy] jacket on every night.  It was the only cord, it was the only jacket I had, and a blue tie, and button down blue shirt, and these damn blue shoes.  And he obviously was country and they were trying to figure out what I was doing.  But, again, it was a thrill just to be able to be exposed to something I had not been exposed to before.
Story_ID: 191864
Speaker 1: I started law school in September of that year [1969].
Speaker 2: At Columbia [Law School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: At Columbia.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And (laughter), that was, that was a thrill, I guess.  It started out--I moved my stuff up from Greenwich Village [New York, New York].  I moved in with Jim Gilliam [James H. Gilliam, Jr.] who had been in kindergarten with me in Baltimore [Maryland].  He was a senior.  I had lost a couple of years when I transferred.  He was a senior at Columbia.  He was my best friend, you know.  I mean he was like, he was, he was just--he's how I got--became a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] because he was the head of the Kappas at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  He sent some letters down and opened up the gate so I can pledge earlier.  So when I moved in with Jimmy, he was in his last year at Columbia Law.  I was excited because at least I had someone on the inside who could more or less help me understand some of the pitfalls and the ropes 'cause I had really no sense in what I was gonna get into.  I moved up there, and as I was registering for the first semester, I parked my car on the street with all my luggage in it, and went in to register.  When I came back, all my stuff was gone.  Car was there, but all my clothes and everything was gone.  First lesson, New York City [New York, New York], you never leave anything in your car that's visible.  That was a hard lesson because I, I really didn't have--I had money and, you know, dad [John Oliver, Sr.] was always supportive, but it was just the idea of somebody rendering that megatude [ph.] of violence.  They broke the windows of the car.  I had to get it fixed and everything.  But my first year at Columbia was scary because you don't have fun.  It's like, I guess, the first year in med [medical] school.  Everyone else is acting normal as human beings.  You're only focused on one thing.  You're going to class, you're going to the library, you go back to class, you go back to the library and every waking hour, you're writing, you're writing the facts of everything that you read.  You're writing the issues, and then you're writing the holding and the rationale.  And you do that--that's what you call briefing cases and you brief everything.  I mean, and, and your fingers get cramped, but the more you do it, the better you are able to conceptualize what things or segments of a case stand for.  And you are quickly able to pull out the issues and it really does help you qualitatively discern how to begin to think like a lawyer.  And, eventually, you begin to make a noise like a lawyer, but that takes a little while longer.
Speaker 2: How do lawyers think differently than other people, than us regular people?
Speaker 1: We, we are qualitative, you know.  You, you--they're degrees, and after you sort of define the, define the parameters of what the facts are, then you draw from the facts the issues, so that helps you more or less understand, you know, the various nuances.  And then you sort of begin to draw from that the various parts which make this different from others.  It's a qualitative exercise that is not easily more or less gotten only through just repetitive, and it's nothing that you can get from memory, which is what the Socratic approach to teaching law--how that's different from the rote method that many other law schools, mainly non-Ivy League law schools, teach.  What they teach you at Columbia is how to think like a lawyer, more so than anything else.  And it's helpful in practically everything else that I do.  You know, you listen and you, you balance and you extract, and you sort of can, more or less summarize very easily, more so than most people that I know.
Story_ID: 191865
Speaker 1: So you're saying there are two ways of teaching law?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: I mean, on one hand, you can sit there and memorize what the book says this law, this case stands for, but in the Socratic Method, it is more a discussion based, you know, you go through a series of steps where you are drawing out the issues.  You're defining them in a way that permits you to understand how the conclusions were met.  So you're not really worried about what the conclusions are more so than you're understanding how they got there.  And so, I mean Columbia [Law School, New York, New York] and most of the Ivy League schools that's how they teach it, you know.  And you, you have professors standing there challenging you, why is this particular case, or why did the judge hold it this way?  Don't tell me--everybody is expected to know what the holding is, but I want you to tell me, what's the rationale for it?  And do you understand the steps that this case represents, you know, so it's not that much memory as much as it is understanding how you get to the conclusions.  And it, it is very exciting because some teachers really do make it alive.  Others just never do seem to get it.  I had a few teachers that really latched onto me.  Some of them really scared the hell out of me.  Others really just ignited the excitement of things.  To my surprise, the very thing that I thought I would never really be interested in--I guess it was because the dean of the law school taught a course in taxes, along with another nationally famous tax lawyer.  And after the third week, I began to understand the tax code, so that I could flip through it in such a real--I could really under--it, it was like learning and understanding a language.  You really begin to get excited when you begin to think--let's say in French, more so than just speak it.  And when you begin to think it in French, that's when you understand that you, you really begin to know it.  When you begin to think in terms of the various concepts, conceptual segments of the code, that's when it really becomes ignited and very exciting.  And I really just became crazy about the tax code.  I'd say everybody looking at me as though I was absolutely crazy.  But that's--I, I just wanted to be left alone to play with tax problems.  And so, I got through the first year and, and at Columbia.  It was tough.  You go through moot court and that's very nerve-wracking.  That's where you begin to make a noise like a lawyer.  And then, in my second year, I really started to take off.  I mean, I just really started to have so much fun because, again, I just wanted to be left alone with my taxes.  And then, I started to get into a little bit more of the corporate stuff.  And my second year, I did really well.
Story_ID: 191866
Speaker 1: And then, beginning of my third year [at Columbia Law School, New York, New York], I was the first person in my class to get an offer from a Wall Street [Manhattan, New York, New York] law firm.  And I mean, that was probably my worst mistake (laughter) because--
Speaker 2: Why, yeah?
Speaker 1: At that point, I made a decision that my law education is finished.  And I can now go to the beach and do nothing.  And that's, in essence, what I did, and almost didn't graduate because of the fact that I just assumed that I didn't have to do anything else.  And I, I think I disappeared about the second week or third week in September.  And I came back in December, and then I panicked when I realized how much I did not know.  I made it through, but I never made that mistake again, particularly in my second semester.  I stuck back into the books and got back up, but it taught me that it never pays to be cocky.  And you never know as much as you think, and you're never as good as you, you believe you are.  But it scared me enough to really get even more serious my last semester.  So I found myself graduating.  And I was, I was very happy being in New York [New York], being accepted at Davis Polk [& Wardwell].  And very radical, I had an Afro that was about as big as this.  It was an embarrassment to my mo- to my father [John Oliver, Sr.].  I mean, you, I, I--there were pictures of me where I, I mean I had this, the blue Columbia University [New York, New York] doctorate robes on.  I had a blue, dark blue shirt, big hippie tie, and an Afro.  That's all you could see, me and my sunglasses, shades, and an Afro that came out to here.  So, mind you, I started working at Davis Polk that June right after graduation.  I didn't cut my hair.  I didn't wear socks for the first month.  Now, this is Wall Street.  This is the second largest Wall Street law firm.  I was the third black hired.  This is the law firm of John W. Davis.  He's the man who lost Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  He only lost one case in his life and that was Brown vs. Board of Education (laughter).  And I'm showing up as about as radical as I can be and daring anybody to even say anything about my hair or the fact that I don't have socks on.  I guess I felt my role was to try to get the establishment to conform to me.  And I don't think I was any different than anybody else really.  Everybody conformed to each other eventually.  And about three or four months later, my hair was cut.  I had socks on.  And I was more focused on more important things than trying to make an impact on people or people's values.  I learned how to practice law there.
Story_ID: 191867
Speaker 1: Now, what was Davis [John W. Davis] like?  I mean, what, what was--I mean this is the firm that represented--
Speaker 2: John W. [Davis] was dead--
Speaker 1: --the Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas].
Speaker 2: He was dead by then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was, okay.
Speaker 2: He was dead--it was John.  Davis Polk [& Wardwell] was One Chase Manhattan Plaza [later, 28 Liberty Street, New York, New York].  My office was on the 60, 60th floor.  I saw everything in Manhattan [New York, New York].  The firm was headed by an old man called F.A.O. Schwarz.
Speaker 1: F.A.O. Schwarz?
Speaker 2: Fritz of the toy--that was him.
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: The head of the tax department was David Lindsay, John Lindsay's twin brother.  You had more stars in this firm than you could shake a stick on.  I mean, these were serious guys.  The biggest--their clients were General Mills, General Motors, Morgan Stanley, Morgan Guaranty [Trust Company, later, JPMorgan Chase].  And I spent my first two years at Davis Polk at the knee of probably one of the most--a very exciting man who sort of adopted many young associates.  His name was Bruce Nichols.  Bruce is dead.  He was head of the banking segment of Davis Polk.  He was very strange, very intense.  I don't think he was taller than 5'4", brilliant, absolutely brilliant, impeccable.  I mean, he was just real, terribly WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant].  But he taught you how to do loan agreements.  He was the person who Morgan Guaranty Trust would not do very much unless they checked with Bruce.  And Bruce just gathered all the young associates under him, and that was the first phase of your evolution towards becoming a Davis Polk associate.  And you did some very interesting big time loan agreements.  I began to specialize in currency switch your dollar deals, which was like Greek to most people at that time.  And it was exciting doing Australian or European or even some African transactions using currency switch, which was very complicated because you always had to draft the language just right, so that it could be carried in a particular period of time of the loan, and the right currency at the right rate that is established at the beginning of what they call a tranche, but it was fun, you know.  I mean I, I--you learned how to write precisely.  I mean, you were very precise.  And then, of course, you never went home.  You spent all your time at the printer if you were working on public offerings.  And in those cases, I'd be representing Morgan Stanley and who's the underwriter invariably, and it was--you never, you never go home.  I, at that point in time, I fell in love and got married.  And my wife was someone who I had met at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  She was from Fisk and she was very, very pretty.  And we were the perfect couple until we were married for two years.  We lived together for about three years before we got married.  But during that time, my work at Davis Polk almost never permitted me to get home.
Story_ID: 191868
Speaker 1: Now, okay, so you're at Davis Polk [& Wardwell, New York, New York] until '78 [1978] and you were saying before we left that your marriage kind of suffered because of being absent so much.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --it, it sort of fell apart right after--we were married for--in '76 [1976].  And in '78 [1978], we agreed to separate and divorce.
Speaker 1: Now, I guess, if I understand what you're saying correctly, you were in a world that a lot of black people never experienced--this corporate legal world--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was--
Speaker 1: --with all this, you know.
Speaker 2: --it was at the beginning, it was at the beginning of--there's a fair number there now.  But at that time, there wasn't.  At Wall Street, there was just a handful and there was only one black partner that I'd, I knew of.  And it was Amalya Kearse and she was I believe, at one of the, either Milbank Tweed [sic. Hughes Hubbard & Reed, New York, New York] or one of the other large law firms.  But by and large, there was just a handful of black associates.  And, and, indeed, we got together one time for purpose of just introducing and getting to know each other.  And I was sharing that experience, I think, with [Reginald] Reggie Lewis's brother [Jean S. Fugett] because I remember at that meeting, that, that was the first time I, I met Reggie Lewis 'cause he was also--he had been in Wall Street law firm.  And he was like one of the sages and that was just before or maybe just after he broke off and, and, and started to do his own thing.  But it was like a, a very closed circle of probably not more than thirty black lawyers practicing in all the Wall Street law firms.  And I remember that meeting quite vividly because it was just, to me, it was exciting 'cause I was a first year associate and the youngest and still getting my feet wet (laughter).  And we were all sharing experiences of what it was like to be a rare thing on Wall Street.  We all had similar stories.  One guy told about how he was working late at night, as most of us always seemed to do.  And one of the security guards thought that he was a burglar and he got arrested (laughter).  It, it was all these silly little stories that really was reflection--a reflection or reflections of the establishment getting used to us being in a different level.  We were all very visible as far as blacks were concerned as, you know, maintenance and other things.  But when it came down to, you know, include us as the actual lawyers and guys who were really near the top, it was something different.
Story_ID: 191869
Speaker 1: And, but it was a good experience and it was something, again, that I would do.  And I met some very good people.  I--one of the people that I met that I'd forgotten was in--when I was in my third year at Davis Polk [& Wardwell, New York, New York], they always had summer associates come in to spend the summer.  And they, once in a while, you know, they were from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Columbia [University, New York, New York], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], and University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] or University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, you know, they were always, you know, spend--encourage them to, to get to know everyone.  And, and that summer, there was a young brother from Harvard.  I remember him vividly now 'cause he stuck his head in my office.  He was a little short but not real short.  He had, of course, a tie on, and I think he had a pink button-down shirt on.  And he, you know, he just slid into my office and sat down and we just spent some time talking.  I'd forgotten about that conversation and, and forgot about that young man until last summer.  I was invited to address all of the black executives of IBM at the IBM headquarters at Armonk [North Castle, New York] by--Ted Childs is a good friend, was senior vice president in charge of diversity there.  He is a big wheel at IBM.  And he convenes all the blacks once a year to--everybody check in with each other, which I think is good, but he does it also for gay, lesbians, and Hispanics and, you know, because IBM is a very different company, primarily because of what Ted Childs has done.  And I was addressing the black executives for about an hour explaining what the black press was about and telling them where we need to work together.  And after that, there was a reception, and then I got invited to hang out for the next speaker.  And Ted grabs me and pulls me to the side and says, come on, I want you to intro- I want to introduce you to the next speaker.  And I told him I really was rushing to get back.  He said, no, we got time, so I got dragged across the room.  And he says, "Jake, I would like to introduce you to Ken Chenault, chairman of American Express."  So Ken looks up.  He said, "Jake, I saw your name on the program and I was so excited that you were the--I am really glad to see you here, man, 'cause there's so much we need to talk about."  I was like, "Do I know you?"  He says, "You don't remember me?"  I said, "I know who Ken Chenault is."  He says, but I don't--he says, "Davis Polk."  And then, suddenly, it came back.  That was the young associate who spent that afternoon with me talking about various things.  He never forgot it, which was an important lesson at that late stage for me, that it really never hurts to spend some time to try and share your experience with anyone who is willing to listen for purposes of being able to help them in some small way avoid maybe some of the things that you may not have been able to.  The lesson also taught me that, you know, that, you know, there's a lot of people out there who just don't forget small things, and what I thought was a small thing to me was apparently not so small to him.  So, but it was very gratifying.  It was probably one of the highlights, but one of the many highlights of, of my experience at Davis Polk.
Story_ID: 191870
Speaker 1: So you went from Davis Polk [& Wardwell, New York, New York] to General Electric [Fairfield, Connecticut].  Now, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Davis Polk was a good training program.  I didn't think that that was going to be my life work.  And I honestly didn't think that they were going to make a black partner any time soon and, quite frankly, I don't think they have yet either.  So, around my fifth or sixth year, I started to get a sense of maybe I need to start thinking about my next step.  I wanted to practice law a little bit more because I was still getting a charge out of doing deals.  I also wanted to really begin to get a little bit away from the pressure cooker of being at ground zero on the biggest deals and 'cause it was really--I'd been through it.  I'd done it, but now, I think I was ready to sort of ease up a little and begin to do some other things.  General Electric was an interesting opportunity at headquarters to continue some of the things that I was doing, but also to branch out and maybe learn a little bit more about the role of what a corporate counsel really does, an in-house person.  So when the--they invited me up, I accepted, and spent the next four years with General Electric.  It was two years at headquarters and then two years at--as an associate general counsel with their General Electric Information Services company [later, Global eXchange Services] in Rockville, Maryland.  And probably that was one of the major changes in my life when I went to GEIS or GE Information Services because of the nature of the practice there.  That was my first real serious exposure to what was going on with computers.  It was a computer company.  It was a distributed data processing company.  And in 1980, the world was about to become introduced to the new PC [personal computer], age of the PC.  There were a fair number of these large conglomerates called distributed data processing companies which were nothing more than big warehouses chock-full of huge central processing units that were basically selling time, time-sharing, and distributing it to people, regardless of where they happened to be by just hooking up over the telephone lines.  It was an interesting project, but it was completely blown sky high with the advent of initially the Peanut [IBM PCjr], which was introduced by IBM around '81 [1981].  And then, it was blasted completely out of the water when the Macintosh came in town.  And then shortly thereafter, when the PC got reinvented with DOS [disk operating system] and Compaq, and the other smaller manufacturers got wind of, of the codes for, for DOS and started manufacturing the hardware, and the small PC began to become replicated.  That entire business died in about four years.  But it was exciting in the 1980s and '81 [1981] because they were really scurrying around trying to anticipate the mass of change that they sensed was about to happen without really knowing what it was gonna be like, or when it was going to occur.  Most of them were doing one thing.  They were buying up software companies.  And they were believing that by putting more--a greater variety of software on these central processing units and distributing them widely to their various clients, they could maintain their competitive edge over the then-still somewhat expensive cost of the units that were still out there at this moment.
Story_ID: 191871
Speaker 1: I bought companies.  I acquired some fairly big ones for GE [General Electric], and learned a lot about structuring software deals.
Speaker 2: Which ones--can you tell us?
Speaker 1: There was Software International, which was a software house that was, in essence, they developed the software that initially was used by all the ATM machines.  That was a very powerful software.  In 1981, '82 [1982], the ATMs were just beginning to emerge.  Everybody was running after that software.  They had some other types of software that they were using as well.  Gosh, I'm trying to think of some of the others.  There were about three or four that I did.  And each one was--all of them was structured basically the same way.  GE [General Electric] had a sense that they never wanted to buy anything outright.  They wanted to tie the sellers up through some type of performance payout arrangement which was a bad idea.  And, invariably, each one backfired on 'em, but the fun I had was spending a lot of time structuring these deals, drafting the documentation, and closing them.  And I think GE was very, very happy with what I did.  In the process I began to develop a general understanding of computers.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you're back here in, in [Rockville] Maryland, doing this in Rockville, operating out of Rockville?  Are you living in Rockville or are you living in--
Speaker 1: Living in Gaithersburg [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Gaithersburg, okay.  All right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And I have--living with a girlfriend of mine and it was comfortable.  And then, things at the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] started to change.
Story_ID: 191872
Speaker 1: So, there's a generational glitch at the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers].  The old guard was--so what was the critique?  Had it kind of come to a-well was it in financial trouble or was it a--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't really in--let me put it this way.  It wasn't generating a whole lot of profit.  It wasn't on its knees either.  It really suffered from, in my opinion, a lack of imaginative planning.  It just needed a fresh set of eyes.  And being the Young Turk, along with my cousin [HM Reverend Frances Murphy Draper], we basically sort of found each other across this wide table that separated the factions that we happened to find ourselves in.  I was in one family faction.  That was never--I had never really been aligned with Tony [HM Reverend Frances Murphy Draper] who was with the Carl Murphy faction.  And, but as I started to hear and see things, we both began to develop a, a recognition that maybe there is a better or a different way.  And, you know--
Speaker 1: Now, this is Tony who's the reverend, she's a reverend now, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And even though there was not the immediate decision to do anything outside of the existing management structure, we began to develop a frustration as the years went on.  And around 19- I came back into town [Baltimore, Maryland] in '91 [1991]--no, '80 [1980], in '81 [1981], the end of '81 [1981].  The summer of '81 [1981], I came to the Afro because it was decided that there really needed to be another generation somewhere in the management structure because the older generation was expected because they were old--I mean, real old.  They were gonna slow down.  So I was brought in as vice chairman.  I was doing a whole bunch of new things that had never happened before.  Things that were radical, like having, having staff meetings (laughter).  I'd have staff meetings and I mean, it's just, it was--I'd look around that table, and I was, I guess, I, I don't know, I was middle thirties.  And the average age of the people at that table with me was somewhere around sixty-five with me.  That means--
Speaker 1: With you calculated in the--
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).  I mean, it was old.  And then, I, I started to talk about the need to introduce computer automation in various processes, and you could feel the tension in the room.  I mean, it was like, here he comes, gonna mess up everything.  And I just got real busy.  I mean, I met with everybody in the city that I could--who wanted to talk to me.  I was having lunch every day with different people from the mayor to city council president.  I met everybody.  I got involved in so many things in so short of time, I think it shocked 'em.  I then started to analyze various processes.  Then I figured out a way to bring Tony into the business.  And then, we hatched up a plan that was directly connected with a series of meetings that I had had with an old drinking buddy of mine--a, a white Republican from Alabama who happened to be the chairman of the board of USF&G [Baltimore, Maryland].  We basically would have--just we'd, we'd meet maybe once or twice, you know, a month over a period of months at The Center Club [Baltimore, Maryland], which is a private club downtown, that I had basically been admitted to.  And in those meetings, they began to get a sense of a vision that I had had, that I had, that really I'd never really developed.  And after sharing it with Jack [ph.] and a few others, they made an offer, saying that they could finance a plan to help implement some of this dream that would permit us to begin to automate the Afro, and to restructure various sections of it, so that we can improve the reporting and really become a lot more up to date.
Story_ID: 191873
Speaker 1: Tony [HM Reverend Frances Murphy Draper] and I had developed the implementation of that segment of that strategy [automation of Afro-American Newspapers], and then, we became so bold about it that we marched into a shareholders meeting, presented the plan to that group.  And then the group embraced it--said it was a great idea.  And then, we went into a board of directors meeting, and then I told the board of directors a little bit more about what my plan was that I had not shared with the shareholders.  And there were conditions to the implementation of the plan, and the condition was that the existing officers would have to resign.  They would have to give me a power of attorney over--of their shares, and I would create a retirement plan that would make them fairly comfortable.  It was as if I had asked for this family jewels.  I got fired the next day--voted out of office.  Tony quit.  And the war started.  My plan had--not only it, a funding mechanism, but it had the support of several large banks in the, in the state [Maryland].  Again, I'd become friends with everyone.  And they were looking at me as the great hope of what they all viewed as a very valuable institution [Afro-American Newspapers].  When I left, I got a job at one of the large law firms downtown.  And Tony joined another firm, a security firm.  And there was an aspect that also I meant to inject.  When I presented the plan to the board of directors, I also told them that this company is governed by what is called a voting trust agreement.  Various factions of the family have agreed to pool their shares for purposes of having those shares exercised by two or three members of the family as trustees.  So only three people really are involved in the exercise of those shares of--that are in that trust.  To the extent that the trust really controlled most majority of the shares and I was a member of that trust, but Tony wasn't.  I was--my, my hands were tied 'cause even though I was one of the three trustees, I was outvoted.  But the fact of the matter is that voting trust--and this was in 198- this was in 1983 or '4 [1984].  That voting trust was scheduled to expire in 1985.  I had a voting trust in my back pocket that consisted of--my family shares included Tony's family shares, and one other additional family group that had not been involved.  In other words, we had reshuffled the formula to equal a majority and thus control that would automatically take over the paper upon the expiration of the then-existing voting trust.  So, in essence, when I put this plan in front of the board, I told them, you can either accept the conditions and go quietly now, or we will take it in two years.  So, either give it to me now or later, but there is--those are your options because what I have in my back pocket is locked up.  Well, they thought that--well, if you can get all this funding and everything else, we certainly can.  And we got two years to do whatever we want to in order to prevent you from doing what your, you plan to do.  Two years later, Tony and I walked in and took over.  We never looked back.  I mean, it was--in that two-year period, they tried everything possible to get funding from every bank or whatever.  And every time, they talked to any bank president, I would be basically receiving phone calls 'cause everyone in, in Baltimore [Maryland] apparently had made a decision.  That's not the future.  They are.  And it worked.
Story_ID: 191874
Speaker 1: And so, we came in in '86 [1986], took over.  It [Afro-American Newspapers] was not in shambles, but it really was difficult.  Tony [HM Reverend Frances Murphy Draper] was just absolutely great because I was still at--I was still at, at practicing, the law firm, but I was chair- I was chairman of the board and CEO [chief executive officer].  Tony was president, but she really walked in and just grabbed the day-to-day stuff, and it was largely through her efforts that helped us get through the next two to three years, while I was still practicing.  And I didn't stop practicing until '87 [1987].  I came in around '87 [1987], '88 [1988].  And when I came in, my real focus at that point was to implement the conversion of the automation, which eventually saved the paper only, because, keep in mind, we were seventeen, eighteen people in our production department.  We were--I mean, our staff was so big, we were not automated in connection with anything.  Tony held the reins when I got in.  We started to--I started, we really started to move everything.  And by 1990-'91 [1991], I'd cut the production staff from seventeen down to seven.  We had converted to a totally new process, desktop publishing.  We were looking at weak--encountered a very serious tax problem.  And we were looking for a new location.  And we took some major steps.  We sold our building in [Washington] D.C.  We got out of, out of, we got out of trouble with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service].  We sold our building in Baltimore [Maryland].  I mean, in, in Baltimore, because that building literally was falling down on top of us.  And we moved into this building in 1991.  And in 1992, I'm sorry, in 1992, we moved here.  Nineteen ninety-three [1993], we threw away our paste-a-boards and our X-ACTO knives, and we became one of the few newspapers in the area that was completely automated.
Speaker 2: This is in '90 [1990]--
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992], '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Everything was done on the Mac [Macintosh].  And that was primarily a result of--from '87 [1987] to '92 [1992] through the move in '93 [1993], I took off my suits.  I moved into the production department with Mac Classic and started to teach everyone, not only how to use a Mac Classic, how to lay out pages, and develop the process of getting people to put (laughter), to put the copy on floppy discs, if you can--I mean, can you imag- flop- we had, we had, we had a, a sneaker circuit going around where go upstairs from the editorial department.  They have their stories on floppy discs.  They run them downstairs to give them to me.  I'd put them in--I laid out every major front page and every major section page of this paper in four years.  I mean, I--not only did I teach the process, I learned the process, taught everybody how to do it, starting from classifieds, which you can't imagine what it's like laying out classifieds on a Mac Classic, which goes eight megahertz a second.  I mean, it, it is like slow as can be.  But we did it, and then we gradually moved up, got faster machines as they were developed.  And now in '94 [1994], we blew the lid off by going ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] that connected us with terminals in our editorial department in the Washington [D.C.] office, and terminals in the editorial department in our Richmond [Virginia] office.  Everything got connected in a wide area network.  This is in '94 [1994] using ISDN.  No one in the world knew what ISDN was.  And then, the next year, we dropped ISDN, and went--we went frame relay.  Folks thought we were crazy, but I had cut my operational expenses by one-third every time we made a move.  It became so efficient.  We became faster.  Our paper became--came, hit the street faster.  And my staff was reduced to now to the point where we have five people in production doing capacity-wise, maybe twice as much as we'd ever done.  Took the savings and hired more sales people.  It was a simple strategy, but someone had to sit down and learn how to do it step by step by step.
Story_ID: 191875
Speaker 1: Did circulation increase [for Afro-American Newspapers]?
Speaker 2: Circulation increased only when we got the paper out on the street consistently in the mornings.  And when we got the paper, we began to--and we, and then we did something that was almost impossible.  Not only did we get the paper in Baltimore [Maryland] and Washington [D.C.] out on the streets on Thursday for [Washington] D.C., and Friday morning early, but we also got the subscribers to get their papers delivered to them on Thursday and Friday morning at the same day that the paper regularly was hitting the newsstands.  That means that the little old ladies at home are gonna get their Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] at ten A.M., the same time everybody else gets theirs.  I can't tell you--I would walk into a gathering and old ladies would come up and grab me and scream and kiss me and say, we don't know what you're doing, but don't stop 'cause everyone said that there's no one way you can get--the subscribed papers would always generally arrive, if they're lucky, on Saturday or maybe Monday.  Now, they arrive on the day the news, the newsstands get their paper.  And then, we also did another thing.  We also developed a process so that not only did the newspapers hit subscribers at the same time they hit the newsstand, but they also--the bills are hitting the mailbox that same day.
Story_ID: 191876
Speaker 1: --When we [Afro-American Newspapers] accomplished 100 percent pagination, it was such an enormous step up, that it changed practically every aspect of this business because whereas in the old process, when we're even pasting up, the printer wouldn't get the pages until the messenger arrived with all the flats which represented all the pasted up pages that we had completed, which would normally take an hour to arrive after we had completed our work.  And then once they get those thirty, the forty pages, of broadsheet pages, then they would have to begin their pre-press process and it would take them maybe four, five, six hours to do that.  So, invariably, the paper wasn't coming back until late the next morning, but when we eliminated all those old Compugraphic waxing processes, it only took the page thirty seconds to get to the printer.  The printer could start right away for the pre-press the moment he received the page instead of waiting for all of the pages to be completed by us.  That meant that within a half an hour to forty-five minutes after we sent the last page, the entire newspaper was up on press.  That meant that we were coming off the press generally around three or four o'clock in the morning.  That meant also that we could get to the post office to ensure that all our subscribers were gonna get the paper at the same day.  And it also meant that all our newspapers were getting into those locations where they could hit the morning drive time traffic perfectly.  And we generally hit it every time.
Story_ID: 191877
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there's another aspect of this.  When you have an old established institution like the Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers], with everybody knows it and everybody's--the, the staff's been there a long time and you know, there's--you had this big change, you know.  Here you come in and you bring new technology--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --new ways, and take the receipts out of the shoe box or whatever they're in, and all that sort of thing.  I heard some of that story before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that Tony's [HM Reverend Frances Murphy Draper] been talking to you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tony's been talking to us.  And, I mean, how did you manage to--you have feelings to soothe and relationships to heal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --what happened to the people that didn't have jobs any more--I mean, and that sort of thing.  What, what--
Speaker 2: It's tough.  You know, it is, it--with respect to members of the family, we gave them an opportunity.  And it was either them or us and they chose themselves, and even though we told them that it's either now or later, they didn't believe that it would be later.  But we were right, they were wrong.  It really was trying to take them into consideration at the initial stages of the--let's say the proposition process.  But when we realized that reason wasn't gonna work, then there was no other way for us to do it, so we had to do what we had to do.  We, at all times, are very sensitive because they're still our family.  We don't want to hurt anyone and we've tried to really assist them in every way.  You know, I mean we lived up to our obligations with respect to the officers who did have power before we took over.  And we made our payments over the period of years and we paid up the obligations to them.  And over the last couple of years, we've been able to reinstitute dividends.  And we really are about trying to heal while the process focusing on our main objective which is to grow this business, expand it, make it more viable for the future generations of managers, whether they are family or not, to really continue the obligation of this enterprise.  It's a big responsibility for me right now because of the fact that we are really at a critical stage where I am really confronted with probably the next big step.  I mean, we did all those things in the '90s [1990s] that helped automate.  And we, as a result, had a series of profitable years after that.  This year has not been a good year for us at all.  It's probably been one of the worst years, but it's environmentally one of the worst years for practically every--I have not met any newspaper owner or publisher who's having a good year right now.  The national advertising is down.  It is a struggle for local ads across.  And we're all dealing with some of the basic things that we all have got to become better masters of, which is recognizing that a newspaper in 2003, it's a marketing animal that has got to be competitive in a multimedia environment, more effective than it is ever been done before.  And that requires a better understanding of the technology, a better understanding of the market pressure that the advertisers are faced, and trying to understand how to meet their needs more effectively and more efficiently than what we've ever done before.  That's a big challenge for many of these newspapers who don't have the benefit of forward thinking, young technologically astute business folks.  They're going to not make it, quite frankly.  I've just finished my second term as president of NNPA, the National Newspaper Publishers Association is the press association, the principle spokes entity for all the African American weekly newspapers in this country.  We have over two hundred.  For the last four years, I've been away from the Afro technically.  I've only been back at the Afro since my term was up for, as president of the NNPA of the association.  In June, I couldn't run again and I wouldn't have run again, but my term as president of the foundation expired in, in September.  And since September, I've been able, for the first time in four years, to dedicate all my existence to one thing, reinventing, everything that we do at the Afro like I did in the '90s [1990s].  And it is required to do this almost every--and now I know we're required to do this every ten years.  We've got to become far more efficient.  We have got to reinvent all the processes.  And in this time, some of the processes are not the same processes that were reinvented back in the early '90s [1990s].  We've got to look at how we build.  We've got to look at how we track.  We have to look at how we interact with our particular client agents, as well as our client advertisers.  We've got to be far smarter as a result of understanding their pay cycles and get them to have more information about what our, our pay cycles are gonna be like.  When there's less money out there, everybody's got to become far more understanding and far more efficient.  Indeed, they're got to become far more smarter, else they won't survive.
Story_ID: 191878
Speaker 1: Now you [Afro-American Newspapers] have a website now, too.  You've joined, you know, the modern world with a website, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were the first black newspaper up on a website, up on the Internet.  We've been up on the Internet since 1994.  In '94 [1994], there were only eighteen newspapers in this country on the Internet and we were one of the first.  That is a reflection of us recognizing the importance of technology.  We use it not just to be first.  We use it because of the fact that it has helped us survive because it made us more efficient, it's permitted us to become far more cost, less costlier in connection with our operations.  We can reach more people.  We can do more things and we are still today, learning more and more about how to use that Internet more smartly.  We are really quickly becoming a daily newspaper because I'm forcing my people to write faster and shorter, and to cover more events on a weekly basis, and not be impeded or restricted by focusing on when the deadline for the print happens to be for our--for, at the press.  But more so, write it quickly, get me as many pictures as you can that make sense.  And we are now all using digital cameras.  We don't use any film anymore, so that I can, if, if there's a late breaking story, I want that story up on the Internet that night so that people can log in to afro.com and see exactly what happened half an hour ago.  That's what we're gonna be doing more of, and we're gonna become better at, as we understand how to sort of perfect that process of transferring pictures, copy, copy editing, proofreading, so that what we put up on the Internet is at least as good as it is when we put it in print.
Story_ID: 191879
Speaker 1: You all recently lost someone who is special in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the black newspaper world, sports writer.
Speaker 2: It's Sam.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sam Lacy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sam Lacy was everybody's father, everybody's uncle, everybody's coach.  He was the man who taught a whole, whole generations of our writers here at the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] how to be journalists.  I mean, how to approach a story, how to structure it, how to write it, how not to write it.  I mean, he was a very critical, he was a very critical overseer, and no one ever took Sam other than seriously.  I mean, he was, you know, you listened to everything he told you.  He was a very polite, but very intense person.  We have been with Sam for forty-seven years.  I've known Sam all my life.  And, you know, I remember Sam when I was a kid.  And I remember him being always there with a smiling face.  And as an adult and as the chairman of the Afro, he's always been my biggest supporter.  He was always a lot of fun--never missed an opportunity, regardless of where he was to always, you know, thank me for being there, and always never missed an opportunity to always ask for a raise (laughter).  But if you can imagine, here's this ninety some year old guy would be driving his car at five o'clock in the morning, showing up here, showing up here at six A.M., first one in the building.  We always have a guard here, but he would be the first reporter or the first writer in the building, and he's at his desk working.  And he'd always have this loud Cougar or loud car that he would drive by himself.  And then, in '97 [1997], '98 [1998], as he began to get really--reached the end of the road, you would never, you'd, you'd never get surprised at showing up here at seven o'clock and you'd see a satellite camera or van outside.  And there was always someone from one of the networks, Bryant Gumbel, Ted Koppel, you name it.  Everyone was making their way to get to Sam, sitting there in the morning talking to him, recording him--Spike Lee.  Spike Lee is doing something about Jackie Robinson.  He spent couple of days here with Sam, just sitting there talking to him, listening to him, and because he probably had more history about what 20th century African American sports was about than anyone else, probably has written more than anyone else about it.  And you never--we can never say enough about Sam Lacy.  The most--probably one of the, the most happy moments in the last couple of years for me was being able to witness Sam being inducted in Cooperstown [New York] [National Baseball] Hall of Fame.  And he did it with such panache and style, but also he gives me the opportunity 'cause he, you know, said, "Jake, I want you to be there.  This is going to be one of the highlights."  And I drove up that, you know, that Saturday afternoon and made it there.  And little did I realize that I would be among--probably every major star whose baseball card I would kill for.  I ran across from [Harold Henry] Pee Wee Reese to Juan [Antonio] Marichal [Sanchez], I guess, the peak was when I was riding the VIP bus over to the induction ceremony.  I was seated in front of Harmon [Clayton] Killebrew.  There was Juan Marichal across the, the aisle, and I was seated at a window.  And a guy tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I wouldn't mind if he sat next to me.  And I looked up at and it was Warren [Edward] Spahn.  I just said, couldn't get better than that (laughter).  I couldn't talk (laughter).  I just said, uh-hum (laughter)--
Story_ID: 191880
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Now the Afro's [Afro-American Newspapers] had some other contributors that have gone on to fame.  And one was--we were discussing before we started this interview, a man by the name of Romare Bearden--
Speaker 1: Ohh--
Speaker 2: --who was writing this.  Romare Bearden, he was a cartoonist--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --for the Afro for three or four years in the '30s [1930s], right?
Speaker 1: Right, Romare Bearden is probably one of the--currently most widely, among the most widely celebrated African American artists of this age.  We were extremely privileged to have him as a cartoonist between 1935 and 1937, I believe.  I--we had all been told, and we had known that he had been our cartoonist.  But I don't think we really spent a lot of effort doing any research about it until I was attending the National Gallery of Art in, in Washington [D.C.] with [HistoryMaker Elinor] Ella Tatum, who's the publisher of the Amsterdam News.  And she dragged me over to the exhibit that they were having of Romare.  And the curator and the head of the news service came running down when they heard that the publisher of the Afro and the publisher of the Amsterdam News were in the building.  And the curator immediately told me that Romare had been your cartoonist.  Did you know that?  And I said, "Yes."  And then she said, "We have all his cartoons.  Do you want them?"  And I couldn't believe it but she--then I said, "Absolutely."  And so, what she did was she sent me all of his--a Xerox of all of his cartoons, except for one, which she couldn't find, which we probably still have here.  And we've been able to find the original paper that each of those cartoons have appeared in.  And we're going to be doing a lot of, of--a lot of special things with Romare to reflect, not only the, the magnitude of his artistry, but also the significance of the issues that really formed the context of those cartoons because only then do you really understand the full magnitude of, of what he could do as an artist.  It's very--you also get a very clear sense that for African Americans at the time of the Harlem Renaissance, which is what this period was, it was a very bleak period even though it was a very important and exciting period for the artists themselves.  And that bleakness is reflected very clearly in the style that, that Romare has in these cartoons.
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of the themes are lynching, the Italo [Italian] invasion of Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Ethiopia, right--the presidential elections issues, [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt New Deal.  I'm just really excited.  I can't wait to get into it.  I, I mean, and some of the people, the journalists that we're talking to who are interested in helping develop a study that can form the basis of a whole series of articles that we're going to be doing to introduce our readers because the more you look through these cartoons, the more you realize that this was about sixty years ago, you know, but after sixty years ago, the old adage that the more things change, the more they remain the same.
Story_ID: 191881
Speaker 1: Now you've got a cartoonist with you now that's been with you for forty-five years, right?
Speaker 2: Forty-three, forty-four, forty-five years.  It's Mr. Stockett, Leroy Stockett [sic. Thomas Stockett].  He is someone who we are just as proud of him as we were of being proud of being associated with Sam Lacy.  Stockett is everybody's artist.  He's done pictures for all the major people I know of in Baltimore [Maryland].  He has exhibits as far away as Japan.  He is well sought after.  He's--I just love to watch his work.  And it's a very--it's a big privilege I have knowing that on important things, I have someone as skilled as he to help reflect the important things that we're reporting on.  It's quite a, quite a large privilege but also a great tool to have.
Speaker 1: Now, who are some of the other writers, notable writers and contributors to the Afro?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we, the--
Speaker 1: Now, I don't want to get you in trouble by leaving anybody out.
Speaker 2: No, I don't want to leave anybody out either but, you know.  I mean, over the years, you know, we've had [James] Jimmy Williams, who was just an absolutely phenomenal editor that passed away several years ago who worked for us in the '90s [1990s] in a second rotation after being city editor for Baltimore [Maryland] in the middle '50s [1950s], I believe, very, very--you know, the old journalists, the old fashioned writers are really hard to replicate, you know.  That's why, really, you know, when Sam Lacy left us, you know, everyone--you just know that, that is a crater that you're never gonna be able to fill.  But as you go through the, the long line of writers, you know, that, that has been through here--Jimmy Williams and George Collins, who's still around in Baltimore.  You know, Bettye Moss, who used to have just an absolute great column called "If You Ask Me" that [HistoryMaker Reverend] Frances Murphy [Draper] has now taken up, and is doing a great job with--Ida Smith, another one of the Murphys sisters that was really great on, not only writing, but on entertainment issues, but just doing all this charitable stuff--Miss Salern [ph.].  Moses Newsome who's still--who wrote, co-wrote Sam's book ['Fighting for Fairness: The Life Story of Hall of Fame Sportswriter Sam Lacy'], and is around today and, and to me, is just probably one of the most untapped treasures.  Moses, to me, is, is just an exciting writer.  I, I mean just, the amount of experience--he covered the Emmett Till case.  He was in Money, Alabama [sic. Mississippi].  He, he can tell you what that's all about.  He wrote for us when we were basically revisiting that entire unfortunate event six months ago.  You know, I mean, you can't beat having the person who was there, who did the initial articles, that--to, to rely on them to really do another good job just to teach the next generation as to what they missed.  He also covered Little Rock [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  I mean, we got pictures of Moses, you know, he was attacked by the crowd.  When the, when the nine walked in, they were looking for somebody black.  And you could see on, 'Eyes on the Prize,' or something else, it was Moses that they were throwing around like a piece, like a ragdoll across the street.  You know, I mean, but it's 'cause--so he's witnessed the good--
Speaker 1: Is he the tall thin man--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they hit in the back of the head with a brick?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  That's Moses Newsome.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, that's the Afro.
Story_ID: 191882
Speaker 1: I mean, they're--then we [Afro-American Newspapers] got Ollie Stewart.  You got Art Carter.  I mean, there's no one that covered the war [World War II, WWII] like Art Carter.  I mean, he covered the Tuskegee Airmen.  He lived with them.  He stayed with them in, in Italy.  I mean, he, he just--then he came back, and became such a great publisher and editor for us in the Washington [D.C.] Afro [Afro-American Newspapers].  It's, it's--Ollie Stewart's writing is, is probably one of the most enjoyable things that I, as publisher, have an opportunity to just go back and revisit what it's like.  And I invite you to do the same.  On the website at afro.com, there's a segment called Black History.  Go in there and there's a segment called, This is Our War.  Look up Ollie Stewart.  He'll tell you what it was like to ride in the Paris [France], down the Champs Elysees, the day the Allies took it over.  He'll tell you what it was like to be kissed by the white women in Paris, and what the hesitations of the black soldiers were like.  It, it--and also, feel the fear of the snipers that were still taking pot shots at them from up in the steeples.  You're not gonna find writing like that anywhere else.  I mean, we at the Afro, probably our greatest treasure is the heritage and the legacy of those enormously talented writers who we've had the privilege working with over the 111 years that we've been around.
Story_ID: 191883
Speaker 1: --It's, it's a sort of a hip hop language, but that phrase "What's Beef?" is English.  It's "What is Beef?"  That is what Biggie [Smalls, The Notorious B.I.G.] was asking and he was giving you, "Beef is--."  And he tells you exactly what it is and what it's not.  And in, in his own hip hop way in the phrases thereafter, he's describing the danger in the street, the fact that even when your mother has got to worry about her safety.  That's a problem.  We are attempting, in our own way, to try and reach out at the same time to reflect every aspect of our society.  We don't do enough to try and attract our younger readers.  When we, we, we ran the story of Ja-, Ja-, was it Ja Rule, and, and 50 Cent's battles.  Their battle, a week ago, I knew nothing about either one.  And then I quickly became familiar with their, their beef.  And the story is exciting to me because it is--it, it's about an issue that practically every teenager and, and young person in this city [Baltimore, Maryland] and this region is very familiar with, and which most people in my generation have not a clue what's going on.  When we [Afro-American Newspapers] published that paper, it moved in ways that we haven't seen the paper move in the hands of a group that we need to be more focused on.  And we're--be gonna, gonna begin to do more things, particularly Internet to be able to attract that group because we want to show them that there is something in this publication for them, and that we can reflect them in a positive way because everything about them doesn't have to be violent, and that more or less is reflective of some of the conversations that I've had over the last year with [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons who has a very similar problem.  He--his audience is hip hop, but as he grows older, he wants to be able to address the more mature groups, the mothers, the fathers, with respect to some of the social issues that are now becoming important to him as an older member of the hip hop.  I mean, Russell is close to forty-five now, so he's, you know, almost over the edge, so he's gotta begin to talk to the older folks and he can't because--
Speaker 2: Because he's gonna be one.
Speaker 1: He's, he's gonna be one, if not, already one.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, you know, we were talking about ways in which, you know, I can make the black newspapers more available to him to get his messages to the groups that we address while he can begin to help us address through our publications, not only Afro, but the other black members, members of the black press--his message so as to attract his market more into our market.  I mean, we want to merge the two markets so we're, once again, where we need to be together.
Story_ID: 191884
Speaker 1: What about the NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association]?  What were some of the issues with NNPA when you were with NNPA?
Speaker 2: NNPA is a very complicated group.  I was the president for two terms.  The biggest issues that I had when I came on board was really trying to get them to become more effectively connected so that they can begin to act as a unit with strength.  They're individually jointed, disjointed, local newspapers, but always talking about basically the same issues in every community.  So that there's a national voice that we needed to assert more effectively.  And it seemed to me that the only way we can do that is by effectively using the Internet as a microphone to project those issues that are consistent throughout all our communities and when necessary, to join up with the other diverse communities such as the Hispanics, and maybe the Asian community, on issues that really are very similar.  So we started to do that very thing with the Hispanics.  We realized that it made more sense to begin to define the editorial issues first before we defined those economic issues that we begin to approach because we still need to develop a level of trust that we still don't have with respect to each other because we still don't know that much about each other.  But the more we begin to learn about each other as a result of the partnerships on joining up on editorial issues like harassment, police harassment, driving while black or driving while Hispanic--it's all the same.  Too many of the black or too many of the brothers, and too many of the Hispanic brothers are being harassed by cops just because of how they look or how they dress or what they're driving.  Those are easy issues that we can join up, and we have joined up, to really project a national outcry.  I mean, there are, are probably a lot of--there are a lot of other issues that, in the future, the NNPA and, and the Hispanic Publication Association [National Association of Hispanic Publications] will be working on, but they are very aware of the importance of continuing building the relationship that was created, but that was one of the first things that I was working on, along with the Internet.
Story_ID: 191885
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I guess my general ones are that we can figure out quickly how to more effectively participate in the mainstream of American society.  I don't think--I was somewhere yesterday, or maybe at lunch, where someone stated that a hundred years ago, we represented the lower 5 percent of the American economy.  And we are still there now, a hundred and some years.  We, we really have not progressed at all.  And it is because of a whole lot of reasons, but we need to become smarter to figure the system out better, so that we can become more effective in its participation.  And that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to expect to continuously segregate ourselves because we won't--and that's another thing that we're gonna have to grapple with because the hood in the '30s [1930s] for a whole lot of positive reasons will never be the same in 2003.  And what's 2003 will never be anything like it's gonna be in thirty, forty, sixty years from now.  And what that means is that our cultural recognition is going to have to be quickly sort of imbedded into our psyche in a far different way--a project such as the one that you have, I think is an excellent way of at least creating a reservoir, an inventory, so that we won't forget from whence we've come, and all the battles that we basically had to go through and endure in order to achieve what small piece of the successful American pie that we currently enjoy.  We, however, are gonna have to do some other imaginative, innovative things in order to make sure that our great-great-grandsons and daughters still feel as strong as we feel about the heritage that they will continue to represent.  And I fear that they may not if we don't find better ways to remind them of their history.
Story_ID: 191886
Speaker 1: At this juncture, you're still fairly young.  What would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: That I continued an enterprise [Afro-American Newspapers] that was valuable to the African American population.  I helped promote the ideals and was, at times, an effective adversary for its issues.  I hope I can be remember as, remembered as someone who kept the torch lit, and maybe made it a bit brighter as a result of some of the things that I did.  I don't expect to be recognized or touted as being the savior, or the second Carl Murphy, or anything like that.  I, I really don't want to be that.  If I can say that this company has become better, and the newspaper has become a better news instrument and respected, then I will have done my job.
Story_ID: 191887
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that you would do differently when you look back on--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, there's a lot I would have probably done different.  I probably wouldn't have wasted my time on some projects.  I probably wouldn't have wasted my time with some individuals.  I, you know, I would have eliminated the waste.  I would have been more daring on other things, but there's not a lot that I would do different.  I mean, I did not, I--my last four years has been utterly consumed by things which did not really directly benefit the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers].  But that was the sacrifice that we had to make for purposes of, hopefully, promoting and bringing progress to the entire African American weekly newspaper group.  I think I did a little of that.  But I learned a lot and, quite frankly, I don't think I would have served the second term because I think--
Speaker 1: With NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association]?
Speaker 2: NNPA.  I was elected my second term, and I was unopposed.  And, and that has never been--I mean, there has never been an election that I know of at NNPA where someone was not opposed--where it wasn't political, where it wasn't, you know, a whole lot of kicking and screaming.  But nobody, no one stood up, you know.  When it come to, came time to vote, everybody stood up and gave me a rare--they gave me a standing ovation.  I should have quit (laughter) right then because when you go into a lame duck situation, which is what the second term, particularly the last year was, you're pretty much limited, and indeed overwhelmed by the politics of those who didn't have the nerve to try to challenge you, but are nevertheless clambering for your seat when your term is up.  The games, the, you know, the ethics--and I guess my major point of all that is that it wasn't until my second term that I didn't realize that before you agree to represent any association as varied as NNPA, where you are supposedly representing two hundred independent African American entrepreneurs who have values and ethics that span the proverbial rainbow, that you better have a clear understanding of the span of that disparity--clearly understanding that there is no way that you can fairly represent that group to any third party honestly because there are people in there who claim to be newspapers that have no business even thinking about being a newspaper.  You are always--you got to always remember that you are no stronger than your weakest link.  And you've got to understand clearly what that weakest link is, and how it can ultimately destroy the whole group.  It was very frustrating, the last year for me to realize that, to realize that what I thought was a noble cause was indeed substantially denigrated by too many, I guess, unnoble [ph.] members who really had not the same values nor any sense of ethics that I thought most people needed to have in order to just call themselves honest business people.  There's a lot of good folks in there and a lot of good businesses, but there are a large number of folks who have no business being in there.  I would, therefore, never do it again.  I'd rather be more selective with who I'm going to be associated with.  I won't continue the membership of NNPA with the--the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] will, but I now know that there are a lot of good members out there that I'm gonna be associating with, but in a different way.

Speaker 1: Having a valuable communications vehicle in the black community is worth something, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, and not--it can tempt those who--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yep.  You have politicians historically vying for the right to get their message across on the black press is something that's really as old as, as the black presses.
Speaker 2: True.  I mean, we're, we are--the politicians are in the black community at least.  They're a necessary evil in many respects, and they also serve a very high necessary good in many respects.  You know, I mean, we [Afro-American Newspapers] choose to lead our readers by recommending who should receive their votes.  You're always gonna piss someone off.  We don't, at this stage of our development, believe that we should ever choose someone simply because they are black 'cause really what we're doing is we're basing our evaluation on what they can do simply for the black community.  And, quite frankly, there are a lot of so-called politicians out there who don't deserve the black vote.  But there are a lot of black folks out there who don't see it that way.  They simply view our mission as being, if the person's black, then you have no choice.  You got to support him or her.  I think that's dangerous.  That's reverse racism, and I think it's fraught with all kinds of not hidden, but obvious, problems with that.

Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you this.  Let me, let's talk about your civic involvement and stuff just for a minute, you--we were talking off camera about your involvement with the colleges and the state colleges in Maryland and--tell us about that.
Speaker 2: I'm the, I'm the chairman of the Maryland Higher Education Commission.  Now, that commission is the oversight commission for all the colleges, universities in this state that receive any money from us.  And that includes independent colleges as well as University of Maryland [University System of Maryland] and those in the system.
Speaker 1: Okay, so not just the state, state colleges as such but also--
Speaker 2: Right, all of them.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And as such, they have got to provide us with--we, we approve their curricula and we approve their budgets.  And then, we also exercise oversight for purposes of reviewing their steps that they are required to take to assist everyone in the state to remove the vestiges of the legislatively-enacted segregation that the state required in pre-Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] times.  My job is to make sure, therefore, that there is a clear sense of direction and a clear commitment to pursuing the direction for all the colleges, universities in the state that have got to be focused on meeting the future needs of the state, commercial business-wise, as well as providing education for its students.  Our objective is to be able to turn--have Maryland turn out baccalaureate and post-graduate students that are well and highly educated and skilled to provide and meet the needs, particularly meeting the needs that the business and the commercial communities of the state will require in the future.  And it is a very interesting job because it's trying to--it's, it's moving a--it's trying to hit a target that's moving at light speed because the future vision of what the state will need changes almost daily based upon what is happening today.  I have a very large staff.  They do a lot of research.  They are very good at what they do.  On the other side, one of the most challenging aspects is really analyzing what these universities and colleges are doing and, in particularly, analyzing the funding patterns, so as to make sure that the disparity that historically has existed between historically black colleges [and universities, HBCUs] and historically white colleges are substantially minimized as we move forward.  They have not been minimized, in my opinion, nearly enough.  There are still colleges here in this state who have been so terribly underfunded who are black, compared to their white counterparts that they continue to embarrass the entire state as far as their underfunding.  The present administration has stated a commitment to begin to address those disparities, but the moment you give something to any black college, you always get the counterpart of the white colleges wanting more.  And it is a battle, a constant battle.

Speaker 1: One last question, it's similar to legacy, but, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I really don't think about being remembered.  It doesn't--it's not important to me.  I mean, I'm just, I would rather that people think of the paper [Afro-American Newspapers], not me.  I don't really want to be thought of because my role is like--I'm, you know, I, I view myself as a little cog in the middle of a big engine that is under a big hood, that is maybe at best described as a control point, that it sort of coordinates the timing of the pistons to make sure that the timing of everything else works together, but you never see me, and I don't need you to see me.  The only time I really want to be visible is really for purposes of promoting with important outside components to enhance the mission and the vision.  And only in connection with those who can help facilitate that, do I hope that I can be remembered for purposes of them wanting to come back and continue the relationship.  But I don't really want them to think of [HistoryMaker John Jacob] Jake Oliver.  I want them to think of, the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] is a good paper.  And I want to do business with them.  And I like the way that they do business, and because they basically provide good client service, they provide a very well-written product, that's well reproduced, that's timely distributed, and effectively distributed to the market that respects them and responds to them.
