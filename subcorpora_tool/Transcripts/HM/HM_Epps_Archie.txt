Speaker 1: Before we get into depth, there are five 'People'-magazine-ish-type questions that we always ask. And they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: They're kind of light-weight questions.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Sir, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I think it's a blue.

Speaker 1: And sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "Is he a sound man?" is my favorite.
Story_ID: 17701
Speaker 1: Sir, I wanna ask you about your family tree--your origins--Can you--How far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Well great grandfather--my--yeah. My grandfather and my other people I'm most aware of is a family from Louisiana.  My father [Archie C. Epps, II ] was from Shreveport [Louisiana], up north; my mother [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps] was from a little town called Mossville, Louisiana; and we lived in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  And I knew my grandfather, my mother's father.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there any stories from the nineteenth century [19th century] or stories from the period of Reconstruction, of slavery that come down through your family?
Speaker 2: No, not that--not that--not that far back. But the two things I remember. One is, I remember seeing my, seeing my great, my great grandmother and she was living in a cabin in Mossville. Her hair went down to the floor. And I asked my grandfather, "Why does she have such long hair?" He explained she was an Indian--Choctaw--Choctaw Indian.  So I'm part Choctaw, which has been very important to me.  And then my grandfather--remember telling me about how he swam the Calcasieu River.  He was a logger. And we had the--they had to follow the logs along the river and he ended having to swim. He had a boat fire--a fire on his boat. And he had to swim across (unclear), incredibly strong swimmer.  My grandfather on my father's side I didn't know. But he was a preacher and also a cotton sampler--you know, a person that went along and tested the cotton.
Speaker 1: Okay to make sure it was quality--?
Speaker 2: Yes--interesting--interesting job.
Speaker 1: Now I read in your biographical sketch that the name Epps comes from a particular plantation in--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes, a plantation of Edwin Epps, up in Shreveport [Louisiana].  And that plantation is described in a book by Solomon Northrop, who was a sla--a black stolen into slavery.
Speaker 1: Now he was a free man here living in--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Free man--that's right. He was captured in Washington [D.C.] and then sold down to Edwin Epps in Louisiana. And he lived on Epps plantation part of the time. And that's where--and our house is still there apparently. Edwin Epps's house is still there. Because I've talked to the people down in Loui--in Louisiana. One of the universities is sponsoring it. And I said, "My brothers and I might want to help you financially." And the president of this university said, "Oh yes." I said, "I'm not sure. I think you might be surprised when you see us. We're black Americans." I'd love to see it. But it's still there. Life was pretty tough on that--well yes, that plantation. 'Cause this Northrop book describes how difficult slavery was. But it also describes the different quality of life for the slaves. There was a musician and he was treated very well. The house slaves, the old Malcolm X division between house slaves and the field slaves is seen pretty clearly in that book.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So we--my dad--I remember when we were--my father [Archie C. Epps, II; Archie C. Epps, the second ] --we were driving up to Shreveport [Louisiana]. I remember my father saying once, "We came from over there," he said. But he didn't say anything else. And I've often wondered 'til I was reading this book up here in the library. And 'boom' there it was. And I felt an immediate connection with slavery.
Speaker 1: There's been a movie made of Solomon Northrop's story called, 'Half Slave, Half Free' starring--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Really?
Speaker 1: Avery Brooks.
Speaker 2: Really? I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.  It's available in video stores.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I'll try to get that.
Speaker 1: 'Half Slave, Half Free'.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's quite historic.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Twelve years'--I think--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) 'Twelve Years A Slave.'
Speaker 1: Yes, 'Twelve Years A Slave'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's right. Yeah but the movie's 'Half Slave, Half Free'. Can--Can you give us your father's full name and tell us a little about him--and his date of birth?
Speaker 2: Yes. I don't have his date of birth. Don't remember it. And he was Archie C. Epps the second, very important second (chuckling) my father's name. And he came from Shreveport and then went up to Southern University [Southern University and A & M College] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana]. Met my mother [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps] there.
Speaker 1: So did he--?
Speaker 2: He played a lot of football for Southern.
Speaker 1: Alright. I just wanna--now did he?--so his family was fairly well to do. They could send him to school or did he have to struggle to go to school or--?
Speaker 2: There were six children in his family and his father sent them all to university.
Speaker 1: And you say his father was a cotton sampler and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And they owned a big--I can remember this: a block in Shreveport  was owned by the Eppses. So they must have done very well.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And then my dad [Archie C. Epps, II] --so my dad went to Southern  and played football, started for Southern as a center. He was called Papa Cow . And he played between the mule brothers , two big guys on the guards and my father, center.
Speaker 1: Was he fairly big?
Speaker 2: My fatherwas large. Yes. He was about three hundred pounds in my childhood. I think he was much smaller then. And he founded an orchestra. Played alto saxophone which I played too. Met my mother  there. And then they settled in--in Lake Charles where he also taught. He taught and he also coached the football team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He always wanted me to play football. But I--I went out, but I didn't make it .
Story_ID: 17702
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us about your mother. What is her full name and--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps.
Speaker 1: Now can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: "R-O-C-H-E-L-L-E, R-I-G-M-A-I-D-E-N" Epps. Rigmaiden is a name of a family who owned slaves in--around Lake Charles [Louisiana]. My mother was from Mossville [Louisiana], which is a small town outside Lake Charles. And she went from there--went to Southern [Southern University and A & M College] too, with her sister. That was that generation that was beginning to send the children to university. Very interesting. She graduated second in her class, very bright, wonderful lady.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what did she do for a living after she--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) She taught school, yeah, sixth grade, I think, and further. You know, that was her career. And then they founded, my parents [Archie C. Epps] founded Epps Cleaners, which was the first business, black business in Lake Charles. And they went into business together. And then she, they also built a cosmopolity--cosmopo-- cosmetology school to teach people to do hair. And she ran that.
Speaker 1: Alright. Now they--Were they affiliated with Madam Walker [Madam C.J. Walker] or any of the other--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No. She just bought her own things. We knew about Madam Walker, 'cause we took a trip up there once. She wanted--they  wanted to show my twin brother [Martin Luther Epps] and myself what it was, what a black business, a big black business was like. And then she, which I'm most proud of, is that there is a library, Epps Library [Epps Memorial Library, Calcasieu Parish Public Library] in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which is named for her. Because she was busy trying to get library privileges for Blacks in that town. And eventually they built a new library in her, named it for her.
Speaker 1: Well that's wonderful.
Speaker 2: And my dad  was--we helped to introduce the voting machine to blacks. I can remember riding with him (unclear) --By the way as he, as he came in started his teaching career in Lake Charles, he wanted, he had the idea of having his own business. So he would deliver ice from 3:00 a.m. to 7:00 every morning to the whites and saved money. And then some friends of his helped him build Epps Cleaners. They built the building themselves, a stone building. And my mother [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps] to get ready for that went to work for a white cleaners to learn how to take stains out of clothes, she and my cousin before we opened our business. And so  when we opened our business, we could do that work too.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's interesting.
Speaker 2: They  were an interesting pair of people building that, that, those institutions. So we, you know, my twin brother --we grew up in a great household, I think.
Story_ID: 17703
Speaker 1: How many of you were living in the household at that time?
Speaker 2: Well there were four, there were four, four children--two, yeah four boys and my grandfather.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Who was, had a business nearby. He had a barbershop.
Speaker 1: Now this is your mother's father?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My mother's father. He lived with us in the front room.
Speaker 1: Great. Okay now can you--So you have a twin brother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And his name is--?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther Epps, "M-A-R-T-I-N L-U-T-H-E-R" Epps.
Speaker 1: Alright. And do you have another brother as well?
Speaker 2: I have a brother, the great George, Heibert George Epps, "H-E-I-B-E-R-T" George "G-E-O-R-G-E." And he's a space, he'a mathematician at the space center in Houston, Houston, and also a computer specialist.
Speaker 1: And is he an older brother? Or--?
Speaker 2: He's seven, all of us are seven years apart. And George is fourteen--seven years younger than my [twin] brother and myself. And then I had a young, younger brother, Darryl, who's since died early of a blood clot; the greatest tragedy in my life. So--and he went--he came up here actually to go to school at Milton Academy [Milton, Massachusetts]. 'Cause when I got up to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], I was trying to figure out what I can do to help my brothers. So (unclear) cam and got into a good private school up here and came up and finished and had decided to go back to the South. It's where he died.
Speaker 1: How old was he when he died?
Speaker 2: Thirty--no, younger. Yeah, about, in his thirties. 'Cause he had been at the university for a while, at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] and then unfortunately this tragedy happened.
Story_ID: 17704
Speaker 1: Can you reflect back on your early childhood and give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: All right. Well the strongest sight in--you have in Louisiana is Spanish moss hanging everywhere. And it's very strong. And the other, for me, was food: the gumbo, the fried catfish. And I loved that. Well I had to be careful. I had a tendency to put on weight, even in those years. And the flowers--well the great flowers. Around our house we had lots of azaleas. And we had hummingbirds all the time who were coming to get--I don't know if you can get nectar from azaleas. But they were coming around our house getting nectar all the time. And fireflies at night which would light up the sky and 'mosquito hawks,' which I was an ace at catching, so--
Speaker 1: What's a mosquito hawk? What is that?
Speaker 2: Well it has a (unclear), their heads are round. They have a very transparent wings. They're shaped like a plane. But--and they flit about and they're all over the place.
Speaker 1: Okay. And they actually go after mosquitoes? Or do we know?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't know. I think so. I think so.
Speaker 1: Alright. Okay. What kind of little boy were you when you were little? What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well now there're two parts to that. I can tell you what I remember . I'm not sure it tells the whole story. But for some reason fighting seems to be the thing I  remember a lot. I remember visiting my mother's [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps] godmother out in the country, Aunt Moran. And we were friends with some white boys out there. And we used to go hunting for crayfish mounds. You know crayfish make little, like pyramids. And one of the boys kicked one over and I ran him home--threw--with rocks, throwing rocks at him. And I thought that might create problems for my mother's family. So I went home to tell them. They might have a visit from his father and, you know, the redneck, in a red truck. And that's one of the things I remember from that conversation was they said nothing to me. No response at all. And I never heard anything about that incident. And much later when my twin brother and I were coming home for Christmas, taking a train from New Orleans, we were--I was at Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] from '54 [1954] to '58 [1958]. So it was in that period. We decided to sit in the front of the train from New Orleans. And excuse me, the conductor tried to get us to move. Refused to move--We refused to move. And as I drew--drew--came into Lake Charles, I looked out on the train station and I saw the police cars. And then we came out. I didn't see my parents. But I saw one of the black sheriffs come over. And he said, "Come and follow--Come and follow me." And he took us home. Somebody from the station must have called about these black guys on this--refusing to move. This is the beginning of the civil rights period. 'Cause [Martin Luther ] King  [Jr.] is in Montgomery [Alabama] in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay. I wanted to--I didn't wanna get that far yet.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh sorry--But my par--Let me finish this point.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: My parents--I went in and they didn't say anything. Which is again this theme of--I think in my family it was letting you figure things out yourself. Make your own decisions and live with the consequences. But, of course, we were protected. Because my--my father [Archie C. Epps II] had helped to elect the sheriff and he obviously was helping us by not putting us in jail.
Speaker 1: So when you were coming up in Lake Charles [Louisiana], black people could vote?
Speaker 2: Began to vote. Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's unusual for that part of the country. Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is. And then when they introduced the voting machines, the question was whether they could use the voting machines. And my dad saw that they could. Got his ice truck, put the machines in the back and came to a hall in our area of the town and taught people to vote.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now anything else about your younger life as a child, you know? Did you like to read when you were little? (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, I like to remember that I liked to read. We had a basketball court in our backyard and all the kids would come over to play. And I remember sitting in the window watching them play while I was reading (laughing). That's the story I used to tell. I wasn't that good in basketball.
Story_ID: 17705
Speaker 1: My schooling was important. We went to Catholic school, although we were protestants. And the Mother Superior said, "We have two Protestant boys with us today, entering the school. And although they won't be able to go to heaven, we'll try to give them a good education."
Speaker 2: Okay. So what was the name of your school?
Speaker 1: Sacred Heart.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was great. And then we had to leave that school.
Speaker 2: Was it an all black Catholic school? Or--?
Speaker 1: Yes. But we were tun--taught by whites--nuns from up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Sisters of the (unclear) la Union sacre coeur, Sisters of the Sacred Heart. And they taught my wife in England--the same order was teaching my wife in England, which I thought was poetic (chuckling).
Speaker 2: And that is interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--well--how did you do in grade school? Did you do well?
Speaker 1: I was average. Except when I got to high school. I was pushing ahead. I became ambitious. I wanted to do well. I wanted to go to Colon--to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio], but my scores weren't good enough.
Speaker 2: Now let me linger on high school for a moment.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 1: I went to Sacred Heart High School for three years.
Speaker 2: Alright. And what were your favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 1: I think English, Latin--we had to take Latin in the early years, and the extra-curricular activities were important. Because we had musicals, 'The Mikado' and those things.
Speaker 2: And you were playing the saxophone?
Speaker 1: No, I was singing then. And then we had to leave Lake Char--we had to leave Sacred Heart, because my brother got into trouble. My dear twin brother who--a nun slapped him because he said something. And he slapped her back.
Speaker 2: Oh?
Speaker 1: So my mother  [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps] came to my bed once (unclear) morning and said, "You all have to leave Sacred Heart and go to public school." And I said, "I'm not leaving. That's not my responsibility, you know, I'm doing well." You know, and at Sacred Heart you wore suits and ties. That's (unclear). And we thought we were better than the kids at the public schools. Also there was lots of fighting at the public schools. So I was, you know, very snooty. And I said, "No, I'm not changing." They made me change. And it turns out I had a great time; my life opened up. I represented our school in mathematics and chemistry at the state level. Got into plays and musicals and all kinds of things. It was a good, important change.
Speaker 2: So what was the name of the public school?
Speaker 1: W. O. Boston High School [William Oscar Boston High School, now Calcasieu Parish School Board's Curriculum & Training Center, Lake Charles, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: W. O. Boston. Okay. Who was W. O. Boston? Do you know?
Speaker 1: I don't remember. It was for blacks though. It must have been a black man and I think in our town.
Speaker 2: Alright. Okay.
Speaker 1: Excuse me I just have this itch. (rubs eyelid)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But one thing I remember about W. O. Boston besides, you know, I had good luck in drama and singing. I was singing and I almost got recruited by the Xavier University opera department [Xavier University, New Orleans, Louisiana]. But in W. O. Boston High School, we had the chemistry things from the white high school. And that is all we had. We could make stink bombs and those things. We had no proper chemistry equipment. We did--so that was--that always--well, it wasn't so bad thing, 'cause I'm getting ahead of our story. But my college was a big step up in terms of, you know, the opportunities I had.
Speaker 2: Okay. So when you graduated were you at the top of your class? Or near the top--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) At W. O. Boston, no. I was near the top, but I wasn't at the top.
Speaker 2: I see.
Story_ID: 17706
Speaker 1: I was at the top at Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I graduated  third in my class.
Speaker 2: Alright. Now so did you--You said you wanted to go to Oberlin.
Speaker 1: Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio]. Yes.
Speaker 2: When you--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I didn't know anything about Oberlin, but it was a good school, excellent school. But, I didn't get in. My scores weren't high enough.
Speaker 2: In high school did you have any--were there any particular teachers that you would consider a mentor to you, that, you know, that helped you?
Speaker 1: Yes, my math teacher. I can't remember his name. He was very good. That's one of the things you got at the high school level. The teacher--I picked up a couple of mentors in music and mathematics.  (unclear) those two things.
Speaker 2: Alright. Well tell us about college.
Speaker 1: Yes. I went--.
Speaker 2: How did you get to Talladega from, I mean, how was that chosen?
Speaker 1: That was a--Well there was a--young lady in our town who went, who was at Talladega  at the time. And my mother  [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps] was very impressed with her. And I didn't want to go to the same school that my twin brother [Martin Luther Epps] went to. So we decided to go to different schools.
Speaker 2: So he went to Fisk?
Speaker 1: He went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]. Very good, I went to Talladega.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: It was a good school.
Speaker 2: Alright. Tell us about it. Now what kind of school is Talladega and where is it?
Speaker 1: It's in Talladega, Alabama. It's a Congregational school. It was one of the schools established by the Freedman's Bureau [United States Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands] at the end of slavery. The education of freed blacks. But it was Talladega , LeMoyne [College], Dillard [University] and there were a couple of other colleges that fit into that.
Speaker 2: I think Lincoln. Wasn't Lincoln one?
Speaker 1: Lincoln perhaps, yes. And we--small college about 300  people and very good education. It's something I needed. It's the transition period I needed, given what I was gonna try to do later. And the basic (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Now Talladega  has a New England connection with the Congregational Church?
Speaker 1: Definitely. And all--many of our teachers were single ladies from New England on the--you know, carrying out their mission. And the buildings were brick. They remind me of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] very much and the whole culture. And you, you know, you were supposed to have strong ethics and work hard. I particularly had a Miss Montgomery, who taught me freshman English. And I didn't realize she somehow took a special interest, and she said, "I want to see you every Saturday morning at eight o'clock," I said, "Well Miss Montgomery, people are sleeping Saturday morn--." But I got over Swayne Hall. And she taught me. She said, "I want you to walk with your back straight up, your shoulders pulled back, because you're slouching and you'll never get anywhere that way. And I wanna work on your spelling. You're a poor speller." So I was there slugging it out with Miss Montgomery. And I can remember going back to Talladega  after I had been up at Harvard  for a while and was assistant conductor of the Harvard Glee Club. And we were taking a tour of the South. And we went to Talladega  to present a concert. And I was able to conduct some of that concert for Miss Montgomery and also my professor, Frank Harrison. And I was able to invite Frank Harrison up to Boston  to stay with me when I was at Harvard . Those were people--those connections were very important.
Story_ID: 17707
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of your activities in Talladega?
Speaker 2: Yes. The main one in Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama] was the choir, the Talladega choir, under professor Frank Harrison. I sang tenor--first tenor. I wasn't the best tenor. A friend of mine called 'Daddy Cool' was the best tenor. But I took voice lessons from professor Harrison, trying to improve myself, trying to get that solo. I was impossibly ambitious now that I look back upon it.
Speaker 1: And did you have a nickname at all? You--you--you--?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't remember. My wife--Somebody came and visit me and told my wife my nickname (laughs). Yeah. It was 'Lochinvar, God's gift to women,' or something (laughs) terrible. And then I was in a fraternity, the Alphas.
Speaker 1: Alpha Phi Alpha.
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha [Fraternity] and we did drama. There's a big drama competition, 'Jabberwocky', put on by the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and I used to do our plays and we won a couple of those.
Speaker 1: So you directed the plays then?
Speaker 2: I wrote them.
Speaker 1: Wrote them?
Speaker 2: Wrote them, yeah. I wrote the plays. I wrote original plays. I'm trying to find them actually now.
Speaker 1: What were they about? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah. One was about John Brown and it started with lights out in the theater, a prologue by a man in gold, covered in gold, which I don't think was very safe. And then, the lights came up. There was a guillotine that we constructed and it came down and cut off his head.
Speaker 1: The narrator's head?
Speaker 2: Yes. But it was a--we had a trick where you--he would hide behind the guillotine and a false head would roll down towards the audience. But that was pretty, pretty dramatic stuff.
Speaker 1: That is dramatic.
Speaker 2: and then we--.
Speaker 1: And that was about John Brown?
Speaker 2: Yes, (Laughs) creativity. But we did a play about a Japanese--based on a Japanese no play, which I wrote. And it was a separate language. I created a language on the theory that you could communicate with people by gestures. You didn't have to understand what they were saying. And then there was a mu--the other one was a musical. I don't remember what that was about . It was probably best forgotten (laughing). But I had a great time with that at Talladega. And then my main other study work was amid the civil rights thing. So that's the perio--so [Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] '54, '55 [1954, 1955] movement, we go to visit him at Dexter Church [Dexter Avenue Baptist Church  Montgomery, Alabama] and hear him preach. And we hear the great William Holmes Borders. All the great preachers who I remember, you know, who had warmed us up, the crowd up before King came out.  Borders preached about the great baseball game where somebody was on---Charity was on first, Faith was on second, Hope was on third and the batter was the Devil, and the pitcher was Almighty God. Church was in an uproar. And then God throws the Devil out, you know, strike one, strike two, strike three. And then King comes on, very small elegant man. He would come over to Talladega  to talk at our chapel talks too. And I can remember it was just, you know, it was a great privilege being part of that early phase of the movement. My teacher was John Bross, white man, who was very interested in civil rights; we went over with him. And then our civil rights adventures at Talladega  was that apparently some whites was--were gonna come and throw straw, hay on the campus. And the guys organized a watch group who went down to the front of the campus in the big ditch to keep a watch, and one of our guys went down to the town. One of our guys who was very white looking went down to find out when they were gonna come. So we were ready for them with some stones. And then we got called in by the president of the college.
Speaker 1: Now did they show up? Did the people show--did they show up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were met with stones?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: See this fighting and all. And then we--the president called us in and said, "I'm very sorry you can't do that, you know. We'll take care of things." So that was a--that was a very--it wasn't difficult. I mean I wasn't afraid. It was just part of the challenge.
Story_ID: 17708
Speaker 1: We talked before we started running tape about the tenuous position of black colleges in the South.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Why they're allowed to survive or what protects them, in a sense. And Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama] is associated with the Congregational Church--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And strong support from the Northeast.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And so that presence in the South sort of--
Speaker 2: And also there were southerners on our board, progressive southerners who lived nearby Anderson, Alabama I remember and who supported financially. So I think many of those colleges have that kind of connection, those kind of alliances.
Speaker 1: It makes a lot more complicated view--.
Speaker 2: Oh yes. I don't think the view of blacks and whites in the South is a simple one--all bad, all good. It's a big mixture. And I hope somebody will write that history because in my experience, of course, you know, we had maybe half our faculty was white, at Talladega. So it's a complex history. Then you add to that the miscegenation, the race mixing that was going on, officially and unofficially. I remember my mother [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps]--I married an English girl. And my--took--I wanted to take her down to my, to see my mother in Lake Charles [Louisiana]. And my mo--I said to my mother, "Is there going to be any trouble?" My mother said to my wife, "Just keep your mouth closed, honey, and nothing  will happen. No one will be able to tell." 'Cause, 'cause in Louisiana there're a lot of peo--blacks are of many colors.
Speaker 1: That's true. There're many black women that are--that look like they're white.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 17709
Speaker 1: Is there anything else eventful about your college career at Talladega--?
Speaker 2: Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama], it was so--it was very hard. I mean the working, the academic work, was hard, but I had a wonderful sense of discipline. I could sleep for ten minutes after lunch in my room and get up, wake up, automatically. So I could study. I remember that. And I always remember those Saturday mornings with Miss Montgomery. And I had some very able classmates. So being third in the class was not easy. I had a lot of competitors, a lot of bright people. And Talladega  was one of the schools that sent, you know, very high proportion of its graduates to professional schools.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: It is still going down there.
Speaker 1: Are any of your classmates famous now or--?
Speaker 2: Well I'm sure (laughs). But one of them was Richard English [Richard Allyn English]. He was a professor of education at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]. And three of my classmates have written a book on friendship, Otis Holloway and Marilyn Hill and one other; so they're doing well. And they've been--one of my classmates was president of Talladega  very recently.
Speaker 1: Alright. So what did you major in at Talladega?
Speaker 2: I majored in psychology and studied a lot of religion. Because my thesis down there was--I did a senior thesis in religion and went for honors. And in Talladega the honors, I can't remember but you had to pass so many of your exams, I don't know, fourteen hours of exams with A--I don't think you could have a C. And then you wrote a thesis and then there was an oral examination. And the oral examine at those six colleges was chaired by a white from the North, from the American Board of Home Missions. So my examination took place in my professor's office and I answered their questions. And I noticed at the end, I guess--I was asked to leave the room and then came back in shortly. And they said, "Well, you've done very well and we would--we've been thinking of your going to Harvard  or Yale ." And I said, "Well where are they?" So we got a map out (laugh). I said, "I don't know. I have to talk to my mother." My father [Archie C. Epps, II;] had died by (unclear) in my sophomore year of a blood clot. So my mother [Rochelle Rigmaiden Epps] said, "Yes, if they can provide a scholarship for you." So the American Board of Home Missions Congregationalists provided scholarships all through my years at Harvard Divinity School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And the Divinity School itself provided scholarships. And--but when I arrived at Harvard I arrived with two suitcases: one with my clothes and the other with canned goods. And my mother said, "You have to provide--make your own lunch, until you can find a job." And so I was up there in Andover Hall opening my cans (unclear). But I found a job in the library. And she provided the other support. My dad had died. But she was still running the business, Epps Cleaners and beauty school and providing support. And I supported the rest of it.
Story_ID: 17710
Speaker 1: What did you major in at Harvard?
Speaker 2: I came to the theology school [Harvard Divinity School at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well what was your area of concentration in theology school? I mean what--?
Speaker 2: Well, you have to cover certain areas and you had to offer two languages. I offered Greek and French to try to pass examinations. And then you would study a course in the New Testament, Old Testament, the patristic fathers, theory of the church, which is--I got especially interested in the early church. And I remember tho--those--coming down--those exams coming down the stairs at Andover Hall and my legs were so weak that I could barely get down, and I had to hold on to the railings. And I did well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what was your thesis about?
Speaker 2: I--something on theology.
Speaker 1: That's broad. (laughing)
Speaker 2: Very broad yes, something on Jesus perhaps--I don't remember. This is a thesis--yeah--there was a thesis in college, and just a big paper at divinity school .
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I haven't seen my thesis from college. I wonder what it's about. I think that was about the narratives of Jesus.
Speaker 1: Okay the Apocrypha or the--?
Speaker 2: About the Apocrypha, the main gospels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 17711
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors at theological school?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely yes. The one thing about--I had professor Robert Bellah "B-E-L-L-A-H" [Robert Neelly Bellah] who was a specialist on the sociology of religion, especially of Islam. And I did well in his course and became his teaching assistant. After I graduated from divinity school and was starting a graduate degree, which I didn't finish by the way. But I worked for professor Bellah as a teaching assistant in Harvard Yard [Harvard College in Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] course on sociology of the Middle East and one on Islamic institutions.
Speaker 1: Now that should have been fascinating in those days.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I wasn't a Black Muslim. I just got interested in classical Islam.
Speaker 1: Right. Now, I may be hesitant to say this, but in those days very few black people knew that much about Islam. In fact, I think very few Americans knew much about Islam at all.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And even the Black Muslims were sort of lacking in their knowledge of Islam--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: When they started. And so I think they were just beginning to come to grips with traditional Islam.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm. (coughs)
Speaker 1: (break in tape) Discussions with Black Muslims about the religion? Or--?
Speaker 2: I re--I remember our family being visited by a Pakistani Muslim in Lake Charles, Louisiana, many years ago. And I often wondered, "What is this all about?" And then when I was up here, yes, of course, I knew the black Muslims. And my friends--I had friends there. And then met the Black Muslims beginning in '61 [1961], when Malcolm [Malcolm X] came to speak at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Sanders Theater. And I couldn't believe him. He was amazing. I had met him at a lunch in Boston. A friend of mine was editing his--the book, 'The Black Muslims in America,' and then Malcolm came to lunch. And--.
Speaker 1: Was that C. Eric Lincoln?
Speaker 2: That's right. (unclear) I was pouring cream in my coffee and Malcolm said, "You don't wanna mix those two things." I said, "What are you talking about?" And he said--I said, "Why are you so angry?" He said, "If you're asleep and somebody--you find somebody putting his hand in your pocket to steal everything you have and you wake up, what are you going to say? Are you going to say, 'Could you please remove your hand from my pocket?' Or are you gonna say, Get your hand out of my pocket"? He said, "The black man's got to wake up, angry." Then I went to that speech at Harvard  when Walter [C.] Carrington spoke, debated Malcolm X. That was the beginning, the early stages of Malcolm's (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now okay. So you met him [Malcolm X] in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: I don't think I met him that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I met him  at that lunch, in Boston , right before. And then when he left the Nation of Islam I called him and said, "Would you like to come to Harvard to present your new position?" I was then a tutor at Leverett House
Speaker 1: Now was this before or after you had that debate with him [Malcolm X]?
Speaker 2: That was before.
Speaker 1: Before, okay; so this is how it developed?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And he came up--and he came and spoke at Leverett House at my house where I was a tutor and debated the great professor Martin Kilson and professor James Q. Wilson. And we had the speech in the dinning hall at Leverett [House], and that was full. And we had people out in the street. I think there were 2,000  people that night. And we had to broadcast it out in the streets--Mill Street at Leverett. And Malcolm was very, very good, I mean he was--he said--he had--they had just escaped an assassination attempt in the tunnel." And he had six big guys with him; so he was, you know, heavily protected. But anyway we, you know, became friends--
Speaker 1: Now this is in 1964? Or when he left the Nation was '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then he came back to Harvard after he had gone on the hadj to Mecca [Saudi Arabia]. He came back and I debated him that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was this in '65 [1965] then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And I said--we went to dinner at the [Harvard] Faculty Club. And I said, "Now Malcolm , I have an approach to this debate. You say what you have to say. And then I'll say what I have to say and the debate will come in the question period." But I was not going to debate Malcolm X directly. He was too good. But I do remember walking with him across Harvard Yard, past Widener Library . And he said, "I would like to read every book in that library," which I used to tell black kids about every time people seemed to get off focus in their studies in the college.
Story_ID: 17712
Speaker 1: Malcolm X was a, what you would call a study man, was he not?
Speaker 2: He was an intellectual, by which I mean, in his case, he was a lot of things: he was an activist, he was a politician, he was a religious leader, nut he was mo--fundamentally an intellectual, somebody who constantly searches for the truth and was willing to tell it. And, of course, the material he was using was the black experience, which is why I thought he was important to blacks for the country because he, he could tell the country what the situation was in actuality. I had worked with King [Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know, like everybody else. And actually had done the march on Wa--lead the March on Washington from Boston . But Malcolm was the man we needed to understand; so I did that book on 'The speeches of Malcolm X at Harvard' with a introduction called 'The Paradoxes of Malcolm X' looking at his language. (how does it work, what does it say?) and compared it to the [William] Shakespeare political plays, the language in the Shakespeare political plays. And why did I do that? Because it was important; it was of that importance. And I try--I wanted to show people that--I never quite--that case wasn't really fully accepted, I think. It's hard to make, but it's a very interesting book.
Speaker 1: Now when did you write your book?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967]. So that's two years after that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And it became--it's a new edition out in the '90s [1990s]. But I remember going to a conference I think it was in Nashville, Tennessee, conference of black scholars and read from that chapter from that book and got booed out of the room. But saying, "What are you using--why are you using white material to discuss our condition?" And I said, "I'm afraid I must be in the wrong place. That's what I'm doing." I didn't have--I entered that work without a particular view. I wanted to find what I could discover. And I think that the Malcolm--if you look at the Malcolm X--or if you'd read my book, perhaps, you will find powerful language in Malcolm X. And he, of course, uses the Hamlet material. He compares himself to Hamlet. And you could see because Hamlet is a moralist, he's an idealist, he's a man of action. And the Malcolm X material falls that way. But also if you look at--it's about--it's--the language was, you know, "What stands for the thunder?" Malcolm says. His language is very lyrical and poetic. And also he paints the picture of a bestiary where there are animals that stand for certain things. There's a wolf; there're snakes. And I don't know where that all came from. You can trace some of the--the historian  John Henrik Clark is the source of a lot of Henry--Malcolm's stuff, but there's a big--there's a poetic, powerful imagination working there. So he would have been very important. He was turning towards integration. Not completely. People get--take that too far. But if he'd lived longer he could have been powerful liaison between the races.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did Malcolm talk about his relationship to Elijah Muhammad with you or talk about why he left the--?
Speaker 2: No, he did not. He was very--I think I may have asked him about it. He's a very incredible man. I kept up with the literature. There's a lot out there on Malcolm X. And the Spike Lee film. When Spike was shooting his films, Spike [Lee] was on the Harvard faculty at the time. And I thought he might use the speeches from my book. While I was concerned that Harvard would be too snooty and not agree to let the shooting take place here. I was right.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: And Harvard has a rule that you can't shoot a film here unless the event actually happened here. So we pulled my book out, and we said, "Yes, here is the record." But I think that we may have gotten a "yes," but then when Spike had to negotiate with lower bureaucrats, somehow the price got very high. And so on. And I would have been very happy to have that film shot here. That debate sequence. Also I had to correct some of the--Spike's manuscript. Because he, you know, he had to invent certain things which was fine. But, of course, we had the record here. But it was an interesting phase. And the Black Muslims were all around Cambridge all the time. They had a big influence on the student--black student movement at the time. They couldn't be members. They came to the meetings.
Speaker 1: Oh the members of the Nation of Islam?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Alright. Now Minister Farrakhan [Louis Farrakhan] was--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Headquartered in Boston for a while. Did you have any contact with him?
Speaker 2: I met him  that's all. Malcolm introduced me to him. But no, otherwise. But he's--I've been following his career too.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And you mentioned John Henrik Clarke, for a moment--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know him fairly well?
Speaker 2: No. But as--If you read the Malcolm X material, you find reference to John Henrik Clarke, giving him--providing him with a tutorial on black history. And if you look at 'Freedom Ways' where John Henrik Clarke appears, it's all there.
Speaker 1: I see. Okay. Now, how was your book received basically? Was it--?
Speaker 2: It sold reasonably well. About five thousand [5,000] copies. I sent my wife [Valerie Epps] to law school on the proceeds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had to share some of those second edition with the family--Malcolm X's family, 'cause the copyright's --copyright is in--to Mrs. [Betty] Shabazz . But it did well, I think. It's--it hasn't gotten the intellectual recognition. There was a review in the 'New York Times' which wasn't very good. But it's--some day it'll get rediscovered I think, hope.
Speaker 1: I think you might be right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you got to be ready to listen a complex tale. It's not rhetoric. It's just not proselytizing about Malcolm X. It's not total adoration. It's a critical reading of Malcolm X, which he would appreciate--would have appreciated.
Story_ID: 17713
Speaker 1: Now we're at nineteen--in the late '60's [1960s] now.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We're in the early '60s [1960s]. Yeah. I came--so after--after--after [Harvard] Divinity School, I went to the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to work with my professor [Robert Neelly] Bellah. And then was called one day and asked to see the Dean of Harvard College, somebody called John Monroe, John Usher Monroe, who would later resign from Harvard to work at Miles College, in Birmingham [Alabama]. And then at Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi]. He died just about a year ago. And John said, "How would you like to come and work for us?" And I said, "What do you do?" So I used to meet him about once a month to talk about working in the dean's office. And he sent me to work at the career office to start in the bureaucracy further out. And I went to talk about that. And the guy said, "You're a very nice young man. But I don't think the white students would accept advice from you." So I went back to John Monroe and I said, "You won't believe what this man said to me." And John said, "Well if it's going to be like that, you better come and work directly with me." So he offered me the job of assistant dean of Harvard College. Now you should wait ten years out in the hustings before you get a shot at that. But John brought me right in, and that's how I started.
Speaker 1: Wow! That's something else. A big jump.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Big jump.
Speaker 1: Had there ever been any black person in the administration of Harvard at all?
Speaker 2: No, I was the first. [Martin] Kilson was the first in the faculty. I was the first.
Story_ID: 17714
Speaker 1: How many--You said, "There were seven now--."
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) When I came in '58 [1958], there were seven black students in graduate schools. That would have been law, theology, business and so--and thirty in the college. So the numbers were small. And now there're 2,000 blacks at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. My philosophy was always once you climb the ladder yourself, you have to look back and see who you can help come up. I wasn't the only one, of course. The great David [L.] Evans . And there was an effort here. And also with [Martin] Kilson and I used to talk about it. And once we went to see the admissions people and say--because I thought they were making poor admits--there were stronger people, and said, "What's the trouble? You don't--do you know what to look for?" You look at what people do in the summers. Who are doing those--those students who are doing those extra things. You look at schools that produce." And Harvard does a lot of interviewing. "So you--this is what--these are the questions you ask--should ask." So those--it added. I just think it's been a great tribute to Kilson and others. Kilson was the great standard bearer here. Saying, "Don't complain, do your work." And we were gonna make an ef--a difference at Harvard and not in the nation. No one would accept national boards in those things; just do the work here; create the environment here that will make a difference. And that's our contribution to the race.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you became Dean of Students in 1970 .
Speaker 2: Nineteen-Seventy [1970]. So I served as assistant dean from '63 to '70 [1963 to 1973]. And Harvard had been through the student rebellion revolution. And one Friday I was called into the dean's office, and he said, "We're thinking of appointing a new dean of students. And here are five names. We'd like to know your view of them--these people." And I said, "I'm surprised you haven't thought of me. I'm your man really for the following reasons:  I've worked hard. I've been tested. I'm articulate. I love the place."  And the next Monday morning, I came--I had resigned--written a letter of resignation and my wife had not sent it. I came in on Monday morning. He said, "We think you're right." So I started at thirty-two as dean of students. A very young appointment--
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: I think I've acquitted myself reasonably well.
Speaker 1: Yes. Well that's quite a story. They expected you to help choose one.
Speaker 2: (laughing) Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: When you're an assistant.
Speaker 2: I'm your man. (unclear) "And why haven't you thought--?" I was really angry. And I actually don't remember everything I said in that interview.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughing).
Speaker 1: Now what was your methodology in terms of increasing the black students enrolled?
Speaker 2: Oh, my--I think my impact was secondary. I was on the admissions committee, but my friend David Evans was the main operational man.
Speaker 1: Now this is the noted David Evans that went on the excursion to Surinam.
Speaker 2: Yes. With the great Dr. Allen Counter . Two men who've contributed a lot to Harvard , made a big difference. There (unclear) really team here. But we were all devoted to the notion of, "Your job you did was mainline." We didn't get--asked for appointments as black this or that. And whenever I--people would call me from other universities saying, "Well how did you get to be dean of students?" I said, "Well It doesn't have to do with the race." Well it may have. I'm sure, you know, the whites thinking about bringing me in thought I might help with that issue. And then for a minute--for a long time I wasn't doing anything. I was Dean of Students, I was interested. My first job was to open up conversations with the left in college campus, because we had lots of riots and rebellions.
Story_ID: 17715
Speaker 1: There's a story I heard from a friend of yours about the students carrying you out of a building or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah. They took all the deans out--threw all the deans out.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That was during the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: University Hall. April 9th, 1969 . Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell us about that day. What happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had been--You know, we had a lot of protests starting. And then one day they obviously decided to take over University Hall  And we were having our morning coffee and cookies in the dean's office. And then we heard this rattling of chains. And they were going to lock--they ended up locking the doors from the inside. They took us out, pushed us out and then took over--there were 300 [three hundred] of them took over the building. And from that period, for about fifteen years , there was a struggle here. And I was in the middle of it. I helped to discipline the 300 students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Helping professor Archibald Cox present the cases.
Speaker 1: Archibald Cox. He was the--He was the Watergate  prosecutor that was dismissed by [President Richard M.] Nixon--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. I knew when Nixon came up against professor Cox, I said, "I think you've bit off more than you can chew (chuckling)." BecauseCox is a total stickler for--for--for principle. But Cox presented those cases. I was with him. There were threeof us presenting and I was doing a lot of the detailed things. And we helped to manage the crisis at Harvard.
Speaker 1: Now what happened to the 300  students? I mean now what kind of discipline were they subjected to?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We--Some were dismissed or fired from Harvard. Some were placed on probation and some were warned, depending on what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was very hot on campus, as you can image.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember, one day, going into my office and getting a letter from the Selective Service Board in Lake Charles, Louisiana, said--saying, "You have been reclassified 1-A ." And I said, "But, I've been doing my part up here (chuckling)." But then [President Lyndon B.] Johnson, you know, resigned, and the war was soon over. So pressure was off. So I did that work. Physically it was difficult, I think too 'cause you're under a lot of pressure, a lot of stress. And also the black students didn't particularly like--I was telling you I was--I didn't do much for black affairs. I mean there were lots of things you could have done symbolically, you know: support a third world center, use words to curse the whites or something. I didn't do any of that. So they wondered what my value was, I'm sure. And I was placed on trial by the blacks at Harvard at a trial at the Harvard Law School [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Oh you were! Did you show up for your trial?
Speaker 2: No. But I was served with a warrant by the--a sheriff appointed by them. And I said, "Get out of my office. I'm not coming to any trial." I became friends with that young man. But we--.
Speaker 1: With the sheriff or? Or the--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, the young man who came to arrest me. But you know, there was--I--I--I--My fundamental philosophy was to be a race man, that is to be interested in the race (unclear) but not to be racialist. And not to assume that whites did anything necessarily were bad. 'Cause the whole success of the admissions effort at Harvard  was because of the admissions committee. This was predominately white, of course. And those decent people were making those progressive decisions and also learned to keep the standards high when you're admitting blacks. Not to do--they're not doing us any favor if people can't do the work.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did tension ever lessen, you know, between the black students and yourself? Or--?  Oh, yes, gradually over time. And I think the one thing I said to them--find myself saying to them recently, "You don't use me as much as you can. I know how the place works." I mean, I would get black students in, of course, as part of my work. But I'm happy to tell you that on April the 26th the Harvard Kuumba Singers , which is our gospel spiritual group, will name the spring concert forever in my honor. And I couldn't be happier that this, you know--there is some recognition of my work for them.
Story_ID: 17716
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Now I didn't--I didn't ask you about this at the time. But I just wanted to know--this is kind of a backtracking thing, How did you feel about the death of Malcolm X when Malcolm X was--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah. Malcolm X--his death was devastating for me in a personal way. I don't know why, but it was. I mean, the feeling. Partly-- not many people were grieving over him. I felt a sense of loneliness. I was singing in a concert down in Boston. I remember--was taking the train, saw his picture. You know that picture on the front --of his being wheeled to the hospital. I saw that. There was a spirit--when I published that book on Malcolm X, I was considered to be taking a big risk. The white opinion was against Malcolm X; they were frightened of Malcolm X. And my friends said, "Well, you're trying to be a member of the establishment. Why should you take a risk?" And I said, "Well, my job as an academic and as an Islamist is to try to help America understand--black America as well as white America--this particular person." And I was very impressed with his work.
Story_ID: 17717
Speaker 1: One thing I didn't--I didn't touch on too was I think you were the Boston [Massachusetts] area coordinator for the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) For the March on Washington. Correct.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was an Assistant Dean at Harvard [College, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at the time. And my friend, Tom, was working at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here. And Tom said, "Archie, why don't you come in and coordinate this for us?" So I took time off that summer and did it. Went down New York [New York] to meet with Byron Rushing [ref. to Bayard Rustin]. Went to his basement apartment. And also he was--I was dressed in my three-piece suit, which I always wear--used to wear, carrying my briefcase. And Byron [Bayard] said, "You're not going to be able to do anything wearing that stuff." I said, "Byron, you go about things your way and I'll do things my way." And so we did a, you know--I did not only Boston. I traveled part of New England to churches explaining the March on Washington .
Speaker 1: Alright. Hmm. Did you work at all with Bayard Rustin?
Speaker 2: Yeah. He's the one I just mentioned Bayard.
Speaker 1: Oh, you said Byron Rushing.
Speaker 2: Oh did I, oh sorry, Bayard Rustin.
Speaker 1: Okay. I didn't know--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Byron Rushing is a politician.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a politician.
Speaker 2: Here in Boston . Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so it's Bayard Rustin we're talking about.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. Yes. Sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay. Bayard Rustin was--he was coordinating the entire event?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: (unclear). And so did you--you went on the March apparently?
Speaker 2: I did go on the March . I did happily. And down the other pool, reflecting pool, couldn't believe that  [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] speech --brilliant, brilliant. So the things--and then I worked in civil rights here. and I also worked--represented--tried to work on the [PROBLEM] masters dedication for the seating of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Remember the ones from the Mississippi who came up?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Yes.
Speaker 2: So I went to Atlantic City [New Jersey], I think.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.
Speaker 2: And--.
Speaker 1: Atlantic City, 1964. Summer of '64.
Speaker 2: That's--Yeah, I was part of it.
Speaker 1: They called Freedom Summer.
Speaker 2: I had to get the votes from the Massachusetts delegation for the Freedom Democratic Party. That was my job. So.
Speaker 1: Now that's the group that was lead by Fannie Lou Hamer and Bob Moses--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 1: And quite a few others and (unclear). Yeah. And my other part of that job was to find out for the convention--the blacks--civil rights people, when [John W.] McCormack, the Speaker of the House , would call the votes. No that was for the legislation, '67 [1967] legislation. I worked on that. Took some people down as lobbyists from Massachusetts. Met with Speaker [of the House of Representatives,John W.] McCormack and found out when he would call the votes on the House floor. We had to lobby everybody. Everybody had to be outside the doors of representatives and say that the votes coming up now--Could you go to the Well  and vote?
Speaker 2: So this is--?
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is '64 [1964,] we're talking about?
Speaker 1: This is--I don't--no, I'm sorry. I've switched to the--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Voting rights act.
Speaker 2: Alright, Okay.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967] I think.
Speaker 2: So that one was successful.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But the '64 [1964] was--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Was not--
Speaker 2: Not and wasn't--I think, Joseph [L. ] Rauh of the--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 2: A union lawyer was on the floor trying to--.
Speaker 1: Trying to work out a compromise.
Speaker 2: Yes. But--and the delegation had been tricked ready to go across the street and talk to Hubert Humphrey while the vote took place.
Speaker 1: That's right. Yeah. Yeah, those days. (unclear).
Speaker 2: Did those--Did that kind of shake you up a little bit when that sort of trick was pulled?
Speaker 1: Well yeah. But we were not allowed--those of us who were not from Mississippi were not allowed into the meeting that Bob Moses was running, 'cause he said, "The people that have to live with this. People who have to live with this vote should take the decision."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was there outside the church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But Joseph [L.] Rauh and those people were always a mixed bag for us. And Christopher Dawson from Chicago was partly the problem. He wouldn't support the [Mississippi] Freedom Democratic Party.
Speaker 2: Oh William--you're talking about William [L.] Dawson, I think, the Congressman (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: William Dawson, right.
Speaker 1: And I wrote about--actually when I spoke against Malcolm--debated Malcolm X at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I talked about the internal divisions in the black community that were inhibiting our progress starting with the story of [Joseph] Kasa-Vubu and Patrice Lumumba in Africa, that conflict.
Speaker 2: Yeah. well it sounds to me that your book should be read--should be picked up again.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We'll see. Yes.
Speaker 2: --Yeah. That's ground that was just recently covered again in a movie. It was a movie about the life of [Patrice] Lumumba.
Speaker 1: Really? I haven't seen that.
Speaker 2: It's by Raoul Peck from Haiti. It's called 'Lumumba, la Mort du Prophete' [Lumumba, the death of the prophet].
Speaker 1: I've got to see that. Yes.
Story_ID: 17718
Speaker 1: You married a lady from England.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us how did you meet her.
Speaker 2: I didn't set out to marry a  lady from England. I met her at Harvard [ University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in the facul--at a faculty meeting. She was working for the  Registrar and looking at identification cards. And I noticed she was holding up Ralph Lowell, [correction,] Robert Lowell, the great poet. And I went up and I said in my stuffy way, "This is professor Lowell, the leading poet writing in the English language today. So you should--and he is a member of the Harvard faculty--so you should let him in." And someone came up and introduced me to Valerie . And I chatted with her. And outside there were--the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] was banging on the doors and disrupt the meeting. And I said to her, "Well, where are you from?" She said, "I'm from England." I said, "Well, is it possible to take you to lunch?" So I called her and made an arrangement. Took her to lunch in Harvard Square and then called her after lunch. I had discovered she was about to go back to England, and said, "You can't go back to England because you have to look after my children." And she said, "Oh, do you have children?" and I said, "No, the one's we are going to have." So she didn't think this is all ridiculous. So we started dating. And her parents told her she had to--we had to be separated for eight months. She had to come back home. And then we were married that spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had a wonderful life. I think we hope to live in England as soon as she retires.
Speaker 1: I see. And you have sons, right?
Speaker 2: I have two wonderful boys, Josiah who is twenty-four  now and Caleb who is twenty-one .
Story_ID: 17719
Speaker 1: Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well I think we first of all--we're doing one thing that's good which is to stress education and there are new methods that can help improve performance. One,  the expectations have to be high enough--there are people like Jeffery Howard who was a student at Harvard who works on performance, who have a way of improving that performance. And I look forward to the spread of those methods. Secondly, as a civil rights community, we need to organize ourselves better. There is NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the [National] Urban League still. But we need a more--they need to give us more impact, stronger message, clearer agenda. Where are our positions of leverage? Ask us where that--I mean the [Jesse] Jackson [Sr.] approach is partially good using economic leverage, 'cause we're a big borrower--purchasing power. We've got--we have to provide more discipline in our public affairs.
Speaker 1: Do you have any ideas about where this discipline or where the cen--the, I guess, the center for organization--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's the question. Well, it has to come from the civil rights organization still--NAACP and the black cau-- Congressional Black Caucus, political leaders. That group is growing. But it needs discipline. It can be done from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in part, I think, through professor [Henry Louis] Gate's DuBois center [W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], which is a very powerful scholarly community. But as a nation we need to announce an agenda every year. Raise the money to fund it. We need to be able to go to every household--every black household in this country and say, "We need this amount from you." Then manage the money well. Hire young people to go out. The much--the labor unions now have this summer project where they're hiring a lot of young people to re--you know, to rejuvenate the labor movement. We need that kind of discipline, that kind of preparation, that kind of muscle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we need to talk frankly with the national leaders. No compromise, "This is what we want" and stick to that.
Story_ID: 17720
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you on camera about ways to galvanize the black community politically.  And I think one of the programs here--you have on campus here is the Harvard Foundation?
Speaker 2: The Harvard Foundation for Race Relations, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How does that work?
Speaker 2: That is meant to promote the questions of racial identity. If you look at students lives and what causes them to get involved in politics or which causes them to isolate themselves from predominantly white communities is the questions of identity.  Now there's a big literature out there (unclear) identity.  And we--Dr. Counter brings speakers and poets and politicians in and successful professionals in to talk about their own experience and how they have succeeded. Like Denzel came. (unclear). Remember that film about football players?
Speaker 1: Right. The (unclear).
Speaker 2: Recently, very interesting.
Speaker 1: The Titans. 'Remember the Titans'.
Speaker 2: Titans, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So Allen--We have programming, strong programming.  Hundred events a year of that.  And we were tracking the levels of alienation of black students at Harvard, which was at 40 percent at one time.  Which we now think is at three percent.  And you track it a number of ways.  By questionnaires or the levels of participation.  So.  And you measure.  We have--now 80--36 percent minority of people at Harvard. And we have 80 percent of Harvard College have mixed roommates.  And that is a major accomplishment.  We pushed against separate.  We never did separate housing, the way some of the universities have done.  And we sound--we assign people at random in the second year.  But still they stay in the random assignment--those mixed assignments.  So some how our culture pushes people, white and black towards racial integration.  And we're not afraid of that word. You know, through the nationalist period, you have nationalist expression here.  And it--part of it is leadership.  I think you've gotta--Here's what I would say to nationally.  Let's see.  We need an agenda.  We need resources that are supplied by the black community.  Everybody should give $100 a year, $10 a year. It would be an enormous amount of money.  We need the government--We need to monitor the government's performance.  If I were doing it, I would start out by saying, "Every--we wanna resolve all complaints within one year."  You have a bunch of complaints about discrimination that are allowed to sit and fester.  And people get to some things, but not to many.  But we need to organize that.  Let's resolve all those things.  Let's start with a clean slate.  And so you're changing your environment to free up the energy of the black people and then the economic development.  That there's a big--You know, we lost all of the enter--the businesses of our community. Wiped out in the '20's [1920s] and '30's [1930s].  Riots, Jim Crow.  Jim Crow remember was the government policy boasted by private efforts to keep the blacks out.  But it has to be a disciplined coordinated approach.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now how do you feel about affirmative action?
Speaker 2: I am in favor of only one kind of affirmative action. I'm not in favor of quotas.  I'm in favor of a program of increasing the number of qualified blacks in the pool of candidates. And insuring that the standards applied are fair.  That's what we try to do at Harvard. And the numbers are--You can see that our numbers are done very well. The performance is very good.  I know when I--when I walk in the Harvard yard at the beginning of the year I can sense what those students are feeling. Once I walked into Harvard Yard and I looked at the steps on University Hall Administration building, there were about fifty black students sitting there.  My heart sank. Why do they have to start that way?  There must be something being done to get that reaction. And what was being done was that the upperclassmen were saying, "They really don't want you here."  So we had to set about disproving that.  Welcoming them ourselves at the college.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Okay. Now what about reparations?  How--what do you feel about the idea of reparations?
Speaker 2: I think that's fine.  I don't-I know that I don't' quite know-I'm more in favor of a check than any other (Laughing).  About $20,000 per person might do it.
Speaker 1: That's what the Japanese got, I think, for reparation too (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: Why not?  But it's gonna be a fight.  I don't think we have politically-the political power and support to do it. The courts may order it in the end.
Speaker 1: Now what--do you think there's still a need for black colleges and universities?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Partly many of them are good.  Secondly,  I'm prepared to allow for the possibility that blacks students want to-and black families want to go to a black college.  And they are--in my case, I needed a transition.  I needed those four years.  You know, to get my skills up and be comfortable in an academic environment.  And I think they need to be supported.  I don't think they need to struggle. I think the government needs to provide subsidies.  And I believe the same thing for Indian colleges.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now there was a few years-maybe about ten years ago one of the local people in Boston, Reverend Eugene Rivers wrote an article called, 'The Responsibility of Black Intellectuals in the Age of Crack'.
Speaker 2: Yes, I--.
Speaker 1: In regards to that, I mean a lot of-Harvard professors responded.  The big forum televised on television.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: What is Harvard's responsibility to the black community?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well as an elite institution, it should want to train the elites from all sectors.  And that's a kind of snooty answer. But I do think Harvard thinks that. So we want to train the (unclear). And we're having some success. I read Eugene Rivers. He's one of our students. So I see him a fair number of times. Very controversial, very interesting character. And he was trying to get people to stop partying so much. Come out of the nationalist corridors and get out and compete. And yes, I think that's fine. I'm not prepared to require the disappearance of a nationalist expression in organization. But I do think people have to participate in these institutions. You can't recreate Harvard among-just among the blacks at Harvard. You've gotta be open to the rest of it and give a--develop your skills that way. That was our problem. I think we worked against that a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now Dr. Counter runs the Harvard Foundation.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The foundation. Right.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, interesting person. Yes. That was put together by a-chaired a committee by the great Peter (unclear). And but Counter is the one who's made it work. He's on the ground with the students. He doesn't let them use foul language, you know; you have to have your manners. And he's very strong. He doesn't accept any put-downs from the whites. He requires the black students to do well. So we're very lucky to have him. And I was lucky to have him when I was Dean of Students [f Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. He could do things I couldn't do. He had access to students I didn't have.
Speaker 1: You know, what do you think about--there's been recent controversy in the last six months concerning the black studies department  here.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: At Harvard and its relationship to some of the professors there.
Speaker 2: Yes, Cornel West and Anthony Appiah. Okay. Well can I be honest with you about this?
Speaker 1: Yes. I hope so.
Speaker 2: I don't think Cornel [West] did the right thing. Though I--you know, he resigned, left and went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey]. And I'm happy for--I guess I'm happy for Cornel [West]. Cornel [West] was an undergraduate here. He used to come to my apartment as a tutor and bang on my door and go through my library and borrow my books and things. But first of all, he represented what we had been working so long to build here which is a strong black presence. And so it's not--it's not--it doesn't help us, looking at it selfishly, for him to have left. And if somebody--as I told somebody, "You know, I'm from the South. When I came up here, I faced lots of discouragement, lots of pressure. If I--what would have happened if I had left? Why should I leave? The place should change." That's my assumption. And professor [Lawrence H.] Summers  Summers was just starting. And president Summers shouldn't've talked to him that way. Apparently it was a very demeaning conversation. But so Professor Summers should change--president Summers should change. Now the department is still strong. Professor [Henry Louis] Gates is here. But you won't be able to replace Cornel West and Anthony Appiah. The sheer brilliance of Cornel's work in philosophy, theology--I would've done everything I could to keep him. I would have sent a limousine to his house ever day to keep him happy (laughing). I mean he--that man used to walk across the campus. You know, the students would follow him in droves. Great. Nice man.
Story_ID: 17721
Speaker 1: Looking back on this. Now you retired in 2001?
Speaker 2: That's correct. What do you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 1: Oh. Well specifically for Harv--as Dean of Students [Harvard College in Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I oversaw the growth of student activities from sixty to three hundred that provides a whole network, a whole apparatus for students, a whole scaffold there for them to climb through their college years which helps them to create friendships to grow, learn (unclear) organizations. And gives Harvard a very vital, cultural life. That's one part of it. The second most important one was the work in race relations. I've told you about the Harvard Foundation [for Intercultural and Race Relations]. We also start off the year at Harvard with every student reading a collection of essays which they will discuss with faculty for two hours which is meant to slow down that beginning, which is meant to center it on academic life. One--we start with an essay by [Ralph Waldo] Emerson on self reliance. The great self reliance essay. And professor [Henry Louis] Gates does it at the--on the ethics of identity. And there's an essay on the interplay between being Chinese and Japanese. But the essays are of a very high quality intellectually and seventy faculty participate in that program. And it does--it--it solves a lot of problems of the reputation that you don't get really taught by faculty at Harvard but in our program you do. You start with faculty. There's faculty experience. So that's an important legacy. And then the third is interreli--I was always interested in religious and life. Couldn't speak about it as much as I sho--wanted to as Dean of Students. But now professor [Peter J.] Gomes's church [Memorial Church Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] has endowed A. Epps fellowship and chaplaincy at Harvard College [Epps Fellow and Chaplain to Harvard College]. And I'm interested in religious life because having worked with students in all their crises and dramas, I'm aware, increasingly aware, of the importance of the continuities in young people's lives. I want to support the continuities. Psychiatry tells you, you wanna divid--separate.  Get student to think a new way and break the connection with the past. No. You wanna emphasize the continuities with their families and with their churches or synagogues. So those are the three.
Speaker 2: Okay. Sir, this is slightly different. How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 1: Well a lot of people have arranged for that. I have a wonderful trophy from Harvard saying, I represented "the best qualities of the institution." The Kuumba Singers [of Harvard College] are about to name their spring concert in my honor. When I first inherited the Kuumba [Singers of Harvard College] from the other dean, I said--'cause my parents had taught me, "No gospel music.  Stay away from those churches." And then I--so I wasn't sure about Kuumba [Singers of Harvard College]. Then I did a study of the academic performance of Kuumba Singers [of Harvard College] compared to other black students and I discovered they were scoring very high academically. So I changed my tune. And although I participated a lot in the Harvard Glee Club, I've began to listen to those rhythms of Kuumba and to enjoy the music in a real sense. We were not--you know, we were trained to waltz down in Lake Charles [Louisiana] and those things. The most important guide to me in my work has been Ralph Ellison. That great book, 'Shadow and Act.' Not 'Invisible Man;' it's a great book. But there's a book called 'Shadow and Act'. In that book, there's an essay revealing LeRoi Jones's  book--LeRoi Jones's [Amiri Baraka's] play 'Blues People'. Remember the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: And when Ralph [Ellison] there says that we are--we are all connected in this country and you can only separate our experience with race with the skill of a surgeon. But the black experience is at the center of it and it forms the American experience. It's a quintis--it's crucially American in many ways. And I can remember the day Ralph  died--the day Ralph Ellison died, I shed a tear from me. Because he had represe--'cause I can remember discovering him over in Harvard Square  reading a piece by John Henrik Clark. I think it was by John Henrik Clark. That separate--showed the difference between Ralph--I mean James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison. And Ellison was the more cosmopolitan. More open, more universal, international people, that is what we must become.
