Story_ID: 57835
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your beginnings and the early days.  Can you give us the names of your parents and spell them for us and tell us when they were born and where they were from?
Speaker 2: I may not be able to tell you exactly where they were born, but my mother was born in Brooksville, Mississippi, and that was on July 31, but the year I'm not sure of.  My father, I don't know where he was born, but I do know that he had lived in Pensacola, Florida.  That's where his mother came from when she came to live with us.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Mary Magdalene Calloway.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-Y, M-A-D-G-L-E-N-E, I think, Magdalene, Calloway, C-A-L-L-O-W-A-Y.
Speaker 1: And your father's name?
Speaker 2: James Calloway.
Story_ID: 57836
Speaker 1: Well, can you tell us something about your family history. Did any family members pass down stories from the old south or from slavery or any stories that are of significance to you when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, we know that the great-great grandmother was a slave that had been brought down from Virginia down through Carolina into Mississippi, Macon, Mississippi.  And she became associated with an Indian who had been expelled from his--from his tribe for some reason.  And they became friends and so forth.  Now she was a Williams and he took her name so that started the Williams family, and she had four sons and one daughter and--and they were quite active, so they had a lot children.  And so from that began the--the Williams family.  And we have had some very, very wonderful times together in the late years.
Speaker 1: So your mother's family was a large family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Story_ID: 57837
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about your father's side, do you know much about that?
Speaker 2: I only knew one--I really don't quite understand how this--this happened, but I think one was his foster parent and Mrs. Hayes, now I don't remember her first name was his real mother.  We only saw her for a short time, but he lived mostly with the lady we called Mama Margaret and she was--she was some lady.  And we learned a lot from her because she lived close to us.  And he had one brother that we knew of and they called him Mack. That's the extent of our knowing about his family.  But Mama Margaret was something else.
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about her?  What did Mama Margaret do?
Speaker 2: She was tall and she was always picking on me.  I was a good boy.  And one time, one time, I remember I never will forget this.  I don't know what I did, but I ran out of the house and you know down south they have these little--little flower beds, you know a flower gardens with the bricks around them, and so I ran out the house to get away from her.  She picked up one of those bricks and threw it, and I heard that brick coming man, and I really tore out, it just did miss me.  But she would, you know do it, she would have me help her to make--make soap, you know P and G [Procter and Gamble], you know I think they copied off of the way they make soap back then, because she would take lye and grease, you know, all kind of grease and mix it up together and make soap.  And so those are some of the things that we learned from her.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was her full name, do you remember?
Speaker 2: All I remember was Mama Margaret.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all I remember.
Story_ID: 57838
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father first worked in Hillman Hospital.  Then he started working in the mines in Alabama.  My mother, at first was a finisher and she also did domestic work for three hours a week or something like that.  And--but then she began to do work for Utopia Cleaners, I remember that.  And she was very good at doing white Palm Beach suits and they called that a finisher.  And that was the kind of work she did.  But then she became a Seventh Day Adventist and things became tough because she wouldn't work on Saturday, and therefore we became very, very, very poor, you know during that particular time.  And that time was around the time that the--the financial market crashed, let me see, what did they call it--
Speaker 1: The stock market crash.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Depression.
Speaker 2: The Depression, that's right.  And we had a tough time during that particular time because my father died as he was going to work.  He got hit by an automobile.  And so my mother didn't have anybody to take care of us but my sister and I.  And as a result we really had to eat out of--of the garbage that people threw away from up in Five Points in Birmingham.  Now, it was a little different in that they would take potatoes that were slightly spoiled and they would take chicken feet, because the people in that area were wealthy and they didn't eat all of that, so chicken feet and chicken heads and so forth.  We would go up there, we would get it, and my mother knew how to make dumplings and all kinds of different things so that we would have food to eat. And for--for heat in the winter time, we would get up early in the morning, I would get up with my mother and go with her and we would go to the hospital and we would gather the coke, you know after the coal burned it formed into coke and so we would take the coke and bring it home and use it for fire.  And whenever anybody would tear down a house or something like that, we would go and get the wood so that we would have wood to work with.  And so we managed to live.  People today don't know what being poor is.  But in a sense we didn't realize that we were poor.  We were happy but we just didn't have money and stuff.
Story_ID: 57839
Speaker 1: So can you describe maybe some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Birmingham in those days.  Now your story is different from a lot of people who were raised on a farm.  You were actually raised in a southern city, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was very interesting.  On the corner where we lived was a long house like a--like a "L".  And in the back of that house, they sold spirits, as the old people called it.  They sold spirits on--they sold whiskey, you know.  And they danced because they didn't have night clubs as such, you know.  So they had houses where they had their fun, so they had piano and I heard the blues.  I heard the blues like people don't hear the blues.  They had guitarist and people like that.  Now up front they had a little old lady that--whose name was Miss Annie, that's all we know, and she would have the children teaching them about the Bible and they would sing and so forth.  And whenever the police would come, that was all they saw, was this little old lady teaching the children.  And so--and then on Fridays in Birmingham, in various communities they would fry fish, you know.  They would take charcoal and put it in a round tub and--and put a--some wire, heavy wire over it and they would fry fish.  And Friday night they have a good time in the house there and so forth.  Then on Saturday they would barbecue and man, they would have some delicious barbecue.  People haven't tasted barbecue like they--they make it there.  Then we was close to the iron industry, steel industry, I should say, and they made steel so you could, sometimes you could smell some of the--the fumes and so forth that came from that.  But we had a very interesting--interesting childhood.  We had--we went to the 16th Street, pardon, not the 16th Street Baptist Church, but Six Avenue Baptist Church.  And there I would get up early in the morning and go to Sunday school, and I would go all over the place, and I would hear the old people line out the hymns.  They would singing, one person would speak the hyms, the words of the hymn and--and lead out and the others would follow.  That would be early in the morning at what we might call prayer meeting before the regular services began.  So those are some of the things that we witnessed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many brothers and sisters did you have and where did you fall in--
Speaker 2: I just have one sister, and she's younger than I am.
Speaker 1: --Okay, and what's her name?
Speaker 2: Lucille.  Lucille Robeson now.
Story_ID: 57840
Speaker 1: Okay.  What school did you go to and how did you like school
Speaker 2: I liked school.  I had no problem with going to school from the very beginning.  We went to a school called--first we went to Immaculata School. I don't know how my mother did it, but she always sent us to a private school with the exception of one year and we went to a school called Cameron, down on 14th Street and then the next semester, we went to one called Lane School, which was down around Ninth Street or something like that in Birmingham.  After that we went to a private school called Ephesus Seventh Day Adventist School, and we went there for the rest of our years in Birmingham.  In fact we lived over, right, border lining the white community, and they were over in what we called Smithville, that was many, many blocks away.  And we used to always pass by the 16th Street Baptist Church, the one that was bombed and we walked to school every morning, unless it happened to be rain or even snow or something like that.  But it was good.  Now, the schools weren't fine like they are now.  We had--we would go there in the morning, they had a little stove, you know, and I liked the teacher because she was pretty, she was from Atlanta.  And I would go and gather wood and coal and make the fire and so forth.  And we were behind the auditorium of the church.  And sometimes when the health people would come to examine us, they would have hay baling scales and so forth and sit us upon those hay baling scales and weigh us and things like that.  That's how--how very, very meager things were in the south.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you a good student in school, did you enjoy school work?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I did.  I liked--I did, I was--I was involved, totally involved and I don't know, I--I liked my teachers.  They were--they were very fine.  I would help them take their books home and sometimes I'd go by the place where they lived and I would, you know, cut wood for them in the afternoons so that they would have it, you know, for the next morning and--and of course they had ladies who would come and make quilts, you know today it's very, very, fashionable, you know for quilts but we would go there and watch them and do whatever they would--would have us to do.  And we would have good food and then we'd go on home, you know.  So, it was--it was a wonderful time.
Story_ID: 57841
Speaker 1: Can you remember any specific teachers that gave you guidance?  What subjects did you like the most in school?
Speaker 2: There again, I'm not sure that there was any particular one that--that I liked.  But they did guide me in the area of music, I think, more than anything else.  For some reason they thought I had a very nice voice.  And so that they had me directing and--the music for all the other children, sometimes I would sing solos and I think Mrs. Hamilton, Grace Hamilton, was instrumental in--in helping me to appreciate music.  And there was another lady by the name of Miss Schwedenburg [ph], she was a very fine musician, and then there was a Miss Goss [ph].  When I about seven-years old she came from Atlanta, she was the prettiest lady I ever saw.  And so I used to torment her a lot.  But she didn't get angry at me, it wasn't bad, it was just that I would--I always wanted to do something and want to go because she was so pretty.  And so, I appreciated her, but I learned a lot.
Story_ID: 57842
Speaker 1: All right, let us go on to high school, I guess.  Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama.  That was very interesting because I always wanted to go to that school and there had been professors coming to our city and our church and so forth telling us about the school.  And one--one of them told about the morning star and that intrigued me.  And so I wanted to go there so that I could see that morning star.  I had envisioned this star falling from heaven and it lighted up the whole place.  So I sold the Chicago Defender, in fact, I was selling Chicago Defenders when I was very, very young.  And the papers would come in on Thursdays and we would sell them for Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays and we would get three cents and they would get the seven cents.  So I learned something about finances from that. So I sold a lot of Defenders.  I saved up twelve dollars so that I could go to Oakwood.  My mother wasn't making very much at that particular time.  So I did.  So there was a L and N Train that went there so I took the L and N Train [Louisville and Nashville Railroad].  That was three dollars, and I was to stay in the city because I was too young, I was twelve.  I was too young to stay on campus.  So when I got to Huntsville, Alabama, I gave to the lady I was supposed to stay with, her name was Mrs. Hines, I gave here twelve--four dollars and I had only four dollars left.  So when we registered, I gave the--the registrar the four dollars and he asked me, he says, is this all you have.  I said yes, my mother would send the rest.  And so he said, wait a minute, so he went upstairs and talked to the treasurer and the--and the president, and you know they didn't send me home.  And they just let me go on.  And so then one day the, the president, Professor Milan--Moran, rather, he actually saw me on campus and he asked me had I heard from my mother and I told him, no. He said well, son, I think you should go down and pick a little cotton.  I didn't know how to pick cotton, so I went down anyway with the expectation of picking cotton, and everybody had big old large bags of cotton and mine was just a little bit.  And so the farmer came there who was head of the agricultural section of the college and he says, well you know, son, I think you should get up and weigh the cotton and so that's what happened, so I would weigh the cotton and--for the other people as they picked it, and I got through.  And so I worked so that I could pay for my tuitions and Mr. Cosby was very, very kind in that he would give me all kinds of little jobs that I could do so that I would make enough money to help pay for my tuitions.  And so I graduated from the twelfth grade there.  But I had to walk--I had to walk about 15 or 20 miles every morning to Oakwood College.
Story_ID: 57843
Speaker 1: Okay.  It takes a lot of determination to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did, but you see you had an objective even at that particular time.  And so you just did what you--was necessary for you to do in order to get where you wanted to get.  In fact, even before then, when I was smaller, you know people down south, they sold coal in the winter time and they sold ice in the summer time.  So I would help the people deliver it all up the hills and everywhere else so that I could make a little money so I could help my mother.  And so we were already used to achieving our objections through work.  And so when I left Oakwood, I went all the way through until I was in the--my junior year and then by that time I had become interested in music and so I left and came to, not to Chicago, yeah I came to Chicago, and so that's how we happened during that particular time.
Story_ID: 57844
Speaker 1: We're rolling again, and you were talking about how some of the things you all had to do during the Depression to survive, growing a garden, some other things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was necessary for us if we wanted to survive, we had to find a way to survive.  And like in Birmingham, now, where we lived, my mother and my sister lived, that was you know, some land behind there, not very much and on one side we had the toilet, that was outside, and we would learn how to--to put corn in the ground, it grew up, greens, beets and different things, vegetables and so forth so that we could eat.  And as I told you before, we would go up to the--it's called Five Points, and the people were the wealthy up there, so if the greens weren't right, they would throw em out, potatoes, they had a little spot on em or apples had little spots on them, we get em my mother cut em off and--and we would eat them and we survived like that.  And on Sunday we could always look forward to chicken feet and dumplings.  And, so, we had  to--at one time we really had to go to other places to get food and Wait's [ph.] Bakery, I think it was, we went to.  They gave us a bucket of soup and some rolls that we were able to eat, that would last us a day or so. Then they had the welfare, I guess it was just starting at that particular time, and my mother took me down with her and we stood in line all day long, and I got sick from the heat.  And, so, but I liked being sick because they were taking care of me, they brought me ice cream and stuff like that, I was on the front porch you know.  And, so, it was all right, but we had a hard time surviving.  In fact, in the house that we lived, for instance, it was almost rotten, and it would rain, we'd put buckets down, and it got so that we could only live in the front room.  But these are the things that happened to African Americans as they were living during that particular time.
Story_ID: 57845
Speaker 1: Now what kind of social life did you have in high school?  Were you involved in clubs in high school or were you singing in the chorus or the choir?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did, but that social life actually began in the earlier years in Birmingham because for some unknown reason the kids would come in my yard and play and we'd have a good time and the ladies that lived next door to us, her name was Big Mama, Fannie Lewis, and she had been in slavery.  And she was huh, her skin was so wrinkled, it was really, really wrinkled, but she could cook and she would take care of a little white girl, her name was--her name was Sylvia.  And they would bring her down for her, and she would go up and cook for them. Now the other thing that happened is that when black people worked in the kitchen of the white people, they would bring back plates of food so that we could--we could have it to eat, so those were some of the things and ways that we survived. We played hop scotch and hide and go seek and all these things like that. In fact if I had time one of the most terrible whippings I ever got was because of hide and go seek. I found a good place to hide and it was, you know, the--the toilets, that's what we called them down there.  The toilets were on one side and they had different ones up--up above you could, you know, walk through or crawl through. So I was crawling through and I was really, really hid, nobody could find me.  And I came to one place and saw a little girl down there and I jumped down there where she was and I wanted to make love with her.  I was little but we knew what was going on and she wouldn't, you know.  And so I didn't force her but all the kids were in my yard playing, so she--she was up there playing.  I told her don't be playing with my things and so--so she, I don't know, she told my mother or somebody what happened and so they were gonna whip me, so I took off running, as fast as I could, but those stupid boys, they ran behind me and caught me and drug me back to my house.  And my mother put me between her legs and crossed it like that where my behind was sticking out and they whipped me, boy they whipped me, because I had said some bad words to my grandmother because I was mad.  And, but, that was the worst whipping I ever remember getting.  But we got over it and we played.
Story_ID: 57846
Speaker 1: Now in college I was working most of time from--
Speaker 2: Well you probably finished in high school.  I just wanted to find out if you--
Speaker 1: I mean in high school, yeah, uh-huh.  In high school I was working most of the time.  And of course I learned how to take care of the horses and I learned how to take care of the--of the calves.  The farmer, manager, let me take care of the calf, and the calves were first born after about four or five days, a little while, they were weaning, so weaned them from the heifers, you know. So we would take them and I would have to feed them.  And so I had a lot of time playing with them, running and so forth and then I also rode horses.  I learned how to ride horses.  And then on Saturday nights, we would have social fairs, kind of socials.  And in the dining room there was a lot of communications with one--with each other so that we had pretty good times.  We played ball and things like that.  So we had a pretty good time.
Story_ID: 57847
Speaker 1: Now there was a story that I heard.  Your father told you that you might be related to Cab Calloway?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And he did. He was a good person when he wasn't intoxicated and you know sometimes on weekends they would you know get high.  But he would teach me how to dance and he often told me about Cab Calloway.  And in fact, the kids started calling me Cab cause I would dance you know.  I was ugly and so in order to get the attention of the young ladies at the party you would have, I would dance, man, and I would really dance.  And so I did learn that.  But when I came to Chicago, I saw Cab Calloway in "Porgy and Bess" and so I went back stage to see him, and they let me back.  And I went to his dressing room, and I knocked on the door and somebody wanted to know who I was, and I told him I was Cab Calloway's cousin.  And he came to the door and he didn't--he was nice.  He didn't say I wasn't or anything like that you know.  And so he invited me in.  I stayed for a little bit and then I went on.  I didn't stay too long.  But ever since then whenever he would come here, I would always go and see him and we had a good relationship, one with the other. And then I got a chance to see Blanche [Calloway] before she passed away. She was here filming a program with Black on Black.  And we started talking and I told her that I was her cousin and so forth.  And before she could you see, we got noses just like each other and so.  And we had a good time over that and so we talked.  But they were some very, very beautiful people.  They didn't act stuck up about that or anything.  And--cause I reminded of that I didn't have hair like they did but we were all right.
Speaker 1: Where was Cab Calloway's family from, did he ever tell you?
Speaker 2: Baltimore. Baltimore.  But there were a lot of Calloways that was between Georgia and--and Florida.  And so, I don't know whether they migrated up into that area or not.  And then in West Virginia there were a lot of Calloways.  And--and so, but as far as I know he was from Baltimore.
Story_ID: 57848
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school, did you have any idea of what you wanted to do when you got out of high school or any aspirations for a career?  What did you think you were going to be?
Speaker 2: I was gonna be a preacher, that's why I went to private school.  And I could go to church even when I was smaller, listen to the preacher and come back and word-for-word, I could repeat his sermon.  And I would sit on the edge of the seat sometime listening to them and learning.  And so I decided that I would be a minister.  And so I was doing all right and I got through high school, I was very good in my Bible classes and so forth.  And then I went into my first year college and I began to sing and somehow that became a very, very, very interesting art for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: Oakwood.  I went to Oakwood College.  They have an academy--
Speaker 1: Okay. --And then we went into--into college curriculum.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you just matriculated right from high school to college.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The same place?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What kind of a school is Oakwood College?
Speaker 1: It's a--It's a Seventh Day Adventist School, and it's also part of the United Negro College Fund.  And they train teachers, ministers and everything, and so that's what I wanted to be.  However, I became very interested in music and began to spend a lot of time in music.  In fact, that was one of the reasons why I didn't pass Geometry because I was very much interested in music.  And--but I didn't change, I was still gonna be a minister until one day the head of the music department saw me coming down from the hill where he lived and he called me Cab Calloway.  And that disturbed me because I couldn't understand why, here this religious man calling me Cab Calloway.  So I took that as a sign that maybe I shouldn't be a minister and so then I switched to education and music and so I've been in music ever since.
Story_ID: 57849
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what kind of musical activities were you engaged in in college, and in the process, did you begin to write?
Speaker 2: Not--well, yes.  That came early in high school.  I didn't know anything to write about too much but I loved horses and I used to write about horses.  Every time there was a composition, I would write about horses and Ruby Goss was my English teacher.  And I didn't know it was anything special or anything like that but when she signed my little book, you know, in high school you have a little autograph book, you know, and she wrote in there, I loved your stories about horses.  And you know that sort of inspired me, so I tried to write better. But then when I got into college I had another teacher by the name of Dr. Eva B. Dykes, she was the first African American woman to get her doctorate degree from Radcliffe [College].  And, oh, there were others who got theirs, but she was the first to finish hers.  And--and she commented about my writings, I forget what she said, it was something that I didn't know what she was talking about.  But then I started writing better whenever I had something to write.  But it was the music that began to captivate me and so I sang with the male chorus, I sang in the choir and I sang at solos.  So, that's--I decided that's what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think the real reason that--another reason that helped me to change was the fact that when I went to Buffalo, New York, I would find--I found me a music teacher who could teach me voice.  And that was a lady by the name of Mrs. Horner and she knew Ormond D. Walker.  Now Ormond D. Walker was the president of Wilburforce University, but he had come to Buffalo, New York to pastor the Bethel AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church, and he put on this pageant, you know.  And so they told me I had a voice like--like a flute and they made me take the role of a old man.  Here I was 13 or 14 years old, I took the role of a old man and I was supposed to die and be taken to heaven.  So they built a little wagon and with two pretty little girls in it and so I sang and they pulled me all the way through the church.  And I was oblivious to the people that were there.  I sang "Swing Low Sweet Chariot".  And after that, whenever I walked the streets, they would call me the "Sweet Chariot Boy".  And so when I went back to school, I sang--I sang two songs, one was "Thank God for a Garden" and "If I could Tell You".  And the students cut up so badly, not--not, you know, they were given ovations and things like that and the president came up and quieted them down and the boys took me on their shoulders and took me into the dormitory, and then I said, I got to be a singer.  So that's--that's where that began and I changed then with all my emphasis that direction.
Story_ID: 57850
Speaker 1: Where did you go for further instructions, what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I persuaded my mother to come to Chicago because I had developed friends from Oakwood [College] here in Chicago more than anything else.  And it was cold in Buffalo, it was cold in the summer time.  And it was ridiculous in the winter time, so I didn't want to stay up there.  So we came here and I began to take music here in Chicago, at first at Chicago Musical College with a man by the name of George Graham.  I took vocal music from Harold Bailey at Roosevelt University and that was the beginning of that.  But I wasn't able to really get into school.  So I sang in the community, I sang for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] every time they had teas and things like that.  They don't have them like that anymore.  But the sisters used to come and bake real delicious cakes and make all kinds of things you know.  And there were several of us young people who liked music and we would sing and we would help them and eat.  And so, also the Urban League was another one where we would come and give our talents to them.  And so we developed, and the churches were always very, very open to our coming and performing, and we sang with the choirs, we had many great people here in Chicago who were fantastic musicians.  So in the community we could learn.  We learned from a lady named Doctor Oneka[ph.] King.  She was with the National Association of Opera Singers and then there was another lady name Mary Dawson.  And she organized in the '40s (1940s) a black opera and they sang all kinds of operas and things like that, and so I had a chance to--to sing and practice with them.  Then I had to go to the army, and--
Speaker 1: This was 1940--
Speaker 2: --No this past now.  This is in '51' (1951).  See before it was in the '40s (1940s) like, you know.
Speaker 1: --So you came to Chicago in 19--
Speaker 2: Forty-three, '43 (1943), yes.
Story_ID: 57851
Speaker 1: --So you've been here almost ten years when you had to go into the army?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, uh-huh.  So we went to the army, at least, I went to the army and that was an experience, a great experience.  But there we developed--I had learned how to type a little bit at Oakwood [College], not a lot because there were three of us young boys who wanted to type, and the girls wanted to you know to type and so they kicked us out and made room for all the girls who wanted to type because they didn't believe that we were gonna do anything with typing.  But anyway when I went to--to the army and asked for volunteers, you know they said never volunteer, but I just volunteered because I didn't, you know I could type.  And so it proved to be very beneficial to me in the army.  We would get up, I'd wait for the--the supply house, that's what it was, you wait for the supply house and they would--in the evenings when the people would come, and we'd have to go in and give out supplies and things like that, therefore, we had privileges.  Then--
Speaker 1: It's what they called the quartermaster core?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't a core, but it was just a--I was at Fort Breckinridge.  You know where Fort Breckinridge, that was the 101st airborne, that was a great company, boy they worked you to death, man.  And so then we--they sent me to--to Fort Knox.
Story_ID: 57852
Speaker 1: That's Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, at Fort Knox.  And I would walk by that--you know they had the--the place where they keep all the gold, we would walk by there every day.  Every day we would walk by that place where they had--they had it enclosed sort of, but we would go by it every day.  And after that--and I started a male chorus there.  By that time I had sung with the male chorus at Oakwood [College], so I knew something about that.  So I would do that.  And then they sent me down to--to Fort Sam Houston, the soldiers' paradise, and I started a chorus there.  After that they sent me to Camp Stoneman and then overseas to Korea, and it was--I learned a lot.  You know some people don't like the army or they complain but I could cut hair, so I cut hair and made a little money and the most beautiful thing that ever happened was crossing the Pacific Ocean.  And I could sing so I sang and I played the organ a little bit.  And they made me the preacher.  So for two weeks on a Sunday, I would do the services and it was beautiful.  All the people, the soldiers, were there and we sang and I preached and then when I got over into Japan--oh, yeah, one thing, they had a--you haven't seen a storm, but on that ocean, the water was so high until the ship would go down and come back up and I was sitting on the--on the side of it, you know, with my legs wrapped around the, I forget, the anchor and--and all the water would come up, all that salt water would come all over (unclear) and it was gonna go down again and come up until the captain of the ship came out there and saw me up there and he--man, he cursed me out--he cursed me out and then told me get myself back downstairs, but you know I didn't have any idea you know how dangerous it was, you know, but anyway it was so beautiful.  Then after that I saw the rainbow.  Man that rainbow was so beautiful and yet, you know, everything became peaceful again.  And it was just beautiful so we got to Yokohama [Japan] and I went down--I would always go and play music because I didn't drink and carry on like the other kids when they went out, so I would go down and play.  So the Chaplain saw me playing so he tried to get me off my assignment to stay there to be a chaplain's assistant, but I didn't.  So they sent me on to Korea and I became a sergeant first class.  Then I came back home to Chicago and enrolled at Chicago Musical College where I really seriously began to study music.
Story_ID: 57853
Speaker 1: As you were an aspiring singer if you patterned yourself after Paul Robeson or Roland Hayes, or any other?
Speaker 2: Roland Hayes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because he was a tenor, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He--he's dead now, but he was the greatest singer--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --That you would ever want to hear.  And fortunately I was able to hear many of those people.  Now Paul Robeson, I didn't get a chance to hear in person, but I knew about him, I knew people who played for him, but I got a chance to hear Dorothy Maynor, those old singers like that, Marian Anderson and--and Roland Hayes.  And Roland Hayes was a magnificent singer, and his spirituality was so tremendous, and his German--his German leader, his French, all were impeccable, you know.  And I pattern myself--I held my hands like he did, and I tried to sing like him.  And that was--was my idol.  And then I also liked--liked Marian Anderson cause she too would come out and it was just like--it's an experience that you could never, never forget.  And Frederick Schauwecker, who was at Roosevelt [College], he wrote me an introduction to Marion Anderson.  And when she came out and saw me, this little black boy, standing up there, she just--just looked into my eyes and she had some beautiful, deep brown eyes, and she took my hand and gave me encouragement and so forth and that's what helped to inspire me.  So I kept on trying to--trying to sing.
Story_ID: 57854
Speaker 1: Now, when we left off, you were in Korea?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had the army really utilized your singing talents?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  In fact I worked with Timothy Irons who was the chaplain.  They had sent him to be the chaplain for headquarters and headquarters company in the area.  And so every Sunday I would prepare to go with him to the MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) hospitals where he would hold services.  I would sing for him and play the organ as best I could.  And we would go--one time we were about eight or ten miles from the front line you know.  But you would climb those mountains, they were high, way up above the 30th Parallel.  And then Christmas time we decided to have a Christmas program and by that time he had secured a--a chaplain's assistant who could play and so forth and I could work with men and sing you know and so forth.  And so we prepared a program for Christmas that was very good.
Speaker 1: Now what's the significance of the 30th parallel?
Speaker 2: The 30th parallel?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You just mentioned that, I think, that there's probably a significance to it that people wouldn't know if you didn't tell them?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a separation between North and South Korea.  And it's way up, I can't explain it.
Speaker 1: That's the line that separated the two countries.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But then it's more than that, it's you know, we have parallels all around the earth you know and so forth you know, I don't know why, but--but that was a very, very, very important area.  But I do know there was a separation between the North and South Korea.
Speaker 1: A political separation?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to make that point, because you know it's language you could read in the history books and most people don't know.  Okay, but so you all prepared a Christmas--you were getting ready to do a Christmas party?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had a very beautiful Christmas program. And Captain Irons did a little brief sermonette, and we sang.  We sang--I guess we sang about eight songs.  And it was good, those guys really did sing, and they enjoyed it, they wanted to keep it going, but we couldn't.
Story_ID: 57855
Speaker 1: Now what songs did you like to sing the most?  What were your favorite songs in those days?
Speaker 2: In--I liked and appreciated African American spirituals.  I had heard them from Big Mama, I think I mentioned the lady before.  I had heard her sit and rock in her rocking chair and sing those songs when I was a little boy, four and five years old, and they always stuck in my mind.  So when I learned about them at Oakwood College [Huntsville, Alabama], I had sang in a chorus, they became even more fascinating to me.  And then when I arrived here and began to--to study the music that African Americans had arranged, these songs became a special entity in music to me, and I would always sing them whenever possible.
Speaker 1: Now, this is an opportunity because if you would like to sing a couple of lines of a song, you know, you have an opportunity to do it while we're doing this interview. If you can think of something. Just a brief bit.
Speaker 2: (Singing) "This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine, this little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.  This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."  Now, see, ordinarily I wouldn't do this, but the only reason I did it was because it will illustrate what we're doing, because during this period, during the cotton wood blossom, I sneeze all the time, you could hear the hoarseness in there, so that's why my voice wasn't clear.  But--but they are so beautiful.  And the most amazing thing is that we do not realize the tremendous intelligence of our Africans who came from the mother country and how they learned about the love of God when they could not read, but they did.  And they captured it and put it into their songs.  You know that's fascinating when you think how amazing they are.  And these poignant songs are more beautiful than any other folk songs in the world.
Story_ID: 57856
Speaker 1: I think when you have written, and I can tell in the way you rendered, you rendered that song that inflection is very important to you and the words--how the words are delivered, you know, the way the words are delivered is very important to you and the concept is very important.  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You see words have meaning.  Many people just get up and sing, but when you speak about I love someone, what are you talking about?  Are you just talking about going to bed with them, no, it has some more penetrating depth to it.  You really would be unselfish to them, and therefore when you sing a song then you must be able to project all the meanings that you could possibly get from those songs.  For an example, there's a song by Langston Hughes, it not by Langston Hughes, but he wrote the poem.  It's called "Song To The Dark Virgin".  Miss Price, who lived here in Chicago, wrote the music to it.  And it says, "I would that I were a jewel, a shattered jewel that all my precious love would fall at thy feet." That's not exactly--I'm improvising.  Then the second verse goes something like this.  "Would that I were a garment, a silken garment that all my foes might wrap about thy body and I would hold thee and hide thee."  Then the last one is that, "I would that I were a flame but one sharp leaping flame to annihilate thy body thou dark one."  And you see, when you say, jewel, beautiful jewel and all the shimmering beauty that you have then--and you want it all to be there at her feet to enlighten her.  And then when you speak of the second coming how when you put on silk, it clings to you, you know and everything, you know.  And that's the way you want to take her and fold her and wrap her about.  That body hold and hide her, not to just you know, and then you have all the emotions within you and you want those emotions to leap like the flames of fire and take her being and engulf it into you and so that you two can become one.  So those are the kinds of things that--that you would place into a--into a song.  You see, for instance, if you only have one minute or maybe two minutes to sing a song and so you must get every--all the essence of that poetry that will fit with the music.
Story_ID: 57857
Speaker 1: That's the, were you taught how to do that, I mean when you studied voice.  Did you have teachers that taught you that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes and no.  Somehow there's an innate quality that every artist have.  I don't mean to be proud but I am an artist and--but I learned it from--even though I had the natural ability, I learned it from those old people who used to sing in the church back there.  I learned it from--from Mama Margaret who--Big Mama, that's what we called her, who sang in the back, and she would sit there, and her mine would be gone, but she would just sit there, close her eyes and rock her chair.  And I sat on the porch and listened to her.  Then I listened to Roland Hayes, Marian Anderson and all of those people, not only those but Caruso and while working at Orchestra Hall, I had the opportunity of listening to every person who played music, piano, violin and everything.  And that becomes a part of you.  Now, what the teachers did was develop me technically so that I could use my talents and so that I could, And I learned from Eileen Dumond Lee [ph.] that singing is more mental than physical, you know, you can do all this but you know--but when you can take it and use your mind to dig deep into the humanity of what the poetry is about than you can be able to interpret.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's inspiration but it's also observation and somewhat, I mean the artist's genius coming out, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it has to become--everything is involved in the summary regardless to how small it is.  Now, you hear a lot of people today they entertain, but they don't--they don't interpret from the artistic standpoint.  Take for instance Ella Fitzgerald, now she is the one that had a very beautiful voice and she could sing real great and she could thrill you with her singing and that was beautiful.  But then you had a person like Sarah Vaughn who penetrates deeply into the essence of a song and Carmen McRae, those are two people are the greatest, you don't have singers like them anymore.  And then if you ever heard--if you ever heard Leontyne Price, Leontyne Price is known as a supreme opera singer of the world, the Italians call her that.  She could take a character and make it live through her voice.  That's what you call artistry, and it's beautiful, and you sit there, and if you've never heard opera before when a person sing it well and so forth then you would appreciate it.
Story_ID: 57858
Speaker 1: Now we left your career in the Korean War a few minutes ago.  We had to take a little side trip.  Now the Korean war, now how long were you in Korea and did anything, I mean, is there some incident you'd like to describe for us that you haven't talked about yet in Korea?
Speaker 2: Not really, because I was with headquarters and headquarters company they sent me directly to headquarters and headquarters company because of my ability to type and so forth and to do things like that.  I didn't have any prejudice.  You know, a lot of people talk about you know their prejudices and so forth, but I lived in the tent with the captain and the sergeant.  There were three--there were four of us and I was the only black person.  And that was--there really wasn't that difference.  And then I became very important to them because I was the company clerk, and everything had to be perfect.  And the first sergeant he had been over there and he was ready to go, he was tired.  So I helped him with his responsibilities, the things that he was supposed to do.  I went on and did them, it didn't matter to me.  It was just things that had to be done.  And so and I could cut hair and all the--all the officers came down and I would cut their hair for them and so forth.  I even cut General [Lyman]Lemnitzer's hair.  You know who he was?
Speaker 1: Who's that?
Speaker 2: General Lemnitzer, he became the head of the army.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: No.  Wait I'm a try. L-E-M-N-I-T-Z, either I-R or E-R, Lemnitzer.  But he became the general of the army.
Speaker 1: Head of the--
Speaker 2: Whole army.  And so--
Speaker 1: --Did he succeed [Dwight] Eisenhower?
Speaker 2: I think it was after him.  I think it was after him, yes, uh-huh.  Because Eisenhower was--became president while we were in Korea.
Speaker 1: It was in '52 (1952)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I forgot when it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fifty (1950) I guess.
Story_ID: 57859
Speaker 1: But that was a very wonderful experience.  I--I didn't have any unusual experience except there was one thing that I remember was a young white kid by the name of Edgar Eriks [ph.] who was on the further end of--of Korea, and I had met him while we were at Fort Knox.  And one day he saw me in one of the places and then when he was assigned, he came all the way over there to see me and that was really something to have, hitch hiked and whatever the way he got that came over to see and we had shared some very good communications with each other at that particular time.  There was another experience.  See people don't understand the real tremendous relationship that we have with each other.  I was promoted to the new psychiatric section of the army, and one evening they brought a young boy from Detroit [Michigan] down who was--he just wasn't himself, he was really out of it.  And so they couldn't send him back, and--at that particular--they had to wait for a long time.  So I got a chance to know him.  But he had been with his buddy from Detroit [Michigan] all through every phase of the army.  And one night his only friend was killed, was murdered, and he looked over there and saw that boy lying in blood and everything, and he just--he just went--his whole emotional epralibrum(sic)--equilibrium was interrupted and therefore, they brought him down and he wouldn't eat, he wouldn't do anything.  So I would just go in there and, you know, talk to him a little bit.  So then I started bringing his food to him, and I told him I said "well you gotta eat".  So he started eating.  And then one day I told him, I said look, I said "we're sorry that your friend died, but you must be thankful to God that you were spared".  And I said that now, what are you gonna do when you get married and you have children and your wife and everything and something happened, I said you gonna have to take care of it.  And I invited him to go to the movie so until then he hadn't done anything.  So he went to the movie and then I persuaded him to come and go eat with me in the mess hall.  And so eventually he began to get better, but because of his emotional situation, they sent him to Japan so I lost track of him.  I don't know whatever happened to him.  But people don't realize how serious the war is when people die or they're killed or when they are hurt or something like that to one another.  So that was a very interesting experience for me.
Story_ID: 57860
Speaker 1: Now when did you come back to Chicago?
Speaker 2: November 21, 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did you do when you got back, did you continue singing, I guess you continued singing?
Speaker 2: I got right in school because I had the money to go then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know until then, it was working and trying to go, you know and taking two subjects and working with this teacher and that teacher, but then I could go, I could take all the subjects that I needed to take.  And it was a very, very wonderful experience.  I had never heard the beautiful music of [Franz]Schubert, [Johannes] Brahms, and the songs of [Robert] Schumann and so forth.  And I sat there and there were two black girls by the name of Betty Lou Jackson and can't think of her sister's name now, but anyway, both of them were very excellent singers and pianists.  And I listened to them as they--as they performed in vocal pedagogy, not vocal pedagogy, but vocal literature and the other people, and I began to learn those songs.  And Frederick Schauwecker, he was a great accompanist, and I asked him to teach me and I--I didn't know whether he would or not because you know, he was so great and you have to be so fine so he did.  And he was the accompanist to (unclear) and Richard Crooks, they were two great tenor singers.  And another lady--a lady by the name of Clare Dukes, who was--who was married to one of the Swifts, and he took me for two lessons a week.  And sometime he would go over the hours and so I learned the vocal literatures in German, French and the songs of the great masters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was at what school?
Speaker 2: That was at--that was at Chicago Musical College.  See Chicago and Musical College combined together in 1953 or '54 (1954) or something like that.  And so therefore the Chicago Musical College building was torn down and they have another building up there now, so we were studying over at--at Roosevelt University.
Story_ID: 57861
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went on there to get a degree from Chicago Musical College?
Speaker 2: Yes, I got a degree from Chicago Musical College and then I began singing, and you know during that time you know black people weren't given opportunities as they are today and so we had to make our own.  So I got a little friend of mine who was about 15 years old, who could type and so forth and we organized a company called Calhall Artists Bureau.  And so we wrote and I began to get concerts, New York, down in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Orleans, all places like that.  And then we were doing quite well and one January, 1960, I was getting ready to go to a concert and I had a very terrible hurting in my side and it turned out to be a kidney stone, and I had one concert in New York, I had three or four down south, Nashville, Oakwood College, Birmingham, Alabama, and I think it was Texas and so the doctors in the hospital told me I couldn't go.  And I told them, I have to go, and they said, no, and I insisted, and they said that if you go, you will understand that you will never be able to--to come to the army hospitals again, you know, and so forth.  The VA would not work with you.
Story_ID: 57862
Speaker 1: You got this kidney stone and the VA Hospital, the officials are telling you that if you go on this tour, they'll end your coverage because they can't be--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Responsible for your--
Speaker 2: That's right.  So, I was to sing in Nashville for a school that they were working with.  And the man who was in charge, his name was Mr. Steele(ph), and he heard about it and he called and told them that if it's all possible to let me come and do that program.  Now, I never did stop practicing because I had my accompanist, Richard Boger(ph) to come to the hospital and we would practice almost every day so that I would--in case I go, I would be okay, and I would learn how to work with it in case I had an attack.  So--so Mr. Steele called them and told them, see they had a hospital in Nashville called a sanitarium--called The Riverside Sanitarium and Hospital.  So Mr. Steele told them that if they will let me come then they would house me in the hospital until I got ready to sing and they would have the physicians to look after me and so forth.  And at Oakwood [College] they had a doctor down there.  So they let me go on that assumption, and I went down and I did--did the concert in Nashville [Tennessee] and I did the concert in Oakwood College and then I went to Birmingham [Alabama], and we did that, and that was the only time that it ever bothered me.  I was singing a song by [Johann] Bach called "Pond is Master of Us All" and at one point that pain came and I breathed and caught my breath a little bit and I went on my accompanist was right there, he was right there, and no one ever knew.  And so--but we--we got through all the way--all the way through, and then came back and they operated.
Story_ID: 57863
Speaker 1: Now while they were operating, I was recovering because I couldn't sing because you have to use your diaphragm.  So a friend of mine said that why didn't I come and write for the "Courier"?  And so, I said well, you know I would do that, so I went--
Speaker 2: So this is the Pittsburgh Courier?
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh Courier, yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And can you tell us the significance of the Pittsburgh Courier in those days?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  At that particular time Mr. S. B. Fuller, is that his first, S. B. Fuller.  Okay he had bought a section of the Chicago [Illinois] part of the--of the Pittsburgh Courier and it was housed at 2700 South Wabash Avenue.  So I went down and they happened to receive me and I started writing for them.  In the meantime at the same time, I started writing for the Associated Negro Press under Claude Barnett, that's Etta Moten's husband.  And I wrote and my article appeared in all the newspapers all over.  And then I begin to think that there are very few African Americans writing who really know how to criticize the arts and so forth.  They would say, "Oh he--he was--he, you know, he was this and he was that and, or he laid it out on this song and so forth, you know, you using a lot of cliches and things like that.  And so I decided that I would continue writing, but I didn't know the subsequence of writing.  So I called, no, Seymour Raven, who was a critic for the Tribune, but at this particular time, they had called him to become the manager of the Chicago Symphony and he was very--he called me and he told me he said now, are you sure that you want to do this.  He knew of my career and he said that you must understand that if you become a music critic or write in this manner that you would not be able to appear with the Chicago Symphony or sing with the opera or any of these professional groups because they consider it a conflict of interest.  And so I thought about it and then I--I called and told him I was gonna do it.  That's why I did it because I thought that we needed to upgrade our--what we were doing on an artistic level and in every area.  So that's how I started writing.  Well, I wrote for two or three years for the Pittsburgh Courier and one time I wrote about an individual who was singing that wasn't doing a very good job.  And I mentioned it in a very nice way and so this managing editor of the Pittsburgh Courier questioned me.  And I told him, I laid it out to him and I told him why and everything and he said that well, he said from now on, don't put your--your byline.  I said well, I said what's the use of the writing if I can't use my byline?  And they weren't paying me but five dollars anyhow, a week.  So he said well (unclear).  I said well, there's no point in my writing for you, and so I left.
Story_ID: 57864
Speaker 1: And at that time I was writing for, not writing, but I was involved with Charles Levy Circulating Company, you familiar with them.  Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the biggest magazine.
Speaker 1: That's right--
Speaker 2: Newspaper distributor.
Speaker 1: --I was in their circulation, circulation department.  And they--they appreciated me too cause they-- they gave me, what do you call it now, they gave me a part of the profits every year, profit and sharing, whatever it was, and I was the first one to receive that.  And so one day I noticed in the Defender that they didn't have anybody writing and so I went over and talked to Chuck Stone and Chuck Stone told me that I could and I started writing for them, and I wrote for them for four years at no salary at all.  And I didn't care, I didn't care at all, it was something that I thought needed to be done, and for four years I wrote for them.  And then I left Charles Levy Circulating Company and began teaching.  And I taught for three years.  Well, that was pretty good.  In the meantime I was ushering at Orchestra Hall so that I could get a chance--see when you don't have money, you have to figure out ways and means of how you can be able to--to get the things that you need for your life.
Speaker 2: Yes, Sir.  Now this means that you had like how many jobs, now Charles-
Speaker 1: Three.
Speaker 2: --You're writing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Orchestra Hall, that's three.  Okay is that it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.  Then I--then I started--I left Levy and started teaching because see I had--I really had done something for--I had made a contribution to them.  See many times young people don't realize the contributions that they could make to people.  They had one (unclear).  I was there as a (unclear) operator and address all the things that went to all the newspapers and things like that.  So, Mr. Levy came down and--I must say that many people who are in high places are more understanding a lot of times than the people that worked for them.  Now he came down, just came and started talking with me and so forth.  And so he had an idea and I told him that it could be done.  And I said that if you get me a--a (unclear) and make the drum a little larger than this one, I could work both of them, you know.  And so he did.  So next week I had it.  And so they want it for education, they were doing educational things in the school, putting books in the schools and things like that.  But the man who was doing it really didn't know and I had the education.  So I went to him and told him that I would like to be involved in that part of the program.  And he just outright told me no.  So, now I could have gone to Charles Levy because he would give me anything I wanted.  So, but I didn't.  I said that--in my mind, I said that if I go to Charles Levy and they open that, (unclear) and all the people that were involved, I said then I have problems with him.  So I left and I walked over to the Board of Education and signed up to teach and so I left them the next week and started teaching.

Speaker 1: Then the [Chicago] Defender needed someone to write and as I said, I started writing for them.  And as a result, I was able to build it much more than what it was then.  They had a little TV, a TV listing about as large as this card almost, you know.  And so--and there were other things that they weren't addressing.  And I realized that even though you are an African American that there are a lot of things that are open, and I, excuse me, I discovered that we didn't get any ads unless it was a black picture, and at that time it wasn't too many black pictures being made.  So I went to all the movie companies and I told them, I said you send me everything, regardless to what it is, and so therefore we began to get ads and things like that.  So that's the way I began to start writing for the Defender and it has been a very, very wonderful occasion for--for instance we learned to, at least, I met people like Lionel Hampton, you know how a great person he is.  I begin to meet Nat King Cole, Eubie Blake.  I met Eubie Blake, he wrote me a letter.  And a lady by the name of Dr. Eva Jessye, she was with the Hall of--the Hall, not Paul Hall, but the Hall Johnson Choir, and she had her own choir that traveled all over.  And when--
Speaker 2: I thought she lived in Michigan, right?
Speaker 1: --In the last year, she lived in--well she was from Kansas, uh-huh.  Then we--we were able to--to meet these people and help to guide, you know, not guide their careers but let people know who they are.  And then we began to work with people like the Jacksons and some other youngsters and so forth.  The Dells and all of these people and give them the proper recognition that they should.  And the other area of drama, drama was kind of dry then so there was a man by the name of Charles--Charles, can't think of his name, but he wrote "No Place to Be Somebody".
Speaker 2: Charles Gordone?
Speaker 1: That's right, Charles Gordone, yeah.  And I learned that he was coming here with that--with that musical at the Studebaker Theater and so I talked with The Dozens, they had a group called The Dozens, and we got them to let them have the opening night and so they sent me all the material, I called and had them send me all the material, and so we made it a big thing and then other plays came in.  And with The Dozens they began to do it.  By that time the local people began to develop like Kuumba Workshop and so forth, they began, that--I think that group was one of the earliest during that particular time.  But at the same time over at--over at the Parkway Community House they were doing plays under Hull House, and they had very fine black actors, they had directors and so forth and so they began to develop.
Speaker 2: That was Clarence Taylor and (unclear).
Speaker 1: No, that was before then.
Speaker 2: That was before then?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that was--that was many years before that.
Story_ID: 57866
Speaker 1: And so then eta began to develop.  They started down on Michigan Avenue and--and then they went out to the--to the YWCA on--on near Cottage Grove and they began from there.  And so I was happy to work with all of these elements.  We also had dance that outside of Sunny Dyer, we had very few dance companies.  One of them was Swain, Julian Swain, his dance company, now I worked with them.  I used to go up there, watched them and write about them.  And then we had Blackwell, Darlene Blackwell.
Speaker 2: Blackburn.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Blackburn.
Speaker 1: Blackburn, I'm sorry, Blackburn, that's right, Blackburn.  And from there came Joseph Homes and then now we have Muntu and we have a lot of dance organizations that are--that are in the city so that Chicago [Illinois] has a very viable cultural African American community that I would say that is better than any other in the United States.  And I'm very happy to be involved with them.  And then we had a young man by the name of Mr. Chuck Smith who has become one of the most tremendous director and producer in this country, he is.  And I have seen him develop from the time that he was a youngster over at Michael Reese Hospital to becoming an assistant or associate a director for--for Goodman Theater, and in Africa and in many other parts of the United States.  Not only him but there are others who are making themselves felt and therefore African Americans who have talent and who have the ability are able to grow and develop, thus helping our society, our community to become more viable in every--if you notice every time you turn around now all these other theaters got our--our producers and our plays and everything.  Just like Goodman, every year they produces several African American productions and so forth.  And the artists, did the same thing.  We established--we established black esthetics.  Today they call it black creativity.
Story_ID: 57867
Speaker 1: But I kept talking to the people at the Chicago Defender to have a festival of the arts, you know.  And Mr. Martin listened to me and I went over and talked to Mr. MacMaster, who was head of the Museum of Science and Industry because they were not using the west wing at all and during the late '60s (1960s), we had a lot of activities in the arts that were going on, but we didn't have the places where they could really do it.  The artists were doing it on the street and so forth.  And so Mr. MacMaster listened to me and had me to come and talk to his--his committee, his people, and they decided that we could do it.  So in 1970 we started black esthetics, it was difficult, but we did it.  And a Mr. (unclear) gave us $500 to do it with and--and we did it for an entire month in February.  And the young people came and they could see various facets of our art every day whenever they would want to come.  And so we--I'm still trying to--to bring African Americans to the heights of their ability.  And I for one, I don't write that this is black and this is the other, I write as they are artists, just as--just as comparable to any other group that is out there.  And I go to listen to them when I go and hear, she's dead now, but [Elisabeth] Schwarzkopf.  If I go and hear any of the white singers, I come out here and listen to these people as singers, not as a black singer.  And because they're black anyhow, I don't have to worry about that, but we listen to their ability and what they are able to project.  It's the same thing in drama, when you stop to consider what our African Americans do and they don't have anything to do with it, I go out and I see them, they don't have all the money that they can make big stages and things like that, but they use what they have and they do very excellent work, they work all day and they come and act in the evening, and they do very well, so I'm very happy to be a part of all of that.
Story_ID: 57868
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned starting a black aesthetic, which was like Festival of the Arts at the Museum of Science and Industry that they ran for a number of years, and now they call it Black Creativity, but philosophically, do you think there is such a thing as a black esthetic or a black creative style?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, very definitely.  Just as there are Jewish elements and so forth that reflect their tradition, you see, just as there are the Russians who--who have their sounds and so forth in music, now there's a difference between the Russian sound and the Jewish sound, a difference between the Russian and the German because of their various elements and how the musicians, you know, use their various elements, their folk songs.  See they may take their folk songs and use them and turn them into symphonic groups, like Kodaly he's Hungarian, I think.  All right, now he took their--his music and--his folk music and utilized them and so forth, and he built all kinds of movements, sounds and so forth.  And so we have that too.  Now there're two areas of African American music that we have.  In fact there's a lot more, but let's just deal with--from Africa, the music of Africa.  Now there are subtle differences between all the nations of Africa.  See when people think of Africa, they just think as one, but it isn't, there--there are the Kenyons, the Nige, not Nigerians but the--but just all kinds of different nations in Africa and there are difference--differences in their styles and the way that they beat their music, rhythmic and so forth.  And then we have the African American who has taken some of their things that began with the slave, the slave songs.  And then as we lived in America, we achieved our own that was different even from the African, see.  So our Jazz and things like that it's entirely different from that of Africa, and you listen to it and you find that there's that difference.  Also in our drama we take the essence of our traditions and formulize them.  You know in the old time there used to have the dramas in the churches.  I've seen them, you haven't seen them, but I've seen them the dramas in the churches, right upon the pulpit, you know, and they were wonderful, beautiful.  All right we have taken those, we have taken things that we have dealt with, the sufferings and so forth and we have put them into--into our--our dramas.  And the same thing goes with the--with the art, there is definitely a school of art that has developed and it started back in the 1968, and so we were able to project these kinds of things in black esthetics.
Story_ID: 57869
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask, you mentioned 1968 it seemed to be like sort of a cultural change around 1968 in the black community, can you expound on that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There was a definite change, some for the better and some not so good.  You see before that time there were a few, a very, very, very few African Americans who were--who were actually singing, playing on the top levels and so forth.  Even the jazz people were playing in joints, let's say.  Our dancers were just playing anywhere, you know, now they are playing and touring in the big houses and so forth.  So after 19, I would say, '60s (1960s), the late '60s (1960s) that began to happen because they were crying for equality, and they didn't just cry, but they moved out through the arts, and the arts took on, took on a different perspective and so therefore we have top-notched people who are doing things now.  We have people who are creating dancers like Arthur Mitchell with the Valley Theater--Dance Theater of Harlem [New York City, New York] who went to Africa, South Africa, and he heard a chamber music work that had elements of Africa, but it wasn't the same as the traditional African music that we only hear, so he created a ballet, and it was good, which happened here about two or three weeks ago.  Our artists, they were drawing things with their fists and things like that and so forth and people with the big naturals and so forth, but during that time, they began to use textures, they began to picture the African, I mean the American as a real beautiful person and so in our poetry, whereas our poetry had a same, kind of a sing song situation, now it is free, and they talk about the inner--the inner self, they talk about their relationship with spirituality and all those kinds of things that has happened, so that we have definite schools, I might say, in poetry, in our literature and so forth, and we are continuing to develop.
Story_ID: 57870
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you have a tremendous responsibility as a cultural art critic for a paper like the Defender because you're the only one, and  yet you've got to render critique of jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, dance, theater, how do you manage to keep up with all that?
Speaker 2: Education is the key.  When you go to school, I don't think one should just deal with one facet of learning, he should be able to do it--do it all, and I was influenced greatly by Dr. Eva B. Dykes, as I mentioned before.  Now she could play a piano, and anybody came that she could sit down and accompany them.  She took us as a group of young people and taught us how to sing choral music, making us get up at five o'clock in the morning to come and practice.  But, her degree was in English, that's what her doctor degree was.  But she had all of those other elements, and so we began to learn that.  And when I came to Chicago, I went and learned about Joseph Holmes' style, I learned about Muntu, I went to see Hall dance, I used to go in and watch him dance, I used to go and watch all the dance companies and so forth.  And likewise, I was involved with those people who were in drama, not as a matter of criticizing them, but going to enjoy, and to learn.  And so, but you would have to study because all of the arts have the similarity, you know.  So like, I used to go over there and watch Katherine Dunham.  Now she has a style that's different from others, and so when you go and you watch that, then you can see.  Sammy Dyer whose works are continuing, whose style is continuing now, he has a very flaring style, and so you have to go and be able to watch them and be able to--to interpret them to your best ability.
Story_ID: 57871
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your writing style has always been described as verbose.  They use a lot of words, a lot of multisyllable words and you really enjoy using them apparently.  Can you comment on that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I directed a choir for a number of years of teenagers and I have 70 in that choir and I kept them for almost from the '60s (1960s), no the '50s (1950s), 1954 up until 1973 or something like that.  And I learned that if you lift their aspiration just a little bit higher then they will learn and they will feel their pride.  You see our African American people, they may act crazy, I know some, but they have a lot of intelligence.  And so what I tried to do is to write so that it would be understood but yet just a little bit higher so that they could lift their aspirations.  And then you have to understand that music, you can't--you have to use all kinds of elements to describe music cause you really can't, you know.  Drama is different because you can--you can deal with the person's emotions, are they really getting into the emotions of their characters, you know, and so that what's that is about, and the relationship of people with each other and how this person's attributes affects the other and if their problems whether they--one will have the unselfishness about him or her to--to let it dissolve you know.  So and in dance there are various styles, there are the French style, there are the Russian style and then there are the styles of the people in England, the Royal Ballet and so forth.  And so, like [George] Balachine, he has a different kind of a style that he uses which the ballet, the Harlem Ballet Company has achieved, and so you have to be able to do that.  But I spent time going to these places, I went quite a few times, not a few times, but almost weekly to look at Ruth Page [Center for the Arts], and I used to go over and look at the Hubbard Street Ballet people to see what they were doing and so forth.  So, and besides, you know reading and studying and so forth, you will be able to pick it up.  And somehow once you have that artistic ability, like a man who is a, like Chuck, for instance, if he doesn't mind, sure he's in drama, but he knows whether you're singing right or whether you're not, because he has that all carries through to a certain extent.  And so that's the best that I can explain it.
Story_ID: 57872
Speaker 1: What's the most impressive performance you've ever witnessed in Chicago, or is there one that really stands out to you, the most impressive performance by some black person here in the City of Chicago that you were able to cover?
Speaker 2: That's difficult.
Speaker 1: I know it's a tough question.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't.  There have been many who have been tremendous and--and I've appreciated them.  Now, if I had known you were going to ask it, I would have written some down so--but I can't think of any right now by name.
Speaker 1: Maybe I should say this.  Maybe I should ask this, out of all of our home-grown Chicago artists you know, who do you think of being the most impressive ones over the years that we've seen here, locally?
Speaker 2: What are you trying to do put me on the spot? Well, let's put it like this, there are times when maybe eta [Creative Arts Foundation] may do something very, very, very outstanding and that will depend upon the talent that it has and the director and so forth.  And at Goodman [Theatre], we may have some of our individuals doing a fantastic job.  Now I'll tell you one, "Raisin in the Sun" was done differently from all the other Raisins in the Sun that I had seen.
Speaker 1: The one at the Goodman [Theatre]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Recently, about two or three years ago, I guess it was two or three years ago, they did one.  And I--I liked what they did with it.  And they brought it home you know, it wasn't far away, they brought it right home and I appreciated that.  Sometimes Black Ensemble does some fantastic things.  She has developed what I call a cantata portrait by taking musicians and giving a brief theatrical concept of what they are and what they did and what they accomplished, and that's good because it helps people to remember who they are and what they went through to accomplish what they wished to.  So that's a very difficult question to ask, but each one of them have their own individuality according to the director and the producer you know, even though--even though a great writer might pen work, it is up to the director to bring the kind of perception to make it live.  That's all I can say about that, I think, you know.
Story_ID: 57873
Speaker 1: Now, you have a reputation of being extremely generous in your coverage of art schools in terms of, you don't offend them, usually they're not offended by what you write, but there's so much art going on in the City of Chicago, it must be a lot of pressure to try to cover all of it, you know.  How do you manage that?
Speaker 2: Well, that's perception.  When I was--a Dr. Otis B. Edwards at Oakwood College, when I was a little boy, he said something that I never forgot.  He said that when someone does something extremely bad, find something that you can say about their performance.  For instance, if a person gets up and sings a terrible song, I mean, his singing is terrible, you can come up to him and say, "My that is a beautiful song".  Now he isn't aware of the fact that you're saying nothing about him, you see what I mean.  So I do that.  I may say something about an individual.  I may say that his--his walk, his speech might have been good, but I never--I didn't say how he really did it, but there are sometimes when I do, I do.  I think that a critic should be objective.  Yes, I think he should tell the truth, but I don't think he should go and just tear somebody down, you know, just because he's a critic.  I perform myself so I know how it feels. But that's why it--they don't--they don't perceive really what I've said.  Just a few weeks ago, I got a very, very, very, I would say, terrible letter.  There was a group that was doing African American spirituals and I merely said that they didn't have the spirituality in the African American spirituals, nor the real understanding of what they were about.  They sang well, but they didn't have that you know as I or you.  I didn't--I didn't say that now, but they just couldn't sing the African Americans like we sing them, and they didn't have any enthusiasm in it at all, and they lambasted me.  So, but, I don't know, sometimes you want to really get through, however, like I said I try to find something that will encourage our entertainers, and at the same time, let em know that they can do it a little better.
Story_ID: 57874
Speaker 1: There's a new culture, I expect it's almost old now, Hip Hop culture has gotten a great deal of attention and books are now being written about Hip Hop culture and the black performers in Hip Hop culture, poetry and you got music and you got you know Hip Hop writing and there's a Hip Hop aesthetics out here, what do you think about that, do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: That's nothing new.  See the old jazz people have done that before.  You have Red--Red Saunders who was doing that with the Hambone, you know.  How many years ago was that, that was in the '50s (1950s), I think, or something like that.  You have many of the Hip Hop exponents of today going back picking up from where our people of the '30s (1930s) and the '40s (1940s) were doing, you know.  Now, that's all right, but when you stop and think of culture, you must ask yourself, what is culture.  As far as I am able to understand it, it is those elements, or it is the result of those good elements that are in us to make our talents and our acting and whatever we do the best.  Now, people call it culture, but many times in the way that people speak and in the way that they use the language is not--is not as comfortable as it should be.  Now, I'm not speaking of using some maybe, well let's use it commonly, curse words.  If they're used in the proper manner within the perspectum of what a drama or what a song is talking about, but today, many of our young people just use the same old thing over and over and over and over again, and they're not bringing the proper respect, even to our women that they could.  And so I think that we should take into consideration what we're doing.  But some of those individuals are doing it for the almighty dollar, rather than for the culture of the art.
Story_ID: 57875
Speaker 1: I just want then to ask you a couple of final questions.  One is, and I know you're not, you know, you've been writing a long time, but you still have some time left, but what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: Well, the most important one is that we have endeavored to give to the African American the same kind of artful consideration that we would give anybody else.  And in many instances we go a step further to say what it is.  For instance, if I may just make one example, there's a young man by the name of Carlos, I can't think of Carlos' last name right now, but he's dancing with the American Ballet Theater, but they will not say that he is a great tremendous ballet dancer, comparable to [Rudolf] Nureyev, [Mikhail] Baryshnikov, I'm gonna say it, but he is, and we said it.  How many times would you hear people of the establishment say about the tremendous work that these young people are doing at the--at the Goodman [Theatre], you don't do it, but we do, and that's the thing that we're very happy that we hope the people will recognize that we give to the individuals their proper due.
Story_ID: 57876
Speaker 1: Now, what would you like to see next on the Chicago cultural scene?
Speaker 2: I would like to see the classical music, the classical compositions and those individuals who play and study a long time and be recognized and promoted.  Now we are doing all of that.  Our drama has come a long ways, and it's doing fine.  There's still room, there's always room for improvement, but the--the African American composers, those that sing, they spend a lot of time for years and yeas and we, as a people, are not recognizing them.  The other thing I would like to see African Americans really support their art.  They're doing all right, a little bit, you know, but not really as they should be.
Story_ID: 57877
Speaker 1: When you talk about black celebrities, sports celebrities and entertainment celebrities and artistic celebrities, I think that there's a tendency for them to stay away from black people.  They get further and further away, the greater they get.  And you were just talking about how that as a problem in the community, they are not available, can you continue?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When you come to the place where you are really acclaimed, why can't you become associated with us?  You don't have to live with us or anything like that, but be recognizable.  I see many of them come in and it's down at the hotel, you know, that's fine.  And you may ask them to come and do something or participate in something, they have to go to somebody else before they--before they can--they can do that, you know.  But I think that it would be better and they would have more support from the community at large if they would be more sociable with them.
Story_ID: 57878
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's a couple of last questions.  The first one is, did your mother ever get a chance to see you as a writer or what did she think about your career having started from such a humble place?
Speaker 2: My mother, she appreciated it even though she didn't always let me know.  She used to make fun of me sometimes, say, "You ain't doing nothing but pushing that pencil down there," you know.  But she appreciated it, and I think she would do that so I wouldn't get, as she said, too high and mighty, you know.  And she was a very fine woman.  She played the violin herself, and she sang.  So that she understood and she was a very, very wonderful mother to me, and I never, never forget the sacrifices that she made in order to make me the man that I am.  And you better believe it, she just didn't talk.  When, I remember one time I--she was saying something to me and I thought, well it wasn't what she should have said, and so she was gonna whip me, and I told her don't you think that I'm a little old for you to be whipping with the switch.  So she threw the switch down and got the broom handle, so I never spoke in that manner again.  She was very, very, very interested in the children and I didn't realize that she knew all the people or most of the people in the church that she attended.  I would come and she would ask me about this person and that person and I would hardly know them, but she knew them, and that taught me a lesson that you be conversant and be aware and show your appreciation to all the people who are around you.
Story_ID: 57879
Speaker 1: All right one last quick question.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just as a friend.  That's the greatest thing that anybody can exhibit toward another person.  It's just being a friend, a friend to the artist, a friend to the dancer, you know, and work with them.  I'm working with a youngster now and he's not related to me, I just happen to know him, but he has a beautiful voice and representing him in a concert.  There's a young man who had a problem with getting his GED, we had to keep after him, you know.  There's a young lady who has one of the most gorgeous voices that you ever want to hear. I'm just a friend, but I want to see her make it and therefore whatever that I can do, I would like to do.
