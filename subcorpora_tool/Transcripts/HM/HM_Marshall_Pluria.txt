Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.

Story_ID: 648277
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It is Olivia Faye Marshall [Olivia Pleasant Marshall].  And Olivia is O-L-I-V-I-A, and Faye, F-A-Y-E, and Marshall.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, it's November the 5th, and the actual date, she's seventy-five this year, so I think that would, '38 [1938], is that right?  I have to look, but it's November 5th, though, definitely.
Speaker 1: It's 1938?
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight [1938], I think that's right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: All right, now, how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: You know, I haven't done a lot of genealogy and all on either side of the family.  Obviously, we have cousins that are working on the lineage and things of that sort.  My mother was born in Houston.  My grandmother was born in Navasota, Texas.  And that's about as far as I can go at this point.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories of, from your family of slavery or emancipation or Reconstruction or Juneteenth or any of that, you know?
Speaker 2: You know, not any stories that I can recall.  Once again, I'd have to call, call my mom and call my cousins and say, "Hey, kind of where are we?"  This has been an ongoing project.  You know, one cousin has been working on it.  And then we've recently had my mom's aunt pass from Los Angeles [California]--she was living here in Los Angeles.  And so another cousin came and said, "Oh, you know, she's working on things."  So we're trying to get the genealogy completed.
Speaker 1: Okay, any sense that relatives on your mother's side lived anywhere other than Houston?
Speaker 2: Well Houston, and then Navasota.
Speaker 1: Okay, this would be a rural, I mean the suburbs of--
Speaker 2: Well, Navasota is actually, strangely enough, it's--you know, Texas is obviously a pretty large state, a thousand miles wide and fifteen hundred miles long.  Navasota is kind of Central Texas.  I know it's strange to say South Central Texas, but it's closer to Houston versus Dallas [Texas].  I mean Houston and Dallas are about 250 miles apart.  And so actually, the radio station that I owned [KHRN Radio; KVJM Radio] and is licensed to Hearne, Texas, but we served Bryan-College Station [Texas] market.  Navasota was a fork.  You know, we'd hit off of 290 [U.S. Route 290]--there's a couple of ways to get there.  But Navasota was a town that I actually drive through going to my radio station up in Bryan-College Station.
Speaker 1: Oh, Bryan-Colle- that's where Texas A&M [Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Texas A&M, correct, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 648278
Speaker 1: So is there any story at all about the family like moving to Houston [Texas], or how your mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall], you know, got to Houston?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, I mean back, way back then, obviously everybody wanted to move from the little small town [Navasota, Texas] to Houston.  And my grandmother moved when she was, you know, young.  And the family settled in what we call Third Ward.  And, you know, she grew up and had a pretty, you know, normal life and everything.  Of course, met my grandfather and had a passel of children.  There's ten total on my mom's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, what did your grandparents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was a beautician, and my grandfather was a barber.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that--they kind of go together.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  So what did your mother say about growing up in the Third Ward of Houston?
Speaker 2: You know, it was--this was when the black community was pretty tight, pretty tight knit.  Yeah, I've heard stories of, you know, Nat King Cole, you know, being engaged, involved in different activities within the community.
Speaker 1: Did he live there in the--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure if he lived there or not, but my mother was a music teacher.  And then she got her master's [degree] in counseling.  And so I just can, I can remember her saying--because, you know, back then, I mean everybody knew everybody.  And if you came through a city, you know, typically, you know, based on the time, you couldn't stay in the hotels.  So you end up having to stay with someone, some, you know, friends.  I'm sure you've heard tons of that from in the South.  And I mean that's the one name that kind of rings true, Nat King Cole, and, you know, his involvement in the, you know, in the black community in Houston.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's something 'cause I know he went to high school in Chicago [Illinois], and supposedly grew up in Chicago.  I don't know all the details about him, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so he has a strong connection in Houston.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if I'd say strong, but I mean, it's, that's just something that she would mention, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, and, well, it was strong--as you were saying, the communities were a lot tighter in those days.
Speaker 2: Right, well, yeah, I mean even I'm fifty-one, and I mean typically you went to a elementary school or middle school and high school.  And, you know, the old saying, you know, if you did something wrong at school, you got in trouble at school.  And then if you do something, in trouble in the neighborhood, everybody would know.  And, you know, it was a lot more community based.  I mean people would really look after one another.  And, you know, you'd get in trouble with your mom, your dad, the principal, everybody, 'cause they were all friends, you know.  I mean a lot of black people in Houston were educators.  And that was the--educators and doctors were our, you know, probably the, the more well-to-do people in, in, in town.
Story_ID: 648279
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] go to Phillis Wheatley [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas]?  Is that the one?
Speaker 2: No, she went to Yates.
Speaker 1: Yates, Jack Yates [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Jack Yates, Jack Yates, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's Third Ward [Houston, Texas] and Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas], so.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yates would play Wheatley, and those were the big rivalries.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she majored in music, and did she go on to college and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University].
Speaker 1: That's right there in Houston [Texas] as well.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did she have any stories about college days at Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: Well, just, you know, I mean it was a nice little, small black college [HBCU], and, you know, she enjoyed music and played the piano and the violin, and very musically inclined.  Obviously, my grandmother and my grandfather were in the choir.  My mother's maiden name is Pleasant.  So Reverend Pleasant had a pretty large church in Houston--
Speaker 1: Is this her father?
Speaker 2: No, this would have been like a cousin 'cause it would have been on my grandfather's side.  Pleasant is a maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a--did Reverend Pleasant have a fairly large church?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: You're gonna make me--I wanna say it was St. John [St. John Missionary Baptist Church, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: It's a Baptist church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, okay, did your mother go on to teach music?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a music teacher, and, you know, obviously, education is real big in our family.  So, you know, she decided to improve her degree, if you will, and she got her, her master's [degree] in, in counseling.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did she get it right there at Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 648280
Speaker 1: Let me go on to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's Pluria William Marshall, Sr. [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Obviously, junior.  So same spelling as mine.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind the name Pluria?
Speaker 2: You know, my father was named after his great uncle, and it's Greek-Latin in origin, you know.  Where his great aunt came up with the name, you know, we don't have a clue (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've never heard it before, but--
Speaker 2: Well, it's, you know, there's plural, pleurisy, pluribus, the P-L-U-R.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, Pluria William Marshall, Sr.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 19th--he's seventy-six now, so I guess he'd be '37 [1937], 1937.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, in Houston as well.  Now, once again, how far back can you trace them and do they have some origins in some other part of the country?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  I mean I--once again, I have to, I've talked to my dad about it.  And, once again, we have, you know, cousins that have been working on things.  And I'm not sure where they are right now.  My father's, my grandmother [Fannie Hughes Marshall] on my dad's side was from Brookshire, Texas.  And that's not too far south of, of Houston.
Story_ID: 648281
Speaker 1: --So and are there any stories about, you know, you know, slavery or Reconstruction or Juneteenth or any of the Texas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, you know my, my, my father is a, is a civil rights activist.  He started out with Operation Breadbasket in Houston [Texas], which was Reverend Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] kind of predecessor group to Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois].  And if you Google Pluria Marshall [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.], you--and put in Houston, you'll get a ton of footage stories.  He was always fighting for the small guy, you know.  I can remember hearing stories, you know, from him directly and from other people that talked about how the Schlitz beer [Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company] was a beer down south and how the black drivers that drove the trucks would deliver twice the beer and get half the pay.  And Borden Milk [Borden Milk Products], just did a lot of things.  I mean I finally remember being about ten years old on a picket line in Houston because there was a Burger King that was built.  And Burger King said, "Oh, we can't find any black people that are qualified to own a franchise."  And so, you know, we had doctors, lawyers, businesspeople.  It was a group that, you know, could probably write a check singularly and they collectively had come together to acquire this Burger King.  And Burger King said no.  So the store was on Wheeler [Avenue] and Almeda [Road], about a block off of Almeda (laughter).  And so my dad said, "Well, you will sell no burgers in Houston.  You will sell no burgers here."  And we put up a picket line on one--obviously, the side of the street that was owned by the city.  And they sold no burgers.  They sold that Burger King to a group of, you know, black investors.  So that's things that, as I said, from age ten, my dad has always been--he's a photographer by training.  And tentatively, so am I, and so he would, you know, he's just a, he's just a great guy.  I always tell the story.  My father will, will give you the shirt off of his back.  I'll sell you mine.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), okay a little bit different from--
Speaker 2: A little bit different, right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: No- now--
Story_ID: 648282
Speaker 1: What did your dad's parents do?
Speaker 2: My, my, my grandmother [Fannie Hughes Marshall] on my dad's side was a teacher.  So she's an educator.  And my grandfather [Hugh Marshall] worked for the railroad.  So he would travel between Houston [Texas] and Louisiana quite a bit, freight railroad.  So, you know, he was always on the road.  (Laughter) I always have a vivid memory of my grandfather because he smoked cigars.  He would have that proverbial little butt of a cigar in his mouth.  That's why I do not like cigars today (laughter).  I know everybody, they're all the rage.  But I, I can still smell that cigar at this point, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so he worked for the railroad.
Story_ID: 648283
Speaker 1: And your dad [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.], now, now, where--did, did he go to college too (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, so he went to Texas Southern.  He would have been there back in the days of, gosh, there's a lot of--well, Texas Southern has a rich history.
Speaker 2: Oh, without a doubt, without a doubt, yes.
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories about Texas Southern and some of the professors down there?  I think James Farmer's father [James L. Farmer, Sr.] taught there for a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I, you know, we really didn't, I mean we would talk more about, obviously, once he was out of college and everything.  So I mean no real stories about--I'll let you guys ask him directly about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he lives in Silver Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Silver Spring, Maryland?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he knows Herb [HistoryMaker Herbert P. Wilkins, Sr.] and the entire, you know, would be banking community that served black media folks (laughter).  So.
Speaker 1: All right, so do you know, I guess, who some of your dad's mentors were at Texas Southern or--?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  You know, I'm, I'm not sure mentor wise, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't know any.
Story_ID: 648284
Speaker 1: Is there a story about why he, he became engaged in civil rights the way he was 'cause a lot of people grew up in those days and weren't engaged in it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my, my father, you know, I mean he's, he's just passionate about helping people, you know.  And it really interesting because he would literally--Operation Breadbasket was a, obviously, it's a nonprofit.  And they would survive off of donations.  But he would literally get people jobs, you know.  If he'd go to battle with the folks from Borden Milk [Borden Milk Products] or Schlitz [Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company] or whatever, he'd get these guys their jobs back or get them raises or whatever, and he'd ask 'em for, "Hey, guys, can you help out, you know, my organization."  And they'd go, "Oh, Pluria [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.], I just got my job back, and I gotta pay my bills and I gotta do this, gotta do that."  And, you know, they basically said, no.  And, yeah, I'd say, well, dude, you had no job.  You know, how can you not support the organization that got you your job back, got you your raise or whatever.  And it was just a mixed bag.  And it's, you know, as a kid, you know, I don't know this stuff, you know.  But as an adult, it just, it wasn't a business model that was sustainable.  You have to get people that will support you.  And a lot of his support came from folks that didn't look like him.
Speaker 1: Okay, we interviewed Henry Brown [HistoryMaker Henry H. Brown] in Houston [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: --at Anheuser-Busch [Anheuser-Busch Companies]--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  I know Henry.  As a matter fact, his, he owns a home that's catty-cornered to my grandmother's home that I still own in Houston.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean he was detailing some of the struggle at Anheuser-Busch.  I think he was the first black sales rep there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, rep, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your father, now, he's--did he start with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or did--it wasn't with Bread basket or was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it was, as far as I know, yeah, and it was the whole movement with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and how Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] came up with Operation, you know, Breadbasket, you know.  That's up to, you know, I'm sure he can give you the full background on that.  But, and, you know, my father obviously knows Reverend Jackson, and, you know, all his contemporaries.  And, you know, Houston had an interesting, when the, if you will, the sit-ins were happening at the lunch counters, there was, a documentary of that was made called 'The Strange Demise of Jim Crow,' 'The Strange Demise of Jim Crow.'  And essentially, way back in the day, if you will, the dominant advertiser was a company called Foley's [Foley Brothers Dry Goods Company, Houston, Texas].  It's a department store.  Now, it's, was bought by Macy's [Macy's, Inc.].  And Houston did not want the riot issue and the problems that had happened across the country.  And so the guy from Foley's basically called the TV and the radio folks in and said, "Look, we don't have this in Houston."  And so they got with some of the black leaders.  And so they made sure that very little was shown on TV, very little was written in the newspapers.  And so they didn't have the, you know, the violence.  And this is actually a documentary that you guys can probably find.  And some folks would say, and I concur, that, you know, some of the black leaders sold out 'cause they, you know, they wanted to keep the peace, essentially.  And I'm sure their pockets were lined in some way, shape, form or fashion.  So Houston didn't have the challenges that, you know, the Deep South was having.
Speaker 1: So, the transition to integration, say in a department store, where oftentimes, there are no black employees or their significance is set in the lowest help, you know, and that sort of thing, can--I suppose even how they treated customers and what customers had access to and that sort of thing, happened in a gradual way--
Speaker 2: Right, correct.
Speaker 1: --in Houston in terms of, similar to what I read about Atlanta [Georgia]--well, Atlanta was a little bit more contentious (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A little bit (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --but there are other cities in the South where they really didn't want all that noise, so they just kind of--
Speaker 2: Right, they just, they did that.  I mean, and it's, you know, from a business standpoint, I mean I get it.  I understand it, but from a community standpoint, I mean it's tough.  I mean you're, I mean, heck, you had Juneteenth, you know, the 19th of June which is when, you know, the slaves were officially--well, word got to Texas, basically, you know.  And it's, once again, it's all about money.  You can't turn the slaves loose in January, and you got crops to, to plant and, you know, and then do all the things that need to be done.  So, you know, everything revolves around money one way--in one way, shape, form or fashion.
Story_ID: 648285
Speaker 1: Now your father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.], before we get off of him, he, he was the founder of national, the National Black Media Coalition, right; or one of the founders (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Right, he was one of the founders of the National Black Media Coalition, and he was also one of founders of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].
Speaker 1: So was he--I know he was a photographer.  Was he operating as a photo journalist then or as a (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, a photographer, yes.
Speaker 1: And did he start, did he contribute or start a paper or anything himself?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  My father obviously shot photos for all the black papers in Houston [Texas], the Informer and Texas Freeman [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman] and the Forward Times [Houston Forward Times].  You know, I mean he was a photographer.  So, but, no, he's never owned a media property.
Speaker 1: Okay, in terms of his photography, just because he's got such a rich history, are there any photos or, you know, signature photos of his that have been (unclear)?
Speaker 2: You know, I would, I can't think of any, but he shot everybody, you know.  So, but I mean it's not something that is a huge part of life.  He's now obviously, folks that know him, know that he's a photographer.  But, you know, I can't think of anything that, you know, kind of stands out.  You know, I mean he did a lot of conventions, and, you know, he would do the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] and the Alphas and, you know, conventions of that sort 'cause these were back in the days where you would be at an event; you know, as a photographer you take photos.  You process the pictures.  People buy 'em, you know.  That, that was the way we recorded our history.
Story_ID: 648286
Speaker 1: Okay, so your, your father's [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] and so was your mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did they meet there, or is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's interesting.  I mean I--they were obviously at, at Texas Southern at the same time.  And, no, that's a question I'll have to ask my mom, you know, (laughter), so.  They were divorced when I was ten, so, you know, I mean I'm assuming that obviously, they're at the same college, so that's where they met.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, there's a story there somewhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere, right.
Speaker 1: One of 'em knows it, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or they may have two different versions of it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, of course.
Story_ID: 648287
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, how they walk, talk, look, sense of humor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what they're interested in, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would probably say, my father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] has a pretty strong personality, a bit of a temper.  I definitely get that from him, and, you know, drive and determination and, obviously, both of them have that.  I think probably with the sensibi- the sensibilities about myself, I, I get from my mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall].
Story_ID: 648288
Speaker 1: Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a sister, Mishka, M-I-S-H-K-A, Marshall [Mishka Marshall].  She's a labor lawyer in Phoenix [Arizona].
Speaker 1: And is she younger or older?
Speaker 2: She's younger. She's four years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so just one sister, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you all were raised together?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Now, I take it you were raised by your mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] primarily then if you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Primarily, yes, yes.  My mother, and then when my grandfather died, my mom's dad, I wanna say in '71 [1971], there were nine surviving siblings on my mom's side.  And seven of them were in California, between Northern and Southern California.  So my mother and her brother, the youngest boy, were still in Houston.  So as it would, you know, happens in most cases, most families, when my grandfather died, my grandmother moved in with my mother and my sister and I in Houston.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, but you saw your father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] quite--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes, yeah.  Yeah, it wasn't the, like today's, with, you know, with divorces where the parents split and then the father is nowhere to be found.  I mean my dad, I mean I'd see him, you know, three or four times a week.  He'd go to football games.  I'd tag along, you know, with him.  And so, yeah, so it, it--you know, while I'm a kid, then obviously, my parents are not living together, there was full engagement on, on both parents' parts.
Story_ID: 648289
Speaker 1: You said, tag along, he, he was shooting football games?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah, he'd shoot football games.  He'd shoot the, the, the, I guess--I think the, the biggest thing that I, I would remember would--I remember as a kid, I--was going over to the Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] and Grambling, Grambling University [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], coached by a legendary coach, Eddie Robinson.  And I can just remember going to those games, and he's shooting, and I'm, you know, I'm--there's a term called a grip.  Of course, you guys know what that is.  I was his grip.  You know, so I'd get the film and, you know, and pass it back and forth, and just, you know, I'm a kid having fun with his dad [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah, so did you often have access to places that you wouldn't ordinarily, I mean a kid wouldn't be at, you know, because of your father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I can remember one case where we met The Jackson 5 at the time, at the, I think it was the Westin Hotel in Houston [Texas].  And there's a legendary doctor, Dr. John B. Coleman was doing concerts and things of that sort.  And he brought The Jackson 5 to Houston.  And, yeah, it was a, you know, private setting, and akin to a press conference probably.  And, you know, we had a chance to, you know, meet them.  I'm sure there's probably a photo somewhere 'cause my dad was, you know, shooting that also.
Speaker 1: Now, you, if I'm correct, you'd be about the same age as Michael Jackson, right, pretty close?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's maybe a few, a couple of years older.  I'm fifty-one so I guess he's probably--would be fifty-four or fifty-five maybe or so?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause he died when he was fifty, I think, right?
Speaker 2: Right, I think so.  That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: I just, so you were actually looking up to Michael Jackson, but almost on that same level (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, true, true, yeah, yeah, you know.  Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: So that would have been a big thrill, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, 'cause I mean, you know, you got this hot group and there was, I wanna say the concert was at the, oh, my god.  It was a coliseum, maybe just the coliseum [Sam Houston Coliseum] in downtown Houston.  So, and, you know, it was--it was fun times, you know.
Story_ID: 648290
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest as far as?
Speaker 1: Anything.  The first thing that you can ever remember?
Speaker 2: (Pause) My earliest childhood memory.  I can, I can remember going to my--actually, both my grandparents'.  My father's mother, my father's parents [Fannie Hughes Marshall and Hugh Marshall] lived across the street from what is now Jack Yates High School [Houston, Texas].  And when my father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] decided he wanted to be a photographer, his, you know, his parents built the studio in front of the house, you know.  So you have the house, and then they have the studio, you know.  It was connected, obviously, by a door.  And I can remember going to my grandparents' house, both grandparents, and climbing a tree.  There was a tree in my, my mom's parents' home.  It was just a big tree, but it was funny 'cause it, it was a stair step.  And I used to crawl that tree and just sit up there, you know, and the breeze and, you know.  That was a much simpler time, you know, no video games, you know.  So you went outside and you had fun.  And you played with, with your friends, and, yeah, I can just remember very hot summers.  And, you know, just having fun as a kid.
Story_ID: 648291
Speaker 1: Now did, did you live in the same neighborhood the whole time in, in Houston [Texas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, we did.  We lived--where I was born, my parents [Olivia Pleasant Marshall and HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] had a small apartment off of South Moore [Street].  But the home that I spent all my life in, which was in an area that would be called South Union [Greater OST-South Union, Houston, Texas].  Me and my mother, who now lives in Phoenix [Arizona], sold the home in the last year.  So my entire life, we lived in that home on Alberta [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay, kind of describe the house and the neighborhood--what the neighborhood was like?
Speaker 2: Four bedrooms, two bathrooms, you know, nice, you know, reasonably--I guess it was maybe 1,500, 1,600 square feet.  I had my own bedroom.  My sister [Mishka Marshall] had her own bedroom, and mom, you know and [maternal] grandmother were, you know, downstairs.  And, you know, just a standard home, you know, two car garage, backyard.
Speaker 1: Two story or one?
Speaker 2: It was a two story, two story, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, neighborhood was just a middle class, you know, neighborhood, nothing good or bad about it.  Schools were a bit challenged.  I went to Lockhart Elementary [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas], which was closer to my grand- my dad's mom's [Fannie Hughes Marshall] house.  That was back in the days where you needed to use an address that was near the school that you wanted to attend.  So we used my grandmother's address.  And I went there.  It was a better quality of education, you know.  Obviously, my mom and my dad knew all the teachers and principals.  And then my middle school, I was bused to Johnston Middle School [Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School, Houston, Texas], J-O-H-N-S-T-O-N, Johnston--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, we didn't, I mean busing wasn't a big deal.  We got on the bus, and we went, and had a great time, never any problems.  Johnston had a very large Jewish population.  And, you know, we got along great with everybody, you know, I'm a jock.  And, you know, we had friends and--were playing football and basketball and baseball and tennis and (laughter) I was having a great time.
Story_ID: 648292
Speaker 1: What were you interested in, in elementary school when you were at Lockhart [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas] or did you--?
Speaker 2: Lockhart my, my mother's brother was a musician.  And I always remember, I wanted to play the saxophone.  And so, my, my uncle told my mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall], "Oh, he should start on the clarinet."  And I did not like the clarinet.  So my dad's mom [Fannie Hughes Marshall] bought me a clarinet, and I played it.  I did not like it.  And as soon as I was old enough, which was probably a year later, to play football, the clarinet went into the top of my closet, never to see the light of day (laughter).  So, but I played football from probably the third or fourth grade on.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you're like eight years old playing football.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Texas, you know, I mean football is a religion (laughter).  So, yeah, every, I mean all my friends played, and I wanted to play.  And that was my way of getting out of playing the clarinet also.
Speaker 1: And it's been immortalized in 'Friday Night Lights' and all that sort--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of thing.  I mean Texas football, you're right, has a national reputation for being--so the kids start out at eight years old playing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, so you were in a Pop Warner league [Pop Warner Little Scholars, Inc.] or what was it called?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was akin to a Pop Warner league.  We had, I can remember Coach Chandler [ph.] and Coach Hicks [ph.] and Coach Lawson.  And it was great 'cause he had two of these, little bit older gentlemen, and then a young guy, you know, Danny Lawson [ph.], as a coach.  And, you know, we'd play and my dad [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] would come out and take pictures and, you know, I have, you know, some photos of me in my helmet and all that stuff, you know.  And it was fun.  I mean we enjoyed it.  I can remember Saturday mornings--it rains a lot, wouldn't say a lot--it rains a good bit in Houston [Texas].  And having to go out and navigate the puddles, the big lakes of water for practice 'cause we practiced, you know, unless it was lightning, we practiced and played all the time.  And, it was a lot of fun, lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a particular position that you started off playing?
Speaker 2: You know, strangely enough, I actually started off as a center in my first, you know, probably year.  And then when they figured out, they said, "This guys is kind of fast," you know.  And I was the fastest guy on the team.  So I went from the center to playing receiver, and then free safety.
Speaker 1: Okay, in those days, now, were you a fan of the Houston Oilers [Tennessee Titans]--
Speaker 2: Houston Oilers, yeah, Earl Campbell and Billy "White Shoes" Johnson and all that.  So, yes, I was an Oiler fan.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, so sports was a lot--you know, really a big deal?
Speaker 2: Yes, it, it was big.  I played football, I ran track; and actually, for fun, I played tennis in the summers.
Story_ID: 648293
Speaker 1: Now were there any, I mean--who would you consider like a mentor or like an adult role model at that stage?
Speaker 2: As a kid?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It would have been my dad [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.], you know, you know, I mean obviously, he had a great work ethic, and, you know, I mean he's, you know, he's you know, your dad.  You know, I mean he's--takes me around with him wherever he goes and, you know, would, he's doing his photography thing.  And doing the Operation Breadbasket.  So, I just wanted to be around my, you know, my father.
Story_ID: 648294
Speaker 1: Now, middle school [Johnston Middle School; Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School, Houston, Texas], this is court ordered busing, right? To, this--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think it was court ordered.  I think it was voluntary, and 'cause it was only two, two buses; and it was mainly the kids that were in, at Lockhart [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas] that, whose parents wanted them to go to a better public school because the middle school that we would have been zoned to, it just wasn't good.  It wasn't good.  So it was voluntary, and we had no problems.  It was great.  We knew--as a matter fact, one of my good friends here in Los Angeles [California], his father was the bus driver.  And, you know, he drove the bus, and, you know, we knew Mr. Robinson [ph.], great guy.  And it was a different time, it was a different time.  It wasn't, we weren't forced to do anything that we don't wanna do, you know.  We voluntarily went there.  The education was great, and it worked out well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but I think maybe in a larger sense, the court had mandated that--you know, I don't know.  You can check, but I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not real sure.  I mean 'cause it was--
Speaker 1: --I don't think they would have had that opportunity if it wasn't forced (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean Houston [Texas] was very different.  You know, having black administrators that would, you know, they had an interest in what happened to the kids.  Not that the administrators today don't, but it was just very different.  Yeah, I can remember knowing all my teachers.  My teachers knew all, knew my parents.  My father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] was in civil rights so he was on television a lot with press conferences and things of that sort.  So, you know, so I'm not sure if it was mandated.  I think it was more of an option that we chose to exercise that was facilitated by the administrators within the district [Houston Independent School District].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is this the era where you had the black school superintendent in Houston?
Speaker 2: Rod Paige?
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah, I heard he was eulogized a couple years ago at a conference.  I mean they talked about him at length--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no, he was a, I mean this is, you got Rod Paige, you got Barbara Jordan, you got Mickey Leland, I mean you have all these folks that are there.  And these are, you know, friends of my dad's, you know, and my mom [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] also.  So I mean, as I said, the community was very, it was a small community.  It was very tight.  Everybody knew everybody, you know, so.
Story_ID: 648295
Speaker 1: Johnston Middle School [Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School, Houston, Texas], you said it's in a primarily Jewish community, so you had--and usually that means that the academics are, you know, would--
Speaker 2: Higher.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I, you know. Don't wanna stereotype the Jewish people, but they usually do have higher academics (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean it's, and Houston [Texas] has a very large Jewish community.  My father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] was actually able to get a good, a decent amount of donations from the Jewish community.  Obviously, they had the challenges that they had, you know, many, you know, eons ago.  And the Jewish community and the black community were very close in Houston.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so any special teachers at Johnston that you remember?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  I mean all of the teachers, I mean can remember, wow, outside of my football coaches, no (laughter).  No, I--no one really, 'cause I mean, you know, you take your classes as you're supposed to, you know, I mean math and science is never fun, at least it wasn't fun back then.  And so, you know, but we, I was a decent student, you know, B plus.  And, but obviously, with a mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] and grandmother [Marshall's paternal grandmother, Fannie Hughes Marshall] in education, you know, we couldn't be slouches in grades.  If you didn't get your grades, you couldn't play your sports.  So I made sure I kept my grades up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, you start, I guess, when you're about twelve?  That had to be in 1974 or so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, you went from Johnston--now, what were you interested in, in school?  I mean what was, did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean I just, no.  I mean nothing was a real challenge.  I mean I liked history, I liked the math, you know.  Science wasn't much fun, you know, for me.  I mean obviously, I had to take it; but, no, I didn't really have any subject that, you know, I liked more than the other.  I liked playing football.  So I had to keep my grades up, and you know.
Story_ID: 648296
Speaker 1: Now, where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to James Madison High School [Houston, Texas].  James Madison at the time, my, my, my mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] was a counselor at Madison.  And that allowed me to essentially opt into that school.  And Madison was not a natural feeder school for Johnston [Johnston Middle School; Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School, Houston, Texas], and so, I transferred in.  You know, I had a few friends there, and I played football, and, you know, I ran track, and, you know, played tennis.  And it was probably the most racially diverse school in Houston [Texas].  I mean we had an excellent mix of blacks, whites, as well as what you'd call Hispanics today, we called 'em Mexicans.  And never any problems.  You know, everybody got along great.  We were all friends, and, you know, we're just typical kids just having fun.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting that you say--that was Mexico before Texas. I mean the U.S. moved (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, here too (laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess it's proper in some ways.  And I never thought about that before, but they are, you know, when somebody says, a Latino or Hispanic, you get like a sense it could be anybody.  But these are Mexicans, these are--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, this is, I mean, it's, you know, this is a--
Speaker 1: Mexican Americans anyway.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, well, I mean and we would, you know, our friends were Mexican, you know.  But it wasn't a big deal.  Kids don't really make a difference between what race someone is.  I mean that's their friend, you know.  And we had Mexican friends, and, you know, it was no big deal.  This is back in the days of the Afro Americans and the Chicanos.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean if you were Chicano, a Chicano would speak probably Spanish at home, but would speak English outside of the home and wanted to assimilate into America.  It wasn't like today where you have people that are out, you know, wrapping themselves in the Mexican flag.  That's fine.  If you wanna do that, go to Mexico, you know.  This is America.
Story_ID: 648297
Speaker 1: Now, you're playing football.  Are, are you a running back at this point or, or a receiver--
Speaker 2: I played some running back, but more receiver and then more safety on, on, on defense.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. How, how did the team do?  Was it--
Speaker 2: The team was a good team.  We did very well.  You know, we were top ranked.  This was when 4A [Texas Division 4A] was the largest rank.  And now, of course, you have 5A [Texas Division 5A] and super 5A.  But we did well.  I always had a challenge with some of my coaches.  I think it was a, probably a backlash from my mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] being a counselor, and, you know, I didn't, I didn't think I got a fair shake with some of my coaches.  But, you know, I'm a kid so what could I do?
Speaker 1: Now, you--wait a minute now.  I think I caught something in here.  Did--coaches sometimes, and I don't know if it's the case here, have conflicts with the counselors in terms of trying to keep the football--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: --players on the field instead of, you know, spending more time in classrooms.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was that some of the tension there?
Speaker 2: You know, all I know is I was the fastest kid on the team, and I had a challenge getting playing time.  And I--classic story.  Part of the reason why I actually went to Madison [James Madison High School, Houston, Texas] was there was this guy named Clyde Duncan [Clyde E. Duncan, Sr.].  And you may remember that the fastest man in the world was named Jim Hines and ran for Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  And so the second fastest man in the world was named Clyde Duncan, Duncan and Hines (laughter).  And so--
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) (laughter) I know.  It was something else.  And so when I was recruited from my middle school [Johnston Middle School; Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School, Houston, Texas], they said, "Oh, we have this guy.  He's a sprinter coach, and, you know, you'd do great."  And I can, I never will forget.  I was in a track meet, and he came in, and, of course, I was--today, this probably would be illegal, he handed me a pair of cleats, white cleats, white on white.  And I was like, I thought I had just died and gone to heaven, you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) white shoes to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, exactly.  Yeah, I got white cleats.  I was a very fast kid.  And so I was like great.  I'm going to Madison, you know.  I will have a Olympic coach that would be able to coach me.  And, of course, once I got to Madison, we actually had another couple of coaches that were assistant coaches.  They wouldn't let coach, you know, Duncan coach anybody.  And so I'm going, why?  I mean I'm a kid.  I'm going, I came here to be coached by this legendary coach, you know, this legendary sprinter.  And they said, "Oh, it's politics, you know, it's politics."  You know, so the, I think it was the office coordinator was our track coach.  And he was terrible, you know.  I'm like, "Why can't you guys let this guy, you know, train me?"  And they said, "No, I can't do it."  And so that was very disappointing for me because, you know, I was, as I said, I was the fastest kid.  Typically, the first and second fastest kid at my high school--in my elementary [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas] and my middle school and in high school.  I can think of one guy that, that, that could beat me in high school.  And they wouldn't allow the coach to coach.  So it was very disappointing.
Story_ID: 648298
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any of the business related activities in high school [James Madison High School, Houston, Texas] like Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA] or any of that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, I, I have always been an industrious kid.  I always liked to work.  I worked for my father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] from age ten.  So by the time I got to high school, a photographer is someone that's trusted in the community.  Excuse me.  And so when I got to a point where, you know, football was going somewhere but not where it needed to be for me, I talked to my dad, who, you know, is obviously in civil rights, and he's engaging folks.  And he had started to do work with the National Black Media Coalition.  And so he had contact with all these people that own, you know, TV stations and radio stations.  So I said, "Dad, you know, I gotta do something when I go to school, go to college."  And he said, "Well, I got a couple of friends that, you know, own some TV stations.  We'll see if we can get you a part-time job."  So the Hobby family in Houston [Texas] owned the TV, radio [KPRC Radio, Houston, Texas] and the newspaper [The Houston Post].
Speaker 1: That's--the Hobby Airport's [William P. Hobby Airport, Houston, Texas] named after (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hobby Airport, right, exactly, William Hobby [William P. Hobby].  So, yeah, they were very well to do, and, you know, Post-Newsweek [Post-Newsweek Stations, Inc.; Graham Media Group, Inc.] I think bought most of their stations, but so I got a part-time job.  And Channel 2 [KPRC-TV, Houston, Texas], which was the NBC affiliate--this was probably 1978, '79 [1979] or so.  And, you know, as they say I was bitten by the bug.  I liked the media business.  I liked being able to work at the TV station and run the cameras and it was kind of a natural transition from being a still photographer into essentially, a video photographer, and it was fun.
Speaker 1: This is while in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're in high school, and you're, got that kind of experience.  That's--
Speaker 2: Right, I, once I figured, you know, I wasn't gonna go to college on a football scholarship, I was able to work, I think it's like--they call it work study.  So I'd go to school in the morning, and then, you know, go have lunch and then go to the TV station, three or four days a week and worked there.  And it was fun.  This was back when they only had ABC, NBC and CBS.  You had a couple independent stations, but, you know, it was fun.  You know, I can tell my friends I worked at a TV station and all that stuff, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So did you work on a school newspaper or any--did you shoot photos for--
Speaker 2: I shot photos for the yearbook staff; really didn't work on a newspaper a lot.  You know, one at a time.  I went from football and track and tennis to, you know, planning for the rest of my life, and you know, working for the, the TVs, I mean for the TV station.  So my extracurricular stuff really wasn't, you know, I enjoyed working.  So that was kind of my thing.
Story_ID: 648299
Speaker 1: I can imagine that you were, you had access growing up to a lot of black publications, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The, the, the Informer [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman] was the, was the big paper, the big, black paper in Houston [Texas], along with the Forward Times [Houston Forward Times].  So those were, you know, the papers that, you know, most black folks--and since my father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] was shooting for, you know, both of them, you know, not that I was in there a whole lot.  But he shot a lot of stuff, a lot of the, the, the community people, and the, you know, the few politicians that, that we had at the time.
Story_ID: 648300
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior in high school [James Madison High School, Houston, Texas], like what were your--I mean what were you thinking in terms of college, I mean?
Speaker 2: You know what?  My, my dad [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] was living in Washington, D.C.  And my mom [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] is in Houston [Texas].  So--
Speaker 1: Now, when did--I forgot really to ask you anything about (unclear), I mean what--so they split when you were about ten--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --years old.  Okay, and did your father move then to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, he stayed in Houston.  He was there probably for another three or four years.  He would commute back and forth to D.C.  Since Breadbasket [Operation Breadbasket], you know, he has the photography business.  It paid, you know, the bills.  But Operation Breadbasket did not pay anything.  I mean it was limited.  Fundraising was tough.  So when the National Black Media Coalition was being formed, and it paid, I mean you gotta go where the money is.  So he moved from Houston to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: So did he go as the director of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, I think--
Speaker 1: --the black media coalition?
Speaker 2: Initially, there was another gentleman, I can't recall his name now, that was the, if you will, the executive director or maybe the interim director.  But once my dad got to D.C., given his experience with Operation Breadbasket, you know, he took over and was the guy that ran the show.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he got paid for doing that, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that's why he's in Silver Spring [Maryland] today?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).  Okay.
Story_ID: 648301
Speaker 1: Oh, I was asking you like how did you choose--now, you went to Clark?
Speaker 2: I was at Clark and so, so, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how did--
Speaker 2: --I, yeah, funny story.  So, so I'm doing my little mini college tour.  We didn't call it a college tour back then, but it's like, "Where do you wanna go to school?"  Well, let's see, you know, what kind of makes sense?  And my dad's [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], so I'm like obviously, "Let's go to D.C."  So I go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And I, you know, viewed the campus, it was a great campus, area was a little bit dicey, and I think it probably still is.  But, and so it snowed.  And I was just ecstatic.  Oh, my god, there's snow everywhere, and having fun.  Well, I didn't know that snow has to melt, obviously, and the way they break the snow up is they use salt in some cases.  And I had all these shoes that I had been traipsing around in the snow, was laced with salt.  And when I got back home, my shoes were all white.  And they had, you know, curled up on the ends in some cases.  And I was not happy.  And I had to scrub and use saddle soap and all kinds of things to get my shoes back to being in better working order.  And so I said, "I'm not going to D.C."  So since I was, I had an interest in communications, my dad said, "Hey, I have some friends, a friend [Gloria Walker] that runs the communications department at Clark College [Clark Atlanta University] in Atlanta [Georgia]."  So I said, "Okay, that would be great," you know.  So, you know, I applied.  I got a scholarship, and so, and it was funny because Atlanta was exactly two hours from Houston [Texas] by plane.  It was two hours from D.C. by plane and twelve hours by car.  So I was right smack in the middle of where nobody could get to me.  You know, I, yeah, I wanted to be independent and out on my own and having a good time.  And, you know, so it worked out great.
Story_ID: 648302
Speaker 1: Now who was it that your father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] knew at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] that--?
Speaker 2: Dr. Gloria Walker--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was the, the lady who ran the communications department.
Speaker 1: Okay, Dr. Gloria Walker.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what the department like?  I mean what were they specializing in?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean it's, Clark has a communications school, school of communications.  And, obviously, as a freshman, (clears throat) excuse me--I could only take my basic courses which I thought was a total waste.  And by the time I became a sophomore and began to get into, you know, a little bit of the curriculum and bear in mind, I'm working at TV stations, you know, during the school year because once again, my parents wouldn't allow me to bring my car to school my freshman year.  And so unbeknownst to them, I was going to class.  I had a job at the TV station, but I also had a job at a clothing store in Lenox mall [Lenox Square, Atlanta, Georgia], 'cause I like clothes.  And so I would, you know, arrange my school schedule around working at the TV station on the weekends and working at the mall during the week.  So, of course, if my parents knew that, they probably would have killed me.  So I got, had my grandmother and grandfather sending me money from both sides of the family, getting money from my mom [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] and my dad (laughter), and I'm working.  So I had a good time.  I had a really--I had fat pockets as, as we used to say.
Story_ID: 648303
Speaker 1: In our outline, we have like a number of different jobs that you, you know, and TV stations while you're at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean you're, you're all over the place.  I mean, you know it seems--I'm not sure what the chronology of 'em (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the real easy chronology is during the school year, I was either working for Ted Turner at what was then CNN and WTBS [Superstation WTBS-TV; WPCH-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], and then during the summers, I worked for Frank Melton who was the president Buford broadcasting [Buford Television, Inc.] in Tyler, Texas.  So Frank put me in, and Frank's family--Frank was ten years older than me, and ten years younger than my father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.].  And Frank's parents [Marguerite Haynes Melton and Herbert Melton] and my grandparents were friends.  So, and I'll never forget.  I was actually at one of my dad's conferences, the National Black Media Coalition conferences.  And so I meet this guy, and, you know, my dad says, "Hey, this is Frank Melton, and he works this company, he runs a TV station," and I said, "Oh, great, fantastic," you know.  And, you know, me being a, you know, a bit of a smart aleck kid, I said, "Hey, you got a job for me?"  He said, "I do."  I said, "Oh, okay, where?"  And he said, "Tyler, Texas."  I go Tyler, I said, "Tyler, Texas?"  I know my geography in Texas is pretty good, so ah, that's not too far from Houston [Texas].  And so he said, "You know, I'll give you a summer internship."  And so I said, "All right, great, you know.  How much does it pay?"  He said, "A thousand bucks [dollars] a month."  And I said, "Oh, my god, that," (laughter), "that's great, I'll take it."  And so he put me in the program, and, you know, paid me the thousand bucks a month, got me an apartment, and drove my little car up there.  And I never will forget, my apartment was across the street from a cemetery.  And it was, it was a great apartment, but I was just like, my god.  Every morning I got up, dead bodies everywhere (laughter), you know.  But, you know, it was a great experience, and that's what launched my, my career, if you will, in the media business because it was a wonderful opportunity.  I mean I was, I worked with Gannett [Gannett Company, Inc.] in news and WXIA [WXIA-TV] in Atlanta [Georgia], and then I worked with Ted Turner in sales research.  So I was able to get kind of all aspects of the media business.  I got, you know, the news--and this is actually right when the child murders were happening in Atlanta [Atlanta Child Murders; Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases].  So I got that during the school year, obviously my education.  And then the summers, was, was spent in Tyler and Lufkin, Texas.
Story_ID: 648304
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're amassing quite a bit of experience for someone who's coming out of college.  I mean your (laughter), your resume might look like somebody that's already been working ten years--
Speaker 2: Right, very true.
Speaker 1: --from all the experiences.
Speaker 2: Very true, very true.
Speaker 1: I mean how many stations?  Now, this is--
Speaker 2: So, so essentially, it was four stations.  So you had KLTV [KLTV-TV] in Tyler [Texas].  You had KTRE-TV in Lufkin [Texas], and then we had WTBS [Superstation WTBS-TV; WPCH-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and then WXIA [WXIA-TV].  So, and, of course, XIA is the NBC affiliate in Atlanta [Georgia].  And, of course, TBS is, you know, it's what it is.
Speaker 1: Right.  What was it like?  Now, these are the, you're at TBS, what?  In nineteen eighty--in the '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s], right?
Speaker 2: This is eighty--actually, I started working for Ted Turner, I wanna say it was probably '81 [1981], maybe.  It was right when CNN and all that stuff was launched.  You know, we did sales research and all the numbers were crunched by hand.  So we had a calculator and the green paper, and we'd take the number and it was really interesting.  I mean it was, 'cause, you know, this is this thing that's created.  It's like news all day long.  You know, who watches news all day long?  You got three big, you know, networks that are just dominant.  And they have bureaus around the world.  And you got this guy that wants to do news, you know, all day long from Atlanta of all places, you know.  And I never forget the first time I ever saw Ted Turner, he was ranting about something that had happened.  And I said, "Man, who's the, who's the crazy guy?"  He said, "That's Ted," (laughter), "you know."  "Oh, the guy that owns the company.  Okay, great."  And then when I met him formally, he was as gracious and as nice as he could be, you know.  Told me to tell my dad hello, and all that good stuff, and, you know.
Speaker 1: And so he knew your father as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, I'll tell you an interesting story.  So when the laws or the rules were written for TV stations, they were really strict on what you can do and how you can do it and everything else.  So the way the National Black Media Coalition would gain your attention is that when you had--a license was up for renewal--it happened every five or seven years, so a very critical time because if you don't have a license to operate, you can't operate at all.  And so my father would always time his challenges to their licenses around their license renewal time.  And so Ted Turner had, I wanna say the station was WTTG [sic. WTCG-TV; WPCH-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] or something of that sort.  And so the National Black Media Coalition had filed a petition to deny the license against, you know, Ted Turner's company [Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.].  And so I think Ted's father [Robert Turner II] owned a billboard company or some TV stations or whatever.  And so what he was gonna do, Ted was gonna sell the TV stations to get the money to do CNN.  And so NBMC had filed a petition to deny.  And, you know, so he and my father, you know, obviously, had conversations.  And it was like, you know, "Pluria, please withdraw this petition.  You know, if I can't sell the stations, I can't launch this network.  I can't do this, you know--," so on and so forth.  And so, you know, Pluria, Sr. [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] being the nice guy that he is, and obviously, you know, Ted made some donations to NBMC and their cause, he, he, my father withdrew the petition to deny the license transfer.  And that allowed him to sell the station and build his multibillion dollar empire.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: A little known black history fact.
Speaker 1: So he owed your father and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: And you're right.  Those were the days when black organizations could challenge broadcasters based on the rules of the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] about public service and--
Speaker 2: Right, right, and actually can do it.  I mean any lay person could walk in and file a petition with the commission against the station.  Now, obviously, it's much tougher today because the rules have been watered down to basically nothing.  But back then, I mean if someone challenged your license, you were in deep, deep stuff.
Speaker 1: Once again, this is why in the '70s [1970s], we--well, from the '60s [1960s] through the '70s [1970s], we had like black programs, community--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --affairs shows.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Every--
Speaker 2: Everybody had one.
Speaker 1: --body had one.  'Say Brother' in Boston [Massachusetts], you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, Gil Noble in New York [New York], all these shows, public service shows.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We had 'em in Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right, oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean it was mandated by the FCC.  I mean you had to have these community service type shows on that dealt with, and this is back in the days when America was a black-white country.  Yes, you obviously had other, you had immigrants from everywhere, but the predominance of issues were focused on black people.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So you'd have a show, a half hour of at least, sometimes an hour, focusing on--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --things in the, you know, programs of concern, I mean issues of concern in the black community exclusively.  And it was gonna be on every week, and somebody had a job being a host and a producer of that, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which does--these do not exist today.
Speaker 2: Very true.
Speaker 1: Very few exist.  I think the one in Detroit [Michigan] that started way back when, is still on the air ['Colored People's Time'; 'American Black Journal'], in a very stripped down--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --budget.
Story_ID: 648305
Speaker 1: Oh, CNN, also, you mentioned the Atlanta Child Murders [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases], and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what the police chief [sic.] was Brown, right?
Speaker 2: Lee Brown.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Lee P. Brown, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, who has a Houston [Texas] history, too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I just thought that was interesting.  You're--
Speaker 2: Right, I mean much, you know, later, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He becomes mayor of Houston later on.
Speaker 2: Right, very true, very true.
Speaker 1: So this is a--did you, what was your sense of that as a, I mean I don't know whether you, how much you were focusing on that or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean actually I focused on it quite a bit.  One, I'm a college student [at Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] working at WXIA [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] on weekends as a grip.  So I'm obviously the assistant to the photographer.  So my parents are all like freaking out.  They're like, you know, "Are you okay?  Are you fine?"  I'm like, "I'm good," you know, (laughter) I mean, you know, I played football in high school [James Madison High School, Houston, Texas] so I'm a good sized guy.  And so, they're like, "But yeah, these, this guy is killing little black kids."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I said, "Yes, he is.  But he ain't killing anybody my size, you know."  And so I'm working at the TV station on weekends.  I mean we spent countless hours at the coroner's office with, you know, just all the stuff that you do as a reporter, reporting team on the weekends.  And so we're sitting out on bridges, you know, with these extended lenses 'cause, you know, we can't get near the actual scene where they're--a body was possibly dropped.  And, you know, this is all being reported on national news.  And everybody's like, "Pluria [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.], can--you need to come home."  I'm like, "Mom [Olivia Pleasant Marshall], I'm not coming home.  Dad [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.], I'm not coming home.  I'm not, I'm fine, I'm good, you know."  And so ultimately, obviously, they caught somebody.  Whether it was Wayne Williams or not, who knows, because Atlanta [Georgia] had a real interesting, there's a lot of cities, obviously, there's several counties that make up Atlanta metro.  There's a lot of cities within those counties.  And so you have cross jurisdictional issues from a law enforcement standpoint.  And see, nobody wants to look bad.  So if you're in Gwinnett County [Georgia] versus Fulton County [Georgia] versus wherever else.  And then you got Atlanta proper and you have all these other cities, I mean law enforcement, they're territorial, you know, anyway.  So, you know, how do you make it work and from a whoever did it standpoint, it was probably a wonderful opportunity for them to do all kinds of things that normally wouldn't happen in a city (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, are there like five counties in metro Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about five--
Speaker 1: Fulton and--
Speaker 2: Fulton and Cobb [Cobb County, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Cobb--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, Fulton and then Cobb are the main ones that were fairly well populated then.  And so this guy is killing kids and crossing county lines, city lines or whatever.  So it was a nightmare, you know.  I'm, I'm sure it was.  And, and we sat on many a bridge, many a morning, you know, just trying to get the story.  You know, we're doing what we needed to do.
Story_ID: 648306
Speaker 1: I've read where you were quoted as saying that at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], in those days at Clark, as you were getting ready to leave Clark, you felt you could do anything.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I wondered if that was due to, you know, some inspiration from the faculty at Clark or was it in these, in your role, you know, working with these various television stations as an intern, and, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, it's--the black college experience is very unique.  Black colleges [HBCUs] back then--this was the early '80s [1980s], you know, we were essentially bred and it was ingrained in our thinking and in our psyche, you could do anything you want.  I mean anything you wanna do, you can do it.  You know, we are preparing you to essentially lead the world, conquer the world if need be.  And, you know, having parents [Olivia Pleasant Marshall and HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] that were very supportive, had the same mindset, you know, anything you wanna do, you can do it.  You know, you--there's no such word as can't, you know, I can't do--no, sorry.  That's a four letter word.  I know it's a contraction, but it is.  And so, yeah, I graduated thinking I was gonna go out and rule the world, buy up a bunch of TV stations and become a multimillionaire and, and retire at forty (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Obviously, I'm still working (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now--
Story_ID: 648307
Speaker 1: Were there any important teachers or mentors at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I actually ended up having to change my major from communications to business because the curriculum that they were teaching in the communications was very different from the real life work that I was experiencing every day.  So I can remember having debates with teachers about what they were teaching us in the book versus what we did yester- you know, yesterday at five o'clock on a live shot.  And we'd go round and round.  Man, people would say, you know, "Pluria [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.], you know, we're tired today.  Why don't you and the teacher have a debate?" (Laughter) And we'd debate for an hour.  You know, and I'm like, "You can't tell me what you're teaching me is correct 'cause it's not.  It's just not."  So finally, they said, "Pluria, look, we're not gonna change the books.  We're not gonna change our curriculum.  And if you continue to do what you do," (laughter), "we'll flunk you out of this department."  So I said, "Oh, okay, great."  So I'll change my major from communications to business with a focus on management.  And I'll continue to work in the business and, so that I didn't get tossed out of school (laughter), and out of that department, and I could go ahead and finish up on time.
Speaker 1: But was there any, or who was there that--did anybody inspire you there at Clark?  I mean in terms of what you went on to do?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I actually had a real estate teacher.  His name escapes me now.  I love real estate.  I used to read a ton of books on real estate because, you know, that's the way you made money, you know.  You bought property and did all that.  And I mean he's--my, I'm getting old.  I can't remember his name.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, but he, we were, it was me and one of the other students.  We were so good that he would literally sit back after about a month into the semester, he said, "You know what guys?  You get this."  And I said, "Yeah, we get it."  And so we would literally teach class almost every day.  You know, we'd go in, you know, we'd prep.  And we would take the whatever, twenty plus chapters, and, you know, we'd bounce off of each other, me and this other student.  And so it was probably the most fun class, and it was the most fun I had in college 'cause my final was just, you know, you keep teaching the class (unclear), you and this other guy have an A.  And I thoroughly enjoyed--you know, it was my first kind of foray into, you know, something I thought that I could obviously make money with and have fun.  So that was probably the, my most fun class in college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was the other guy Lorenzo Butler?
Speaker 2: No, Lorenzo Butler is from Houston [Texas].  He's a couple of years older than I was.  And actually, he was the one who, he had mentioned that he was at Clark.  And he said, "Hey, man, you ought to go, come to Clark.  They got a great communications program."
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had already been to Clark, so you didn't really meet him at Clark?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, he's from Houston, he's from Houston, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, and then, yeah, I met--he was, he was part of the NAACP ACT-SO program [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics], and so he was like, "Oh, man, you ought a come here.  I'm a student representative for Miller beer [Miller Brewing Company] and--," you know, all this other stuff.  And, you know, he was involved in student government, and all that.  So, you know, I mean he, he had some, some influence on--and actually gave me a good, you know, kind of representation of, of Atlanta [Georgia] 'cause he was actually there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I think that clears that up.
Story_ID: 648308
Speaker 1: When you're on the verge of graduating [from Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], you--well, right as you gra- graduate, didn't you attempt to buy a station (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) when you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that's--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --that would be really ambitious.  So, no, so when I graduated, my thought was, I would, I had done my internships in the summer in Lufkin [Texas] and Tyler, Texas.  That's where Buford broadcasting [Buford Television, Inc.] was based.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was '84 [1984], this (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen eighty-four [1984], yes, 1984.  And so, so I talked to Frank [Frank Melton], and I said, "Hey Frank, I'm graduating in May.  You know, I'd love to come to work for you."  And he makes me an offer.  I like to always say I was the highest paid graduate in the whole Atlanta universities system [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] 'cause I had a twenty-five, or twenty-seven thousand [dollar], you know, job offer, and I didn't know anybody that had come close to that.  So I'm thinking that I'm gonna hop on I-20 [Interstate 20] and drive to Tyler.  He says, "No, we're now in Mississippi."  I go, "Mississippi, I'm going where?"  "Mississippi."  "I know it's there, but who lives there?"  He says, "Well, we just bought two TV stations."  And I said, "Oh, okay."  So he says, "You can hop in your car and drive to Jackson, Mississippi."  And so once I told my parents [Olivia Pleasant Marshall and HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] (laughter), they were a bit stunned that, you know, I was moving to Mississippi 'cause, obviously, Mississippi has an incredible history, not always the best history as it relates to black people.  And so I got in my little car, my little 260Z [Nissan 260Z] and drove to Jackson and lived there from 1984 to about '85 [1985].  So about a, maybe fifteen months or so because that's where Frank had, he moved there.  And, obviously, the training program that I was in, I had to finish it up some place.  So I finished it up at WLBT-TV in Jackson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: WLBT?
Speaker 2: LBT, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, LBT, okay.  We had WL--
Speaker 2: LBM [WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV] was in Meridian [Mississippi] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) LBM, okay.
Speaker 2: That's Meridian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: LBT is in Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay, WLBT in Jackson.
Story_ID: 648309
Speaker 1: What was Jackson [Mississippi] like in those days?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I, I had no idea what to expect.  And I, I always tell people, if someone dropped you into Jackson, outside of the red clay, you would think that you're in, obviously, some southern city, not knowing exactly where it was, it wasn't backwards.  It wasn't country as they say.  It's the capital of, you know, the State of Mississippi.  And, you know, having, you know, owning a TV station in Jackson was incredibly rewarding, if you will.  Obviously, Buford [Buford Television, Inc.], you know, bought control.  This station had the dubious honor of being the first station that was ever taken from a licensee for racial violations.  So the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] basically took the station from the owners and held it in escrow for twenty plus years.  And Jackson--WLBT [WLBT-TV, Jackson, Mississippi] had the distinction of having the first black general manager, first black program director, first black news director, first black everything.  It was the first black everything.  The station made money, but really wasn't as efficient as it should be 'cause it basically didn't have an owner, if you will.  So when Frank [Frank Melton] came in, we revamped everything and took the profits through the roof, and it made it just be a wonderful investment, obviously.
Speaker 1: That is, that's quite a story.  That's a story I did not know.  And so this, which had been the most racist station, I guess, in Mississippi, at least the one that was caught--
Speaker 2: At one time, yes.
Speaker 1: --they ended up having the first black general manager, the first black--
Speaker 2: You name it, you name it, they were the first black everything.
Speaker 1: As they're being managed by the FCC, basically, right or--
Speaker 2: Essentially.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not sure how they did it or what they did.  But essentially, the FCC held the license, and then it was run as a, obviously, as a for profit entity.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's something.  So you come in the situation where this black--now, how, how many TV stations were in Jackson?
Speaker 2: There were three.  You had ABC, NBC and CBS.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I would figure.
Speaker 2: And so this, this was an NBC affiliate.
Story_ID: 648310
Speaker 1: So you were there fif- fifteen months.  What happened?  Why did you, well why didn't you stay longer?
Speaker 2: Well, as you can probably tell by my, my history, I, I like to work, and there was really not a whole lot more for me to do.  I mean I had been in three years--three summers of training, been at WLBT [WLBT-TV, Jackson, Mississippi] for, you know, a little over a year.  And so Frank [Frank Melton] would, you know, we'd have board meetings, and he was, he'd allow me and my cohort to attend the board meetings, you know, for the exposure.  And so, they would always talk about this little station [WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV] in Meridian [Mississippi].  They said, "Oh, man, that station's not making money."  The guy would come, and he would have a song and dance every month.  Why we're losing money, why we're doing this, why we're doing that or whatever.  And so I said to Frank, you know, I'm twenty-two, twenty-three years old, I'm like, "Frank, come on, man, you know, if it's losing money, I mean, you know, give me a shot.  Let me run it," you know, and I'm, yeah, as they say full of piss and vinegar.  And so he said, "Well, hell, Pluria [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.], you know, you can't do any worse than what's going on there now.  We're losing money."  And so I said, "Okay, great."  So he says, "All right, you can move to Meridian."  And so, I said, "Okay, great."  So we had to renegotiate my little package that I was getting paid and everything.  And so he said--so I said, "So what do I do?"  He said, "You make it make money."  I said, "Okay, so how do I do that?"  He said, "You cut your expenses, raise your revenue."  I said, "Oh, okay, great.  That's easy, you know."  And so literally, I got there and the guy that ran the station, it was a guy named Glenn Rose.  Glenn was a nice old guy, but he's just not really good at raising or selling ads and things of that sort.  And he used to always say, "Pluria, you just, you're just too aggressive, you just, you know, you just, you gotta be patient."  I said, "Dude, I have no patience, you know, I've gotta get this done."  So--
Speaker 1: This sounds like a clash in cultures of--in Mississippi, they do, they move slower.  They move slower.
Speaker 2: Oh, they do.  They do.
Speaker 1: So I mean you're like, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) anybody watching this can see.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm like, hey, guys, you gotta move.  You know, I mean I'm, I can't sit here and wait, you know.  So, finally, after probably about, you know, two or three months, you know, Glenn gave me, through Frank, he said, "All right let him be a--," I was a station manager.  And so I'd go in, "I'm sorry, fine.  We can fire this person.  We need to do this.  We're gonna raise the rates.  We're gonna make the--," I did all the things that I was trained to basically do.  And so ninety days after I got there, the station made money.  And so, you know, I said, "Frank.  I did it, all right?  So make me the general manager," (laughter).  And so he was like, "You know, you're being a little impatient, Pluria."  I'm like, "Yeah, I am, you know."  And so I kept pushing and pushing and pushing.  And so finally Glenn said, you know--and Glenn was a little bit older and been around the business for quite some time.  He said, well, he's gonna basically retire.  And so I said, well, you know, the station's mine at that point.  And so Frank, you know, put me in as the vice president and general manager.  And it also helped that NBC was on its rise in the mid-'80s [1980s].  So we had 'The Cosby Show' and we had all this great programming.  Although the station was a bit of a, less than a full powered station, it covered the Meridian area.  But it wasn't as big as the station in Jackson [Mississippi].  And so, you know, I kept it, it never lost a dime as long as I ran it.  It was always very profitable.  And so I ran it from, essentially, '85 [1985], '86 [1986] until 1990.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you got a large black viewing audience down there, I would imagine?
Speaker 2: We do, we do.  Yeah, the state's about 50 percent black.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So anything you put in the air, there's gonna be a lot of black folks, at least by this time, having--with TV sets.  They can check it out.
Speaker 2: Right, oh, yeah, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: And watching a lot of TV.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'The Cosby Show' was a hit.  It definitely was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you were there--you weren't there that--were you there very long?  I mean--
Speaker 2: From, from, as I said, from about '85 [1985] to '90 [1990], roughly 'cause when I spent--I was in Jackson for about fifteen months.  So, and that was from '84 [1984] to '85 [1985].  So, late '85 [1985] to 1990.  So I was there about, you know, for five and a half years.
Story_ID: 648311
Speaker 1: Any major stories from that, that period of time, of things--or anything that happened that you--?
Speaker 2: No, no, we never had any, any problems, any issues [at WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV, Meridian, Mississippi].  You know, I was out in the community.  Folks knew who I was; never had--I only had one instance where I had a (laughter), had a sales rep that said (adopts southern accent), "Well, John doesn't wanna buy from no black man."  And I said, "Really?"  I said, "Let's go see him."  And he had a, like a service station type thing or whatever.  And so I drove--got in my car and drove right down there and walked in, "Hello, Mr. Johnson [John Johnson (ph.)], how you doing?" Or whatever his name was, you know.  He looked at me and, you know, his little greasy hand, shook my hand.  And I said, "Is there anything we can do for you?  Anything we can, you know, help Theresa [ph.], obviously close the business.  We want your business, whatever."  Said, "Nah, (unclear) nah, it's fine, everything's good, you know, she's a good girl."  And I said, "Okay, great, fine, fantastic."  Got back in my car and left, you know, so I'm a hands on, any problem, any challenge, I'm gonna meet it head on, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is the kind of community where you could, that I mean you could just go, go out or drive out and meet the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --advertisers and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, definitely, definitely.
Story_ID: 648312
Speaker 1: Did you have any special programs [at WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV, Meridian, Mississippi] geared towards the black community that were produced locally?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean we, we had some community affairs, you know, programs that we would, would air.  We would air a lot of stuff from S.I. Communications [S.I. Communications, Inc.], actually, Bob Dockery had vignettes.  You had Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] vignettes.  You had King's birthday vignettes.  You'd have Black Music Month [African American Music Appreciation Month] vignettes, things of that sort.  And, you know, 'cause remember, this is the '80s [1980s] so there's not a lot out there from a programming standpoint.  Obviously, you had 'The Cosby Show' on NBC, but that was an anomaly.  So, you know, we would do what we could do locally.  You know, my staff was pretty well mixed from a black-white standpoint, obviously, black.  Our sales manager was black.  Your photographers were, you know, black and white.  We really didn't have a large news operation, but we had a couple, you know, reporters.  Actually, we would shoot a lot of news copy and send it over to Jackson [WLBT-TV, Jackson, Mississippi] because, obviously, we were in the far eastern part of the state, and they were more kind of central to west.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we had a crew that did that also.
Story_ID: 648313
Speaker 1: Any big news stories break when you were there [WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV, Meridian, Mississippi] or, or--
Speaker 2: Well, we, we had--Meridian [Mississippi] was, was an interesting little city because it sat so close to the Alabama border.  So it had one of the, it was one of the strangest things.  Right downtown, we had a federal post office, which had a federal court.  And across from the federal court and the post office was a large bookie joint.  So they ran numbers across the street from the courthouse, which I always found comical.  And so Meridian was one of these places where, if you wanted to commit murder, you should do it in Meridian and then cross state lines which then makes it a federal offense.  And there was a lot of things that happened back in the day that were always questionable that would end up being federal crimes versus state crimes because of, you know, you cross the state line, then all of a sudden, it bumps it up.  So we had one case where there was a woman that wanted to--she was trying to have her cousin killed.  And so some kind of way, this would be murderer used something to essentially melt brick and take out like a huge section of this guy's garage, and waited in there and killed him.  And it was a big, his home was a beautiful home on a little man made lake.  And it was a really big deal.  And I wanna say she did get convicted.  But that was the biggest thing that I could think of that happened while I was there.
Speaker 1: Now, these are white people--
Speaker 2: All white, yes, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, black folks never kill anybody (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Not like that.  I mean usually it's like, you know, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, oh, now, isn't Meridian the home of Alice Walker, I think, the writer?
Speaker 2: It's possible. I mean--
Speaker 1: She had a book called 'Meridian.'  I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, the biggest thing in, in Meridian was the Peavey Electronics factory [Peavey Electronics Corporation].  Peavey, if you know anything about, you know, speakers and things of that sort, I mean the Peavey logo is very distinct.  And it was headquartered in Meridian.  We also had a naval air station [Naval Air Station Meridian, Mississippi] which was interesting 'cause they had a twelve thousand foot runway in the middle of the sticks.  And that's a long runway, you know.  But there was a lot of stuff that went on in Meridian.  So.
Speaker 1: So the naval air station supported, I guess, [U.S.] Navy operations on the Mississippi, I guess then?
Speaker 2: I guess.  I mean they would fly some planes there, man, that you--amazing stuff, you know, I mean just amazing.
Story_ID: 648314
Speaker 1: Around 1990, you set in motion a plan to buy a television station, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the WLBM [WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV, Meridian, Mississippi] was a very small TV station.  It was the, had the dubious honor, honor of being the smallest three station TV market in the country.  So when Frank Melton and the board [of Buford Television, Inc.] decided to sell the station, you know, they said, "Well, hey, we're gonna sell it, and we'll put it out to market."  And so I said, "Well, heck, I'd love to buy it," you know.  So, and then the guy that worked for me, said he'd love to buy it.  So we got together and formed a company and raised some money.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, this is, I read it was like $4.5 million you raised.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it was, I--maybe a little bit less than that, but, but it was a reasonable amount of money.  So we had done a fairly great job locally.  The McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] operator had total faith in us and had agreed to put some money up.  And so, you know, we, you know, went and raised the debt.  We had equity.  We had the equipment financed.  We had all the things in place that I'd seen Frank do for a number of years.  And we thought we were doing great, you know.  We were probably a week away from closing the transaction.  So it was in April, and I get a phone call from my morning anchor.  "Pluria [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.], the station's on fire, the station's on fire."  And I'm going, who the heck is this?  And I hang the phone up.  You know, 'cause this is four o'clock in the morning.  Calls back, "Pluria, you know, the station's on fire.  You gotta get down here."  And I'm going, you know, once I figure out it's real, you know, I go, "Hey, is anybody in the building?"  "No."  "Are you okay?"  "Yes."  "Called the fire department?"  "Yes."  "Called the police department?"  "Yes."  So I hop in my car, and I fly down, you know, actually, up the hill to see what's going on and lo and behold, there's smoke billowing out of the station.  And I'm just going, you know, so nobody's hurt.  Okay, fine.  And I'm thinking, okay, this is bad and good 'cause we were off the air for a period of time.  But it was great because if I'm buying the TV station and it just burned, as best I can tell, the insurance company's gonna fix me up a brand new station.  Well, unbeknownst to me, the insurance company said, "No.  This station is being sold essentially for salvage value.  And unless you're gonna sue us, you know, we're gonna give you exactly what it's worth," which is basically nothing.  And so, you know, of course, you know, once again, you know, black college [HBCU] graduate, you know.  Oh, we'll hire a lawyer, and we're gonna sue these guys and do all that.  And little did I know--this was my first foray into the legal side of business.  And everything that you think you can do, you can't do.  So when our investors figured out that we may be tied up in litigation for a number of years, the, you know, Frank, who's my mentor said, "Look, you know, the best thing to do is to, is for you guys--is for us to essentially, you know, take the station back, let the insurance company pay what they're gonna pay, buy you guys' stock," 'cause we owned some stock in the main company, "and just call it a day.  It's the best thing, Pluria.  I know it's not what you want.  But, you know, better for you to get some money, get your investors back their money, all your expenses."  I mean they took care of everything.  So it was really hard to say, yes, it dashed ambitions as a would be TV station owner, but, you know, the practical side of business had to, you know, take place.  So, yeah, and then what made it worse was, we were out of a job 'cause the gentleman, Alfred Martin, and I worked, and we were there, and this is what we did.  So I was really, really angry, very upset.  And it turned out that the fire wasn't a typical fire.  It didn't burn anything really.  Whoever set it, set--well, we had two five ton units.  One that kept the building cool and the other unit kept the studio cool.  So they set the fire on some old programming logs which were in the basement.  And mind you, the basement is concrete and steel.  And the only thing that could burn was the paper.  So they set the paper near the air conditioning system.  And so as it began to, you know, the fire began to build, the air conditioner turned on and sucked more oxygen in which fed the fire, which fed the smoke throughout the building.  And, you know, what we ended up having was really more smoke and water damage than anything else.  And it was actually ingenious, whoever did it because it was just, it allowed that fire and transaction, more than anything else, not to happen.  So they never found out who did it, you know.  Since no one was hurt, the company wasn't trying to seek out who actually started the fire.  And everybody was fine.  They just said, "Well, we'll just chalk it up to, you know, experience and keep moving."
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does seem like--it seems to me that someone, you know, with some stake in it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it was a black company.  I'm a black guy, you know, so it wasn't like it was racial from that standpoint.  You can't say well, white people are gonna burn it down 'cause you're a black man trying to buy it.  And it, it was just, it was a strange deal.
Story_ID: 648315
Speaker 1: So from 1990, basically call it June of 1990, I sold my houses and moved back to Texas; and took about two years off and just--I was a, I was a, I, I had started skiing, snow skiing.  So I would snow ski in the wintertime, and I'd hang out in the islands in the summertime, you know.  And I took a couple years off.  I just was a slug, didn't do anything, had fun and just skied and went to the islands, you know.  And so by 1992--
Speaker 2: Now, are you married at this time?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm single, I'm single.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: So by 1992, I run out of money.  And so I began to look for work.  And the challenge that I was having, I had a ton of experience, but everybody that I was competing against for jobs was, you know, five or ten years older.  So I'd get to finals, and they'd go well, "Pluria [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.], you know, we like your resume.  We like what you've done.  But, you know, you just don't have quite enough experience for what we want."  And I'm going, wow, this is amazing.  I was a general manager of a TV station [WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV, Meridian, Mississippi], ran a TV station for, you know, five years, more qualified than most folks, but I was young.  I was twenty-eight, twenty-nine years.  And so I'm in Houston [Texas], living back at home with my mom [Olivia Pleasant Marshall].  So I go out and get, you know, jobs at various, you know, places in Houston.  And so finally, they had a radio station that was changing its format.  And they had just turned over to being a black station.  And I decided to take my resume and strip it of all my management experience, my training and everything else, and just put all my sales training down there.  And so, you know, the guys came and looked at me, and said, "Wow, man, you have a lot of experience."  "Ah, yeah, I do."  So they offer me a job, and it was KBXX, KBXX-FM [KBXX Radio, Houston, Texas].  And, you know, worked there.  And I said, after I had completed my six months of probation, I went into the sales manager and the general manager and said, "Look, guys, I wanna tell you who I really am."  You know, they looked at me like I was kind of crazy like.  "So who are you, you know?"  I said, "Well, look, here's my real resume."  So I gave it to 'em.  They looked at it and said, "Wow, you could probably do our jobs."  I said, "Yeah, probably could, you know."  And so they said, "Well, we don't care.  You know, as long as you--you're a sales guy.  As long as you make your budget and do what you have to do, then we're fine, you know."  So I spent probably a year and a half there.  And it just wasn't for me.  It was, I, I had gotten the system down to where I was working half days every day, getting full time pay, which was great for the average guy.  But I, you know, I had a mission.
Story_ID: 648316
Speaker 1: And so I ended up leaving the radio station [KBXX Radio, Houston, Texas]; and that's when I went into WLBM--I'm sorry, WLTH [WLTH Radio] in, in, in Gary [Indiana] and also to KVJM [KHRN Radio; KVJM Radio] in Bryan-College Station [Texas].
Speaker 2: Now, what came first, the one in Gary or College Station?
Speaker 1: Gary came first, and then College Station came in--College Station was an interesting deal because it was actually a station that was in bankruptcy.  And the SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration] had a lien on the assets.  And once again, the more knowledge to learn things.  I had no idea how bankruptcy courts worked, but as the trustee told me, he said, "You know what?  I don't care who I sell to.  The first person that comes up with twenty-five thousand to pay my fee, and assumes this note, gets the deal."  And so there were a few people that were buying and so I scraped together ten grand [ten thousand dollars] and said, "I don't have twenty-five, but I got ten."  He said, "As long as I get the full twenty-five at some point in the next so many months or whatever, then you're in good shape."  So I sent him ten and then five and five and five and got him his twenty-five thousand.  And so I said, "Okay, great."  So he says, "Now, here."  I said, "What do you mean, here?"  He said, "The station's yours."  "The station's mine?"  He said, "It's yours.  You paid the fee, you assume the note," (laughter).  "Take it over.  I'm going." "No, I need some time, you know."  He said, "No.  The time is up, you know."  So I ended up having to go to the station, which was in a field, if you will.  It had a little doublewide trailer, chickens in the front, cows in the back.  And the radio station was right there with the tower and everything else.
Speaker 2: So this is in Gary--this is in--
Speaker 1: Hearne, Texas.
Speaker 2: Hearne, Texas, okay, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hearne, Texas, yeah.
Speaker 2: This is KHRN.
Speaker 1: KHRN, yeah, yeah.  So WLTH was a fully functioning radio station.
Speaker 2: So did you have that one already when you got--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, I mean I--
Speaker 2: Hearne came first?
Speaker 1: No, no.  WLTH came first.  And then Hearne came within probably a year or two after that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we, we've kind of skipped over WLTH (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 648317
Speaker 1: So LTH was actually owned by Lorenzo Butler.  And he, he had had a really bad auto accident and needed some, someone to help him.  So probably 1992, we also bought the Informer and Texas Freeman [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman] in Houston [Texas].  So--
Speaker 2: Okay, so WLTH [WLTH Radio, Gary, Indiana] is actually owned by a Houston guy, Lorenzo Butler?
Speaker 1: Right, correct.
Speaker 2: And then the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics] who told you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --about Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and all that?
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, okay.  Now--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'd do the newspaper in Houston first.  He had the radio station that he had owned for, you know, some time.  And then the radio station.  So we got two radio stations and a newspaper.  Then, you know, as partnerships work, he and I had a, kind of a parting of the ways, and he said he would take the newspaper, and I'd take the radio stations.  And so, you know, we had, obviously, a legal agreement.  And he had some performance issues that he needed to basically comply with that he didn't.  So I ended up having to buy him out of the entire transaction.  And so I ended up with the newspaper in Houston, the radio station in Gary [Indiana] and then the radio station [KHRN Radio; KVJM Radio] in College Station [Texas].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so, now the--so it didn't, you didn't have to spend a lot of time in Gary, I take it.  You didn't--
Speaker 1: No, I mean Gary, I actually lived in Chicago [Illinois] and would commute into Gary.  It's about thirty-five miles from downtown Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I would balance my time between Chicago and the College Station and Houston.  So needless to say, I was a pretty busy guy from a traveling standpoint.  I mean I'm--
Speaker 2: Now this, this is the era of the Fly Jock, Tom Joyner--
Speaker 1: Right, right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --flying between Chicago and Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So you're flying between Houston and Chicago?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You're the fly owner, I guess, on some (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah, I guess so, yeah.  That's a good point, yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: That's interesting. At any rate.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean I'm young, I'm single, you know.  So I, I'd fly and go where I have to go.
Story_ID: 648318
Speaker 1: WLTH [WLTH Radio, Gary, Indiana], now, did they, was their programming patterned after WVON [WVON Radio] in Chicago [Illinois], 'The Talk of Chicago' (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More or less, I mean these were the days you could only own, I wanna say twelve AMs and twelve FMs, so the radio business was very fragmented.  And so we could go out and we could sell advertising in Chicago.  We could sell it in northwest Indiana.  It was a really great time.  I mean it was, you know, little small market radio, essentially.  I mean Gary [Indiana] is part of Chicagoland, which it's part of the Chicago radio market.  And, obviously, while we are a little small, one thousand watt AM station, you know, our coverage area had 1.2 million people in it.  You know, so we had a lot of people, very dense, you know, but still there's 8 million people in Chicago.  So, you know, while we covered a lot, it wasn't near what the stations in, in Chicago covered.
Speaker 1: Hm. Okay.
Story_ID: 648319
Speaker 1: Now, KHRN [KHRN Radio; KVJM Radio, Hearne, Texas], let's see.  This is, you were telling us about that.  So this happened after you got the station [WLTH Radio] in Gary [Indiana], the little station in Hearne [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you're, before I interrupted you, you were talking about being surprised.  Now, you actually have, you own this--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we have the station, and it's, so I'm having to subsidize the station.  It's not making any money, and, you know, actually, one of the guys that I worked with at the radio station [KBXX Radio] in Houston [Texas], you know, we had, you know, had become friends.  And I said, 'Man--," he said, "Man, if you ever get a radio station that you want programmed, let me know.  I'll program it for you."  And so I said, "Oh, well, great, you know."  So long story short, you know, I got the radio station, called him, and said, "Hey, Lester [ph.], can you help me out?  I need somebody to help me program this radio station."  So, you know, we got programming because, now, granted, Bryan-College Station [Texas] is an interesting market because what you have is Texas A&M University [College Station, Texas] which is, obviously, a huge university with its own culture, and literally, right next door as close as you and I are sitting, is Bryan.  Bryan's a very different city from College Station.  And, but there's a large, black population there.  They didn't have any, any black radio stations.  So we, you know, flipped the station from kind of the hodgepodge of Mexican programming and black programming and talk programming to a full fledged commercial radio station and made it where it was music all the time.  And so we played music, and it was a hit immediately because you had, obviously, the black population that loved it.  Then you had the kids over at A&M that also liked the music.  And it was a match made in heaven.  Now, of course, the financial side of it was different because the advertisers were like, hip hop music and R and B music, you know, "I don't listen to that music.  And I don't know about that music, and why in the heck am I gonna give you guys any money from an advertising standpoint?"  And so, you know, me being a sales guy, we made a ton of sales calls.  And so we would do these live remotes, if you will.  And so once they saw that the station could deliver, obviously, consumers for whatever their products and services were, we became fairly profitable.  I think we were (clears throat), excuse me, probably about twelve, maybe fourteen months after we acquired it, we got into what's, what's called cash flow neutral standpoint, which means that I wasn't losing any more money.  And from that point forward, it was profitable after that.
Story_ID: 648320
Speaker 1: I had a note here that, it came--there were some problems in trying to manage it from Houston [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: The r- the radio station [KHRN Radio; KVJM Radio, Hearne, Texas]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean it's, I'm, I'm good, but I'm--I can't be in three places at once.  So what I was able to do was obviously train staff.  And I trained a kid who literally came to me as like a sixteen year old, just a kid that wanted to be on the radio and trained him to, obviously, how, you know, I told him if he ever wanted to make any money, he had to go into sales because on air was, you know, a minimum wage job.  And so he was able to come in, Edward Sanchez [ph.] is his name, and he ended up being my station manager.  So I'm between Chicago [Illinois] and Houston, and, you know, Bryan-College Station [Texas].  And, you know, Bryan-College Station was a much smaller operation.  It was the smallest of the three operations.  And I needed to focus where the money was, which was basically, in Chicago and Houston.  And so I moved from Houston, essentially, you know, I had more time in Chicago.  And about this time, this is '92 [1992] or so, I met this young lady in Chicago.  And, you know, we began our courtship, and it became very evident that if I was gonna be some place (laughter) and I was gonna have a life, something had to change.  So I ended up saying, "All right, fine.  We'll leave Chicago."  It's doing fairly well, moved to Houston because we had the newspaper [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman] there, and set up shop.  And I ended up getting married, we got married in 1996.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and I'm probably missing some, some dates in there somewhere, but, yeah.  We settled in Houston.
Story_ID: 648321
Speaker 1: Now in '96 [1996] is when you acquired the Informer and the Freeman [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman], right?
Speaker 2: No, actually '92 [1992] was when, when we acquired the Informer and Texas Freeman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and you know, it was just a little, small black newspaper owned by the Watson family.
Speaker 1: Now, this is an old paper.  This is the paper that goes all the way back to when we were Freeman.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was actually--the Informer [Houston Informer] was one paper, and then the Texas Freeman was another one.  So they merged them together back in maybe the '30s [1930s] or so.  And so I mean while people call the paper the Houston Informer, it, the Texas Freeman has the legacy name that was created back in 1892.  So, 1893, actually.  So when we bought it, it was ninety-nine years old.  And it was, you know, it was an old, you know, coal type and liner type and cut and paste and light boxes and things of that sort.  You know, we put the computers in, and we did more money on the centennial issue of the paper than it had done (clears throat) excuse me, ever.  I mean it did probably a quarter million dollars in revenue and a hundred pages.  And it was, really, it was a great deal.  It really was.  So my thought was, and this is right, as radio is being deregulated.  So, you know, the idea of buying more radio stations, you obviously have to get money to do that, but once they deregulate a radio, and if people with tons of money could come in and buy up to eight stations per market, it killed my little idea of buying up, you know, TV stations and radio stations.  And so I said, well, heck, black newspapers, ah, you know, maybe there's an opportunity there.  And I just still thought, I said, man, this is way too much work.  So I went from having this wonderful job in television, where I would do a turn on transmitter.  If you got a TV at home, you watch it, to go into radio, which is more work, more fun, you know, remotes and things of that sort.  Now, I have a newspaper, where I have to find the information, write the stories, you know, produce the paper, distribute the paper.  And it was like way too much work.  It was a ton of work, you know, but, you know, it had longevity.  And it made money.  So I said, okay, fine.  Let's see if we can give a go at this (cough).
Speaker 1: Okay, so did any of the Watsons remain involved with the paper?
Speaker 2: We, Mrs. Watson [Marlene Watson] stayed around a bit.  But it was basically--excuse me.  Let me take a drink of water (pause).  Mrs. Watson, which once again, Houston is a very close knit community.  Mrs. Watson's husband, James Watson [James C. Watson], was the first black medical examiner.  And he actually happened to be my doctor also.  So I knew the Watson family.  I think they had four daughters, and so, you know, we knew 'em, and Mrs. Watson said, "You know, this is more than a notion to run a newspaper," and they didn't have anybody out selling.  So we cut a deal to, I actually borrowed some money from my mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall] (laughter) and my uncle.  I gave 'em a down payment, and we had fixed, you know, monthly payments we made to them for a period of years.  You know, so that's how we acquired the Houston Informer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --creative financing.
Story_ID: 648322
Speaker 1: What was your editorial philosophy; and did it change, did it change from what it had been pre- previously?
Speaker 2: No, it would--that was the other interesting part of the Informer [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman].  So George McElroy whose family literally grew up next door to my mother [Olivia Pleasant Marshall], growing up.  So George knew my mother before she was born.  And, yeah, as I say, it's a real small community, you know.  And so, I mean George knew me long before I was born.  And so, you know, we used to call him Mr. Mac, and he would, you know, he was the king--everybody knew him.  He was the, he was the dean of journalism in Houston [Texas], you know, just a great guy.  So, you know, we had, you know, we added color to the paper.  We had more, a little bit more of a focus on entertainment, but, ultimately, it was what we call a hard newspaper, where it wasn't a lot of fluff.  It was news and events about the community in Houston as well as around the country.
Speaker 1: I know a lot of papers at a certain point made a shift from covering a lot of black crime stories, which were the, you know, the staple of the black newspapers at one time, you know, who got killed and that sort of thing in the community, to covering more, you know, community events and positive events and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that what your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean murder and mayhem was very prevalent on television.  I mean there was no real need to rehash a murder that happened last night.  Now, obviously, if there was, something happened within our community that needed to be covered, you know, we'd actually cover it.  But the whole blood and guts and, you know, black folks killing black folks, it was like, you know, why bother to, you know, to cover it?  And while this is pre-Internet, if it hits the radio and it hits the TV, unless we have a unique angle on a story, it's like why would we cover this?  So, not that we--we didn't focus on soft news.  But just news that was more germane to the community.
Speaker 1: For instance?
Speaker 2: Well, for instance, much like what Black Enterprise does.  You know, I mean there's a lot of things happening with state legislators.  You know, we have a black mayor [HistoryMaker Lee P. Brown].  You have folks in Washington, D.C., you know, policy, things of that sort.  So, you know, there was just really no need to cover, you know, as I said, the murder and mayhem.  There was high school sports, which we did that, you know, very well.  And, you know, call it a version of what John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] did with Ebony because, you know, you would very seldom see a negative story in Ebony.  I mean it was always, you know, promoting the positive about black people.  And we just tend, tending to hue more toward that.  There were other papers in the city that can do the blood and guts.  Houston is probably one of the, the more overly populated newspaper cities in the country.  It was probably a dozen stations--a dozen newspapers in Houston between black and Caribbean, you know, and, and just all kinds of versions of, of news as people see it.  So it has, it has a lot of papers.

Speaker 1: Now you became active during this period with the National Newspaper Publishers Association?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.
Speaker 1: As a, you were a board member, and?
Speaker 2: Right, I, I, I was on the board, you know when, when we, since the Informer [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman] was actually one of the founding members of another group called Amalgamated Publishers, Incorporated [Amalgamated Publishers, Inc.].  And Amalgamated Publishers, Incorporated was a rep firm that represented black newspapers.  So we, obviously had a vested interest in black newspapers doing well because we had a rep business that came alongside of the newspaper.  And then the national trade association NNPA and API worked together.  So it was a bit of a symbiotic, you know, relationship.  API sold ads, and NNPA had newspapers.  The ads had to be placed by someone.  So API was a big, excuse me, a big part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's like a sidebar.  It was not on the resume.
Speaker 1: Okay, but Amalgamated Publishers In-?
Speaker 2: Incorporated.
Speaker 1: --Incorporated, okay.
Speaker 2: Based in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: So I just had to get the I--okay, (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was trying to figure out where the I came from, incorporated, all right.
Story_ID: 648324
Speaker 1: Is it now talk, time to talk about the Wave?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there's--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so all right, so we segued, so we have Houston [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman].  We had Gary [WLTH Radio, Gary, Indiana], we had KHRN [KHRN Radio; KVJM Radio, Hearne, Texas].  I mean we got all these properties, and so as I said, when they, they deregulated radio, it made it difficult for me to one, find stations, two, acquire financing.  And, and so our offices in Houston [Texas] were domiciled within the 610 loop [Interstate 610].  So Houston has a loop system.  So 610 is the loop.  So there was this company that was getting a fairly large bit of notoriety called Enron [Enron Corporation].  And, you know, I knew who they were.  They were big.  They were doing all kinds of things.
Speaker 1: That's the big energy company that--
Speaker 2: Enron, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the big energy that got in trouble.
Speaker 2: This is the big one.
Speaker 1: Enron, all right.
Speaker 2: Enron, so, you know, as I'm out looking for money, I get a phone call from someone who says, "Hey, Enron company is looking to do things locally in a local community."  And so they said, "Okay, so--," I'm like, "Great, that was good.  How does that help me?"  "Well, they have money to invest."  I said, "Oh, fantastic."  So they said, "One of the first requirements--," (laughter), which was you had to be within the 610 loop.  I said, "Really?"  I said, "As long as my business is inside the loop, I'd qualify for one of their possible loans?"  And he said, "Yes.  I said, "Wow, okay," I said, "that's great."  So I'm involved with NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association] and I'm out scouting and talking to people and so, they, I get a call that there's this paper in Los Angeles [California] called the Wave.  And so I said, "Okay, fine."  So I went and did my research on L.A.  There was a Wave, the Los Angeles Wave was a community paper.  The Los Angeles Sentinel was a black paper.  So I said, "Well, heck, let's just, you know, run the gamut and see what we can find out."  I contacted the people over at the Sentinel, had a real difficult time getting to the owner, just never could get any traction there at all.  So I talked to the, this gentleman that was running the Wave, C.Z. Wilson.  And so, you know, I talked to him, and, he says, "Oh, yeah, man, we're doing great things.  We got a bunch of people, and I'm taking over, and we're looking to acquire, had some challenges."  And so I said, "Okay."  He said, "Oh, I want you to come over and join my board [of Wave Community Newspapers, Inc., Los Angeles, California]?"  I said, "Really?"  I said, "C.Z., I mean, I know I'm a young, young guy," probably thirty-eight, thirty-nine years old, "but I'm buying businesses just like this.  I mean I would buy this newspaper."  He said, "Oh, don't worry about it--," he used to call me young buck, "Oh, don't worry about it, young buck.  You come on in."  So I said, "No, I'm gonna have my lawyer write you a letter to basically let you know that essentially, I'm a fox and you're a henhouse.  And I like eggs," (laughter), you know.  "So I want you to be very clear that if you add me to your board, there's a possibility that I would acquire, acquire this newspaper, you know, from you guys."  And so, you know, he said, "Oh, fine."  I said, "Okay, no worries.  I'll come in, and I'll join the board."
Story_ID: 648325
Speaker 1: So you're on the board of the Wave?
Speaker 2: So, I'm on the board of the Wave.  So the, the, the Wave [Los Angeles Wave], this is post the Rodney King riots and all that stuff.  So the, the Wave was able to receive money from a group called the Los Angeles Community Development Bank, not a commercial bank.  That's literally their entire title.  And so we were, C.Z.'s [C.Z. Wilson] thing was, we're here to create jobs.  And I said, "That's great C.Z., but we're losing money."  We were burning money like a dotcom.  I mean we were losing a hundred thousand a month, $350,000 a month, two hundred thousand dollars a month.  And C.Z. had a guy over at the LACDB that would just give him money 'cause he said we were creating jobs.  And at the time, we probably had 115 on staff.  We had a huge operation.  It was massive, twenty-six zones with the newspaper.  It was nothing I, I had never seen anything like this in the country for a community paper to be that big.  And we were printing four hundred thousand papers a week.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this idea that, so the Wave is a conglomeration of community papers or one company--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --that publishes several different community papers (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, so the Wave Newspapers [Wave Community Newspapers, Inc., Los Angeles, California] are a collection of about fifty mastheads.  So imagine fifty different newspapers that have been kind of rolled into and culled into, you know, one big operation.  And so with those fifty news--fifty mastheads, we had twenty-six zones.  So we had a zone for practically everything known to man, you know.  It was just, it was, it was a nightmare really, you know, to manage it from a logistical standpoint.  It was just, it was tough.  So when I came, I said, "Look, we gotta stream this thing down 'cause every time you stop a printing press, you pay more money."  So we would have twenty stops per night.  I mean I was spending sixty-five thousand dollars a week printing alone.  It was a massive operation 'cause C.Z. kept getting more money, so we kept burning it (laughter).  We'd just, just go through it to go through, to go through it.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't, little management actually going on, is what you're describing?  I mean this was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was quite a mess.  So at--
Speaker 1: People were running it, but they weren't managing it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, very true, very apt characterization.  So what ended up happening is the, at some--shortly thereafter, me joining the board, I said, "Guys, I can't sit here and just say, you know, this is, this is okay for us to lose this kind of money.  We're losing, you know, a million plus dollars a year."  And so the board, so it was myself, you know, Cynthia McClain-Hill, who's a lawyer, locally here, two representatives from what was the bank, C.Z., and then a representative from the actual employees.  So we had a seven member board.  And so they said, "Well, Pluria [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Jr.], you know, we understand that the paper is losing money and somebody's gotta run the paper."  And so I said, "Well, I'm flying from Texas.  I come to board meetings, you know," (laughter).  "I live a couple thousand miles away."  They said, "Well, we don't, we don't wanna run it."  You know, the two guys in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] didn't wanna run it, said they didn't wanna run it, you know.  C.Z. couldn't run it 'cause he had been, you know, making a mess.  And so they said, "Well, you run it, you run the paper."  And I'm going, "So you want me to run the paper from Texas?"  "No, I want you to fly in and run the paper."  So, they flew me in, and, you know, I ran the paper.  And so all the while, so I got my paper [Houston Informer and Texas Freeman] in Houston [Texas].  I got all my other stuff going on here.  And so I'm trying to, I'm talking to this Enron company [Enron Corporation].  And so we go back and forth, we're going round and round.  And so finally, you know, put the business plan together, and long story short, Enron finally says yes.  So I ended up acquiring control of the Wave from the Los Angeles Community Development Bank 'cause the bank really wasn't in the business of owning a newspaper, and (clears throat) excuse me, shortly there,  thereafter, a year or so later, we ended up acquiring full control of the Wave.  And, you know, that's, that's kind of where things are, are now.  And then, granted, obviously there's a ton of stuff in between there.  I can give you as much or as little of that as, as you'd like.
Story_ID: 648326
Speaker 1: What was the most difficult part of acquiring the Wave [Wave Community Newspapers, Inc., Los Angeles, California], I guess?
Speaker 2: The, the most difficult part of acquiring the Wave was just the acquisition itself because I knew someone locally.  I mean you don't get an opportunity to walk in and acquire a newspaper that's the biggest thing in a country.  And I just knew someone would come in and basically beat me out.  Somebody's gonna come in and be able to have more money, do this and do that.  And when the Enron [Enron Corporation] money came in, and we were able to consummate that deal, you know, it was a bit of relief and also concern 'cause like I--now, we gotta turn this thing around and actually make it make money.  So, you know, personnel challenges (laughter) were the interesting part of what we had to deal with 'cause we had so many people, so inefficient, duplication like you would not believe.  People had what we called legacy post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] jobs.  I've been here for a thousand years doing one thing, and, "You can't fire me."  I'm like, "Yes, we can."  And we fired a lot of people, you know, not because they were bad people, but because from a business standpoint, it just didn't make sense.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so the paper is now able to operate with how many staff (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We have gone from 1.2 acres in South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  When we acquired the Independent [Los Angeles Independent Newspaper Group, Los Angeles, California], we went from that facility to a fifteen thousand square foot facility to an eight thousand square foot facility.  Now, we're sitting in about six thousand square feet and about twenty-five staff people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, so, we have contracted, as newspapers have contracted.
Speaker 1: Okay, so three fourths of the old staff is gone?
Speaker 2: They're gone, yes, yep, although we have, we do have one gentleman, Arnold Adler, who's been here for many, many, many, many moons.  He's, I think Arnold's about eighty-two.  He's the most productive reporter that I've ever had.  This guy cranks out twenty stories a week, all day long, and everybody knows him in his beat and he does a fantastic job.
Speaker 1: Had he worked his whole--has he worked his entire life for the Wave [Los Angeles Wave]?
Speaker 2: I'm not, I don't think his entire life, I mean 'cause he's obviously up, up in age, but I mean he's a, he's a, a journeyman journalist; and does, does a great job for us.
Story_ID: 648327
Speaker 1: So the, the local co- communities, do they really feel a stake in the, in the, I mean do they really feel that they (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.  The, the, the Wave [Los Angeles Wave] has the, the distinction, I mean we're a hard news, newspaper.  I used that term earlier.  I mean we cover news that matters, essentially.  And we don't do a lot of weddings and, you know, funerals and things of that sort.  I mean it's really news and issues about the communities that we serve.  And that's what separates us from everybody else.  Some of the other papers are a bit light in their editorial coverage.  You can buy their editorial.  We don't sell our editorial here.  I mean it's--if some advertiser or some politician has done something wrong, we're gonna report on it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, 'cause--what are some of the memorial editorials in terms of--and where were they, you know, what was the opinion espoused, you know?
Speaker 2: The, you know, we really don't do a lot of edi- I mean I don't do a lot of editorializing.  You know, we have a couple of columnists and then folks that kind of carry the water, you know, for us.  One, Betty Pleasant.  You know, Betty is a walking editorial board herself, well known.  Either you love her or you hate her.  But she frames a lot of things that, you know, we do.  She's a columnist versus a reporter.  So she has a little bit--she has actually a lot more leeway to do what she does.  But, you know, I'm more of a sales publisher versus an editorial publisher.  You know, I set a broad construct for the editorial department, and as long as they kind of fit within those guidelines, they have a free right to cover what they need to cover.
Speaker 1: Okay, any significant endorsements made by the Wave over this last few years?
Speaker 2: We really don't do a lot of endorsements, but we did endorse, of sorts, Mayor Garcetti [Eric Garcetti].  You know, we know them fairly well. He was one of the first people that I met when I came to Los Angeles [California] through Ben Jealous [Benjamin Jealous] who is now retired from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  So Eric and I met when he was called a cub councilperson.  So I've known him for eighteen years, I guess--or fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is it a--is there any community that's more difficult to cover than another?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: No, no, I mean with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] having challenges and closing their community division, there's eighty-eight cities within L.A. County [Los Angeles County, California], which is a lot.  We probably cover, you know, couple dozen of 'em.  And, I mean news is just, I mean, and it's tough, you know.  And with the Internet being, siphoning off a ton of our revenue, you know, we all--although, we have a website and have had a website for, you know, over ten years, it's just challenging.  But if there's any community of the ones that we cover, I'd probably say West Hollywood [California] is more challenging than some of the other cities just by the nature of what Hollywood is and the community, and, you know, the news.  And, you know, we're not a, like gay publication.  You know, our newspaper, the West Hollywood Independent is a newspaper that covers West Hollywood.  It's the official paper of West Hollywood, but we don't, you know, publish the salaciousness and all the stuff that kind of goes with that.
Speaker 1: But that is like a predominantly gay community (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, gay and--gay and Jewish and, you know, Russian.  It's a very affluent community, very affluent.  And, you know, that's if, if I had to pick a paper that was challenging within our group of eight, that would be the more challenging paper.
Speaker 1: Okay, the readers who are more likely to give you feedback over there about what some (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we, we get feedback from everybody, but, but they, if you, if you, if you've ever been to a City of West Hollywood city council meeting [West Hollywood City Council], it's, it's, it's quite a, an event.
Story_ID: 648328
Speaker 1: I was looking, I was, you know, glancing through the papers, you know, for first time here in the office here this morning, and you had the different--did you start features--and I was looking at something called the Next Level [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where it would seem like a feature that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, we created Next Level as an answer to the business community.  There's always a need to promote businesses.  Our sales manager, you know, wanted some type of feature that we could highlight businesspeople.  So we created that, and it's been well received, and people like it, and, you know, I mean business guys loved to see their face and ladies, to see their face in the paper, especially when it's positive and talks about, you know, what they do.
Speaker 1: Do you have like a f- formula for, I guess for, I mean a strategy going forward in, in terms of, you know, revenue [for Los Angeles Wave Publications Group, Los Angeles, California] and, and--'cause this is, I know there was quite a bit of discussion beginning the early 2000s about whether print newspapers had any future or not, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I always like to say that once upon a time, there was a man who had a couple of tablets, you know, the Ten Commandments, you know, (laughter), the written word, if you will.  And, obviously, there's been a Bible that's been around for thousands and thousands of years.  And the written word has been around forever.  And from a media standpoint, at the advent of every creation of a quote, unquote media killer.  So radio was gonna kill newspapers, and the TV was gonna kill radio and newspapers, and what has happened is the pie is just sliced, you know, in different, you know, pieces.  So nothing has killed anything.  So if you go back and look at, well, FM was gonna kill AM and, you know, TV--it's like nothing's gonna die off.  I mean obviously, we have to change the way we do what we do.  It's very challenging with the Internet and people getting news, but what we cover is probably not in what we call wide circulation.  There's nobody's gonna be coming into South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and beating us to cover XYZ story.  So community newspapers of all things within the newspaper sector are doing much better than dailies because when we cover local news, if you're from Chicago [Illinois], you have the Crusader [Chicago Crusader], you have the Chicago Defender.  You have the Citizen [Chicago Citizen Newspaper Group], you know, those are papers that cover a geographic area that the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] and the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] will probably never (unclear).  We have the same, you know, issue here in Los Angeles [California].  So community papers are actually doing very well.  Black and ethnic papers are, are doing well considering where newspapers are today.
Story_ID: 648329
Speaker 1: Now, in 2005, now, you, you had to file bankruptcy, but it was a part of a business strategy?
Speaker 2: Right, right, we, we, we had--the, the, the Los Angeles Community Development Bank went bankrupt.  So our, our loan was essentially in limbo.  So we had this, I mentioned this 1.2 acre property in South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] that we had agreed to sell as part of our obligation to our lender.  And so, you know, we had the building on our books was carried at basically zero.  The appraised value from years ago was like a million bucks [dollars].  But as I learned about Los Angeles [California] real estate, the real estate values can go wildly different from what's on your books.  So we actually had a buyer at $2.5 million.  And so we told the lender, said, "Look, we'll give you the money.  We'll give you 100 percent of the money."  And so we cut a deal, cut on a Friday.  By Tuesday, he said, "Deal's off."  We said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "Well, you know, we want you to just give us the asset."  I said, "Why would I just give you an asset that we obviously have a buyer for at twice what I carry it?"  And he said, "Well, you know, we're gonna take it."  So I went back to my board and they said, "You can't do that.  You can't just hand this guy the asset.  You--we will be screwed to the wall basically."  So we put the company [Wave Community Newspapers, Inc., Los Angeles, California] into bankruptcy, and we had to force them to take the money which was insane, but, you know, we did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is, I mean so you're glad you changed majors, I guess, in school [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I actually was.  You know, business management, everything's a business.  It doesn't matter what it is, if it's a for profit or a not-for-profit.  And it's helped me out tremendously all the accounting (clears throat) excuse me, and, and the finance courses and just the more round- the more rounding of, of my education from a business standpoint was, was very critical.
Story_ID: 648330
Speaker 1: Now, you've been a mem- are, are you still a member of the National Black Media Coalition, or?
Speaker 2: Well, the National Black Media Coalition essentially, my, my, my father [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] has retired.  So it's, for all intents and purposes, it's now defunct.
Speaker 1: And the National Association of Broadcasters?
Speaker 2: I was a member of NAB, and served on the board of the Texas Association of Broadcasters when I lived in Texas.  So, yeah, I'm not a member of NAB any longer either.
Speaker 1: Probably not the National Association of TV Programming Executives [sic. National Association of Television Program Executives] either?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, that was back in my days in TV, right?
Speaker 1: NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association], are you still involved?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm actually with NNPA, actually with CNPA [California Newspaper Publishers Association] which is the, the California version of NNPA, but it's for all publishers.  I'm also on the foundation, the NNPA Foundation board as, as vice chairman.
Story_ID: 648331
Speaker 1: You know, thinking about everything you've done to this point, now what's your--do, do you have a big thing that you wanna pull off?  You know, what's your dream, I guess of acquisition in terms of media?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean there's still a massive need for news information in the black community.  And when you look globally at where, essentially, black people are.  And, you know, there's black folks in Germany and France and the UK [United Kingdom] and Australia.  There's still no news organ that addresses people of color.  You know, I mean everybody else has a news network.  You got 'em in China, you got 'em in the Ukraine, you have 'em in Russia.  You have 'em in South America, you know, every--Canada.  Everybody has a network, a news network that speaks to their community.  Black people don't have it.  So if there was, you know, if you will, a dream which would probably come to fruition within the next five years, it would be to create essentially a black version of CNN and then take it global because there's a ton of issues that Europe deals with differently than America does, but they're basically the same.  Black people have a challenge.
Speaker 1: Okay, so sort of a Pan-African CNN or is that what you mean? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I mean it's, you know, the challenge, I mean since I'm a business guy and the sales guy at heart, you have to be able to sell advertising to support whatever you do.  I don't think anybody has quite figured out Africa from an advertising standpoint.  One, you have to deliver a product to the continent.  You got a ton of countries, a ton of language challenges.  So, you know, what we would do is we would focus on, obviously, America first, probably go in the Caribbean 'cause obviously, there's a large black population there, maybe the UK, maybe Germany, maybe France.  We, we'd wanna focus on area (clears throat) excuse me, we wanna focus on areas that are friendly to journalists, where they don't just kill 'em on sight.  And you see in the Middle East, that's a huge problem.  And you, as a journalist, know, you don't mind going into a war torn area, but you wanna have a reasonable sense that unless you get hit by a mortar shell, that the people aren't gonna kill you just because you're reporting the news of the day.  So--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --that would be my swan song (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but you imagine this being world, I mean a worldwide news network for African people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with a, emanating from the United States with a, you know, an African American staff basically?
Speaker 2: Right, well, yeah, I mean we'd obviously have probably a predominance of, you know, black folks working for us, but, you know, as you see my staff here, it's like the United Nations [UN].  I got a little bit of everything--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, it doesn't necessarily have to be an African American staff, so much--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as it is--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the subject that is covered.
Speaker 2: Subject matter, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you a step close to doing this?
Speaker 2: Yes, we are working diligently as we speak on a couple of plans and a couple of tracks to secure funding 'cause obviously, you've got to have a good bit of money to get this done.  And, you know, it's something that I've been working on for a long time.  So it's not like something started from, from scratch.  This has been probably a ten plus year project.  And I think timing and some, some partners that we're working with are just about right to, to make it happen.
Story_ID: 648332
Speaker 1: Now this is, I guess, we--so you've got, you got like on American cable television now, you've got like BBC News--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --presence, which is a British slant on the news, but the British would probably say it's the universal slant on the news produced by the British.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: I mean is there, have you considered, I mean there's A- Al Jazeera--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --which presents the Islamic world's take on the news in, you know, and I'm sure it's subjective within that context.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, and they're doing it there, but Al Jazeera America, now, do you think there's an African American slant on the news, I mean philosophically, that's different from--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean I have a phrase I used to use in some of our sales pitches which basically states, "All news affects all people differently."  So, when O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murder, they had two cameras set up, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Harvard and Howard.  When you cut to Harvard, there was dismay, "Oh, my god, he's acquitted."  Howard, you'd think the people won the lottery (laughter) or the Bison [Howard University Bison] had won the, you know, their championship or whatever.  And I mean that's, it's always gonna be that way in America.  Trayvon Martin is the most recent example, the Jena Six.  There are countless atrocities that have happened to black people in America that if you get two people that differ in race, you will get at least probably a dozen different versions of what made sense or what didn't make sense.  So, yes, there is a huge need for this to happen.  I like to say that news globally has been unbalanced from day one.  We've always had a challenge telling our stories in a proper manner and no one's been able to tell it.  So what we would do is, is offer, you know, not a slant on the news, but just a version of the news that is basically from a black person's point of view.  Now, if a black guy killed somebody, he killed somebody, period.  Murder is murder, you know.  But, you know, everything that black people do is not entertain- you know, an entertainer, an athlete or some type of drug dealer.  You know, that's not who black people are.  And, you know, the average person, if you saw me in any other setting, you know, based on my physical body size, you'd say, oh, he's an athlete.  Who'd you play for?  You know, well, I went to college [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] on an academic scholarship, you know, not a football scholarship or a tennis scholarship.  So there's this perception that, you know, black folks, you know, that's all we do, is we can entertain and we can do this and we can do that.  You know, but as you know, Reginald Lewis [Reginald F. Lewis] was the first, you know, black man ever to do a multibillion dollar transaction, you know.  And then he, you know, was fantastic and great, but if you walk up to the average kid and ask, you know, a little black kid who he is, they go, "Who?  Does he play football?  You mean Reggie Lewis, the--," yeah, no.  This is the entrepreneur.  This is the black guy that did Beatrice Foods [Beatrice Foods TLC; TLC Beatrice International Holdings, Inc.].  So there's a lot that we obviously have to offer outside of sports and entertainment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is, this would be a furthering of the model of the first black newspaper, "We wish to plead our own cause" ['To Our Patrons,' Samuel Cornish and John Russwurm].
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Freedom's Journal, correct, exactly (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question: when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: The only thing I would do different, from a business standpoint, I would have gone and got an M.B.A. from Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  Now, you may say, why Harvard?  Well, Harvard's network of people from what I've seen is pretty phenomenal.  You know, I may have done a little time on Wall Street, because obviously finance is key and critical.  But, you know, I loved my experienced at Clark College, now Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  I have some of my best friends in life that I met there.  And I really wouldn't do anything different.  I have no regrets.  I'm glad I got married, you know, when I was in my thirties.  I have, you know, two kids and a wife.  You know, I wouldn't change anything.  I'm not the kind of guy who's a, if I could have, would a, should a.  Well, you know, if I had just, well, maybe if I had, no, no.  You make a decision based on the information that you have.  Hopefully, you have good counsel, which I believe I do.  And I make prudent business decisions, but that's the only thing that I would do different.  I'm not sure when I would do it 'cause I would have missed my training in Mississippi and the whole TV station thing [WLBM-TV; WGBC-TV, Meridian, Mississippi], could have possibly done it when I, when the deal in Mississippi blew up.  I had a couple of years.  I could have gotten an M.B.A. at that point.  So, you know, I mean those are the only--that's the only logical time for me that I could have done it.  But I was really upset about that deal not happening (laughter) 'cause I'd been working for it since I was seventeen years old, so.
Speaker 1: Well, like I said, you, you had early, success early on, and some ups and downs.
Story_ID: 648334
Speaker 1: So we're talking about, you know, success early on, you know, that some, you know, some you know--experienced some down points, but then coming back.  Now, when you look back on all this, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Has not been written yet (unclear).  I mean my legacy will be that news network [Los Angeles Wave Publications Group].  You know, you could look back and say, oh, he owned a couple of radio stations, and he did this and he did that, and he, you know, was working with this pioneer guy, Ted Turner.  Yeah, those are great things, but, you know, did they move the needle?  You know, what has he moved the needle for, you know, me and my family and my community, you know.  I mean, has anything moved the needle?  And I'd say, not really at this point.  Yeah, we do a great job here in Los Angeles [California].  We did a great job in Houston [Texas] and College Station [Texas] and northwest Indiana, but nothing that's, that's really moved the needle.  I mean, hadn't created a Facebook [Facebook, Inc.], yet, you know (laughter) or something like that.  So that, that, that news network would be it.
Story_ID: 648335
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your family.  You've got children, right, and?
Speaker 2: I have a daughter that's, that's fifteen and a son that's thirteen.  I have a wonderful wife who is a stay at home mom when we moved here [Los Angeles, California] 'cause our kids were like three and five.  So it was important--it was more important for me to have her take care of them and be there, you know.  I mean my kids don't know.  They leave stuff.  My daughter left her, one of her--she has a couple of calculators 'cause she's a great, she's very, does a very good--does very well in math and science.  So she calls this morning, "Mom, can you bring my calculator?"  You know, well, if I'm off to work, and my wife is at work, then obviously, that's something.  And obviously, parents, there're dual, you know, families that work with not having someone at home.  But it was more important for me to have her there for them so that anything that they needed.  And, you know, my wife, when she goes out of town, I have to take care of the kids, especially when they were younger.  It's a job.  It's a real serious job.  And, you know, I think we, as men, all men of all races, don't give the stay at home moms nearly enough credit for what they do 'cause it's, it's work.  I had to do the car pool thing and, and just make it all work.  And I was happy when she got back home so I could go back to, to my job (laughter).
Story_ID: 648336
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I think we need to get back to more community.  We do, we do not do a very good job of taking care of one another, and as I mentioned, when I was a kid in Houston [Texas], if I got in trouble at school, you know, I got in trouble at school, I got in trouble, you know, with my coaches in football, get in trouble at home, that does exist.  I mean, you know, black people--and to a large extent.  I mean there's, it's conflict and strife across many continents in many races.  And people have challenges, but, you know, we as black people, we're unique and different from other black people in the world.  I mean slavery happened everywhere, but the concentration and the impact on America was very, very different.  I think if we become more concerned about, you know, how our kids can function in the society and go back in some cases to the way things, you know, were before, from a management standpoint of what we do and how we do it, I think we'd be a lot better off.  But the breakdown of the village, if you will, is a huge challenge.  And it's gotta be fixed so that, you know, the kids, and you know, as I said, my parents [Olivia Pleasant Marshall and HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.] were divorced.  This whole thing about, "Well, I don't have a mama and I ain't got a daddy," it's like, there's no excuse.  There's no excuse for you as a person to basically want a pass so that, you know, you can go and be stupid.  You know, it's not acceptable, you know.  Everybody has to, to, to pull their own weight; and in a lot of cases, it's not happening in our community.
Story_ID: 648337
Speaker 1: Now does the, the Wave--does Wave publishing [Los Angeles Wave Publications Group, Los Angeles, California] have a foundation or anything that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No we, we, we have a, a, a nonprofit called the, the Black Media Preservation Foundation, which is broader in scope because black media essentially is black newspapers.  You have the NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association], but there's nobody else outside of NNPA formally, that actually does anything directly for, you know, black newspapers.  And so when we created this nonprofit last year, you know, the goal is to make sure that we have a black media going forward.  You know, there's very few radio stations that are owned by blacks.  I mean the TV ownership is absolutely invisible.  I mean it's probably less than a half of a percent, if that.  So there is a need to preserve this because everybody needs a voice.  I mean I, obviously, as a publisher, I get hundreds of emails a day.  And one I get pretty consistently is from The Jewish Journal [The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles].  I get one from them, you know, at least once a day.  And, you know, we, as black newspapers, should be pushing out our stories, just like they do.  And obviously, the Hispanic community has hundreds of networks.  Everybody has something except us, you know.  So, you know, that's what drives me and has really fueled my passion for wanting to get this news network done because it will provide balance to the larger and immediate landscape.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the Black Media Preservation Foundation does, what is it--
Speaker 2: It's a 501(c)(3) that has not been funded yet.  We will probably be able to get that done in 2014.  We have some other projects that have kind of moved it to the side at this point.  But once we get those off the ground, we'll be able to activate that nonprofit also.
Speaker 1: So, is it a, is the goal to protect and preserve, you know, keep in place the ownership that we have now in terms of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's, it's designed to help, you know, black media still, you know, be around.  Now, what that looks like?  It can be in the form of grants for websites.  It can be investigative journalists.  It's really broad enough to where, I mean you remember Carl Rowan, you know, I mean and Paul Harvey.  I mean Carl Rowan, I mean I can still hear his wonderful commentaries that were salient and just on time for those times.  Well, we don't have that anymore.  You know, one, nobody on radio is really doing anything that is of quality from the news standpoint.  So it's things like that we could activate.  And, obviously, you know, put it on television and radio and, you know, make it work.  So it's, it's--the name is broad enough to where we can do almost anything.  We could do education, you know.  We can go into the schools, I mean as early as elementary school, work with the newspapers, help them with their social media, with their photography, with their video.  So it's just something that we need to do that, and actually is doing it, a little bit from a selfish standpoint because we need to be able to grow folks, that actually read the printed word, you know, and use full sentences and real words, not U-R, for your (laughter) and things of that sort, you know.  So, and I mean kids, kids really are our future.  I mean we have to give them the things that they probably don't know that they need; and, and, and make it work for everybody.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't mentioned that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I mean I think we, we've, we've covered pretty much most of my career, if, if you will, you know.  No, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I would like to be remembered as the, as the black man that provided the global vehicle of change--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from a media standpoint.
Speaker 1: All right, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
