Speaker 1: I ask five questions of everyone, they're a little People magazine-ish, but if you'll just bear with me with very short answers--
Speaker 2: Carry on.
Speaker 1: --I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, my favorite food is soul food, which I can only eat, obviously, but black-eyed peas, candied yams, neck bones, obviously gumbo, at the top of the list, obviously, and top it off with a bit of peach cobbler.  You can tell my Louisiana roots are very deep, I admit to my transgressions, if you will.
Speaker 1: A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I must say Christmas because it's family.
Speaker 1: And a favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: Well, I like going to the Caribbean but I don't go there as often as my wife [Doris Dillon Dyer] and I would like to go but I like to go to the Caribbean a lot, specifically the Bahamas and maybe in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: And I use this, it's not original but I use it in my memoir quite a bit, success is nothing more than a rendezvous between preparation and opportunity.
Story_ID: 202243
Speaker 1: I want to start out by asking you about your mother and if you could give her name and talk about what you know about her family and, you know, on her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Barbara, they call her "B," Parker Brooks.  I should tell you we were very close.  As a matter of fact, the memoir ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS,' Joseph Dyer] that I wrote I dedicated to her.  They came from Louisiana.  They were basically sharecroppers, poor, very poor.  She came from a large family.  I don't recall the number but I think it was something like maybe ten, eleven sisters and two brothers.  And it's interesting because in those days, years ago, it was, you'd say, I'm not too sure it was done deliberately but it was an economic advantage to have large families because, you see in the rural life, when you did your own sharecropping and you raised your own stuff for market, to have a large family, that same large family became employees, if you will.  Everybody took to the fields.  The more out in the fam- out in the fields, the more work could be done, the more produce you could take to the market.  So when you find out years ago, fifty years ago maybe, beyond, a lot of, especially the African American families down south were basically large families because (unclear) and like I said before, it was an economic reality.  You needed large families to help harvest the crops.
Speaker 1: Now how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Well my mother was disabled.  She was among the hearing impaired.  She was very strong and even to this day, even though she's gone, when I feel I'm being overly challenged, quite frankly, I often think about the challenge she had because throughout her life, I'm sure she suffered many indignities because of her hearing impediment.  Well-meaning people tended to shout at her and shouting was not necessary.  In fact, since I was the oldest child, I many times found myself trying to become a buffer between well-meaning friends and relatives, the person who didn't know that you didn't have to shout, you just had to speak clearly, slowly, and she did a pretty good job of lip reading.  She referred to me, I don't think I ever remembered my mother calling me [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer] Joe, she always referred to me as "Man."  "Come on man," "let's go man," because truly in her early years, I was the man of the house.  My father [Joseph Dyer, Sr.] died when I was about seven, eight, and she was disabled.  So I tried my best to take up the slack during that interim period before she married my first stepfather, Mr. Ed Parker, a delightful man.  And so I had to help take care of the three younger sisters [Vergie Dyer Thomas, Shirley Dyer Pierre, and Barbara Dyer Morris] and to join her in the cotton fields and she talked to me as if she's talking to another spouse, you know.  She'd tell me what the problems--any time I see her walking through the house talking to herself, I know she was trying to get it together, you know, just talking to herself.  And I really felt deeply for her, you know, and I was inspired by her.
Story_ID: 202244
Speaker 1: Now was she [Dyer's mother, Barbara Parker Brooks] born that way, I mean with her hearing impaired?
Speaker 2: She was born with a hearing impediment, right.  All of her life she's been with that difficulty.
Speaker 1: And do you know the cause of that?
Speaker 2: Never did, never did.  I think it was mainly genetic, quite frankly, but you know the funny thing about it, talk about her courage, I'm basically a very reticent person, I'm very quiet, I mean, being alone does not cause me any problems whatsoever.  My wife [Doris Dillon Dyer], in this family, is a great contrast, my wife, is like my mother.  My wife loves to talk and I don't.  I don't say I dislike talking, it's just that I don't normally talk very much.  I get in a corner, I'm very pleased.  When my mother and I used to--and the sisters [Vergie Dyer Thomas, Shirley Dyer Pierre, and Barbara Dyer Morris] used to get on the train and travel across the South, invariably my mother would start talking to someone, either seated next to her or across the aisle.  Well, the minute she did that, that pressured me into the conversation, because I became immediately the volunteer interpreter, because my mother would not understand what the other response is from the person with whom she's talking, and the person with whom she's talking to, till they let on she was hard of hearing, they would just talk normally.  Sometimes they look forward and they're still talking.  I mean, the projection went forward but recognizing this and many time my mother was striking these conversations and I said, oh, here we go again.  That means it's going to be a long-winded conversation, we've got a long way to go and I've got to provide the interpretation.  But she never let her impediment make her gun-shy about talking to people.  And I theorized years later that in a group session, like we are right now, my mother usually led the conversation.  I think she did it because she could control the conversation.  She knew exactly what the conversation was about 'cause she was controlling it, quite frankly, so she didn't have to feel embarrassed by saying something totally counter to what the conversation was all about, and I respected that.  So, throughout the years, I always say that if she made it with her hearing impediment on welfare, the meager welfare check, trying to struggle to support us back in the '40s [1940s] when times were bad and we were in an area of institutionalized racism, I mean, racism was not in Louisiana in those years, but it was on the books.  I mean, there were certain things you couldn't do by law, and you had to run that gauntlet almost every day.
Story_ID: 202245
Speaker 1: Matter of fact in my memoir ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the cotton fields to CBS,' Joseph Dyer], I related how it was going downtown [in Bogalusa, Louisiana], you know, and some of the stores you walk in first and you get served last or you walk in and a lady politely excuses herself from you because someone white walks in after her and she had to accommodate them first.  It wasn't done brusquely, it was done very politely but nevertheless you felt the bit of indignity, quite frankly.  No matter how old or young a person was who referred to my mother [Barbara Parker Brooks], she's white, she was always a girl, you know, and invariably she was "Auntie" or "Grandmother" but very seldom her name, very seldom her people referred to her as "Barbara," you know, it was always "Hey girl," "Hi grandma," and stated almost very humorously, if you will.  The other indignity, just a case in point, I remember as a group of whites who owned a restaurant [Capo's] in front of us, Italians, well-meaning people, of course, and they'd come over here initially, the older person was from Italy, and they were very nice people but they had some daughters and two sons that she'd play with us a lot and when I started working for them, after school, one day I was called in and the lady said, "Joe Junior [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], when you guys play with Lucille [Capo], would you do me a favor?  Would you guys play around the back of the house with her 'cause it just doesn't look right you guys playing right there in the front yard."  And I know what she was trying to say.  She didn't wanna, it didn't, it wasn't said vindictively, she was saying, and I think, for our safety and to keep some of the people from reacting negatively to us who saw us playing with this little white girl out there in the front yard and we meant her no harm and she was just another person as far as we were concerned, quite frankly.  And the other thing is that when normally I'd walk into the restaurant, and it was a carhop place and you walk in and just order three, "Let me have four po'boys, let me have three ham sandwiches," or something, and if I didn't understand it, that they heard me, I would call that young lady, who was her daughter, Lucille, I mean Veda [Capo], "Veda, did you get that order?"  And then she'd finally called me in later and said, "Joe, I appreciate it if you wouldn't call her Veda, if you can call her Mrs. Capo I'd appreciate it very much because it doesn't look right.  Some of the people around the corner may not understand what you're saying."  That whole transformation, you know, and that was before the Civil Rights Movement but it also showed a mindset in that the thing that I always remember, one day I was back there stirring up the meat part for the barbeque, the po'boy beef, and she came back there and the owner said, "Joe, as long as you're here, Little Joe, you have a job for life" and at the time I'd gotten a scholarship to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] and she heard I was going to be going to Xavier, and to college, and she said, "Well, your momma needs you here in Bogalusa and she'd done wonders with you kids over there, now you got a job here with me for life.  If I were you, I wouldn't be worried about going to college, I know, 'cause look at my brother, and Pete [ph.] had a broken hip and he's kind of walking on one side, he said, all his life, he's been disabled working at that football, now you don't want that to happen because your mother needs you."  And I understood what she was trying to say in her limited bit of intelligence, mind you, I appreciate it very much, I appreciate.  I didn't think ill of her because years earlier she had brought clothes over, hand-me-downs, and she was very good to the family.  This is why when my--I was working at the place called Acme Cafe [Bogalusa, Louisiana] and I was enjoying it down there 'cause I was eating food I'd never eaten before, being back then a busboy, you know, I'd go back in the kitchen, as I said in my book, and I would eat like a king.  I mean, bouillabaisse, I'm not gonna get that kind of eating at home, we couldn't afford it.  So I wanted to stay at Acme as an after-school job and my mother had talked to Mrs. [Anna] Capo who said look, have Joe work for me.  Well I realized that there was going to be some problems there because the problem would be that when you're living in front of your place of employment, you never get off because I would sit on the front porch and she'd say, "Joe Junior, you got a minute?" and all during the week that minute would just get to be a part of the job and so I never had peace.  I'd end up sitting on the back porch part of the time because I said, God I'm not going to go to work today free.  And you wanted to be as accommodating as you possibly could because they had been very nice to the family and over the years and we were struggling to put clothes on our back but that was a two-edged sword too and I said I don't want to go over there but fortunately for me I stayed over there on and off during the summer for about six years, 'cause during college I had a job and that's in my book and I won't belabor the point here, I had two jobs, in the daytime I worked at the box factory and the money I made at the box factory, I set aside for my college tuition, that kind of stuff.  At night when I worked at the carhop, I used that money to buy my clothes with and took out, usually spending money.  So I was able to do all right, supporting myself with those two jobs.  I was given time to go practice football and all that kind of stuff.  So they were very accommodating.  So I don't say this as a knock against them but it's an observation of the times that we were living in back in Louisiana, back in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s].  It was very, very interesting.
Story_ID: 202246
Speaker 1: --Let me go back to your father [Joseph Dyer, Sr.].  He passed away, you said, when you were seven?  Do you have memories of him?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  It's a very interesting because there's certain snippets of memory that you have.  You know, you remember things like we had an old Model T Ford, the one you had to get out, but you probably wouldn't know, but you had to use a crank in front and crank it up and that kind of stuff and he and I would go out and try to crank that thing up and every now and then it would start and most of the time it wouldn't.  He was a no-nonsense person.  He was very, I guess, most of the time he was very frustrated because he's working on a government job called the WPA [Works Progress Administration], I guess a work program project, I guess, to make work, obviously, for people who needed to work during the [Great] Depression.  And I would see him from time to time standing by the dresser.  They used to have a little tobacco pouch, you know, in a little canvas bag that people had to put tobacco in, but he would have it, that is this money pouch and I would see him sometimes standing at the dresser countin' out those little change, just kind of figuring, I guess, how's he's going to budget his money to make ends meet.  And invariably I knew that things were bad when I saw him standing there very pensively doling out those money, separating the money if you will, in that pouch.  I don't think I'll ever forget those, those days but then again he had a very bad temper, and I say the hurricane.  I noticed sometimes I guess his frustration ended up when he was, basically, he would hit my mother [Barbara Parker Brooks] and I obviously didn't take kindly to that.  I tried, as I got older, I understand years later that he was frustrated because the challenges on his life, but as a young child coming up, the only thing I could see was another man hitting my disabled mother and always said that sometimes the law works out for the best because if I had gotten older, and if he had hit her, I possibly would have taken the initiative and done something very irresponsible to him and freak, so to speak, but when people talk about abuse, I usually hear it, hear him fighting her late at night and, that really would get next to me.  And I didn't capture this in the book because I don't remember that much about him over a period of years because at the age of seven, eight, he was gone, quite frankly.  But I do remember the beatings against my mother and keep in mind we were very close and I felt as if I had to protect her and after he died years later, even after the last two husbands died, you know I still figured that when she had her stroke that part of my charge was to help protect her and my middle sister, Shirley [Dyer Pierre], was very helpful in the area.  The--I made a statement some time ago to a friend of mine at CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California], as a matter of fact he was my boss at the time, a guy by the name of [HistoryMaker] Johnathan Rodgers, and he and I were talking, and he had a job opportunity after I retired that he wanted to share with me and I said no, I don't think I'm going to be able to go back to work right now because I have a full-time job trying to take care of my mother, and I never shall forget his response to me, he said, "You don't have a job, Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], you're doing the Lord's work," and I said, you know, that's very perfectly placed here, I appreciate that.  You're doing the Lord's work and that's how I look at doing the Lord's work.

Speaker 1: Now I want to know, I want to take you back just to your childhood a little bit and I want to know, well two things, can you give your siblings' names--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and their birth order?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of my sisters, right up under me, Vergie [Dyer Thomas] died I guess about ten years ago, by spinal meningitis.  My middle sister, now Shirley [Dyer] Pierre, lives in Gardena [sic. Inglewood, California], and my baby sister is Barbara [Dyer] Morris, she lives in--no disregard, Shirley lives in Inglewood and Barbara's in Gardena [California], and just three of us left.
Story_ID: 202248
Speaker 1: And can you tell me your earliest memory?  What your earliest memory of growing up is?
Speaker 2: I would think that, yes, it's interesting, I think I can picture and hold it very well because--pinpoint it very well, because I was very actively involved in the younger days they called it operettas, you know, they'd come and get you out of one class every time they'd have a school play, and a young lady by the name of Regina Marks, and I've got some pictures of it in there, she became my leading lady from elementary school on to [Central Memorial] High School [Bogalusa, Louisiana], and a school teacher by the name of Ms. Turelean [ph.], I never shall forget, she'd continually come get us out of the class and we'd go in and practice oh, those plays, and I became a little, how do you say it, a little elementary star in those days 'cause I had mostly the leading roles and I really appreciated sometime before performance she'd have us go home early and I'd read all these Hollywood magazines, you know, and you see all these big stars would do it so I sat on the side of the house, and fantasize, and one day you'll get to Hollywood, blah, blah, blah. I remember those years very well because I was on stage an awful lot through those plays and then, obviously, that carried over to the performances at church on Easter Sunday, you'd get up and you'd do your Easter Sunday oration, if you will, and then your Christmas program.  So I was very much involved being on stage virtually all of my life and I think it helped me in later years because it took away from me--keep in mind I was basically a very shy person but by continually being in front of the public, I was able to control it, or conceal it, very well, and I did pretty well in terms of oratorical contest and the later years we had a drama group and I became heavily involved in drama from there to college [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana; Grambling College, Grambling, Louisiana] of course, and winning quite a bit of award.  As a matter of fact when I came to Los Angeles [California] years ago, I kid people, I said I came out here to replace Sidney Poitier.  Well that just never happened because, at the time, things were tight in the business over here but I didn't do too badly because I ended up in media and that's, was not too much of a comedown.
Story_ID: 202249
Speaker 1: Your schools, elementary was?  Your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary, junior and senior--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --all was one big building.
Speaker 1: Okay, all the same?  What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Central Memorial High School [Bogalusa, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: All was in one building?
Speaker 2: One big building.  You went to certain grades in elementary school, with one set of teachers.  Then when you graduate to junior high school, they change teachers on you but everybody was in the same building.  Keep in mind this is Bogalusa, Louisiana back in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s].  You didn't have a whole lot of separate school like they do down there now where you have junior high school, a junior high school, junior high students.  You have elementary schools for elementary kids.  You have a high school for high school kids.  That's now, and it's very modernized but back there all of us went to that one big school and I was within walking distance of the school and I would go to the same school from grade school until I graduated in 1952, '53 [1953].  About two years, there was a break from that one building because the school burned down and we all had to go to school in churches and those churches were designated, you know.  If you were in the fifth grade, you'd go to this church over here, I went to the Second Baptist Church [Bogalusa, Louisiana] 'cause it's close to me, than Third Baptist Church [Bogalusa, Louisiana].  Then when the school was rebuilt, obviously, we returned where we were, quite frankly.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any favorite teachers in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ms. Turelean [ph.], number one in elementary school because she was very good and invited me to all these operettas to perform.  And then there was Ms. A.L. Hannibal, she's A.L. Green now, she's my drama teacher.  And this is not necessarily the order because there was one gentleman there who eventually became principal and that's my English teacher, Mr. J.C. Crump [Jesse Cornelius Crump], who's now dead now, but I liked him because he was a student of literature and he would make it a point to challenge us in terms of poetry to live by and 'Invictus,' [William Ernest Henley] "Out of the night that covers me,/black as the Pit from pole to pole,/I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul./In the fell clutch of circumstance/I have not winced nor cried aloud./Under the bludgeonings of chance/my head is bloody, but unbowed."  And he'd go by the classroom every day with a new poem, you know, and we'd know Mr. Crump had arrived, and he'd say a thing like the 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' [Alfred Lord Tennyson], what did he say, when he got ready to charge that hill, and everything he related to was a challenge to life and he said take poetry and if things get kind of bad for you, start reciting some--that poetry.  It's just like words to live by.  It can inspire you on, quite frankly.  And I think I really liked Mr. Crump because we became friends.  I say, "we," there was a group of us who were football players and we liked to hear him, I guess you would say regardless of his poetry and the fact that he was an accomplished, that kind of mission and later I think it was he who inspired me to become a frat man because I became an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] based on the fact that Mr. Crump was an Alpha as well and he was very much a good role model for me.  But he would be at the top of the list, Ms. Hannibal, my drama teacher, would be next because she would be--she came, when she came to Central out of Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana], she looked very young, in fact she was a teenager, but she knew what she wanted and I remember, I kid her not, when I'd go in the audience sometimes and talk with her.  And even through this day some of the things she taught me as a carryover because she said, when you went out for competition, like oratorical contests, she said, I don't want you to eat anything until after you've performed.  I don't want you standing there with a full stomach, belch or something like that, and I know when I was coming out here I was doing editorials, I never would eat anything before doing editorial taping.  I said, no, no, no, I feel better when I'm lean and mean and that kind of stuff.  That goes back to what Ms. Hannibal taught me, but she would sit in that cloakroom with a Coke and a hamburger and slowly eat that stuff and she's drilling us to, I can't understand what she you're saying, you're dropping those word endings, I don't hear the "ing," bring up those sibilant sounds, if you will, and I'd kid her a lot when I see her and I said, "I don't drop the word endings Ms. Hannibal, I'm still trying to say those sibilant sounds," but she was a delightful person and I think that one of the things that, I think, most blacks in my genre will tell you that coming in from an integrated, a segregated school system, one thing that the black teachers did was instill in us a strong sense of don't just do enough to get along, do enough to excel, and they made a big thing out of that you can, you've got to believe it.  If you can believe it, you can eventually achieve it but you've got to be able to persevere.  And we got a steady diet of that, and keep in mind the location we were in and the political environment we were surviving in, and that meant an awful lot to us as young bucks in those years to try to do something to get ahead--
Story_ID: 202250
Speaker 1: If you look at the history books, if you did an analysis of some of your so-called, some of the top African Americans who were trans--who immigrated from the South, who went on and did great things, a lot of them have very poor roots and I think one reason that accounts for that is because all of them were dreamers down there.  They dreamed that I can do better.  They wanted to do better.  They came out here with a fire in their eye because, I know I came out with the same thing, I've been through welfare before so I don't want there to be a continuing of that, I want to go out and do something better.  So when you came to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you came out here and you said, I'm going to kick butt when I get to L.A.  You will go out now, I tell people here, you take a young black guy from Louisiana, who was a product of sharecropper parents [Barbara Parker Brooks and Joseph Dyer, Sr.], who were on welfare, one of whom was disabled, to come to Los Angeles and to break the color barrier, and God forbid on television news.  I didn't go through Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].  I didn't go to Notre Dame [University, South Bend, Indiana], I went to Grambling College, Grambling College, now it's Grambling State University [Grambling, Louisiana] and much more, obviously, impressive now than it was when I was in school years ago.  But I think that, we didn't have the facilities, we didn't have a great telecommunications department.  We had a little theater, of course, you can train in drama but I didn't go behind a camera.  I didn't know mic work at Grambling and I'm not knocking Grambling.  We just didn't have the facility but what we had was a lot of ambition and the fact that we could do it and we believed it.  So when I came out here, as I put in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], the good Lord helped me tremendously because I always seemed to be positioned the right place at the right time to make a move.  If it were not for the [U.S.] Air Force, I would not have had a chance to do--get those experiences I eventually didn't get, I eventually got that I didn't get at Grambling, that's to go on the tube, to write news copy and to host a talk show for the Air Force.  That was able to make me able to segue to a civilian life where when I got out for an interview, I could say I have experience.  I could show you my tapes and all that kind of stuff.  If I had not done that, I would not have had that advantage.
Story_ID: 202251
Speaker 1: I just wanna understand about--you were born in Gilbert, Louisiana?
Speaker 2: In Gilbert, right.
Speaker 1: And then moved to, you know, grew up in Bogalusa [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Bogalusa, right.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: B-O-G-A-L-U-S-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how large was Bogalusa?
Speaker 2: About twenty-five thousand, I guess.  Twenty-five or thirty thousand--it's a paper mill town.  As a matter of fact years ago, the Gaylord Lumber Company [sic. Gaylord Container Corporation, Saint Louis, Missouri] went down there and set up shop and built a lot of company houses, that's one of which my father [Joseph Dyer, Sr.] got, my uncle, and you rent it virtually free, as long as you work for the paper mill.  And then we went down there and had a three-room shack, I do mean shack, but it was a house.  And all around us were other shacks.  Most people worked with that lumber company always had it--and everything fed off the lumber company because all the mom-and-pop stores fed people who worked for the Gaylord Lumber Company over the years and they eventually got to Crown Zellerbach [Container Division, San Francisco, California] and got a little more sophisticated but it still is a life blood of Bogalusa.  It's a small rural place, quite frankly, a bunch of country folk.
Story_ID: 202252
Speaker 1: Now if you take yourself back to Bogalusa [Louisiana], can you tell me what sights, smells and sounds reminded you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we can just stop at the first one, and that's the smells.  If you read in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], you can tell there's a section in the book that I say, "On the outskirts of Bogalusie, you know you're getting home because you roll the windows down and you get a whiff, you're looking for that familiar smell that had become legendary and that's the Bogalusa paper mill [Gaylord Container Corporation] smell" and I think I, in the book I said it's--some people joke and say it's just like, I think I said, five fat men breaking wind in a crowded windowless room and that's how it smelled because on any given day, when that wind condition, when those wind conditions changed, that paper mill could be pretty cotton-picking repulsive, but you know the funny thing about it, nobody ever complained.  We laughed about it a lot and made jokes about it but as I said in the book, that paper mill fed off a people for years and years 'cause it's the basic--the number one industrial base for years but when you talk about the "Bog," as they call it, what people think about the smell, and if you've been to Bogalusa, they say, "My God, that paper mill is still smelling?"  They say, "Absolutely."  And then there's the small town environment.  It's very interesting, years ago the downtown area was referred to as Jew Town.  Now, when I was coming up, that meant nothing to me except a definition of a location.  Years later, I realized that that could have been offensive in today's terminology because it got to be somewhat ethnically racial and offensive.  But back there, since most of the Jewish merchants, most of the merchants were Jewish and they owned mostly establishment downtown, I guess somewhere along the way they began to refer to it as Jew Town.  And it was said very affectionately.  Nobody seemed to have been deriding anyone.  When I was working at Capo's, they said, "Where you going?"  "I'm going to Jew Town."  I mean, just as if I was saying, you say I have a cold or something.  Now obviously you fast forward and say, make that kind of statement nowadays, and you got a major problem on your hand but back then they was just commonly referred to as--not only blacks but everybody was saying it because it was the location of the city that commonly was referred to as Jew Town and my mother [Barbara Parker Brooks] used it, everybody used it, Jew Town, Jew Town, Jew Town.  We knew exactly where you were going.  It's the downtown area.  That and the paper mill were probably the two things that I remember very profoundly about coming up as a young person.  The other, on a negative side, was the fact that when we were coming up, there were no black police officers.  And that was throughout the South, I should tell you.  It's nothing unique about Bogalusa.  The one custodian of the peace happened to be white and sometimes the cops could be very abusive.  I remember one incident in the ballpark where one guy, they called him, Gus Vitale [ph.], a heavyset guy, and he was trying to arrest some black guy, and in those days they had those little, small billy clubs and he just swatted him up against the head and nobody moved.  You know, I mean, you couldn't because if you had attempted to rescue him, you could have gotten yourself killed right there in full view of everybody in the ballpark.  And they dragged him up and put him in the car.  But then again, that was the law, you know, I mean, you understood the rules, you understood very clearly that if you took on the law, you're going to get killed, not beaten, you're gonna get killed, quite frankly.  They didn't take it--and if you had an altercation with a fellow white, I mean, it was understood that the law's going to take the white person's point of view.  That was how it was in those years over there.  You just didn't question too much, because you know it was going to go again.  I know driving through the South, leaving Bogalusa, going up to Ferriday, Louisiana, which is not too very far from Gilbert [Louisiana], if you will, where my aunts lived, and we had to stop to use the restroom, or something like that.  Most of these so-called African American restrooms, well back then it was colored restrooms, were not very tidy and many of them were locked and you couldn't use the white restrooms.  So you just went down the road till you got to an isolated area and you voided there, quite frankly.  That was how it was back then.  Everybody understood that and the other thing, if you drove too fast in some of those small communities, and you--and if you were in a fashionable car, chances were very good you were going to get stopped and questioned with an out-of-state license.  And invariably you would be taken to the so-called justice of the peace.  At midnight you pay your bill and you're on your way, are they gonna arrest you?  Well, we surmised years later that may have been a put on, at best a sham.  We wondered if the money ever made it to the court, quite frankly.  I mean, it's a great side job.  I got a couple of colored boys over here and they were speeding, blah, blah, blah, that's fifty dollars cash or you go to jail or if you come up with the fifty dollar cash and you're on your way.  Obviously, you want to be on your way and I wonder if that fifty dollars ever made it to the city coffers or not but that's, here again, that's nothing unusual about that.  You can talk to fifty blacks my age and they'd probably tell you a similar story or worse, how it was in those years coming up in the southern portion of this country, in institutionalized racism.

Speaker 1: It said, I think in your book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer] that you picked cotton or helped your mother [Barbara Parker Brooks] pick cotton?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, this--so cotton was a staple along with the paper [Gaylord Container Corporation] in the town [Bogalusa, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, the cotton was a supplement.  Keep in mind, when I was coming up, my mother didn't work because of her impediment so she couldn't get a job at the--as a matter of fact, no black women could get a job at the paper millperiod.  My father [Joseph Dyer, Sr.] was not able to work at the paper mill because, number one, he was not educated and the only job that he could get was the WPA [Works Progress Administration].  So, after he died, to supplement the welfare check, we just picked the cotton trucks.  Now keep in mind, there's another problem here too.  You could only make so much on welfare before they took, either took you off it or deducted the amount of money you're gonna make from your welfare check.  So you didn't have to declare what you made in the cotton fields, you just, they even, I don't think they even knew we were going to the cotton fields, quite frankly, because they would come by with periodic checks to find out if we bought anything new or bought any other thing, household items that represented a major purchase and that would be questioned.  But I'm not sure my mother ever declared what she made in the cotton fields, and it wasn't that much, obviously, but it was a big help to us to supplement the welfare check.  So the staple was for people who had jobs at the lumber company, at the paper mill, those are regular jobs.  If my father had been able to work, I'm sure he'd have been out there with the rest of them, quite frankly.
Speaker 1: And that's just because he was ill, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he wasn't in the very best of health.  He stayed in the hospital an awful lot and I know now that's because of his heart condition.  Now it's interesting, when he died, remember I told you that family that lived in front of us with the restaurant [Capo's]?  He died on a Saturday morning, and I'll never forget Mrs. Capo calling me, "Little Joe Junior [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], you got a minute?"  So I went over there, she said, "Tell your mother that your daddy just died."  Now he was scheduled to come home that Saturday and I don't know, and even to this day, my sister and I wonder about it, he was scheduled to be discharged from the Charity Hospital in New Orleans [Louisiana], that's where he was, and they called Capo, a letter of reference we had given them in case of emergency.  She called me over there and said, "Joe, your daddy has just died.  I just got a call from the Charity Hospital, your daddy just died."  So I went and broke the news to my mother, obviously.  We--that took us totally off guard.  We knew he was sick.  I personally didn't realize how sick he was.  I just knew he stayed in the hospital an awful lot down at Charity Hospital.  But he died without, you know, in the old days when you get real sick, everybody called the family and you start gathering around and, in the waning moments of life--that never happened.  We just got the call that he had died and then that's when life got to be very interesting 'cause my mother was obviously shell-shocked and she's disabled and without the breadwinner so to speak, and that's when I became the man of the house.
Speaker 1: And what age were you at that point?
Speaker 2: I had to be nine.  I'm trying to--about nine years of age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe a year off.
Story_ID: 202254
Speaker 1: Tell me what you were like as a child?  What was, you know, were you well-behaved, were you an internal child, were you, you know, did you think about things?  Did you play?  I mean, I'm just trying--were you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll give you two examples.  Number one, I was very quiet.  I think I established that earlier.  My sister jokingly one day, Mrs. Ruth [ph.], the lady who lived down the street, was a long-time family member to my mother [Barbara Parker Brooks] and my father [Joseph Dyer, Sr.], she was musing one day, she meaning Mrs. Ruth, said you know, "Little Joe Junior [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], when you were coming up, you were so quiet.  I mean, you very seldom said very much," and my sister Barbara [Dyer Morris] would say, "yeah, that's because he's retarded."  She--and then we were going to Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural & Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] to take part in an oratorical contest and I heard Ms. [A.L.] Hannibal and the music teacher, Mrs. Conrad [ph.], talking and I don't think you understand, but I know they were talking about me.  Ms. Hannibal said to Mrs. Conrad, "You know, he doesn't say very much, does he?  You know, he just sits right there and just stares out there.  Doesn't that--audience--until he takes to the stage out there, and he's a whole different person over there."  The bottom line that I was very shy.  I mean, I was extremely shy when I was coming up.  And I was the most unlikely person to be continually getting on the stage but when I got on these little operettas and they kind of said, that wasn't me anymore, I was somebody else.  So I could do anything I wanted to do because they're not laughing at me, they're laughing at the character and I found refuge in that.  Then I would have a little matchbox, you know these long matchbox you pull out and you cut the top open, you bend it back and then you cut some little figurine men outs, and you--men, you put them in a little car and set them along the side of the house and fantasize on the little games you play with these little men you make in your matchbox.  I played very well by myself.  I had no problems with that.  The answer to your question was simply that I was very much a loner.  I had friends when I was in high school [Central Memorial High School, Bogalusa, Louisiana] because thanks to drama and football, they became my peer groups and we would form a little closely knit group among athletes and the same with persons who were in drama.  But basically I was very shy, very quiet.
Speaker 1: Now were you, in your sort of shy, quiet times, did you dream of being or doing anything?  Were those thoughts going through your head?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, initially I dreamed of becoming a famous actor.  That was, 'cause I had been led to believe all along that I was good enough to become an actor, you know, we fantasize of going to Hollywood and all that kind of stuff and it was okay to dream, obviously.  The, when I got out of college, I looked forward to getting a scholarship because I had won all these awards in drama and that kind of stuff.  Unfortunately, they were not giving out substantial scholarships in drama and I got caught, I mean I think Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] offered something like a $450 scholarship.  That was the only school that tendered an offer to me for drama.  Fortunately for me I had made first-team All-State in football and that became my savior because I got these offers to play football over there and obviously I jumped at it because my mother and father couldn't afford to send me on their own and I went to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  There weren't that many.  Tyler, Texas [Texas College, Tyler, Texas], Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and Xavier were the ones I got scholarships for and I went to Xavier quite, the first year and then I transferred to Grambling because I got a job at the box factory during the summers so to speak.  But no, yes, I did, I dreamed a lot--
Story_ID: 202255
Speaker 1: We had been given a steady diet that it's okay to dream and I paraphrase what Dr. Benjamin E. Mays always would say, but dream high you may not aim for the stars, you may at least hit the sky.  Well, paraphrasing it in my days, the teachers were continually telling us as young black guys, look, you gotta aspire to be the best.  Mediocrity is not going to do it for you.  You've got to strive to be the best.  Anything less than that is not going to get you to make it out there.  If you look all around you, all the trimmings around you, the people who was struggling to survive, that made a lot of sense to us.  But then again we had a couple of role models that we always aspired to.  One of the biggest role model we had, we had Joe Louis, obviously.  Every time Joe fought, I mean, that was a happening because Joe didn't just fight for himself, Joe fought for us and when Joe won, he won for us, you follow?  I remember listening to Dr. Felton G. Clark, I mean, the late president of Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], give a speech once and I was a student, when I was a Bayou Boys State student, he said, Joe Louis had a habit of going out after a victory and saying, "To my momma, I'm glad I win," and Dr. Clark said, I'm glad Louis was able to stand there and say, "to my momma, I'm glad I win," as opposed to say, "to your august body of people assembled here this evening, I regret to advise you that I went down today to a devastating defeat at the hands of a very superior opponent."  And I think that those kinds of prep talks, if you will, from people like Dr. Clark and Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Dr. Mordecai Johnson, those of us who were drama students aspired to become an orator.  We want you to be a man of letters, a scholar if you will, because we knew that people like a Dr. Mays, was exceptional, you know.  I couldn't go to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] because I couldn't afford to, but we knew that there was a Dr. Benjamin E. Mays at Morehouse College giving these profound speeches, that we've been told about, Dr.--Mr. Clark told us about.  We certainly knew about Dr. Mordecai Johnson over there [as president of Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  So, those of us who were drama students aspired, basically, to become a scholar.  In terms of dreaming, absolutely.  My wife [Doris Dillon Dyer] will tell you, when I met her, she was in high school and I aspired to just tell her my dreams about being a writer one day and that's, she was still a junior--she was a junior in high school at the time and I was a freshman in college, finished up my first year at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], so to speak.  So I've always had big ambitions for that, quite frankly.
Story_ID: 202256
Speaker 1: 'Cause you went to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] first, then Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Xavier first then Grambling, where I got my degree from, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Xavier, at Xavier, how was the decision made, I mean you got accepted to those places and then chose--
Speaker 2: Xavier.
Speaker 1: --Xavier because of the money, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: But isn't there a story in your book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer] about how, or was that different?
Speaker 2: The bull gang--
Speaker 1: Yeah, didn't they help, the bull gang?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact, what happened is that when I managed to get a job that summer at the box factory, I mean the paper mill box factory, the lady in the personnel office said look now, we're getting, we have an opening for you this year, but understand we can't guarantee you that this opening is going to be available every summer.  So basically, don't depend on it 'cause you may come--it all depends upon the manpower needs at the time.  We may need help, we may not need help.  Now, when I related this story to the bull gang, which is a composition of black guy, grassroots types, both not educated, basically all around uneducated, they did something what I refer to in the book as the unique grassroots miracle.  They determined they would all delay their vacations every summer until I got out of school for summer break, then one by one, each man would take his vacation and I would become each man's official summer relief worker.  Now this went on for four summers, and the last man was going on vacation, as I got ready to go back to school, and I have always been grateful because if they had not offered to do that, and keep in mind, they, I was the youngest person there, was a school boy, most of 'em would call me, school boy, and they, in their state, loved the fact that I was trying to make something out of myself and their contribution was to try to help me to the extent they can and they did by withholding their vacations.  That meant, we didn't have to go by the personnel office, just go and fill the paperwork 'cause they said, Joe Dyer's [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer] coming back, he's going to replace these people during the summer and old man Lowe [ph.] was a white foreman who was very helpful that--in making it happen.  Now when I go back to Bogalusa [Louisiana] throughout the years, I would try to look them up.  Most of 'em are dead, I mean, in rest homes, and very few of them really recognize me 'cause they're elderly and frail, and I'd kiss 'em on the forehead and tell them you did something for me back in the years, I just want to say thank you in their feeble state.  And every night I run across one of their offsprings like I had, one of their sons, Craft Jackson, I told him what his father did for me.  He hadn't heard anything about it and he was very appreciative of the fact that I shared that story for--your father did something for me years ago that enabled me to go on to make a decent life for myself and I just want you to know that I can't thank him but I can thank you for having a wonderful father.  I have never forgotten that, and that's for sure.
Speaker 1: Well that's a pretty amazing story when you think about it, that you hear these stories about, in the black community, that they would identify sort of a person to help, you know, help them and that's essentially what happened--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --with you.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know, they wanted to see you go on.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and that's not--
Speaker 1: And they saw potential.
Story_ID: 202257
Speaker 1: Absolutely, and that happens a lot too, I should tell you, people see a person like that and then they become more or less a mentor to the extent that they can, to push 'em on, and I know my mother [Barbara Parker Brooks] had, in her broken language, she always said, I don't want you to come up like I did.  Well, that was more or less a mantra throughout the South through the years, especially among African American parents.  I don't want you to have a hard life like me, I want you to have a better life.  And they would try to push to have kids through the right way of life.  My mother originally wanted me to be a school teacher 'cause all around her, the role models that she saw that represented success were the school teachers.  These were the professional people with whom she could relate to.  I mean, she didn't see any black doctors or lawyers, people who were professionals beyond that, you follow, so, but she did see the school teachers who were dressed in fine attire and driving cars and they had nice homes and that is what she wanted for me.  Well, I didn't tell her too much about my aspirations of going to be an actor because I'm not too sure she would have understood.  Number one, she would have probably thought, I was out of my cotton-picking mind.  Go out there and talk to Mr. [Jesse Cornelius] Crump and see if you can get a job at the school over there [Central Memorial High School, Bogalusa, Louisiana], one of the teachers, and I always said that the good Lord knew what he was doing because there were no jobs available as drama instructors at the time down there for me.  I thought I would put resumes out all over the place because I found out later that the English teachers in most schools were doubling as the drama instructor and unless they hired you in English, like Ms. [A.L.] Hannibal is a good example, she was in English but she taught drama more or less as a part-time job, because she loved drama, quite frankly.  So, when I came to Los Angeles [California], and I--the rest as I said in the book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], stopping at the [U.S.] Air Force had prepared me for a job eventually at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California], then from JPL to CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California].  It was God who said that I came out west because I was able to realize my ambitions of utilizing my skills as a writer.  But to my mother, a school teacher, and I don't think she really understood what I did until she came out here one Sunday, one summer, to Los Angeles, she and my stepfather, Mr. Ed [Parker], and they saw me on the air doing a news report and then it dawned on her, my God, he did do something all right out here, because she had no idea what it was 'cause, keep in mind, WWL[-TV, New Orleans, Louisiana] and WDSU [New Orleans, Louisiana] and all these stations were not overloaded with African Americans who were coming up down there so she didn't see too many role models down in the South either.  They're down there now but not when we were coming up.  We didn't see too many African American reporters in Louisiana, quite frankly, so she didn't understand what it was that I was supposed to be doing at CBS and she thought she did but she didn't really understand till she saw me on the air.  And my sister, Barbara [Dyer Morris] said, you should have seen the look on her face, sure, there's my boy.  You see my boy over here, and I said God, that's what it all comes down to, that one statement.
Story_ID: 202258
Speaker 1: Now, how did you find Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] when you got there?  Was it, did you enjoy it immediately or was it--
Speaker 2: No, keep in mind I had been to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] my first year.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Xavier, I'm sorry, Xavier, that's what I mean.
Speaker 2: Xavier.
Speaker 1: How did you find Xavier?
Speaker 2: Xavier was quite a challenge and let me say this very carefully.  It was a challenge for me because I'm not Catholic, okay, and--
Speaker 1: And it was very Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was--
Speaker 1: I know it's a Catholic school but it was very Catholic and it's all culture?
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of the people there were Catholic, quite frankly, run by the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.  The--and I was a football player.  The rules were very clear, that after practice every day, instead of going directly to the field house and take a shower, you went and said the rosary.  You just right, Hail Mary, and after you'd done that, then you go take a shower.  On the way from games, I know when I got hurt, we stopped back by a Catholic church on the way from Houston [Texas], when we played Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], and we stopped by this church and we had to go in and say the rosary.  Now keep in mind, I'm Protestant, so I didn't have that programming to go, you know, the rosary so many times during the day, if you will, quite frankly, and all of my peer group, most of them were Catholic.  They come from St. Jude High School [New Orleans, Louisiana] and St. Ignatius [Jesuit High School of New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana] and all those kind of schools.  Most of them were fed to us from Catholic schools.  I'm coming out of Central Memorial High School [Bogalusa, Louisiana] and there's nothing about Central Catholic.  I didn't even know any teachers who were Catholic in Central Memorial High School.  So my program was different but then again I met a delightful teacher who taught me French, Sister Mary Augusta [Ceely], God bless her, and I told her I was teaching Sunday school in New Orleans [Louisiana] and she would always chide me, she said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], do you know what you're doing?  You're a heretic.  You're going on and you're spreading heresy all over the City of New Orleans for talking that Protestant stuff," and we'd debate, well, I can call you heretic too, you know, just because you don't believe in Protestantism.  So we had this friendly give and take and when I got in the [U.S.] Air Force, she and I would continually correspond, 'cause she said I used to watch you come in through the capital- the chapel in the evening and you guys looked so tired and I was wondering how your career's going to end up.  I was in the Air Force at the time and at the time I'd become editor of the paper.  But she also said something I captured in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer] and she told me about building character, that--learning how to ignore pain.  She said, "If you have an ailment, it's dire, don't complain but just go about the whole day bearing your agony in silence and the next day when your pain, in this case the migraine headaches subsides, then you'll feel much better, you'll feel much stronger and that Mr. Dyer," she said, "builds character," and that I put in my book.  I tried that, that experiment once when I had a bad toothache and did all right for a few hours but I had, apparently had an upset--abscess, because that tooth was really hurting so I said screw it and I told everybody that there was a bad tooth--you know.  I said I haven't tried that character building experience since, but I don't intend to.  But she was very good to me, very close and a very dear person and I talked to a friend of mine at Xavier, one of the professors, and she passed on some years ago.
Story_ID: 202259
Speaker 1: Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], so you--did you--so you were playing ball, were you taking acting too, theatre there too?
Speaker 2: No, no, I--
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't until Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Grambling.  You see Xavier you either had to be an opera star, I mean, music or something.  They didn't have the traditional theatre, you know, that's why I became familiar with [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart and 'The Magic Flute' and all that kind of, '[The] Marriage of Figaro,' because if you're a singer and you aspire to the music department as an ideal school and if you're off into pharmacy, it's a great school for pharmacy, but for theatre, that was persona non grata for me but Grambling was known to have a good drama department, Dr. [Floyd L.] Sandle, as was Tennessee [Agricultural and Industrial] State [University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], as was Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Dr. [Thomas Edward] Poag over there, Tennessee State and Dr. [Randolph] Edmunds at Howard.  And any one of those schools I would have liked to have gone to, and I went to Grambling.
Speaker 1: Now Grambling, how was the team, was it known at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Grambling--
Speaker 1: Was it, who was the coach?
Speaker 2: The coach for Grambling then was Eddie Robinson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, you, oh, he was, when you were there?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He just retired.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, I mean, that's why--
Speaker 2: After fifty years.
Speaker 1: I didn't know, oh, I didn't know it was, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, after fifty years.
Speaker 1: Now I know he's been there a long time.
Speaker 2: Coach Rob, I mean, how do you say, the inimitable Coach Rob, I mean, he was, he was it, a very delightful guy, great speaker, great humorist.  He was just a down home person but he had some fabulous teams over there and one of the guys I went to school with, went on to become the perennial All-Pro, [HistoryMaker] Willie [D.] Davis of the Green Bay Packers, I mean 'cause he played at Grambling.  He was a tackler, a tackle, but he went to one pro club and he tried to keep in tackle and he didn't do very well so he transferred--they transferred him to Green Bay, the Packers.  Vince Lombardi put him on the right end, defensive right end, he began to be All-Pro, every year, and a great guy and now he owns a couple of radio stations and he's just a great person, quite frankly.  I used that sometimes in some of the speeches I give to say, sometime you can be misplaced in terms of your talent can be misidentified not that you're not as bright or brilliant or as efficient as someone else, you're not in the right job, at the right time, at the right place and Willie was not, he was misplaced as a tackle but at the right end, he was a terror out there, quite frankly.  I know, I, to answer your question, I enjoyed my career at Grambling.  Grambling was more suitable to my personality as out there in the woods.  They had a downhome president, Arthur E. Jones [sic. Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones], and I think his motto is a school where everybody is somebody and he just was a delightful--it was downhome and more close to my life in Bogalusa [Louisiana]--
Story_ID: 202260
Speaker 1: Now so you said it was, you had a lot of fond memories and I was wondering if you could just share a few stories of the Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] experience, whether it was, you know, in the theatre department or teachers or friends, I mean, any--
Speaker 2: I had a lot of great experiences down there, some embarrassing, but most of them were good.  Of course one of the highlights of my career is the fact that, I told you, I thought, and I don't say this to boast, I can back this up with documentation, I was pretty much the lead actor during my career given that when I came to Grambling with a reputation of having gone there in competitive competition, competitive contests with other high schools throughout the years, that's where the state's finals would be held invariably, so I knew Dr. [Floyd L.] Sandle, he knew me and that kind of stuff but when I got to Grambling, there were three instructors, Dr. [Alfonso] Sherman, Dr. Sandle, the head of the department, and Dr. Eddie Ray Williams, all of them are dead now.  We wanted to do a very powerful drama by Arthur Miller in 'Death of a Salesman' and I've always loved 'Death of a Salesman' since, and when I was given a role of one of the sons, and Dr. Sherman was Willy Loman and Eddie Ray Williams was Biff [Loman], the other son, and I was Happy [Loman], the youngest son, and when they put the big posters out, the three of us were on the poster and I'm sitting there and I said, look, the highlight of my career is that I can get a chance to act on stage in a major production with my college professors.  Now to me, that was the apex.  I said, God, I really have arrived and I really felt for years proud of that fact that I was, I had that key role and then there were other roles that I had that like, I was I think the Heathcliff in 'Wuthering Heights,' [Emily] Bronte's play [sic. novel], and [La] Ruth Fields [Colbert], Ms. Grambling and I was a sweetheart for the (unclear) was my leading lady, beautiful girl and we created quite a bit of a sensation with that.  Now, so I enjoyed the whole theatrical, 'cause I was in my glory back there, you know, I mean, God I was very, very pleased with my development.  And on the negative side, the young musical prodigy, Philippa Schuyler, the young musical genius, pianist, internationally known, 'cause she was it, back there, back in 1956, I think it was.  She was going to visit Grambling in one of the Lyceum programs and Ms. [Bessie E.] Dickerson, my English teacher at Grambling, because of my drama reputation, wanted me to introduce Philippa Schuyler, Philippa Schuyler, and she said, "Joe, [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer] I want you to stand there and we're going to--" she had invited Philippa by the class, and that day I was going to go there before the class and introduce Philippa Schuyler to our English class.  Ms. Dickerson said, "Now, Joe, I want you to prepare well.  I want the speech to be, the introduction to be about a minute long and I want you to do just the same thing in this class that you would do on the stage out there."  I said, "Fine."  She said, "Now, Joe, don't fail me."  I said, "Ms. Dickerson, I will not fail you," and she's one of those straitlaced English professors who wanted you to pronounce all your words properly, who didn't want you to not conjugate verbs improperly.  She was a perfectionist, Ms. Dickerson, so, and she was no nonsense kind of, el comandante type person, straitlaced, walked across with the head back and everything.  So, the day that I was going to introduce Philippa Schuyler, and I think the class was at four o'clock, I went back to my dormitory after lunch and I rehearsed, I guess about nine times, a little one minute introduction, and then I said, well I'm going to just lie right here for about a half hour, just to rest my nerves 'cause I feel that anxiety coming on.  And I got in that bed about 1:30, I guess it was, and when my roommate awakened me, it was pretty close to 5:30 or 5:45 and obviously I panicked 'cause I had done, I had studied late the previous night for an exam and I was tired and I never should have gotten in bed because when he awoke, awakened me at 4:45, 5:30, I think it was, his first thing to me, "Weren't you supposed to introduce that lady at Ms. Dickerson class?"  I said, "Yeah, would you believe I was supposed to introduce that lady in Ms. Dickerson's class and I don't know whether to jump out the window head first or withdraw from school.  Ms. Dickerson is never going to understand why I let her down and she's sitting over there."  So the next day I saw Ms. Dickerson and she said, "What happened?  And tell me straight."  And I said, "I'm going to be honest with you.  I went to my dormitory room and I fell asleep."  Said, "Joe, tell me you cut your leg, tell me you fell down the stairs, but don't tell me you fell"--she gave me a--and rightfully so, she gave me a hard time and it took me a long time to rekindle the respect that she had for me and--
Story_ID: 202261
Speaker 1: Never assume that you've got enough time for anything.  When I had to make a taping over at CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California], I got there early to makeup, I got there early for the studio, I didn't want to run the risk of not coming in on time and when I was producing the eleven o'clock report, I made a point to get there early so I may have overdone it but I said no, I can't afford to make mistakes.  I got to be right on with this because I'll never forget the time I did make a mistake and just relax and you relax sometimes you're left out in the cold.  But that was a lesson I learned and it's a hard lesson to learn but basically the positive experiences at Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] to me were far outweighing the negative and there weren't many negatives, quite frankly.  As I said before, the food, I loved the kids, the students were great and when I joined the fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] over there, we had a certain bit of camaraderie that I always enjoy with my brothers.  Even to this day, some of us remain in touch with each other.  But I enjoyed the experiences I--
Speaker 2: So was, was 'Death of a Salesman' [Arthur Miller] your most favorite play that you did or that--
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.  We had done some one-act plays, but I don't remember too much about them having a great impact, but 'Death of a Salesman' was a major three-act production and every time I see one of the shows on TV late at night, whether it's Fredric March, whoever, you know, it brings back fond memories.  I think [Brian] Dennehy, the actor, played Willy Loman not too long ago at the [Los Angeles] Music Center [Ahmanson Theater, Los Angeles, California] in 'Death of a Salesman', excellent actor.  So it's not only because I guess being a writer you can appreciate the writing.  Arthur Miller did a phenomenal job, and it's putting things in perspective as Mr. [Floyd L.] Sandle would tell us, so many years doing Elizabethan plays, you can only have a tragedy when a nobleman fell from the top, king fell from the top to the bottom, a king got beheaded, something like that, but Arthur Miller proved once and for all that a small man can have a tragedy as well as a big man, and he made a great point of that and that's whatever I really appreciate.  Just an average day salesman who fell on hard times at a time that he had gotten in the waning moments of his career and he couldn't recover, quite frankly.  A beautifully written play.  I think it's probably personally the best play that Miller's ever written, in my opinion, even though he wrote several other plays.  That's one of the best.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you, what do you think also your theatre experience taught you about yourself?  You know, you said I was sort of shy and I can, but I could become different roles and things like that.  But what do you think it taught you about, you know, you, Joe Dyer [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer]?
Speaker 1: Well I think, number one, 'cause I had found this out real years early, and I'll tell you why in a minute, you can rise to the occasion if it means a lot to you.  You can make a transition.  You can change your life if it means an awful lot to you.  I was not a gifted football player, as I said in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], I was relatively small for a lineman, not much larger than I am right now, but obviously, but I was relatively small but I made the difference because of hustle.  I really had not trained hard.  I worked out hard.  I'm like I said, I played hard on the field, quite frankly, and that's what got me over.  The same thing in drama.  I know that the, a good example, 'Death of a Salesman' and 'Wuthering Heights' [Emily Bronte] would be challenging roles for me because in 'Wuthering Heights' they want you to kind of speak with an English accent, if you will, and I'm a southern boy, (speaking in accent) "Last, past and a half" and you know, it got, it was a challenge for me but it taught me I can do anything I wanted to do if you put your mind to it and I never forgot those little tweaks about my own personality even though I'm basically shy.  Shyness can be an asset, quite frankly, and as a writer, you know, I don't--asset because I don't mind staying by myself for a long period of time at the computer.  I don't mind sitting in a, you say, garage just waitin' on a car, like one guy said, it was going to take him about two and a half hours, I said, "Fine."  He said, "Are you going to stay here?"  I said, "Yeah."  "You gonna wait for it?"  I said, "Certainly."  Any problems, I said, "No, no," that's two and a half hours is a long time but hell what he didn't realize, I had my little writing pad, and two and a half hours would pass, would give me all the time I need to just sit down there and write, nobody to bother me, nobody say anything.  And when I took trips on a plane, and I was, "How long is it gonna take," they say, "oh about three and a half hours."  I said, "Just fine."  And the only thing I had to be cognizant of is that, God, don't put me by somebody who wants to talk, you know, so I'm going to be very unfriendly and they'll get the message, I don't want to be talking, I'm going to get my writing stuff out.  So that's three and a half hours of priceless writing time that I needed to do my work, quite frankly.  So, that can be an asset.  I don't need to be the most sociable person there is.  That's not my personality even though I would rise to the occasion because when I was the director of community affairs [for CBS-2, Los Angeles, California], I had to deal with a lot of community groups and you had to do what you had to do.  And I was very sociable because I had to be but that is not basically who I am as a person.  I'm basically very reticent, very conservative and very retiring.  That's just basically my personality.  I feel more comfortable not being the life of the party.  When I want somebody to talk a lot I go get my wife [Doris Dillon Dyer].  "Dot, you come here, you talk, you talk."  And she loves to talk.  She's very sociable.
Story_ID: 202262
Speaker 1: Now, there's the story about the dancing to [HistoryMaker] B.B. King.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk--tell that story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, down in Covington, Louisiana and, you know, we were all young football players [at Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana].  Down in the South they had--among football players, that was a terminology that we called "greasing the pig."  And greasing the pig was basically just getting a young lady to a slow record and gyrating on each other's body, to make a long story short, and we all looked forward to it.  Nobody wanted to dance on a fast tune.  I mean, you go to a house party you wait till the slow records happen and you grab somebody who's very hot-blooded and you went over there and greased the pig sort of speak.  Well, we knew B.B King was notorious for playing slow, funky music.  So all of us jumped in the car, we'd go down to watch the Covington.  There's a thing they do so you don't get embarrassed.  You just double jockey, you know, you put your two jockey shorts on so if you have a mishap on the floor you wouldn't be embarrassed because of the wetting of your trousers.  And we would go down there and watch the young ladies who are out on the floor and they would be gyrating and we'd stand in the corner and you find somebody who was extremely hot, and we'd kind of race to get over there because we wanted to be next.  And sometimes it'd be just a race to get that little hot before someone else grabbed because everybody else had watched the hot momma too.  And those are the ones that we had to be very careful because invariably they're with their boyfriends or husbands and I guess most of us sooner or later got caught in their trap where you're out there making overtures to someone who was gyrating with their husband or their boyfriend and in Covington, Louisiana back then, the early '50s [1950s], that can be very dangerous.  I mean, you can get yourself killed back there.  But with B.B. King, you had about three hundred people in a little small place down in Covington and B.B. would just jive as hot as all everything back there.  But that's what we knew.  When I saw the signs said "B.B. King in Covington", we said God, we've got to go down there 'cause we knew right away, B.B. King, a Lowell Fulson, Dave Bartholomew, Tommy Ridgley, gonna be playing, those were good, greasing the pig better rubbing music, you know.  We put on that kind of stuff and had a cotton-picking ball but that's, how do you say it, the follies of being, the folly of being a young person, a young buck, I call it, football player, in Covington, Louisiana back there in the 1950s.  I enjoyed myself.  As a matter of fact, when I saw B.B. King, and he started to pull up in a big red bus emblazoned on the side, it says, B.B. King, King of Blues.  I mean, that was a big thing for us because we heard about B.B. King but at the time he hadn't become the, how do you say, the legendary superstar he is right now.  I mean, you don't dance to B.B. King right now, you sit and concentrate and listen to him, he's just too cotton-picking big but back then, '52 [1952], we can dance to him and we did dance to him, and we greased the pig to him.  We had a cotton-picking ball to him in those years back there.  I enjoyed that time and I pass through Covington when I'm going back to Bogalusa [Louisiana], New Orleans [Louisiana], you often just reflect, my God, what a wonderful time we had coming out to Covington, years ago.
Speaker 1: Now, we just, we had had B.B. King in recently, you know, he was the whole red bus.  But you're right, he's playing to thousands.
Speaker 2: Oh, God, yeah you got it.  He's quite a, and we'd like to, I mean, he would put so much soul and he's getting older now, obviously, but he would be wringing wet, I mean, you never felt slighted with B.B. King.  I mean, and he didn't do a lot of talking.  He reminded me a lot of Fats Domino and when he starts playing, and he played, and you'd dance, and he took his brief intermission and he came right back.  You felt that you, the evening was well worthwhile because he had given you a full evening of entertainment and good downhome funky music, and I appreciate that and enjoyed it, but he's bigger now and I just say when I saw him, when he was working the Chitlin' Circuit over there, and he was just starting off but you never know, but you had a feeling that he was going to make it big.
Story_ID: 202263
Speaker 1: Now what else about the Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] experience do you think was significant?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the downhome nature of the professors, that was a reasonable segue from my going to an all-black school, high school [Central Memorial High School, Bogalusa, Louisiana].  They gave us the steadiest diet of the same thing, and that is that don't be good, don't be as good as, be better than, in so many words.  Learning to fall in love with the books.  I know I told my wife [Doris Dillon Dyer], when she and I were out yesterday at the doctor's office, and I said, you know, they were doing a story on Columbine [High School, Littleton, Colorado] and they had a picture of the library how it looks right now, as opposed as to how it was during the crisis--the massacre.  I said, you know, when I was at Grambling, one of the places I found a lot of refuge in was the library at night.  I could go in that library and sit in the corner and really lose myself into the books and do what I was doing because I couldn't get that kind of peace and quiet in the dormitory because you had a lot of grab-assing and a lot of talking and a lot of radios playing.  But the library was my place that I found refuge in and I looked forward to going to the library at night.  The same thing happened at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I know I said Xavier had a lot of African students there and these African students who came to Xavier were there for the duration.  They didn't go home, you know.  They were there until they finished school for four years and they'd go out in jobs, just go out in New Orleans [Louisiana] and get jobs.  They were people out there in terms of rooming houses, et cetera.  And I found it very fascinating but I also found it fascinating that most African students stayed in the library a lot.  They were, number one, they were good students, and obviously you're getting the best and their dedication to academia was very refreshing, certainly motivation to me because they were dead serious about their homework.  And I think I learned from that too.  I saw the work ethics that they had.  I also understood their entrapment that they were not going to see their parents, or loved ones, for another four years at Xavier.  And they didn't seem to complain very much.  They just sat in the library night after night and was dead serious about their work.  And I learned from that and I think that it taught me a sense of discipline as well, hey look, stay in those books, stay in that library as much as you possibly can and it will eventually pay off for you.
Story_ID: 202264
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing in terms of, I wanted to ask one other thing about Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], do you recommend it as a--'cause you went to a HBCU [historically black colleges and universities], you know, at a time when those were--that was the option for African Americans more in terms of school, but do you think that--and you point to it as a nurturing environment in many ways.  Do you think that if you had to do it today, and you were a young person going to school, would you go to an HBCU?
Speaker 2: I think that with my personality, keep in mind, you're talking to a nearly seventy-year old man, and my programming is quite different as it may have been, we'll say thirty years ago, you follow?  If I had been given a scholarship to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in 1953, and given a scholarship to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] in 1953, where would I have gone?  Well, keep in mind, in 1953, I wouldn't have been, I would have looked at going to LSU as a challenge, as a breakthrough, as a historic adventure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my program would be a little different, obviously.  So, looking back then, I think here again, any black that made full racial, major schools, looked at being an exceptional achievement, you follow?  And it wouldn't be perceived as such as going to basically an all-black school because you're expected to be accepted and go to there.  So I think that would be a difference, quite frankly.  I always encourage my kids, like Joey [Joseph Dyer, III] went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  You go where you want to go but I want you to give me that first year, in an African American school, if for no other reason, you need to get that experience to see.  'Cause I had one daughter [Karen Dyer] who went to UC Santa Barbara [University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California] and had a miserable experience down there.  She felt so isolated and she had a very bad time.  As a matter of fact, I went to an Urban League conference one year and I heard some students from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] talking about their feelings of isolation, that they never felt a part of the school and the--two years after I got to CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California], I knew I had a chance to go to a seminar at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], in Sioux City [sic. Iowa City, Iowa], and Tony Brown was there, and he's one of our main (unclear).  We were all just young guys, so to speak, and the students there, the black students had put, had bought a building on the outskirts of campus and they had painted that building totally black and had all these African American pictures inside the building and there's a sign outside, it says the Black House and that's where all their social life evolved around the Black House.  Well, they were trying to do that to offset the isolation they felt when they went down to Sioux City, the lack of activity that was designed so that they could participate in the social life at the University of Iowa.  So I could understand the isolation that the kids--I didn't have that feeling at, obviously at Xavier and at Grambling because I was enveloped in a sea of black already.  So that was never considered.  I went, at UC Santa Barbara, Karen told me that when they had a basketball game, all the black students who went to the game sat up right under the goal, that was the black section, the one side of the section.  They just normally felt comfortable because that's where all, everybody else was who was African American, at that goal post over there.  And there were other problems she had.  As a matter of fact, we covered a couple of stories over there because they had some problems and we got a call at Channel Two and cut a crew out and Valerie Coleman [Morris] called it the story and as a result of that, the chancellor made some forays into Los Angeles [California], schools like (unclear), Manual [Arts Senior High School, Los Angeles, California] looking for students who retired and getting African American students to UC Santa Barbara to offset that feeling of isolation, you know.  So to answer your question more specifically, I think because of my age and my years of experience, I tend to think I possibly would have used that as a challenge in '53 [1953] more or less like a civil rights challenge if I indeed I was blessed to go to one of those schools.  Not because of any great love, it's just because I would look upon it as an opportunity.
Story_ID: 202265
Speaker 1: In 1957, you graduate [from Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Now what prompts--talk about what prompts your move to Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Okay, number one, number one, I couldn't get a job down in Louisiana in my field because there were no jobs available to me.  I filed resumes all over the place but I wanted to be a speech and drama instructor.  I since found out there's no such thing as a speech and drama instructor.  They don't hire speech and drama instructor to small schools in Louisiana, not in my year back then.  They hire English teachers and unless you have credentials to teach English, you don't work, you know, and the English teachers who taught had to teach drama.  So, I said, if I stay down here much longer, I'm gonna, I'm gonna starve to death and live with my mom [Barbara Parker Brooks] and stepfather [Ed Parker] and I can't do that because they're barely able to hold on.  So I said, let me go to L.A. and maybe my choice would be much more vast out there because I can really look at ways to enhance, build my writing ability, you know.  There's always newspapers and I'm sure that I can get something in speech and drama, after all, you're talking about Hollywood and take my shot trying to replace Sidney Poitier, you know, very unrealistic, and you know the first thing I did when I came here, I was going to start looking for a little theatre group, some community groups.  You know, that's how you start.  You know, you're doing network and that kind of stuff and about I guess, let's see, three months later, my stepfather called and said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], I got something here from the United States Army," and I said, "well Ed, do you want to read it for me and basically what it was," "congratulations, you're being ordered to report for induction, blah, blah, blah."  Well, I told my Uncle Jack [ph.], I said, "Look, I don't really feel like, I don't want to slough through mud two years so," he said, "why don't you try the [U.S.] Air Force or [U.S.] Navy, Joe, because you're single and four years in the Air Force is equivalent to maybe eight years in civilian life," and I thought about it.  Went down to Manchester [ph.] and some glib talking recruiter sold me on these great things I can learn in the Air Force and I said, okay, I'll buy it and I went into the Air Force and the best move I ever made because it gave me a chance to develop my, hone my skills that helped me get to CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California] later on.  I was very blessed.  I tell people in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], that was the good Lord positioning me to get the experience I didn't get at Grambling, the hands-on experience, if you will, to help me become competitive in a very competitive market, seventh or eighth media market in the country (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So you're talking about your journalistic media skills?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, so because there was a paper on the base?
Speaker 2: There was a paper on the base and then--
Speaker 1: And then you were, talk about where you were based, though, out of?
Speaker 2: Well number one, I was--I spent a lot of time in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  I spent two and a half years, and I will tell you very clearly I never heard of Grand Forks.  I've heard of North Dakota as a state but I've never heard of Grand Forks and I'd gone to Goose Bay [Air Force Base], Labrador [Canada], on isolated duty and made the reward for pulling isolated duty was presumably to have you take the best duty stations once you get stateside.  You know, it didn't happen.  I put in for March Air Force Base [March Air Reserve Base, Riverside County, California], in California.  Travis Air Force Base in California, Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas [Nevada] and they sent me to [Grand Forks Air Force Base] Grand Forks, North Dakota and I said, thanks a lot, I appreciate that.  So I went to Grand Forks.  They didn't have many blacks there at the time because the base had not been opened too long and I got there in December and it was cold and blizzardous [ph.] and gosh, I never felt so alone and lost in my life because what happened we'd go in there in a train and each of us had compartments on the train.  In the [U.S.] military travel, you, they traveled you very well and they just pulled up on the side and I guess early in the morning they just, disconnecting, we sat there and we were working the next morning and we had to ship ourselves.  So we went down to a local bus terminal and got instructions there on how to call the base and pick us up.  But, that was the beginning of what amounted to a very beautiful experience because Grand Forks, North Dakota, two and a half years there, really gave a tremendous boost to my career.  They say you can take a bad situation and make it a positive if you look at it as an opportunity and I keep talking about an opportunity, I needed, I thought I was prepared, I thought I could write a little bit, but I needed an opportunity to prove, both myself and to others who, with whom, I came in contact, that I could write and the Air Force gave me that opportunity and I just took a gamble, the paper, and they could use an old country writer and I went down there and Major [Ronald] Bond said, "Write me something and bring it back and we'll see, we'll take it from there."  And I figured the Major expected me to bring something back in about a week or two and I decided to do the unexpected, I'll bring something back the next morning and I thought that would get his attention, and it did, quite frankly.  And as I said in my book, the Air Force newspaper office also handled the Air Force television show at the time, it was called 'Bob and Blue' because the guy who was hosting it was Bob [Robert] Lyman and then eventually I took that over and they changed the name to 'Scramble' and I became the editor of the base paper and I had a glorious two years, two and a half years, really.  I had, I got a chance to hone my craft, to develop the electronic media background that I needed, in terms of writing scripts and preparing for copy, preparing copy for the script, how to host a talk show.  I learned an awful lot in those two and a half years--
Story_ID: 202266
Speaker 1: And when I got to Los Angeles [California] and was interviewed at CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California], I was able to throw this kind of background at them with my evidence of my work in Grand Forks [North Dakota].  And thanks to a guy by the name of Cassius Weathersby--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who, of the labor and industry committee, who really I owe an awful lot because I was writing for a group called Parks Pacific Productions [ph.], disregard Studio West, down in Vermont [Square, Los Angeles, California] and I met Cassius and he found out I had written for television before and he was head of the labor and industry committee for the Beverly Hills NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], we've been trying to break the color barrier here and I think with your background, it'd be hard to be denied."  I said, "Well, okay then."  He set it up for me and to make a long story short, I got the job and it wasn't a long interview, it was something like twenty minutes in a coffee shop over there or so I think.  I started a job producing the early morning news with news blocking which was really two fifteen minute news segments within a two-hour country and western show that came on early at eight o'clock in the morning.  So I did that for about a year over at Row Show Corp. [ph.] called PanPac, Panoramic [sic. Panorama] Pacific, they called it PanPac and then they cancelled that show and it went to an hour news, an early morning news and I was made a producer of that broadcast and given another writer and a graphics man and I finally moved up to the big news, this was after the Watts riots [Los Angeles, California, 1965] broke out and then the Watts riots broke out that changed a whole different dimension for me because all of a sudden I saw my chance to really do a lot of air work and as I said in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], they didn't want me to do that initially.  The news director was vehemently opposed to my going out to Watts [Los Angeles, California] and I could understand what he's talking about because he said to, finally, we finally bring a black guy in here and we quickly get him killed, and how's that going to set with the community and the community leadership, 'cause my response I say in the book, it's the biggest story of our decade, and you're telling me I can't go down there and cover a story because I'm black?
Story_ID: 201277
Speaker 1: He wanted to bring me along slowly, he said, introduce me to the market very carefully, and I understand that, but they weren't waiting downstairs, down in Watts [Los Angeles, California].  Hell, they were kicking tail and I wanted to get in with the act because I said, that's it.  I said, well look, I didn't know when they were going to riot again and I wanted to get in when it's already in progress, you know what I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Well let's talk--that's what I was thinking, can we talk about Watts in the historical context, okay?
Speaker 1: I sure will be glad to.  Keep in mind, before the Watts riots erupted, they had a delightful man by the name of John Buggs, who was head of the human relations bureau [County of Los Angeles Commission on Human Relations, Los Angeles, California] at the time and he kept telling the city fathers that there were seething difficulties in the Watts area that we better look at as a city.  The seething difficulties were things like a lack of adequate transportation in and out of Watts, in terms of buses, there was not one movie theatre in Watts at the time, unemployment was off the Richter scale, there was a severe and catastrophic problem of police-community relations.  A lot of cops, I was told, were going out to use it as a training ground.  You know, of course, under William [H.] Parker, who was a no holds barred, no-nonsense cop, the idea's go down there and kick tail.  I mean, they could do that in those old days.  So keep in mind you have a frustrated people.  You have living conditions very bad.  You have bad police-community relations going in there.  You didn't have a whole lot of black officers at the time because I have a friend of mine, Joe Rice [ph.], he was a police, he was a motorcycle cop, he said, at roll call, and usually you have a team to go out, you know, duo, a partner.  Nobody wanted to volunteer to go out with him, so he went by himself.  And that was pretty much how it was back there before the Watts riot broke out.  But no one listened to what John Buggs--he was an alarmist obviously.  Then in August, August 13th [sic. August 11th, 1965], a lady that they thought, the community thought was pregnant, was pushed in an altercation down in the Watts.  It's hot that night, and that pushing resulted in some stone throwing from the sideline and when it started, it kept going, and from throwing at the officers, they started throwing at buildings, especially buildings owned by Jewish merchants that a lot of people figured they had been gouging the community.  And then it was on, to make a long story short, and L.A. [Los Angeles, California] got caught unexpectedly and I wasn't there the first night.  We had a camera crew, Paul Udell, went down there the first night.  You know, you heard on the radio, on the little squawk box, disturbance underway in Watts area, and go to Code Two, or something like that.  And they thought it was just a little skirmish between the police and the local citizens but it wasn't a little skirmish because when Paul Udell's crew got down there, they were stoned too and they had to get out there in a hurry because they realized when they came back to the station, hey, we've got a major problem down there.  And the next day, the city started exploding all over the place.  I mean, the buildings started burning, the shooting started and what happened, the more the media coverage, the more the media put flames on the fire, we found out later, because of the current commissioner's and, the current commissioner's reports, that we were part of the problem in our coverage, 'cause we would, drew things like they're pillaging a building over at 103rd [Street] and Central [Avenue], when we said, and they're taking out some television sets and some furniture and blah, blah, well what happens, a guy's living in Leimert Park [Los Angeles, California], watching his news broadcast, he said, my God, they're taking out furniture and television sets out at 103rd Street and Watts.  So what do you do?  You jump in your car and go down to 103rd Street and Watts and get a piece of the action.  Well the police, it got to the point where they were so tremendously outgunned, quite frankly, they just sort of sat back and then all hell broke loose for three days and they destroyed a lot of property but that was anger.
Story_ID: 201278
Speaker 1: When I went down there [Watts, Los Angeles, California] the second day, it was very interesting, they would have, I don't know where people were because there was some whites coming in that corridor, I guess going downtown or going from downtown to their place out in the beach area, and they'd come right down Avalon [Boulevard] or Broadway or Main [Street], and on both sides of the street, people lined up waiting for some unsuspecting white motorist to get into that perimeter and they did.  They came off that sidewalk with bricks and bottles and it wasn't very pretty.  I've never seen anything like that in my life.  I mean it was eerie, you know.  I had been in the [U.S.] Air Force but I wasn't in the [Korean] War, quite frankly.  You know, we'd been through basic training and all that stuff but I've never seen anything like that in my life.  It was very dangerous.  They're serious, and it's interesting, I walked down there, and a young man, who was very clean-cut, talking a lot of sense, like it could have been a young collegian, and he was telling about some of the difficulties and when he got down there at the corner, he picked up a brick and bottle and started throwing bricks.  You know, it was just almost a metamorphosis had come over.  He's just the youngest, just clean-cut young guy I was talking to, became one of the, one of the hell raisers down in Watts.  So they was, they got caught up in this whole--but yet I did a report once and I said, I put this in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], of there was sanity amid the chaos.  We have an old white guy, an old beat-up pickup truck, who turned off at a corner and went down toward 103rd Street, and he had two floorboards on each side of the truck, and when he got out there, several black guys, with bottles in their pocket, rushed out there and said, no, no, no, don't, don't throw, he lives here.  They jumped on both sides like [U.S.] Secret Service people, on both sides of the truck, and they physically escorted the old gent on down toward 103rd Street.  I walked down there, jogged down there slowly, to see what would happen if indeed the guys would break off, and the old man would be left on his own regardless, and what kind of fate would await him.  They escorted him, he turned off on 103rd Street, about the second house down there, I recall, and pulled up in the driveway and they said, get on in there now and stay there, don't come out here.  And when I gave the report that evening, I ended it by saying, "Amid this chaos, there is sanity."  And I signed off because, again, it was a very bizarre thing, yet the brothers who were riding the floorboards, they went back up on the perimeter and resumed their brick and bottle throwing.  It was just total chaos but the seeds was there because of the seething difficulties that were prevalent leading into the riots.  I mean, it could have happened on any other occasion.  It just happened, with Marquette Frye, just, one trigger but it could have been anything that had happened because the seeds were ripe for an explosion and they got it.  But that provided a trigger because in urban communities throughout the country, who suffered similar problems, then people had a chance to react because they have the model out there and that model was the Watts riots in 1965.
Speaker 2: Now you, you were doing your reporting [for KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California] by telephone, right?
Speaker 1: Right, because I couldn't get a camera crew down there.  The camera crew's all white and I certainly didn't get any volunteers.  I would not have wanted to be with a camera crew down there at the time because they weren't accustomed to seeing blacks with camera crews at the time.  And I would have been just as vulnerable as my white camera crew 'cause anybody--
Speaker 2: So would have made--you would have seemed like, you know, the enemy, sort of?  You would be suspect.  You wouldn't fit into the background.
Speaker 1: I would be very suspect.  No, there's no way I can be in the back--as a matter of fact, it's interesting because when I would approach police officers, I'd be very careful how I reached in my pocket for my press badge because, keep in mind, anything that's black, was persona non grata, so they said, and they told me to stop, I said, I am a reporter for Channel 2 [KCBS-TV] and they're thinking, yeah, sure.  I said, I'm reaching in my pocket for my press badge, if it's okay with you.  All right, take your time now.  And I'd go in my pocket and show 'em my press badge.  I didn't dare wear my press badge on the outside of my pocket.  I'm not going down those dark streets at night, that's for cotton-picking sure because again, I represented the establishment, and the establishment was persona non grata, you follow.  You work for the establishment, you can't be a safe black.  You're either for us or against us and if you work for the establishment, you have to be against us.  Then there was the other thing that I heard so often during those years, "You people only come down here when it's all bad and you don't come down here when we need help to point out some difficulty" and that's a point I made consistently at Channel 2 during my early years.  Hey, look, there are two sides to a story, we all heard that, that's Journalism 101.  There's the right side and there's a left side.  Unless you tell both sides, you haven't told the story, and unless we go down there and start ferreting out some of those stories that result in mass unemployment, lack of industrial base, had no great businesses down there, where people don't have any place to go to work, they can't get down there to downtown because of its poor transportation system.  Their schools are dismal, subpar teachers, many of whom didn't have credentials.  When you put people in that kind of a predicament, they get angry.  When they get angry, given an opportunity, they may explode, and what they're doing, not to apologize for what happened, but they're trying to call someone's attention to the fact that these are differences that should be addressed, should have been addressed and were not.  But amazingly after the Watts riot happened, a lot of those problems were beginning to be resolved because people started looking at 'em.
Story_ID: 201279
Speaker 1: Now how long did the [Watts] riots last?  How many days actually?
Speaker 2: As I recall, three days.  I've got a plaque on the wall that tells you how long it--they were three days and three nights and they eventually brought in the [California Army] National Guard, as you recall, and there was some reluctance.  The police officers were very macho, pretty much like the [President George Walker Bush] administration is right now, you don't want to bring in more troops because that's a sign of weakness.  Well, the police looked upon it as being a sign of weakness and said, we can handle it ourselves, but they weren't able to handle it.  And the other thing that was so bad down there, as I recall, the people in the fire trucks, who had to go down and try to put out those fires, you see they had no weapons, so they were fair game because where they parked those fire trucks down there, they would, the people on the streets would unleash the bricks and bottles, against those firemen as well and to some extent they had to request police escorts to go in and get those fires put out down there.  And it's interesting because sometimes the fires would be so fully involved, they'd pass right by those (unclear) and go to those that they could get to.  So it was just a bad situation.  I would not have wanted to be a fireman, that's for sure, because you'll fully explode.  You're trying to fight a fire at the same time, watch your back at the same time and you don't have a weapon to deal with.  That is not a very attractive situation, obviously being, so my hat goes off to those firemen who did that.  But here again, like one guy said it, I was standing by, one of the fire trucks pulled over, and I put this in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], and he threw a bottle at the fire truck and he said, hire some blacks.  Everybody on the fire truck was white and I'm sure if they had had a lot of blacks as firemen, black firemen at the time, they would have probably put 'em on the trucks, basically, but that was not the case, so to speak.  And it's interesting because only recently has the city promoted its first female to a black captain [Veronie Steele-Small].  I know I did a story with Captain Jim Shern [James Shern] years ago when he became the first black battalion chief [of the Los Angeles County Fire Department] and that was about twenty-five years ago [sic. 1968] and that, I didn't realize at the time how big that story was, but it's a big story, but it also showed how closed that market was to African Americans.  I mean, to become a black battalion chief, that was a big, big story and the guy, I think it was Firehouse 109.  They have an old guy who was back there years ago who was one of the curators over there and he tells that story.  If you listen to him, he'll bend your ear for an hour and a half, nonstop, nonstop, because he lived it and you can tell he gets very emotional when he tells that story because he was there.  And he'll tell you about the isolation and the indignity he had down south.  He had to suffer.  It's a very scintillating story that he tells and I enjoy listening to the old-timer.  But as I listened to him talk, I went back with my own predicament and realized I had similar circumstances years ago because you would say, my God, you can't win on one hand, you're Benedict Arnold, and the other hand you're a hero, but you're never gonna be on top of the game because on one hand you're very suspect and on the other hand you're not fully accepted over here, so what do you do?  You suck it up and just make it happen and you keep your goal in sight of you and I never forgot the fact that I was pioneering.  I never forgot how I got there either because I realized that anything I did had to be representative of the trust that the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had placed on me by recommending me to Roy [Wilkins] and I had never forgotten that and I'm not ashamed to say that.  If it had not been for them, I wouldn't have known about it and they didn't have Roy's ear to say I got somebody I think you may want to look at.  Maybe Roy would not have looked at me and I appreciate that too 'cause I've never forgotten that.
Speaker 1: So you felt a little torn, is what you're saying and anyone in that position because--I'm just saying, there was an exhilaration, but you're saying you felt torn sort of?
Speaker 2: You are, you are right.
Speaker 1: I mean just in terms of the role because you were, you know, this is a community that you were a part of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --yet you were on the other side?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This was, here you were, sort of the chance of a journalistic lifetime, you know, 'cause you have the story.
Speaker 2: Right--
Story_ID: 201280
Speaker 1: I'm wondering, then at the station [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California], are you sort of considered the expert at that point, you know, and people, how are--what is your position in the station at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, eventually, I became, because that was manifest in the fact that I was asked to join the senior management team, in the community affairs department as a manager of community affairs.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in, I think, is in 196--it was 1968, the later part of '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: So three years after the [Watts] riot?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because what happened is that during the time I was in news, a gentleman by the name of Garth Hentz [ph.], I put it in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], was the director of community affairs, and he had gone down to one of the inner city schools and tried to give a speech, he's white, and bombed out.  So when he--that experience left him with a very sour taste in his mouth, so, when he had a speech request for one of the urban schools, he'd come to me and say, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], if you can get off, can you give a speech on it?"  I said, "Fine," and as I said before, being basically a ham, I said, "no problem."  So I would always accommodate Garth by giving a speech for him in one of the inner city schools.  So, management, the top management, had a meeting and they decided the time was right to broad-base and diversify their management team, the senior management team.  Garth Hentz went to lobbying for me.  He said, "I've used Joe repeatedly, I know he has it for the community, he has the visibility now and he basically would be an excellent choice."  As I put in the book, I understand from one of my contacts who attended that meeting at Musso and Frank's [Musso and Frank Grill, Los Angeles, California], they went to this Spanish Inquisition-type Q [question] and answer period.  Well, you know, he's a journalist, you know how those guys can be very stubborn and not known to be team players.  Well he shared, you know, working to management secrets over here, can he be trusted, he's plugged in with the leadership down there, how safe are we that Joe is not going to be, I mean, honest, 'cause he might not have dealt with me before in the management level and I understand that.  So finally we agreed that, Garth said, "Look, I'll put my thing that Joe is a professional and he'll do what we have to do.  We don't have to worry about him trading trade secrets if you will."  You know, I was invited to become a member of the management team but I was told initially that I would serve as basically in the--concentrate in the black area because that's where all the challenges were coming from and eventually when I got, I took over the department, I realized there's no future in just becoming one dimensional and that's when I began to get into the other areas of Hispanic, the Jewish, the gay, blah, blah, blah, and I expanded my staff accordingly and we went to a different area.  But, yes, to answer your question, yes, because they realized that there were a lot of stories that were not being told, they had no one to make recommendations.  You see one of my jobs was to go back to news, editorial and programming, and make recommendations of stories that we should be telling but we were not telling and I would even, in one time, go to their production meetings in the morning and lobby for stories I thought that we should be covering, quite frankly, and the general manager was a hundred percent supportive.  He came, and he said, "Now when Joe makes a recommendation, it's not going to be a recommendation where you do the story when you get around to it.  Obviously, the hard news takes priority.  I understand and I enjoy (unclear) on these stories but we have to have balance in our news and we began to have more stories that were positive in nature to offset the many negative that we had to cover down there."  And one of the big discussions we had, and I think you alluded to it earlier, when there was a story involving something black, we'd go through the same people, we'd go through the director of [Los Angeles] Urban League, we'd go to the head of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], we'd go to most of the people who headed the black social service agencies.  As I said in my meeting one day, I said boy, when you got ready to talk about global warming, you can always go outside the black community.  When you get ready to talk about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we never see an African American, and the mindset of a black child who watches our news broadcast would readily conclude the only thing we can talk about are minority issues and that's not true.  I said, now if you wanted to be fair about this, when you got ready to talk about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, I'd like to see an African American talk about it and they can talk about that.  If you want to talk about the Middle Eastern crisis, you have African Americans that can talk about that and they surely can talk about that.  In other words, we are promoting a stereotype, however innocently it may be done, and so they said, well we don't have the resources to develop that kind of reservoir of contacts.  I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, you have a reservoir of other contacts, you start slowly, build a directory, it's not hard to do that, you can easily do that," and before I left, computer technology had been the big thing and you can go to a computer and do a search on that and you can find almost anything you want to know, quite frankly.  So that whole programming, one of the things that one general manager said before he left, he said, "I'm pleased to have served with you, Joe, because for years you were the conscience of this station and we benefited from it, that conscience," but keep in mind I had another role too, 'cause my department was in charge of license renewal, and I knew what that meant if we ever lost our cotton-picking license.  So I spoke with a bit of authority, either you do that or we run the risk, and you tell it to New York [New York] legal.  I told you what you need to know.  And when I say our numbers are down in certain areas, especially top three categories, we can be challenged on that.  We are heavily burdened with secretaries and third assistants but the officers and managers, basically all white.  Now my job is to tell you, you don't have to do a damn thing about it, but once I tell you, and I tell New York legal I have told you this, my job is done.
Story_ID: 201281
Speaker 1: And as I said in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], they had one guy we're having problems with in the Latino community [in Los Angeles, California], in that he just refused to acquiesce.  He's one of these hard-nosed General George S. Patton types until the community got on him and then he came to me for help and I said, "Hell, you come to me when you're on fire, when your building is burning.  But I tried to tell you as I can, that these things that, are going to set us up with a lot of trouble with the Latino community."  And his response, that I don't want to be given a lot of negative stuff, I've got a station [KCBS-TV, Channel 2, Los Angeles, California] to run here and was brought here to do a job.  I said, "Okay."  And he found out later he couldn't do his job because he had the Latinos on his butt from morning to night with meetings and protest groups and threats and everything else.  And finally, I went to [HistoryMaker] Johnathan Rodgers, and Johnathan called me, and this is in my memoir, he called me and he said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], what's the problem we have with the Latino community?"  And I said, "Well I'll tell you what, let me explain to you."  So I had my staff develop a compilation of all the articles in the Los Angeles Times and the La Opinion, and the Eastern Group Publications [Inc., Los Angeles, California] had done about the controversy, I sent them to J.R. [Johnathan Rodgers].  I said, J.R. has scheduled a meeting with the general manager and myself and--to talk about the issue.  And he said that the general manager said, "Well, I don't think they're anything but a bunch of rabble-rousers," and J.R. said, "rabble-rousers, but they seem to be getting a hell of a lot of press, don't they, to be a group of rabble-rousers?"  So what J.R. said to him, this is what I want you to do, very clearly, and I wish I were not in that meeting because it got to be very embarrassing.  He said, "I want you to fix that problem, and I want you to tell me in a few weeks how you got it done."  And that's when the general manager looked at me and he wanted me to hurry up and schedule a meeting with the group that he had been calling a bunch of yahoos, and talk with the group privately.  And they said, "Now we're going to let them stew a while and you can ignore that, we're going to ignore him," 'cause they had already written to J.R.  They said, "Look, unless you get a new general manager down here, we refuse to do business with Channel 2 again," and Esther [Renteria] had shared that with me privately that, and next stop it's New York [New York], and New York's position had always historically been, we don't want a group of angry community people getting off trains and planes coming downtown, to downtown Manhattan [New York, New York], protesting angry, you guys stop that stuff over there in Los Angeles but don't bring it to New York.  And he knew, he knew, and the general manager, that J.R., what J.R. was saying, if he couldn't do it, you can bring somebody here who could.  Well, Esther, the Hispanic media coordinator, the one who'd been dealing with me at the time, you know, and we were good friends and everything 'cause I had, they realized that I had tried my best to get a meeting with this hard-ass, if you will, to talk with him and they realized that his stance had to be softened and they did, they got his attention.  And then when they got his attention, then he tried, almost every hire he had, was Latino, because they were trying to make up for the differential, the deficit he hadn't done when he first got here.  So that was a long-winded way of answering your first question, that is, yes, there was a need.
Story_ID: 201282
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back to one story with the [Watts] riots, and that was your dealings with [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had not heard too much about Dr. Karenga at the time.  I know there was an US Organization [The Organization US], obviously, 'cause they had problems with the Black Panther Party, but I had not personally been involved with them, now keep in mind.  I was trying to get my own stuff together.  So we [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California] covered the community meeting, that's when things had begun to ease up, crews could get down there, an afternoon meeting.  And there were the black ministers and they were just haranguing the [Los Angeles] Police Department and what needed to be done and changes to be made.  And we'd covered it and we got ready to leave, walked out of the building, excuse me, and I see a lot of these black brothers with green dashikis on which was an African American head hanging around their neck, and a guy later identified as [Ngao] Damu, that I thought at the time was the leader of the group.  He said, "Brother, you're not going anywhere right now," and I said, "yeah, we'd done a wrap."   He said, "No, no, you're not through.  You heard what they had to say, and now you hear what the people have to say."  I said, "Well," I told all the camera crew, a bunch of guys, so they were packing up, I said, "you guys better unpack and stand ready for another interview."  And they wanted to get the hell out there and I understand 'cause they had about fifteen African Americans in the same--gathering around us.  They were very polite but they were very direct.  And then I said, "Let's do an interview."  And what I was going to do was to do what we call one of these pacifying interviews.  You know, I interview them and later on I can always say, hell, I decided not to use the story, no big thing, at least we get the hell out of there in time.  Then when we set up, I was going to give the microphone in front of Damu and he said, "No, no, no, just one minute."  And then down in between them came this little rotund, bald-headed man.  "Hi Brother [HistoryMaker Joseph] Dyer, I'm Maulana Karenga."  I said, "Glad to meet you."  Then I began to conduct the interview and he said the only damn thing that was worth airing that evening.  I aired his entire interview 'cause he made a lot of sense, not only he's the product of the community, he lived down there, he had his project down there, he had told basically the same thing that John Buggs had said for years what the seething difficulties were.  Now the minister who was talking before that time, said all the right things 'cause he was very articulate but it didn't make much sense.  I mean, he was saying the things that was very traditional, everybody knew.  He's very polished and everything but Dr. Karenga, number one, he's an educated guy, he had a great command of the English language, obviously, and he broke it down very perfectly clear so that the average person could understand what brought about the uprising in Watts [Los Angeles, California], what it should take to ease the situation down there.  And when I got back to the studio, I went into the editing rooms, he had the only comment that was worth taking so we used his comment.  Never touched any of the other speaker's comments and that was my introduction to him.  And for years, we became great friends.  He was very appreciative of the interview and I had a chance to do many other interviews with him.  And sometimes I'd go down to some of his meetings.  He had an organization called the Black Congress where all these militants got together, et cetera, and he was always there, and very complimentary, quite frankly.  But that was a very unsettling time because I realized that the camera crew was nervous and we had a long drive back to the station through basically unfriendly territory, with an unmarked car, with a car that had Channel 2 [KCBS-TV] with an eye on it, which they stopped doing for a while because that was a mark, that was an open invitation for a brick or bottle or Molotov cocktail.  I would always go in my private car, quite frankly.  I'd want to meet the crew down there, et cetera, for the reason I told you very early, it just wasn't very safe in those times and the people got accustomed to seeing who you are.  But that was my introduction to Dr. Maulana Karenga, who went on to do good things.  The founder of Kwanzaa and everything else.  He's quite an individual and as I said before, even now every weekend he has meetings out at this house of Kawaida down there and he has guest speakers would come in.  I've been down there.  My daughter has been going down there.  So he's a very delightful person and he obviously talks his mind over at San Diego [California], I mean, Long Beach State [California State University, Long Beach, Long Beach, California].  He doesn't hold back, he's very strong, very forceful and very humorous too.  He's a good speaker.

Speaker 1: Yeah, I walked in one morning and Garth Hentz [ph.], the gentleman who hired me in community affairs [at KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California], he said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], I've got a call from my sister station in Chicago [Illinois], WBBM-TV," I said, "yeah." "They have a gentleman they hired back there and they want to send him out here for a week or so to have you brief him on how to do community affairs work."  I said, "Fine, fine, fine."  "Just take him under your wings, tell him the ropes, et cetera," I said, "no problem."  And I had forgotten about it for a couple weeks, later, I was in the office and the secretary said, "Joe, there's a gentleman downstairs says he's here from WBBM-TV, you're supposed to show him around."  I said, "Yeah, that's the gentleman that Garth Hentz was telling me about.  Send him, bring him up."  So Michelle [ph.] brought him up and this tall guy walked in there, I said, "God, you've got to be kidding," now I wouldn't have known his name if they had told me before the fact that it was [HistoryMaker] Warner Saunders, because keep in mind I was at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] only one year, right.  Warner and I lived in the same dormitory, and he's an athlete, but he's a basketball player and I was a football player.  And we just hugged and, it was just, it was quite a reunion there because here's a guy I hadn't seen in, I guess I hadn't seen Warner in at least, keep in mind, I left Xavier in 1953, '54 [1954], and that means from '54 [1954] to about--
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969] or '70 [1970], I hadn't seen anybody from Xavier.  And we had this big reunion right there in the corridor, I said, of all the people they may have told me they're going to send, they wouldn't have, in my wildest imagination I wouldn't have thought it was someone with whom I'd gone to school too many years ago at Xavier University.  And he was a pretty good basketball player too.  But then I began to find out later on that he had left the 'Common Ground' show he was doing, he was doing, then he went to NBC, I think, over there in Chicago and became a field reporter and then an anchor.  Now to my knowledge, Warner didn't have a media background, he just had a perfectly good gift for gab.  He had a good speakin' voice.  He had a nice personality and very, heavily involved.  I think he was heavily involved in the community too.  That shows very clearly what he's doing in 'Common Ground,' quite frankly.  The 'Common Ground' showcasing helped him out too with his overall delivery.  So when I hear about Chicago now, in addition to people like Hosea Sanders and et cetera, I think of, you see, but I got a guy who's basically a homeboy, so to speak, and a school chum if you will.  And I said, Warner Saunders, and everybody knows Warner.  He comes, just go to show you that you just never know where your latent talent may lie until you go out and explore and he's a classic example of what I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: But see, you on the other hand, and I think, I'm trying to think of the other--he's got a news gathering.  He's, I think passed away but he got hired, I think, sort of similarly to you and in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California] there's something called, they do research and training for minorities in the, you know, in the news.  Do you know?
Speaker 1: I think I know what you're talking about.  It's an organization--
Speaker 2: His wife took over, yes, oh, anyway, because his story was that he was also working, you know, similar to you--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as a reporter and you know I think the, I think the story was similar to yours, 'cause see, there's a difference between a Warner Saunders and you in that you were a trained journalist.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, and so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but, and you were working also like, between the years of 1965 when you were hired, right?
Speaker 1: Right, '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Okay, in '68 [1968], when, or not '8 [1968], when you became--
Speaker 1: Manager.
Speaker 2: --you know community affairs--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --executive.  That was, even having that position was a new type of position.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and in the meantime, in those three years, you were working still as a reporter, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Story_ID: 202268
Speaker 1: Let me ask, some of the stories, you know, if you could just recount some of the stories.  I want to ask you when you--well first of all, you interviewed Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a matter of fact, as I said before, that was part of a movement type deal because, there was a movement here in Los Angeles [California] tried to force other stations, and it wasn't involving the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], just a group of people who thought that other stations should be pressured into hiring more African American reporters.  I think the community leadership felt that we can get better done if we had more stations with a Joe Dyer [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer] on their team.  So I got a call from a gentleman by the name of Ed Brown and another gentleman by the name of Booker Griffin [Jr.].  Booker is a helluva revolutionary guy and he said, "Hey, Joe, the champ is dead broke."  I said, yeah, and he wants to tell his story to an African American, at the time back there, a black reporter.  And I said, "Well you got one on the phone."  He said, "I'll tell you what."  Now, Booker and I go back long years and heavy involvement and he said, I said, "Is he willing to come out and openly state on the air that he's broke?"  He said, "Absolutely."  I said, "Good.  I'll tell you what.  Let me get your number, Booker, and I'll call you back on another line and tell you where we can meet.  It's going to probably be at my home over at Leimert Park [Los Angeles, California] in (unclear), that were friends of the family over the years.  I don't wanna run the risk of anyone going on the squawk box and I don't want to see other camera crews over there, I just want me and his entourage and my camera crew to do the story, fine."  So I went in to the news director [at KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California], I said, "I've got a shot with Muhammad Ali and his crew.  He wants to disclose to me that he's broke."  Well initially, he asked me to give it to Gil Stratton.  Gil Stratton was the sportscaster, great guy, because he's much more experienced and you know he's, this is a big story, I mean, if the champ's going to go in there and say he's broke.  And I said, "No, I hate to tell you, they want to give this story only to a black guy," and I said, "Gil Stratton wouldn't matter one way or the other," 'cause he was that kind of person.  You know, he, to him the story is his thing.  Obviously he would like to have done it but it wouldn't have been a big thing because he and I had a pretty good understanding.  So, we set it up here at ten o'clock that morning and we sure as hell, at ten o'clock that morning, a limousine pulled in front of the house and I went out there and had Booker and Ed Brown, Khalilah Ali, and Muhammad Ali and Howard Bingham.  Howard Bingham is the one who took the pictures I have in my book.  He got out of the car and came on in here, and he was just as open as you can make it.  Very pleasant and keep in mind, about a year earlier, I had met Ali at the sports arena ticket window.  He and his brother, Rudy [Rahman Ali], were standing there.  They were buying a ticket for some fight or something, and we got into a talkin' about how much he brags about knocking people out and giving rounds and he made it very clear, and I put this in the book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer] too.  He said, you know, "I do a lot of popping off, and the more I pop off, the more people come and see me get knocked out and the more people that come to see me get knocked out, the more it embellishes my bank book, quite frankly."  I said, "It makes a lot of sense to me."  And that's what he essentially did for years.  You know, he called around with his poetry, you know, and all that kind of stuff, when he was gonna knock people out.  I mean, he was very successful in doing that but I think it surprised him too that he would knock 'em out at the rounds he said because it had to put a little pressure on him.  He didn't remember that encounter we had when we talked about it before and he knew that I knew him very well 'cause I knew his brother Rudy, because the two of them were together at the sports arena window.  And amazingly, nobody in the neighborhood knew I was doing a story.  I didn't tell anybody except the people at the station about, I'm going to do this story and it eventually made the wire services and the evening news and that excerpt made the CBS news.  Now, when Ali left here, and we went outside, he was a very playful guy, he started up shadowboxing, you know.  First you see me, then you don't.  First you see me, then you don't.  He had his suit on and everything, he's a tall guy.  He told me, comes over sometimes and I tell my wife [Doris Dillon Dyer], now see, you know it's a funny thing about it, I sat there and shadowboxed with him playfully, I can see how difficult it is to hit this guy, he's so smooth, he's so fluid.  Now he had shoes on, a suit on and everything, and yet he was moving around that car like a little ballet dancer, and he's obviously a very gifted athlete, so to speak.  And throughout the years, we'd occasionally meet, thanks to Howard Bingham, who was a good friend of mine.  Howard Bingham and I go back to the old teen post days, who ended up making a career out of shooting his pictures and so did Booker Griffin, (unclear).  He would say he was doing an unofficial PR [public relations] job while he'd have a big thing where he set a winter trip to the Bahamas with Muhammad Ali.  Unfortunately, people who always went on the trip would be young ladies, pretty, light-skinned, well I won't get into that but it, Booker, Booker was quite something, God bless him, but he was very close to the champ and that closeness led him, he and Ed Brown, to deliver him to me and I appreciate the respect that they did.  So, that was one of the highlights of my young career because I was able to get him in my home and then the book, the memoir, has a picture of that interview here in my home, in different chairs, of course, and you see them on the news and everything else.  But it was quite an event here.  And my wife was teaching.  She wasn't here and nobody was here.  It was just me and the champ and his entourage and I never forgot that.
Speaker 1: It's a wonder she didn't want to stay around and sneak around and stay, you know--
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.
Speaker 1: --in the background.  I mean, that's pretty--I mean, that would be the highlight of anyone's career--
Speaker 2: Well I thought so.  It would certainly--it was the highlight of mine, I'll tell you that, in my budding career, it could help.  It didn't do anything at all, as I said in my book, he's been known to help people throughout the years and he certainly helped me over the years when I was a budding reporter and these were a good shot in the arm that he provided because I was able to deliver someone of that magnitude and I was very pleased with, that he did this, quite frankly.
Story_ID: 202269
Speaker 1: And Mayor [Tom] Bradley was very good at doing that too.  I would do some good interviews with Tom Bradley.  Tom and I had gone back to the old days when we were involved with a group called the Ragged Robins [Shoe Fund Inc.].  They gave shoes to kids, I've got some pictures of that, every year who couldn't go to school 'cause they didn't have new shoes.  And Tom was advising and I became the advisor and we kind of hooked up when he was a city council person.  So when he became the mayor [of Los Angeles, California], we just took that association and developed professionally in dealing with the community out there.  But the other, you mention some other interview, was one of [Governor] George Wallace, which is very interesting because, as I said, again in the book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], I was the only black reporter here in the town.  I was doing basically--the feature reporter on a Sunday.  I was the only one that was doing the field work and I was assigned to catch George Wallace coming into the airport.  He was running for president at the time and when I got there, we got there early on the tarmac, they had a car there with, I guess about three of his henchmen standing by the car, with a crew cut, burly guy, and they looked at me as if I were a Martian.  So they headed over directly to me, toward me, and my cameraman and, Harvey [ph.] and Bill Pickett [ph.], were standing by the door.  Now, they passed right by me.  I didn't even exist and they asked Bill Pickett, they said, "Is he with y'all?"  And Bill Pickett said, "No, we're with him, he's our reporter."  And this guy could have just dropped dead, I'm sure, then he realized what he had done and, 'cause George Wallace hadn't gotten there at the time, so I went close to where the other reporters were and then like he wanted to make up then kind of softened the blow and by that time I had a little attitude, I didn't want to have anything to do with the guy, but I didn't want to create an incident because I realized then all around me people were, I'm sure, looking at me as if I were a freak, some kind of oddity, you know, very uncomfortable, obviously, 'cause the general concern, not concern, the anticipation would be better, how is this black reporter gonna react or how is George Wallace going to react with this black reporter when he gets off the plane?  And I had decided earlier I was not going to ask him any racial questions.  I didn't want to hear all about his friends of the family and all that kind of, earlier stuff, earlier across the country.  I want to hear about that plane that he's riding around in at the state expense and his office workers who are riding around at state expense.  And this is the story we had gotten from one of the presses out in Birmingham [Alabama].  That's what I wanted to hear about.  I thought he would not be anticipating those kinds of questions coming from me.  He thought, I might have thought about the racial questions and all that kind of stuff.  He can answer that all night 'cause he had been doing that.  But amazingly, when he got off the plane, he made a beeline straight to myself now and he did that 'cause I was the only one there who stood out, you know.  The other white reporters just kind of stood back.  Usually in those kinds of gatherings, you're jockeying for position, you're fighting for the best vantage point.  That was not the case and I think what happened is that they were focusing on the so-called perceived confrontation between me and Governor Wallace and it just never happened because he came over, the perfect PR [public relations] guy, how you doing?  You thought we were long-lost buddies.  He played the role to the hilt, I mean, 'cause obviously he was using me to play to the camera and I understand that, obviously, and one time he put his hand on my shoulder, "Let me tell you something, son."  You know, and that's something, that's a no-no.  I didn't want to give him the impression that I didn't want to, I didn't dare jerk away 'cause that would have been something that I might have wanted to say--someone would have picked up.  So I kind of eased back a little bit and he let his hand slip off me but I tell you, he was very wily, he was very sharp and he had been obviously well-groomed in terms of how to--and very poised.  I give him credit for that.  He was very sharp and no matter what question I would ask him, he would sagaciously have a way of coming back and getting to the racial scene, "That's just like you," would be his segue.  People saying I'm against colored folks and he went on to say I'm not against colored folks, I'm just more for states' rights.  I don't think it's right for the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. to tell us what we should be doing instead.  If the states want this, they can do it.  If the states don't want that, they don't have to do it.  It was very innocent, I mean, very, it makes a lot of sense.  You know, but he said, they try, they come, this colored folk, then they want to tell about the thing that I had heard before that he and his family were basically very tight in the colored, down in Alabama for years.  I mean, workers were just as close to him as kin folks.  I'd heard the story that sometimes--I didn't want to get into it 'cause I heard these stories before and I didn't want to have a restatement at my expense.  But no matter what questions I would ask him about that plane, he would come back and say, that's people who have an axe to grind.  That's just like telling him about, and he gets into his mantra about some of his best friends, if you will, and I found it very interesting.  But he was very, that was an experience, I mean, now interesting--
Story_ID: 202270
Speaker 1: The next time I saw him [Governor George Wallace], again, I put this in the book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], was at the Long Beach Convention [and Entertainment] Center [Long Beach, California].  He gave a speech down there and I walked, with the hostile treatment I received at the airport, when I walked in that night with a camera crew, it was as if I was the--God, a very noted VIP because when I got to the door, the ushers at the door, escorted my camera crew and me down to the front of the cotton-picking convention center seating area, put us in row two, we had the best vantage point whatsoever, and as I said in the book, I looked around me at that stage and Frank [ph.], and George Wallace, and I saw a sea of white and I looked around at the audience and my camera crew and I saw a sea of white and I said for--it was as if I were the guest of honor at the meeting of the white citizens' council because it was eerie, it was bizarre.  But they were very polite that night, very courteous and certainly very accommodating but George was a professional but he got a helluva percentage of the votes in that election year.  So he was not a country bumpkin as some people would make him believe.  He was very polished and very smooth.  And I give his handlers credit for that because they had well prepared him for that presidential run.  And as history would later say, he went on and made some key appointments of African Americans to his administration and he tended to offset some of the negativism that accompanied him before he had his, when he got shot.  But so many people, the whites, the blacks in Mississippi--in Alabama, swore by him in terms of the new George Wallace, 'cause he did a lot of things that no one would have expected him to even envision when he stood in that door and said, "Segregation now, today and forever."  You know, but no, he changed.
Story_ID: 202271
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you, where you were when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed?  And, you know, and your, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the office [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California] at the time he was killed because everything just got a--it was surreal, it was surreal.  It's amazing that the--when he was killed, well the first thing that comes to mind as a journalist you wonder what kind of a reaction there's going to be in the community, number one, that was the first thing from a journalist's point, is my God, here we go again, some stuff gonna go down and did, not to a great extent, but it did go down.  It went down greater in other parts of the country, down in the, I think it was in Detroit [Michigan] they had a big uprising, as a result, they had such a big one out.  We had our shot, I guess, back in '65 [1965] [Watts riots, Los Angeles, California] when they had pretty much anticipated there would be some problems, again, so they had brought in a lot of heavy equipment, militarily speaking.  But we didn't have such a big riot.  I think in, the community of people were more or less in a state of shock, quite frankly, you know, so there was not a big reaction but I was in the news at the time.  But the next day, they wanted me to do what amounted to a reflective piece down at the old historic Second Baptist Church [Los Angeles, California].  They wanted me to stand in front of the church and reflect on my last remembrance of Dr. King, 'cause the Second Baptist Church was one of the last churches at which he spoke in Los Angeles [California].  And I gave a respected piece about my reflections of him and what I remember as a reporter.  And then driving back to the station, and they were playing some of his speeches, you know, the mountain top speech [I've Been to the Mountaintop] and obviously, I Have A Dream, and all of a sudden, I just started crying and it's the most amazing thing and I just told my wife [Doris Dillon Dyer] I said, you know, I just couldn't just stop crying 'cause it dawned on me then, what it really meant to me as a journalist and as an African American, that I just got floored 'cause his speeches have a way of, you know, really getting to you.  I heard him speak before and, before I got to CBS, my wife and I used to go to a lot of the meetings here in Los Angeles, especially in Wrigley Field [Los Angeles, California] and some of the churches that he spoke at, and he was very gifted as an orator, obviously.  But just, just couldn't stop crying, quite frankly, and that was, it was quite an unreal period.  And then a month later, I was covering Senator [Robert Francis] Kennedy's speech, down at the Ambassador [Hotel, Los Angeles, California], and as I said in the book, the thought occurred to me that how exposed he was, standing there at the podium with Rosey Grier and Ethel [Kennedy] and, et cetera, and if somebody wanted to pop him, they could probably do it.  And just, you know it was just a thought, you know, you're sitting there looking at it and fantasizing, my God, what a--how unprotected he is, and when he went back in that kitchen area and then people started screaming and shouting and running about and you realized, my God, it has happened again and it was another night that I shall never forget and I think the heading of that chapter was "A Night That I Shall Never Forget" because I will never forget it.  They locked us in the hotel.  They didn't let us out till they figured out what was going to happen.
Story_ID: 202272
Speaker 1: And there were other, many other interesting things.  I know I was down covering Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] once and I actually spoke, I said to him, "You are head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC]," and boy he really yakked, "get away from me brother," you know, get away from me.  Well, because he had been talking violent all during his speech and I said, "Mr. Carmichael, you are head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, are you not?"  Get away from me, but he knew I was going there with the question.  He didn't want to entertain that at all.  Then there were people on to me beginning of my career, before I became very exposed out there on the tube, well they sent me out to get a reporter, I mean, a story, and people didn't realize I was African American and you could see the reaction when I walked in there and then when I went to cover Jayne Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay, we had that little tiff and I was sent to her place and she had all her entourage around and that kind of stuff, and when I walked in, you could see, no one said anything negative, they were very kind, but you could tell, and it's not paranoid, you can tell that they were surprised, that I was an African American, and then they had a dancer who, the police were busting almost every week being overexposed, and she was a very bosomy-type blonde lady, I think she's peroxide, really, and I went out to interview her a couple of times and when I did interview her, apparently the microphone was too close to her bosom because the phone lit up and they objected to this black guy interviewing that blonde with the microphone close to her cotton--after all, that's what those guys do and, you know, they really gave me a pretty hard time, I was told, and they tried to keep a lot of that stuff from my ear, and I appreciate that the station wouldn't give me too much of that, even when I was doing editorials, the only reaction I got was an organized reaction from the National Riflemen Association [sic. National Rifle Association (NRA)] 'cause they objected to a position I took on the NRA and, 'cause they had a well-organized opposition and I got letters and emails and phone calls about the position I took.  It wasn't racist, it's just that they were very well-organized, and I respect that ability to get the people out when they've been challenged, quite frankly, but all during the years I was doing editorials, and we did some helluva editorials, I never got, I don't recall anyone giving me a racist call.  I had a lot of supporters out there 'cause we tended to take the point of view of the small person and we took on [Los Angeles] City Hall and we took on the governor and we were bad.  Well the guy who was helping write, Gene Faison [ph.], who was editorial director, was an anti-bureaucrat already so it didn't take much for him to dig into the establishment.  He did a pretty good job for that, quite frankly.  And we both were kind of, off onto the anti-bureaucrat campaign and did--stayed on that for some time.  So we picked up quite a following in that respect so there wasn't a whole lot of need of people to object 'cause we were taking on taxation and what was happening down at city hall and how the city council people were taking advantage of the taxpayers' money and they were taking junkets they shouldn't have taken.  So those are the kinds of things that we were talking about, and that seemed to--played well with the general public, you know, I was very pleased, quite frankly.
Story_ID: 202273
Speaker 1: Do you remember covering the [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis case, or what about the election of [HistoryMaker] Yvonne Brathwaite Burke?  When was she, wasn't she elected during the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is to say she's on her second term right now.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but I mean--
Speaker 2: In the [U.S] Congress?
Speaker 1: --when she was in congress?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't cover her.
Speaker 1: You didn't do that?
Speaker 2: No, you see, we had a political editor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were more, when you were reporting?
Speaker 2: Field reporter.
Speaker 1: Field reporter.
Speaker 2: And, I mean, they'd give you anything that came down the pike.  At the time, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Let me ask you, in those three years before you became in community affairs, from a reporting side 'cause you said that the experience with the [U.S.] Air Force had really been a very good experience.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But are there things, and that you even had an electronic experience--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, but are there things that you learned in those three years at CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California] that stood you well for the rest of your career?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think there's been, one of the things I think I take away from CBS is the fact that I was able to work with the diversity here in southern California, that's very important.  I was able to provide some interpretation to management what that diversity means to doing business here in southern California.  As a writer, as an author, I've been able to glean from those experiences a lot of material that I used in my books in terms of the acculturation in both the Latinos, the Asian Pacific, the black community I know very well, and the things I'm working on right now, I pulled from that very strongly what I know to be a fact, I've learned a lot, I'm the first to admit that.  I never shall forget I was in a meeting with the Native Americans once and meaning well, I was appointing some chairpersons or heads of certain committees, and I appointed someone from the Apache community, and one from the Navajo and Jesus Christ, I didn't know what all the fussing and fighting was about.  And then when Junior Tyler [ph.] pulled me aside and said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], brother, let me educate you.  You're not appointing committee chair, you're appointing nations.  So, when you're appointing an Apache, over a Navajo, and a Sioux over an Apache, Joe, you're putting two nations, you're arbitrarily sitting there making the--" and I said, you know, I confess to being totally ignorant, but I learned.  I don't make those mistakes twice.  I was in a meeting with Esther Renteria, we were going out to lunch, and had a gentleman who was--he was really Cuban, who was a new anchor, and I was like all the anchors came to Los Angeles [California].  My job was to take them around and show 'em and do some various leaders in the various diverse community with Paula Zahn and all these people I worked the same route.  I brought this Cuban guy down to Esther Renteria who was Mexican American and Esther really reacted and she apologized later, she said, "Look, I don't normally eat with Cubans, Joe, let me tell you something but I'll eat because you're here, you follow, because," I said, "Esther what was all that about?"  She said, "Don't you understand, Joe?  In the Mexican American community, this is not Florida, this is not New York, this is Los Angeles, we have differences with the Cuban," 'cause they look at the Cubans as being basically white, the aristocracy up here, and they look upon, they meaning the Cuban, tend to look upon the Mexicans as being grassroots, the field hands, the dirty fingernails and that kind of thing.  She said, "Well, those are differences we in the community understand.  That's why people say, we don't want to coalesce with the Cuban because they think they're better than we are, and, but if you say we'll sit down and eat, we'll sit down and eat together."  Now she said this in front of Chris, Chris Conangla, who looks like he's Italian, quite frankly.  As a matter of fact, in meeting with Antonia Hernandez, head of MALDEF [Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund], we were in a meeting once and she said that she was making a point and she's accusing white men of running the media and then Chris Conangla started talking in Spanish and he probably told her, I may not look it but I am Hispanic and Antonia said, well you look white to me, and he did, he's very, very white (unclear).  Anyway, that acculturation that I've been exposed to helped me a lot in terms of my understanding of people--my appreciation of the different cultures, cultures if you will.  The same thing as Japanese and Koreans, you know, you have to be very careful.  In my job how I, meaning well, I try to match people up because you're matching up cultures.

Speaker 1: Yeah, TV One.  I want to see that because that's a start-up, that's a different, that is like totally different from anything he's done before.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause when he went with Discovery [Networks], Discovery was established.
Speaker 2: Well, it was solid, solid, but you know I talked to J.R. [HistoryMaker Johnathan Rodgers] about, well he's supposed to come out here [Los Angeles, California] in January.  When I talked to him, he said I'll be out there to see you in January and we talked about the challenges.  He said, well, we are going to have our debut on January the 17th [2004], you know, the nationwide debut, but it will not be in southern California.  I said, "What do you mean, not in southern California?  This is the number two market in the country, Jay."  He said, well, what you do is you get the word out to community people to start calling their local providers and tell them I said that why don't we open this up to TV One?  Now, I have since learned that the death knell of a lot of startups is that first two years.  And the first thing that impacts, it's a lack of adequate funding.  So I'm holding, 'cause I got my play I want to send to J.R., and I'm hoping they survive, 'cause I understand he has Tim Reid, Bob Reid--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Tim Reid.
Speaker 2: Tim Reid, who has a production company [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia] that's going to be producing for him and Tim, I respect very highly and if John survives, I'm sure I can get him to read my play and see about the possibility of doing an original drama.  But then again, you know, Comcast [Corporation], who also has BET [Black Entertainment Television] in this marketplace, and apparently they're supported very strongly.  And they don't feel as strong as to port around TV One.  You've got to open this market up to TV One.  Number one, you can't keep TV One, I don't want to do a diatribe but you can't close this market down to TV One and I told J.R. in that email, well I sense they wanna eliminate the competition from BET from this marketplace but you know there are a lot of middle class bourgeois blacks like myself, you talk to my wife [Doris Dillon Dyer], who starts preaching on that, who are fed up.  We don't watch BET because we think it's a disgrace, quite frankly.  I'm not against young music and all that kind of stuff.  I can't get my granddaughters away from it, and my daughter, but I said there is an excellent opportunity for alternatives.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Good programming, educational programming just means something.  Now the biographical sketch I got from J.R. indicates that they're gonna do just that.  They can get into quality programming.  They'll get into solid programming.  That's what they say.  Now, whether or not the father to be permits that, only time will tell.  But I'll tell you what, if he doesn't turn this thing around within a couple of years, he won't be a TV One.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I called the other day to speak to him and he's in Europe, so when he gets back, I told the young lady, have him give me a call and I'll see where we are.  So I'm hoping that it survives.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: For a lot of reasons.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well I hope so too 'cause it's really needed.
Story_ID: 202275
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about Mayor [Tom] Bradley, and how you first met him, when you first met him.  You alluded that to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And in his historic campaign and mayoral tenure--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he, he as a city council person, I first met him when he was working with the advisor, one of the advisors to a group that I became very heavily involved with called the Ragged Robins [Shoe Fund Inc.], and that was a grassroots group of women who gave shoes every year at the beginning of the school year to kids they could identify, who did not have new shoes to go to school in.  And a guy by the name of Derek [ph.], I don't know Derek's last name, but was working with Hudson Shoes.  Hudson Shoes was one of the most prominent supporters because they would provide the shoes that we gave every year at a tremendously strong discount.  And from that association with Tom, with the Ragged Robins, it carried over till he became the mayor [of Los Angeles] and eventually he ran for governor.  Now, I had gotten my tuxedo when he ran for governor the first time because the polls had him so far out over [George] Deukmejian it was just a foregone conclusion.  When I talked to Bill Elkins [William Elkins Jr.], who was his chief assistant at the time, Bill said, "Well, Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], join us in Sacramento [California]?"  I said, "Absolutely, my wife [Doris Dillon Dyer] and I are shopping now."  And when the returns started coming in, I think everybody in the community was stunned because they had done an exit polling and the polls had held up even through the exit polling that people were going to give it to Tom hands down.  But you know, you're looking at--you interview a person coming out of the exit poll and they tell you one thing but, in that booth, they can do just the opposite, as you well know and that is a classic example.  I mean, the media was stunned 'cause they had already basically got ready to project Tom the winner and Deukmejian jumped out in front.  It was not even close.  Not even close.  And we were disappointed, obviously.  Tremendous disappointed.  But Tom had his challenges down there too.  He, number one, had moments where the community didn't understand the political role he played.  He made some political steps that were misinterpreted.  When the busing crisis developed, Tom stood on the sidelines and a lot of African Americans thought he should have been more vocal, speaking out, but whatever his views were on busing, he never did.  He never did.  He said let the courts solve this and a lot of people kind of held him accountable for not speaking out.  Well, keep in mind, he was the mayor of all the people and politically if you're very astute, you realize that there are certain games you play and certain games you don't play and a lot of people expected him to be a black mayor, a mayor basically for blacks.  I mean, he made it clear, a mayor for all the people.  And I think that his not speaking out unfortunately on the busing was an attempt to send a signal, I'm going to do what I think is right.  Let the courts resolve this.  And whatever the courts decide, that's what we're going to try to enforce, which is a very politically smart thing to have done, I thought, looking back.  At the time, I even wanted him to speak out more forcefully because you had some rabble rousers really raising heck out there and you wanted him to step forward but he never did, quite frankly.  So that was really the point of the biggest challenges he had, and people watched his level of appointments, obviously.  He did pretty well, I thought.  One of the guys who helped run his campaign, and to run his office, was Bill Elkins, who's with him up until the time of his death.  Nice friend, confidant, you know, who kept him out of a lot of trouble, you know, and any time I wanted something I had a ready access to his office.  So he was good people for me.  As a matter of fact for my retirement, he was one of the first persons to show up. He couldn't stay but he showed up, and I appreciate that, quite frankly.  He was a politician.  Very easygoing, very direct, but pleasant, a different type than, what's the guy's name from Chicago [Illinois] that died?
Speaker 1: Mayor Harold Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he wasn't in your face like Harold Washington.  Harold Washington was an in your face guy and you'd better believe it, get out of my face.  I remember when Ed Bradley tried to do an ambush on him on the convention floor and apparently he had decided he was going to discuss one thing and he changed right in the middle of the conversation, decided to discuss something very controversial, and Harold just said, "Get out of my face.  Get on out of there."  I mean, I mean, I never shall forget that.  That's one of the most--and Ed was, Ed was stunned.  I mean, what can you do?  I mean, you're a reporter, you can't get into an encounter with the principal you're interviewing, not publicly anyway.  But he snapped Ed down right away, "Get out of my face."  Oh God, I said, boy, when I saw that, I said, I felt embarrassed for Ed and he's one of our premier reporters, you know, but he just, misread old man Harold Washington.  I mean, and he's a no-nonsense guy, apparently didn't take any, any stuff, you know, and he didn't that night.  He let 'em know, okay, you ambush me, I'm going to put it right back on your plate, and he did, masterfully.
Story_ID: 202276
Speaker 1: So, what do you consider the legacy of [Mayor] Tom Bradley?
Speaker 2: Well I think he's a trailblazer.  I really do.  A trailblazer in one of the country's most diverse cities, and that's saying an awful lot because in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you've got to understand something.  This is a city unlike many other cities in the United States that you're gonna try to govern, you know.  You've got the largest concentration of Filipinos here outside of Manila [Philippines].  The largest concentration of Mexicans, outside of Mexico City [Mexico].  The largest concentration of Koreans outside of Seoul [South Korea].  The largest Samoans outside of East Samoa [sic. American Samoa] and then you've got the blacks.  You've got Jewish people.  The gays.  You have quite a melting pot here and to get all these people under one umbrella and try to govern them fairly, is a work of art.  I think his legacy that he was able to do it over two terms, you follow, and that's, in being a minority himself in this diverse city, I think that's his legacy that in spite of it, his coloration, he was able to deliver and deliver in a very profound manner.
Story_ID: 202277
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the Rodney King case and its effect on L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or your perceptions about that?
Speaker 2: Well I can give you my perception.  I'm not too sure of the fact.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I have a son [Joseph Dyer, III] who's a police officer.  Obviously, anything I say is going to be suspect and I realize that because I'm very careful.  I try to understand the officer's point of view too.  I try to understand that when they chased Rodney King all over the place and the adrenaline had flowed in these police patrol cars, and they're angry and they want to get him so badly and when they finally get him stopped, and then they, how you say, the mob mentality takes in and in the frenzy they begin to get all their frustrations in and when they go overboard, not recognizing that somebody's up in the back and they're filming all that stuff but I think, number one, if sometimes we have--we lose sight of the fact that if Rodney King had stopped, it may have been a different story.  If he had stopped when they said, pull over instead of--he was running, and when you run you take your chances, quite frankly.  So, if you're going to be fair about it, it's talking about a balanced two-sided story, the question you wanted to ask, well why, if he was doing nothing wrong, when the officer said stop, as you are obliged by the law to stop, stop.  If they attack you if you stop, then you've got a very valid case.  But you were running, you had raised their adrenaline level and then when they got you, you're like your parents when they tell you to come home at ten o'clock and you got home at two o'clock in the morning, you're not helping your case at all.  In the old days, you were going to get a whipping.  And that's what King got, unfortunately.  He had a situation where most of the officers were white and you had a video camera working up there in the back and it showed all that and the more the media showed it here, the more it created a sense of disgust among the public of the police officers who were not always the most revered already and God forbid they're beating a black guy.  And to a lot of blacks, they conjured up reflections of the Old South.  If you remember I told you earlier, you come in and beat up somebody without accountability and I'm sure a lot of that came to play.  My own reaction was that, hey look, you know, it's unfortunate that they went into a feeding frenzy on this guy.  I mean, gosh, he's right on the ground, but to take that many people and that level of violence to subdue a human being that all the training comes out that you're being able to deal with that.  At least two people should be able, should have been able to deal with that, but they didn't take that many that much beating.  Now having said that, I say to (unclear), all that would not have had to come to pass if you'd oblige initially and to comply with the law.  He said, stop.  Well if they began to pounce on you at that time, then you, you know, one can justly say that you were taken advantage of.  And since that time he's had other run-ins with the law too, quite frankly.
Speaker 1: He just became a cause celebre and I think that a lot of people, you know, this is once again that California is diverse, and it's you know, not racially strife, you know, people forget.
Story_ID: 202278
Speaker 1: --I think people were, like, amazed, as they were probably amazed with the O.J. Simpson trial too.
Speaker 2: Right, right, probably, you're right on that 'cause O.J., when the ruling came down, there was a lot of reaction from the community, from all communities.  The white community thought it was a miscarriage of justice.  The black community thought it was fair.  Now, you're reacting from two different reference points, you've got to understand.  The white community say, based on all the evidence, we think the gentleman is guilty.  The black community say, in terms of racial profiling, and there's a long history of our being victimized by cops who plant evidence, cops who do everything they can to get a conviction because that's the baggage we bring from the southern states, and like I put in that book, who's to say that what happened to O.J. was not a case of racial profiling?  Who's to say that it was not evidence that was planted based on the history, quite frankly, and I try to make a case that for so many years down south, this was very much the case.  If you want to make a case, who's going to question that.  The officer said, you had drugs on you in your car, you had drugs period.  Case closed.  Move the agenda.  Well, a lot of blacks were transplanted, who were transplanted from the South had that same baggage they bring out here by saying, hey look, we've been there before, there's other cases more celebrated, of course, but we've been there before.  A lot of whites disagree with that.  They say, no, it's a miscarriage of justice.  Well, you've got, depends upon which your programming is and what your level of experience is and has been and I think that would be all that for years, quite frankly.  I don't think there's ever going to be a solution unless someone comes out with some concrete case and someone step forward and say, look I did it, it's always going to be an open case.  O.J.'s going to be indicted for the rest of his life in the minds of many, in the minds of many.
Story_ID: 202279
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite story about Ed Bradley?  Have you had much contact with him?
Speaker 2: No, the only time I really sat down with Bradley, as such, was at the NABJ, National Association of Black Journalists.  I don't know him that well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --quite frankly.  Our paths have never crossed professionally.
Speaker 1: Were you very active with NABJ?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for about twelve years I hosted the annual reception for CBS at NABJ conferences, every year.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about--
Speaker 2: That's what I meant about the man you mentioned, Jarrett--
Speaker 1: Right, [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett, right.  He's a character.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I call him the old fox, yeah.
Speaker 1: But do you have any, any comments about the NABJ as an organization or as, you know, blacks in journalism?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's a great organization.  It was similar pretty much--I don't go to the NABJ conferences anymore, there's no need, but I am involved with some of the local black journalists.  As a matter of fact, I'll be, I've been invited to come to that meeting on the twelfth of next month.  They've done one book signing for me here already and they've been very supportive.  A lot of my service is more or less as a mentor too, here in southern California, and I'm very pleased with that.  They've gone onto bigger things, bigger and better things.  When I first went to the black journalist convention some years ago to stage a reception for CBS, and I staged a reception for CBS television station, that means all the stations got together and helped pick up the tab, and I went with the president of the company, the president of NABJ, to work out the guest list and I wanted about, let's say, 1,500 people, and as always, two thousand people showed up and I always had a cost overrun which is fine.  When I first went there the first year, I expected to see a small group of people and I was overwhelmed by the fantastic numbers of very attractive, upscale, highly efficient looking, articulate, black journalists.  I was really pleasantly surprised but I was delightedly pleased.  Many of them, if not most of them, were certainly more qualified than I when I went into the media because they're better trained, they're better looking, they're very articulate, they are very much bold, keeping in mind, the environment they're coming into, an environment that I found myself thrust into which was very hostile twenty years earlier.  But as I said and listened to some of the plenary sessions and listened to people talk about their experiences, a couple of times I gave speeches back in the plenary sessions and I was impressed with the level of expertise.  I was also impressed with their knowledge of the communications, the various technologies involved.  So to make a long story, I think it's a value.  If one word can stand out on needs of young black journalists, it'd be networking, because you have to meet people who can steer you in the right direction, people like Vernon Jarrett who can give counsel, who can tell you what you need to do to stay out of trouble and what you need to try to get ahead.  And they are having more and more students attend so we were able to provide some counsel to the young kids out there about what you should do to try to get ahead in a very challenging industry to get ahead in.  If it means, excuse me, going to a smaller market, so be it.  You get yourself some experience.  Everybody can't come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] 'cause L.A. is number two.  You certainly can't get to New York [New York] easily, it's number one.  They got the pick of the litter.  They can choose from the best and they've got a lot of people walking the streets who are very good.  So why fight that kind of stuff.  He said you go to people like Podunk, Texas and you get some experience and you come back to the major metropolitan area, as a seasoned pro.  I went to Grand Forks, North Dakota and I came back and we cracked the barrier here but the idea is to get yourself some experience because people put a lot of importance on experience now, especially in the area of communication.  Where have you worked last?  And if you find the most intelligent, the reporters particularly keep their bags packed and they're all over the planet.  I took Paula Zahn around.  Paula Zahn had been all over the place, Boston [Massachusetts], Texas, Alabama.  I mean, Pam Moore, I don't know if you heard of Pam Moore or not.  Most of them have traveled.  Tony Cox, he was working with us and then he went to CNN and CNN to that, the strip show, I forgot the name of it, but they traveled, and if you're not willing to travel, it's ideal for a single person, and you don't have to worry about transporting the family all over the place but there are challenges for family people because you've got to worry about uprooting families.  They, you have no idea how long you're going to be there, you know.  None of it is forever and therein lies the greater challenge.  How long you gonna be in your new duty station, you know, and it pays a price.  I don't know what the divorce rates are but it's got to be quite interesting.
Story_ID: 202280
Speaker 1: Now you've had a long and successful career.  Do you, if you were to do it again, would you be entering the world of journalism today?
Speaker 2: I think I would because I like to write.  I like to be, like I said before, I watched a lot of news, basically CNN and the 'Nightline' broadcast, sometimes the eleven o'clock report with Channel Seven [KABC-TV, Los Angeles, California].  I'm very fascinated with news.  I'm fascinated more in what goes on, you know.  I read the editorial pages very carefully.  My wife [Doris Dillon Dyer] and I many of the time I disagree with 'em and many times I agree.  I'm very much politically savvy.  I like to find out what's going on in the world and I think most people who are journalists like to do the same thing.  What's going on, we don't have to agree with everything we read.  I'm intrigued by what's happening in Iraq and the obvious missteps I think the [President George Walker Bush] administration is making in trying to solve a miserable solution.  That to me is very exciting.  I find it very interesting.  Every day I get up in the paper and find what did we do wrong now?  What could he do to right this miserable ship we found ourselves bogged down in.  How many more lives did we lose today and that, to me, you can't live in a world, I think, and expect to be fairly knowledgeable and intelligent not knowing what goes on in the world and if you have a chance, try to make a contribution to kind of righting that ship.  But to answer your question, I think I would do the same thing.  I really would, I think I'm, what do you say, like an old police officer, once it gets in your blood, it's probably in your blood for life.  You're, even in my writings I use my expertise of a journalist to put words on a piece of paper.  I will continue to do that.
Speaker 1: Now, for the, you know, the journalism industry, you know, it's changed a lot.
Speaker 2: Considerably.
Speaker 1: And so I guess, you know, and you came along at a time when, you know, you were first, and I guess I want to address the first question first.  For those, for today, because you helped blaze the trail for a lot of people, and in some stations, things have changed--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, and then some other, you know some people say TV has changed and some people will say, well it hasn't changed enough when you look at the anchors, and how people are positioned.  But with, are you happy with the changes that you've seen with the integration of the newsroom?
Speaker 2: Well, when you consider from which I've come, I'll be happy if just two people were more than it was back in 1965.  That would recognize an element of progress.  Now having said that, most of the newsrooms right now are pretty diverse.  They may not be diverse enough in certain areas that I'd like 'em to be, and I want to say that right up front, I'd like to see more Third World anchors, quite frankly, because I think that's what the community looks like, especially here in Los Angeles [California].  They're doing pretty good with the Asian Pacifics and to some extent, with Latinos, but I still see a disappearing act in terms of African American anchors in most stations.  Now there are some exceptions.  Here at Channel Nine [KCAL-TV, Los Angeles, California], you have people like Paul Harvey, I mean, Pat Harvey, who's doing an exceptional job and you have the old Channel Seven [KABC-TV, Los Angeles, California], Marc Brown, who's doing an exceptional job and so as African Americans are concerned.  And on the weekend you have people at Channel Four [KNBC-TV, Los Angeles, California], but I don't see that happening in every station, quite frankly.  I'm talking about your network home station in terms of daily anchors--
Story_ID: 202281
Speaker 1: We have owned the weekends historically in the last two decades.  Most of the African American anchors in a lot of stations place on weekends.  Now the theory about that is that we put you on a weekend and that becomes a farm club.  We train you and move you up.  Well, in some instances, like Marc Brown, it worked.  In a lot of instances, it does not work because you get there and you get pigeonholed and they lock you in and you don't move but yes, you see other people being brought in.  Now, my, on one hand, I think it's good to have a farm system where you put 'em on a weekend and get exposed and see what their actions are going to be, what their (unclear) is going to be.  I have no problem with that.  My problem is that there is sometimes not enough quick mobility from that weekend to the day side and realizing that the day side does not have a whole helluva lot of movement, I realize that.  You don't just move anchors every day, especially if they're doing well.  The, from the South, I have a problem with the weekend from a philosophical point of view because, I put this in my book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], when I was in Louisiana, years back in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s], they had this county fair down in Franklinton, Louisiana, and the fair went from Sunday through Saturday.  Now then the whites went to the county fair Sunday through Friday, and on Saturday, that one day, that was colored folks day.  Well, the analogy's the same in the media where the big boys enjoy all the great exposure Monday, Sunday through Friday, and on the weekend, that's ghetto time and you find that throughout the country, a lot in your major cities, a lot of your black anchors are relegated to the weekends.  When I was in Channel Two [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California] years ago, I was their featured weekend reporter.  I covered sometimes four stories in one day as a field reporter.  Then I would disappear back into the job as a writer, producer, Monday through Friday and on Sunday I would resurface again as a field reporter, don't you see, unless during the week when I had to be pigeonholed, I had to be pulled out to do some general field reporting.  And today, that seems to be the powerful course whereby a lot of your African American reporters, to some extent, are being placed on the weekends.  Ostensibly, we're going to look at you, we're going to train you, we're going to move you up, and as I said before, they've been exceptions because Marc Brown did the weekend bit and did very well and he moved up and he's doing exceptionally well now as a daily anchor.  We had Hosea Sanders, who's down in Chicago [Illinois], they promised Hosea that they're gonna put him on a weekend and move him up day side.  Out of sheer frustration, Hosea left and he went back to Chicago [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  He said, hell, they made these big promises and I've been here three years and I haven't moved yet.  You see, that's the other side, you know, because another thing that happened to it because you get trapped.  The people who brought us over, Hosea Sanders in, got fired.  The people who made him the promises, no longer there, and when your team leaves, you get left without, with a new team, who didn't make you any promises.  So you stay, you follow.  And that happens all too often that they always say, if a team leaves who brought you there, you better go with them.  They will remember their promises, don't you see, but if you stay there and another team comes in, they made you no promises.  They feel nothing.  If you stay there, you stay there at their good graces unless you're very good, quite frankly, and they don't, are they going to bounce you when they make changes and that change is rampant, that's the nature of the monster.  Change, I thought, in Channel Two, we made too many changes and that general manager, every two years, we'd change new general managers.  Every two, two and a half years, we changed a news director and every news director we changed to, reconfigured the newsroom.  You know, bring a brand new set and go out and hire some new anchors.  We had a gentleman out here by the name of, he's dead now, Jerry Dunphy, who was an icon, that's the gentleman I worked with when I first came to CBS, the big news, he was the premier hour-long broadcast in this country.  They pioneered hour-long broadcasts, local station division, but Jerry was getting a little old so they figured that Jerry was too old for Channel Two so they bounced him and put him in Channel Seven [KABC-TV, Los Angeles, California].  He commenced to make Channel Seven the number one station in town, we've been struggling ever since.  I mean, so much for the elderly, you know.  'Cause we brought in a Bobby Dawes [ph.] and all these pretty people and it didn't work out.
Story_ID: 202282
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about, that your decision to write your book ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer], your memoirs.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, it was a--as I said before, they say you don't retire from something, you retire into something and my memoirs seemed like a good place to start my writing career after CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California] because it would capsulate, it capsulizes my entire life and it also indicates the closeness that my mother [Barbara Parker Brooks] and I had and is a tribute to her.  It's my life.  If I never write, or wrote anything else, I said to myself, I want to be sure that the records reflect that my life is down in print for everybody to see and hopefully somewhere along the way it can be a bit of an inspiration to somebody, it can motivate other people to realize you can do it in spite of the odds, and that happened, and the book has been successfully received and I said today I'm going to take my time, I'm going to get as many of those things as I can that reflect believability.  If you believe you can, and in keeping with the theme with the old memoir, it's just that it's nothing more than a rendezvous between preparation and opportunity.  And I try to demonstrate this throughout the chapter after chapter that if you, like Dr. Clark [ph.] said, you build, if you can't get the opportunity to build your own, one rung at a time, and I use it as building a stepladder, and every time I achieve the success, meaning I'm beginning to rise up, I said, my God, I got another rung built, and I have another one to build and that's how I predicated my whole life.  But along the way, I also admitted very readily that I had some help along the way, 'cause somebody kept positioning me to take advantage of opportunities when they came, and I've never forgotten that.  And I don't want to say, it's the good Lord, I don't think I deserve that kind of special treatment, but somebody certainly was positioning me to be there at the right time, at the right place, at the right moment to benefit from a decision that benefitted me.

Speaker 1: Now, when you look at the black community, 'cause, you know, you came from a segregated environment--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at a segregated time in our country and you were a trailblazer in a field, but when you look at our community in the last, I mean, from the time you came of age until now, what hopes and concerns do you have about the African American community--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --for its future?
Speaker 2: One of the, excuse me, engrossing concerns that I have is that unless we develop a strong leadership base, we're destroying ourselves as a community.  Our infrastructure is going to break down because of us.  Let me be more specific.  On any given day, I can pick up the paper and realize that there's been another gang shooting, that black-on-black crime is proliferating some of our inner city neighborhoods, that the introduction of drugs is waylaying too many of our young kids who potentially could go on to great things, that the accessibility of drugs on any given street corner, it's much too readily.  Now, I can go on down the list and one may question sometimes if the school system is as challenging as it should be.  I also wondered sometimes about parental control that the young kids don't have in many, in too many instances, you know, urban environment.  There does not seem to be that same level of respect for the teachers and I use that to say that when I was coming up that the teachers could discipline you as much as mom and dad could, and you respected that and when I was coming up, 'cause we had corporal punishment too, I mean, they'd take you to the principal's office, they can use the strap.  Well, you do that in New York [New York], Los Angeles [California], in Chicago [Illinois] and Detroit [Michigan], you've got a lawsuit on your hand.  If your mother and father thought you were doing, or being unruly in school, you had to answer to them and usually there was nothing democratic about their answers.  You were guilty.  And the minute the teacher say you did something wrong in school, they would administer you.  You had the neighbors who were surrogate parents too, they would chastise you when you did wrong.  I see there's a bit of permissiveness in our community, the black community in particular, that we had better be concerned about, that's getting to be very blatant.  As someone said in Los Angeles, it's because we don't have enough law enforcement officers out there.  Well let's deal with law enforcement, then, let's bring the resources to see that they can walk the streets at night.  I was, I had my little pouch snatched right on my lawn, gettin' out the car.  Fortunately, I had already been to the bank.  This is in the broad of daytime, three o'clock in the afternoon.  The guys walked up and snatched my pouch and said thank you and ran.  Well, that's the, that's the wild, wild west.  Now in the same token, I don't see that strong cohesive leadership that's required to really galvanize the community to the extent that we say, let's turn this stuff around.  There's a reason that we have a lot of gang activities.  There's a reason we have a lot of crime in the streets over here and let's deal with those reasons.  Like John [Allen] Buggs was saying years ago, they're festering and simmering concerns that we better start addressing.  There are some senior citizens that are carrying guns at night because they fear being pounced upon by young Turks who are roaming the streets at night thinking that the old senior citizens an easy prey.  That's unhealthy.  There's certainly too many people out there out of work.  We need to begin to look at our infrastructure and begin to develop some industrial bases. I don't mean welfare, I mean developing jobs for people to go to.  We hear politicians talking about, hey, job training programs, that's good rhetoric but the reality that where are the companies that you could put in these communities that are not being outsourced to the foreign nations, for cheap labor, to the exclusion of our local communities.  Now, the night after that, I listened to a broadcast and I'm seeing more companies are sending work overseas, passing right by people unemployed in these communities who desperately need money.  So if you, and specifically the minority community who need it most, I would think.  Any community needs you but the minority community who has been disenfranchised economically for so long, they really critically need those jobs to stay here as much as possible to turn those communities around.  Now, unless someone begins to address those kinds of problems, and seriously address those kinds of problems, dealing with the political things that says, stop the job from being outsourced, bring those jobs to some urban environments who critically need them and bring the work force where you can begin to support yourself.  Give the people a reason to stay away from drugs, the corners and to selling drugs.  Give people a reason to want to say, "Look, I want to be a responsible, productive citizen of my community."
Story_ID: 202284
Speaker 1: Now the government has to take some responsibility, but then again, there are some parental responsibilities that must be shared too.  If a guy brings a bag of groceries home at night who doesn't have a job, and you don't question him, you just as guilty as that child 'cause you realize you're climbing for somebody's door, whose door he shouldn't have climbed through and if you have a child go out into midnight hours and you don't know where that child is and what sort of friendship that child is developing, you're as guilty as that child.  There's no parental control over there.  I think unless these things begin to be addressed, and addressed very forthrightly, directly, I fear that the generations ahead are going to be very, very hard-pressed to survive.  Now in the black community, especially in Los Angeles [California], there's another problem that we're having here.  This community, demographically, is being changed.  You have an awful lot of the Third World people coming in here who are impacting these resources in the community, the meager resources in the community.  On the one hand, you have the Latinos coming in building up mom and pop operations and they're doing very well.  They are being, moving into areas that are formerly basically 90 percent black that they're now about sixty/forty Latino.  Martin Luther King Hospital [Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center; Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center, Los Angeles, California] is a good example.  It used to be a basically a black hospital, now it's about sixty/forty Latino, and they've had problems down there.  And with this, demographics are changing the landscape of this community over here.  That has to be dealt with too.  So in figuring your industrial base, you've got to make allowances for the bilingual citizens in our midst to accommodate this.  It just can't be accommodating blacks to the exclusion of the new immigrant who's coming in here and that's something that's why I say, you need new and powerful leadership that apparently, it's not casting aspersions against anyone, that we don't have right now.  When you deal with these kind of issues, they're very fundamental, but they can result in a lot of damage in the streets because L.A.'s taking in thousands of people every month, as you well know, because the climate and the system that they're dragging, coming to the West Coast.  We've got to deal with that.  If we don't, believe, you try getting on our freeways at three o'clock or 3:30 in the afternoon and try to go two or three miles in one of our busy freeways, you take, you can bring a sandwich with you.  It's horrendous.  When I first came to L.A., we'd go for a Sunday afternoon drive.  I used to enjoy it.  You don't dare go to a Sunday afternoon drive, you go on Sunday afternoon trips 'cause by the time you get to weaving in and out of traffic, it can be an ordeal.  And going to our sporting events like the games and all that kind of stuff, parking is a very dreadful problem here in southern California.  So all these are adding into our quality of life that has become, as I said, severely compromised in recent years.  There's a lot of undocumented people here that are not accounted for in the census.  Now the problem with that is that when, if city fathers get ready to prepare their budget, they prepare their budgets along the lines of people that are documented.  You can't account for the people undocumented, that impacts on your response time for police, the fire and all that kind of stuff because it can be longer because you've got more people that you hadn't figured on nearby you.  So we have a quite a few challenges here in Los Angeles, in southern California, and it's growing, but the biggest problem right now, I think, is the fact that crime has got to be top of that list over there, followed very closely about unemployment, economy and the, I just listened to today that the economic opportunities organization is reported to grant approval for companies to reduce or eliminate the benefits to retired employees.  That's very dangerous, very dangerous because if you lose that middle gap, a lot of people will be paying more for that percentage that Medicare doesn't pay.  If you don't have a job, that can be disastrous.  That can be very disastrous.  I'm sure AARP [Inc.] is going to have a lot to say about that and I'm sure that's going to become a campaign issue, I'd like to know, hell, I'd vote for [President George Walker] Bush in a minute, in a heartbeat, if he stands up and says, I am against cutting back on the Medicare, the benefits for retirees.  That to me would be significant especially when you come out of a quadruple [bypass] and you're eighty thousand dollars in health.  If I had to pay 20 percent of that, that's a major bill for me during a retired state, you know, so these life, these are bread and butter issues, and life and death issues, are in the community are something we've got to deal with.  Now as far as the future's concerned, I think, I don't see very strong leadership yet emerging in Los Angeles City, yet, and I hope that, it, that does resurface, quite frankly.  I look at the news and I see a lot of contracts being awarded with allegations of kickbacks and that kinds of stuff.  Why, hell, if you've got that kind of stuff going on from the federal government to here, and your poor citizens in the middle, specifically, the middle class, is the middle suffering, all that's creating a climate that certainly compromises the quality of life in the city.  And I have kids who, grandkids that come walking through this kind of stuff, and I'm concerned about that, their plight, long after I'm gone.  This is the life that they're looking forward to, and it's not very pleasant.
Story_ID: 202285
Speaker 1: Now what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, there's probably, there's a legacy, I think, that like someone said the night that they had the retirement, and then fortunately when you read that tape, that I let you take with you, I think I said it best that when you consider the organizations that I've tried to help throughout the years, there is one that tried to, tried to help somebody and I think that, I don't want to sound overly noble but that's something that was given birth from my--affected from my mother [Barbara Parker Brooks] who was a disabled person.  So the persons who are handicapped and certainly played a very important role in my psyche.  I remember something [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] said when they said to--they played it at his funeral, he said, "When I die, you don't have to tell people about all the great books I've written, they're good but that's not important."  He said, "You don't even have to tell people that I won a Nobel Peace Prize."  He said, "That's good but it's not all that important."  He said, "You don't have to tell people all the degrees I have, that's good, but that's not very important."  He said, "If you have to say anything about Martin Luther King, just tell them that I tried to help somebody, that I tried to do God's will, that I tried to visit the sick and the shut-in and tried to serve humankind."  And I would paraphrase that by saying that's something that I would like to leave as a legacy and I'm very pleased when people see my kids, they come up to them and say, your father helped me get a job over here years ago.  Your father wrote this letter on my behalf years ago and I'm hearing this all over the place.  Karen [Dyer] would come back and say, I met this young lady who said you helped her get a job.  I don't even remember the young lady that she's talking about.  Some man came up in a book signing and said, I just want to thank you for helping my daughter years ago.  I don't even remember the daughter.  But the fact is that they perceived that there was help and I feel gratified by that.  That you take to the grave with you.  You may not take as much money as you want to the grave but you take that which is what I do to help somebody.  I didn't screw anybody, that's for sure.  So I think if there's a legacy it's the fact that hopefully my life has been somewhat of a bit of an inspiration to somebody who says that I'm behind the eight ball, I don't think I can make it and look at old Dyer's [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer] life over there and he did it in spite of himself, in spite of the difficulties that he could make it, a hard hearing mother, welfare, poverty stricken, cotton fields and he ended up with CBS [KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, California].  Fifty years ago I was in the cotton fields working alongside of a hearing-impaired mother, uneducated.  Fifty years later, I'm being interviewed by an organization called [The] HistoryMakers.  That to me is a statement within itself.  I feel very pleased with that.
Story_ID: 202286
Speaker 1: --This is yours truly, Joe Dyer [HistoryMaker Joseph Dyer], at the debut of my memoir ['A Retired Black Television Broadcaster's Lifetime of Memories: From the Cotton Fields to CBS', Joseph Dyer] in July, 2002.
Speaker 2: Perfect. Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: These are some of the persons who had attended the kickoff to my memoir book signing.  Ironically, these are all CBS [KCBS-TV, Channel Two, Los Angeles, California] people, all of whom I had utilized my expertise to have them be a protege of me.  I helped every one of these people you see here.  That's why they showed up for the book signing.  All former CBS employees.
Speaker 2: Great, okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is a promotional photograph, yours truly, Joe Dyer.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: This is taken about ten years ago.  Just--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This photograph was taken in Palm Springs [California] during a reception for the Mexican American Grocers Association in which former President [Ronald Wilson] Reagan was the guest of honor.  The photograph underneath that is my son, Joey [Joseph Dyer, III], which is the youngest child.  He's a police officer in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: You know what, let's get this shot of Joey.  Vintage, what date would you give us for this one?
Speaker 1: Okay, this is, I would think, around 1993.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, next photo.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a session with a noted performer Jon Hendricks.  They're getting ready to do a shoot for the (unclear) story.  The young lady in the center is Erica Gerard [ph.] who was the associate producer on the broadcast.  This was done at El Camino College [Torrance, California].  We were down there that evening to film an interview with Ella Fitzgerald.
Speaker 2: Okay, you want to go left to right?
Speaker 1: Okay, Jon Hendricks is on the right side over here, of course, the young lady in the center is Erica Gerard, and yours truly, Joseph Dyer's on the left.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of yours truly, back in 1959 in [Happy Valley-]Goose Bay Labrador [Canada at Canadian Forces Base Goose Base] with members of the persons I work with while on isolated duty with the [U.S.] Air Force up in the mountains.
Speaker 2: Hang on one second.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is, this was taken in Washington, D.C.  At the time, my oldest child, Monica [Dyer], graduated from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  As a matter of fact, it's right after the graduation and I'm over trying to congratulate her.  That was, indeed, a very proud moment in my life.  This was about 19--it's about ten years ago now.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was an event at the old Cocoanut Grove [Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California]. That was a fundraiser for the sickle cell disease research foundation to raise money for that organization's public awareness campaign.  And immediately to the right was the late Redd Foxx, the gentleman to Redd's left would be Joe Adams, the manager of Ray Charles, and to Joe's left would be Bill Cosby, and yours truly to the extreme right.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you give a year on this?
Speaker 1: That was about twenty years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll try to give you a year.  This is in the backyard of my mother's [Barbara Parker Brooks] home in Bogalusa, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Can you spell Bogalusa?
Speaker 1: Bogalusa, B-O-G-A-L-U-S-A, and it's in the summertime and this is about 1975 and the young man in the chair is my late stepfather, Edward Parker, and my dear mother's to my immediate right.  Her name is Barbara, at the time, Barbara Parker.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was a reading we did during the Lenten season about ten years ago at Wilshire United Methodist Church [Los Angeles, California].  They wanted families to do these special liturgical reading that morning and I'm on the extreme right, my son, Joey, is to my immediate right and to his right is my granddaughter Melanie [ph.], and to her right is my wife, Doris [Dillon Dyer].  This was at the United Methodist Church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was my wife and I on a cruise to Freeport [Bahamas] doing an attendance at the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].  That was one of our leisure time activities.  Just about a turnaround trip to Freeport in the Bahamas.  I would guess this is about twenty years ago now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A tribute to yours truly which ended up being, it was a special community tribute to Joseph Dyer but ended up being my retirement because a year later I retired.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Photograph.  I have no idea when this was taken.  I just know at least thirty years ago and I have no idea where we were but I know we enjoyed ourselves.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: And this is one of the photographs that I'm particularly proud of because I was about ready to cross the burning sands and become a fraternity man for Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.  This was taken on the campus of Grambling College [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] in 1958 and I don't know everybody's name but reading from left to right, I know you've got Bob Holmes [ph.], Emmanuel Burk, and you have--
Speaker 2: Is Burk spelled with an E?
Speaker 1: B-U-R-K, without an E.  And you've got Eugene--who's this, that's yours truly, I'm sorry, and you've got Milton--
Speaker 2: Joe Dyer.
Speaker 1: Joe Dyer, and you have a gentleman by the name of Milton, Eugene Milton and you've got the Turner brothers [ph.].  I don't recall their first name.  I just know both of them are brothers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At which retired, the retired local Los Angeles County supervisor, Kenneth Hahn, was in attendance and we were congratulating him.  As a matter of fact, he and I go back quite a, went back quite a few years.  His son, James Hahn, Jr. [sic. James Hahn] is now the mayor of the City of Los Angeles.  He is known and revered as one of the kingmakers here in Los Angeles for years, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.  Extremely helpful, very supportive of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Date and spelling of Hahn?
Speaker 1: Hahn, H-A-H-N.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was probably around 1974.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In Bogalusa--
Speaker 2: Sorry, can you begin again.  I was in pre--
Speaker 1: Okay, sorry.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Joseph Dyer when he was a Boy Scout in Bogalusa, Louisiana and the year had to be around 1947, '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Spell Bogalusa again.
Speaker 1: Hum?
Speaker 2: Spell Bogalusa.
Speaker 1: Bogalusa, Louisiana.  That's B-O-G-A-L-U-S-A.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: What's the date down there?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-three [1993], February 28th.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a picture of Joseph Dyer running the Chinatown 10K run in 1993.  That's one of the most brutal runs here in the City of Los Angeles 'cause it's basically all uphill and very, very challenging, indeed.  Nineteen ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a meeting of the Festival in Black committee.  The Festival in Black was an African American festival held every year, sponsored by the Los Angeles County--city of parks and--Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department and I was chairing up the effort to, I think my third year.  This is about 1971.  I did it for about three years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Walk for Health rallies be held in concert with the United High Blood Pressure [Foundation] public awareness campaign that myself, Joseph Dyer, and Dr. James Mays, a cardiologist, headed up.  As a matter of fact, we formed an organization called the United High Blood Pressure Foundation to help draw money for the campaign against high blood pressure.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Mays?
Speaker 1: Mays, M-A-Y-S.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: There's a shot of the second telethon that United High Blood Pressure Foundation did that a local station at KTLA [Los Angeles, California] to raise money for the public awareness campaign and the honorary chairperson for that foundation at the time was former heavyweight champion, then heavyweight champion, Ken Norton, in the middle, and on Ken's right is Ms. Marriane Cortina, a very good and personal friend of the late Louis Armstrong.
Speaker 2: Can you spell her name?
Speaker 1: Marriane Cortina, that's Cortina.  Marriane, M-A-R-R-I-A-N-E, Cortina, C-O-R-T-I-N-A and the lady on Ken's left is Gertrude Gipson [Penland], the late Gertrude Gipson.  G-E-R-T-R-U-D-E, G-I-P-S-O-N.  For years, she's society and entertainment editor for the Los Angeles Sentinel, S-E-N-T-I-N-E-L.
Speaker 2: From the time at Channel Two as community affairs director and I do believe this is one that plot the Minnie Riperton Cancer Action Run.  All the guests at this time hadn't shown up.  This is about 1985.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About 19--mid-'70s [1970s], where the Los Angeles City Council awarded the United High Blood Pressure Foundation a citation for its work in helping to educate the public.  The gentleman reading is former city councilman, Dave Cunningham [David S. Cunningham, Jr.].  The gentleman to Dave's extreme right is Dr. James Mays, the co-founder of the United High Blood Pressure Foundation, a cardiologist, and to Dr. Mays' left is Frank Eulis, E-U-L-I-S, who was at the time was our executive director and I, Joseph Dyer, am on the extreme right.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Oh, in 19--mid-1970s, we started campaigning, early '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: --year, but this was the annual angel tree that I was involved in for a number of years whereby we set up in one of the May Company [California, Los Angeles, California] stores and we asked people to come back and take a name off the tree and each name is from a child requesting a specific gift, and day before Christmas, you bring a gift back and put it up on the tree and we make deliveries to the child on Christmas night, Christmas Eve night.
