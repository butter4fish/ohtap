Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Bertrand Henry Miles.  That's B-E-R-T-R-A-N-D, Henry, H-E-N-R-Y, Miles, M-I-L-E-S.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 17, 1928 on Lake Mary in Wilkinson County, Mississippi.  That's about fifteen miles above Fort Adams [Mississippi].  I usually, for clarification, I usually say, Fort Adams so if somebody can't find it on a map.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were born September 17th, 1928.  You're Bertrand Henry Miles--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm saying that for your tape (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, good.
Speaker 1: All right, good.  And you were born near Fort Adams, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, first, I should say I was born on a houseboat.  My father [Henry Miles] was a fisherman and my mother [Irma Mazique Miles] was a housewife.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  Well, I'm just trying to establish who you are right now and we'll ask the questions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: So, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm retired photographer--I'm a still photographer and cinematographer.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: September 13, 2004.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In my apartment, 788 Columbus Avenue, Apartment 11N, New York City [New York, New York] 102--10025.
Story_ID: 227887
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that they always make me ask everybody, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Haagen-Dazs ice cream.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I guess spring.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: An ordinary mortgage just won't do.  Community interests versus property rights, and that comes into--brings into play, condemnation and eminent domain.
Story_ID: 227888
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family, and your father's [Henry Miles] side of the family, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Irma Mazi-, Agust Mazique, Irma, I-R-M-A, Agust, A-G-U-S-T, Mazique, M-A-Z-I-Q-U-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Mother was August 29th, 1906.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Artonish, Mississippi.  That's above Fort Adams [Mississippi], A-R-T-O-N-I-S-H, Mississippi, and that's in Wilkinson County [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right on the Mississippi River.
Speaker 1: All right.  They call that the Delta region?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: No, it's not?
Speaker 2: --this is, this is about as far south of the Mississippi you can go.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace your ancestors on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got a quilt back there that's falling apart that's got about five or six, seven layers in it that goes back to slavery.  That was given to my grandmother from my great-grandmother, and then it was passed down to my mother.  And then, when I came to New York, my mother changed the backing on it and gave it to me.  I slept on it for many years.  Now, it's falling apart and I just keep it.  My mother's side of the family was a very famous family in, black family in Mississippi--the Maziques.  We were some of the first doctors to come out of Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And actually, three brothers and a mother came here from island of Martinique.  I don't know what year as slaves, and was sold into slavery.  And one brother went to Arkansas, and the other one to Mississippi, and the other one, we don't know what happened to him or the, the mother.  But the one in Arkansas and the one in Mississippi continued the family.  There are two Mazique doctors in, in, somewhere in Texas now.  Go ahead, what was--
Speaker 1: Well, about when did these ancestors come over from Martinique?  Do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was before the Civil War--say, I would guess, say, 1850, somewhere in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, and the next generation went to medical school as you're saying after they, the steps or--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know about the next generation but--
Speaker 1: --or at least one of the first generations of black doctors were Maziques.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How many attended medical school, do you know?
Speaker 2: At least four, I think, five, four or five.  And a couple of different generations, like my cousin, [Edward] Ed Mazique, who died a few years ago in Washington, D.C., he has two sons that are doctors.  And he had a brother who's a doctor, and another brother who's a pharmacist.  So that was the, the doctors in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any family lore or any family stories about why they came over here from Martinique?  Were they brought over during slavery or--
Speaker 2: Just brought over during slavery and sold.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 227889
Speaker 1: There's another interesting point.  The, the Broadway play, the--what is it--about the boat, the River Clean [sic. Cotton Blossom] on the Natchez [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: 'Show Boat'?
Speaker 1: 'Show Boat.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The, the woman who plays the kitchen helper [Queenie] and Julie [La Verne]--I think was her name in the play.  It, they could have written this play about my great-grandmother.  She was owned by a family in Natchez, Mississippi--the Metcalfes [ph.].  I called that family earlier this year trying to seek some information.  And one of the elders that I talked to say she had given all that information to the University of Jackson [sic. Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi].  And I was trying to get some information about the--put, put the family tree together.  But this play, the 'Show Boat,' could have been about my great-grandmother whose name was Maggie [ph.].  Another interesting point there, she married a man by the name of Riley [ph.] Washington.  Now how did this black boy get the name, Riley Washington?  His mother came here now.  You remember, like the part that you heard in 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family'] with--Alex Haley had heard the family talking about things for so many years--constitute theirs and so forth?  Well, I had heard for years, since I was a kid, that this mother came here from Ghana, and gave birth in the courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina.  And they named the boy, Riley Washington, after old [President] George [Washington].  Old George was the old first president, you know (laughter)--oh, gee, our, our first president.
Speaker 2: She had the baby on the steps of the courthouse in--
Speaker 1: No, inside.
Speaker 2: Inside the courthouse in--
Speaker 1: They took, took her inside the courthouse.
Speaker 2: In where at, where at?
Speaker 1: Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: In Raleigh, North Carolina, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he was very dark-skinned.  My great-grandmother, I, I hate to use the phrase, but I have to.  She was--oh, you can cut this out if you like.  She was considered a house nigger.  She was white, black, damn near white, because she was followed by one of the members of that family.  And she was not the first one of the generation.  She was probably the second or third person that it had happened to in that family.  He would take her to town, and go around and get off the buggy, and go around the side to help her down.  And some old cracker man be sitting on the side--excuse my language--would, would be saying, what that nigger doing with his hand on that white woman?  And another one would talk or would be--oh, that's Metcalfe's old bastard daughter.  And, you know, these things agonize me to, to how people talked, how they, they, categoric--they put you in, in a box.  And, well, we've grown a lot from that.  There's a lot of hatred still in the world, but that's what it was back then, you know, so, so be it.
Story_ID: 227890
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Irma Mazique Miles] talk about growing up?  I mean how--did she tell stories about growing up, and do you know anything about--
Speaker 2: Not, not too much.  She had two sisters and a brother.  Now, they grew up in, down in, in Mississippi.  But another answer to part of my family started in 1923.  My grandfather's sister, named Katie [ph.], got tired of Mississippi, and she moved to St. Louis [Missouri].  And she didn't stay there very long 'cause she said she didn't like the white folks.  She moved to Chicago [Illinois].  She got her a job as a lady attendant in the ladies' room at the Illinois Central Railroad at 12th [Street; Roosevelt Road] and Michigan Avenue.  And she worked there for many, many years.  And she, she married a man called Tom [ph.], or we call him Uncle Tom, but he was no Uncle Tom.  That, just Tom just had to be in, in front of that uncle.  And my cousin and I always liked to visit them, you know, and she would dress so fancy and great.  She, in 1927, she imported the entire family, except my mother, to Chicago.  That included my grandfather; my grandmother; two aunts and one son; one of the aunts; and the brother; and another uncle; and two sisters.  So, let's see, that's the two sisters; their brother is three; these are my grandmother's sisters; and then my grandmother's two daughters, that's four; grandmother's son is five; the brother is six; and they, the other one is seven.  I think that adds up to seven people.  And my mother just married my father [Henry Miles], so she stayed in Mississippi.  That was 1927.  And I had pictures here some place of my mother and father when they got married in 1927.  Hope I can find them for you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I think I know where they are.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they stayed there in Mississippi.  She stayed there with her husband and--
Speaker 2: 'Til 1945--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they separated.  And mother moved to Chicago.  And that was a trying time 'cause I had lived away from my parents, basically nine months a year, from the time I was six years old to now.  I'm--what is that--1945, I'm a good fifteen years old then.  So I had a little problem connecting with my mother.  That took a little time, but we, we made it.  I was never the bad kid.  I had never got into any trouble.  I was never arrested.  I just think I was smarter than most kids and to figure out the best way to go.  And they used to doing things--not to do.  And I still was kinda working that, that direction.
Speaker 1: Can--now, did your mother have a chance to go to school in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Mother didn't have very much education.  She was sorta taught by her mother.  Now, my mother, my grandmother and my grandfather went to Alcorn [Agricultural and Mechanical] College [Alcorn State University, Alcorn, Mississippi] in, above Natchez, Mississippi.  This--that college is still there.  I have a niece that just finished there a couple of years ago.  While mother was in Chicago, the year she went back to school, and I think she, I think she finished either grade school or high school, one or the other, but she improved herself.  But the thing was--this is, this is a funny bit.  I was boarded out over the years, and when I was six, with two old ladies in Woodville, Mississippi, Frances Howe [ph.] and Carrie Battle [ph.].  I'll show you their pictures.  They had a huge house that was just a couple of blocks from, from the courthouse there in Woodville.  And I don't--cannot remember upstairs.  I don't think I ever went upstairs.  And the back left corner of the house was my room.  I ate on linen tablecloths every day, and with proper table manners.  I was taught proper table manners on that houseboat before I left there to go to Woodville, and it was enhanced in Woodville.
Story_ID: 227891
Speaker 1: So, you lived on a houseboat, you said?
Speaker 2: I was born on a houseboat.
Speaker 1: Born--okay, you didn't tell us that at the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I did.
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I say you were born near, but I didn't think--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was born on a houseboat--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on, on Lake Mary.  It's also called river.  That's in Wilkinson County, Mississippi.  And my father [Henry Miles] had the rights to fish that lake for--I guess, thirty years--the only person.  And he would--has a seine, had a seine he would use, and from about September to some, for about four or five months of the year.  And he caught, as many, as many as nothing to 60,000 pounds of fish in one haul.  A haul mean put the seine out and pull it in.  And I wasn't there for that 60,000 pounds.  I wish I had been.  I have some pictures around here some place of him doing that.  The--my father at--one day, the houseboat was tied up on the Mississippi River.  And he heard somebody--a distress call.  And he got his field glasses out and looked, and he saw two men in the water above their knees.  And he got in his boat, went over and got them, and brought them to the house.  Mother [Irma Mazique Miles] gave them some of daddy's clothes.  And she rinsed those, their clothes out, and hung them up to dry, and the heat just--the, the iron stove, we had on the houseboat.  Turned out to be two doctors from Centreville, Mississippi, and that's about another twenty, twenty-five miles east of Woodville [Mississippi].  And they called the Field brothers [Richard Jennings Field and Samuel Field].  They owned, they still own the hospital [Field Hospital and Clinic; Field Memorial Community Hospital, Centreville, Mississippi] there to this day, and they were the second generation.  I think the third generation are the doctors there now.  And I used to go hunting with the third, the third generation.  And that's the hospital my father, unfortunately, died in.  And where was I?
Speaker 1: You were talking about the two doctors that were rescued.
Speaker 2: Oh, at--I--we were given free medical care for many, many years--the whole time I was there.
Speaker 1: These are two white doctors?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 227892
Speaker 1: Another thing I want to tell you about--there was this school up on a hill with red clay, and I don't remember the name of the school.  But one day, I heard this, it was right after Christmas.  And this kid was talking about Santa Claus.  So I said to this girl, "Your mother and father are your Santa Claus."  The teacher heard me.  He snatched me and whipped my behind.  And it broke buttons--I had these blue pants with white pearl buttons and a white shirt.  I went around the rest of the day holding my pants up.  When I got home with these two old ladies, Frances Howe [ph.] and Carrie Battle [ph.]--Frances, I told her what happened.  Frances Howe whipped my behind again, so that's two whippings.  Come Saturday, mother [Irma Mazique Miles] comes.  Frances Howe is telling the story, and I'm standing on the side listening.  Mother is sitting there with her head down, and I could see her puffing up, you know.  So I, here's where I think I first learned to speak up for myself when I said, "Ma, didn't I see cousin Wilson passing the Christmas presents in the kitchen window Christmas Eve?"  And mother, all the air went out of mother--you didn't, I didn't hear the fizz like you hear the balloon, but I see the body relaxed.  And I say, "See there, I told you, you whipped me for nothing."  When I got back to school that Monday, at a proper time, I said to the teacher, "My mother and father [Henry Miles] said that they are my Santa Claus.  And my daddy carries a pistol, and if he--you touch me again, he will come up here and shoot you."  Daddy didn't know nothing about this.  I made it up, but I got over, you know.  And right down the hill was a church called Evergreen Baptist Church [sic. Woodville Baptist Church, Woodville, Mississippi].  It's still there today, right next to the [Evergreen] Cemetery in Woodville, Mississippi.  When I was about seven, eight years old, they put me in a girl's dress for a church play.  That was one of the two things that made me and the church separate.  The other thing, in 1939, a guy named Roger [ph.]--I don't remember his last name--had a brand new house, wood floors, and a restaurant, barber shop, beauty shop, with a white and black side of the restaurant.  He'd gotten in an altercation with a white man, and had to leave town.  He wanted to give the restaurant to my father.  My mother had already been helping his grandmother to cook on the weekends.  My mother was the chef-cook.  Daddy was a deacon in a church in Deer Park [Mississippi].  It's on Lake Mary.  They--I doubt, I doubt if they had two dozen members.  But they didn't want Henry to own this restaurant because he would be selling beer, and that was a sin.  But here's where I begin to kind of put church and so forth together because just about every person in that church had drank some whiskey in my house.  Daddy always had some whiskey.  I, I'm still not a big drinker.  It was always there, you know, I grew up with it.  I would go hunting or fishing with my daddy.  I'd come home.  My mother would smell whiskey on my breath, and daddy would say, "How much can that boy drink?"  But I just had to put the bottle up to my mouth--being, I tried to be a man like my daddy.  I idolized my father.  But that, that's kinda--I mean, how these, these same things happen, but the--with the church.  And that, that was 1939.  Daddy eventually owned a juke.  You know what a juke is?
Speaker 2: Like--
Speaker 1: It's a blues nightclub. In Crosby, Mississippi.  That's about thirty miles, twenty miles or so from Woodville, east of Woodville.  And I went down there in 1950, and spent a year helping him to run that place.  And it's one of the best things I think I've ever done was to go back and spend this time with my father.  And we, we really clicked.  I, in fact, I always got along with my mother and father.  I never had any problems out of them, they never had any problems out of me.
Story_ID: 227893
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit and try to put some chronology on this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what--give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Henry Miles.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And his father's name was Henry Miles, who I can just remember his dead--visual, visualizing his dead body before his burial.  I--that's the only thing I can remember--my, my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when was your father born and where?
Speaker 2: My father was born on Lake Mary [Mississippi], March 1st, 1895.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On Lake Mary and--
Speaker 2: That's also called Old, Old River.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not very much, no.  My father's mother's name was--my father had a sister named Eliza [ph.].  And his, his mother's name was Josie [ph.].  That's the only thing I know about my father's side.  He had, had a nephew that just died at about eighty-five or so, about a month ago.  I called him several times the last few months on the phone trying to find out more information about the family.  He just didn't know, or didn't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what is--so, did your father--well, he grew up there, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did he have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Never talked much, dad didn't talk much.  It's like the commercial--when he talked, people listened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he, he's--I'm, I'm the chatterbox of the, the family.
Speaker 1: So, what, so he used, you named several things he did--had a juke joint once.  And he was, he fished, Lake St. Mary's and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and hunted and--
Speaker 2: No, Lake, Lake Mary.
Speaker 1: Lake Mary, I'm sorry, Lake Mary, right.  And, I'm thinking about the one in Ohio (laughter), the wrong one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 227894
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Irma Mazique Miles and Henry Miles] meet?  Is there a story?
Speaker 2: Well, there's not many people down there--it's Artonish [Mississippi].  Next little community is called Loch Leven [Mississippi].  And then, there around over that side was Deer Park [Mississippi].  And you go back this way was Fort Adams [Mississippi].  So, it was a small community.  Everybody knew everybody, and daddy knew of these sisters.  And somehow, he, he introduced himself, and he picked a woman, as I teased him.  But I say, "Dad, how come you pick momma?"  Dana [ph.] was funny and a great sense of humor--that's my mother's oldest sister.  Her youngest sister, Anna [ph.], she is pretty and she had that long black straight hair like her mother down to her back.  I said, "How come you pick mother?"  And, and he didn't say anything.  I said, "I know, 'cause momma was a high yeller."  "Get away from me, boy" (laughter).  But how, whatever, I don't know.  It's just my way of teasing my father, yeah.  It was his, his choice, and I think he made a good choice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, they, they didn't stay married though, right?
Speaker 2: They stayed married from 1928 to 1945.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, 'cause you said your mother was married, but I didn't think it was to your father--the way you said it.  I mean, I just, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she married, she married my father when she was twenty-one years old.
Speaker 1: So, they, all right, okay.  And then, they split up in 1945.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 227895
Speaker 1: So, when they [Miles' parents, Irma Mazique Miles and Henry Miles] split up, did you--now, did--where were you?
Speaker 2: I was in Chicago [Illinois], Chicago already.
Speaker 1: All right, with, with your mother's relatives?
Speaker 2: With my mother's family, her sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did, so you went back and forth between Mississippi and Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's when I--I first went to Chicago in September 1939.  My aunt came down to Mississippi.  And I was tending one of my dad's boats out in the, at the edge of the Mississippi River.  And she said, "Boy, come in, take the--get some mud between--off, off, between your toes."  And it's a way of teasing me.  She had had a guy to drive her down in a brand new 1939 green LaSalle with double pumps on the side.  Oh, what a beautiful car.  I'd love to own one today, you know.  I'm a--visualize being a car collector 'cause I know a lot about antique cars.  But she took me back to Chicago.  That was September 1939.  In December, '39 [1939], my grandmother died.  So I finished school that year.  Now they're worried about me being home alone for a few hours in the afternoon, and I had to go back to Mississippi.
Story_ID: 227896
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, let's get--hold on now.  Let me try to get school straight.  Now, what school did you start off at?
Speaker 1: I started off at a school in Woodville [Mississippi], three years.
Speaker 2: What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: I don't know the name of that school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I can probably call my sister and find out.  Then, I went to Louisiana, like Ferriday [Louisiana], Vidalia, Louisiana, with my cousins, my father's [Henry Miles] niece, and spent one year there.  Then I went to Chicago [Illinois] in '39 [1939].  Then, from there, I went back to, to Chicago where I finished high school.
Speaker 2: Now, where did you finish high school?
Speaker 1: Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Englewood, okay.
Speaker 1: I went to my fiftieth high school reunion in--here in, in '98 [1998].  And a busload of us was crying because we went past the old school at 62nd [Street] and Stewart [Avenue].  They had torn it down, and I will show you the pictures of it.  It's a, it was a great English Tudor building if you remembered.  And they put up a jail, a little rectangle building with high windows, you know, and it looked like a jail.  That's it there, we did it.  It was some (unclear).
Speaker 2: So, when did you graduate from Englewood?
Speaker 1: June 23, 1948.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, that gives some chronology.
Story_ID: 227897
Speaker 1: I want to go back for a minute to this church thing, I said.  You gave up on the church when they made you dress like a girl in a--
Speaker 2: Oh, that, that sort of did it, oh, man.  I, I, you know, I was--I can now use the word macho.  I didn't know the word macho then.  But I was a man, like my daddy [Henry Miles], you know--I ain't gonna put no dress on, and that was an insult to me, you know.  And then, the next crunch came when they denied my father the, the restaurant.  By the way, a year or two after he could have had that restaurant, one of the largest [U.S.] Army camps in the South opened.  And it was called Camp Van Dorn in Centreville, Mississippi.  And daddy knew all of the--not all, but a number of the owners of the breweries, like Jax beer, Falstaff.  I think there's another one, Regal beer.  He knew all of these owners--they used to hunt and fish with my father.  And we could have gotten all the beer we wanted, and made a lot of money during the war because there were just thousands of soldiers there.  And we could have made it, but the church [Woodville Baptist Church, Woodville, Mississippi] forbid my father from doing it.  Now, my father eventually had this juke I had mentioned in Crosby, Mississippi some years later.  Now, we're going to jump from the time when he had the juke in 1950 to his passing in 1968.
Story_ID: 227898
Speaker 1: What did your home look like growing up in Mississippi?  And what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The house was a three-room houseboat that my father [Henry Miles] built.  My father, at high water time, would go into the woods and take some fellows with him--cut down several cypress trees.  And they would then float it to a given area and wait till the land dries, and then he would pick, have it picked up by truck, take it to a saw mill.  The--it was six-inch thick timbers on the bottom of the boat, the sides and, and the bottom of, and the rake of the boat was six-inch cypress wood.  And my father and my cousin built it.
Speaker 1: Is cypress better for that than any other wood?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, cypress is one of the best things, wood, because it absorbs the water and, and it is, if it's bothered at all.  And--
Speaker 1: You mean, it absorbs it or does it, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it lives in it, so it, it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I can't--
Speaker 1: So, the wood doesn't rot?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Say, you know, okay.
Speaker 2: And so, daddy always had some lumber put aside waiting until it matured, dry, or whatever it was.  And, at times, you get ready to build a boat, you go back and soak the wood for a week or two before he could bend it, and curve the way he wanted.  What is the other question you wanted to know?
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the smells.  The sights were country, country folks.  I did a lot of hunting when I was young.  I was, had my own shotgun when I was six years, three months old, 410-gauge shotgun.  When I was eight years old, I can go in the woods, and bring home half a dozen squirrels for dinner, or go down in the, another area, and bring home two or three ducks for dinner.  Had to have a duck per person--ain't much meat on those ducks.  I never got the Canadian goose 'cause they were on the other side of the river and no way for me to get over there.  But I think I, I had a pretty exciting childhood.  I never missed a meal, maybe didn't have what I wanted to eat.  But even when I was boarded out with family and friends, I never missed a meal.  Oh, here's an interesting point.  Now, 1943, I'd gone from Natchez, Mississippi down in the country to spend a weekend with my mother [Irma Mazique Miles] and father.  Coming back, we stopped in this little town called Fort Adams [Mississippi] and went in the store called Curry [ph.].  I think that store is still there now.  I looked up on the shelf and there must have been fifty pairs sneakers up there and tennis shoes.  We knew nothing about tennis back then, but they were called tennis shoes.  And there were red and there were black, what have you, high tops.  And I have some cash sheets here from Sears, Roebuck [and Co.] for those years.  And those shoes out of Sears & Roebuck sells $1.79, $2.00, $2.50.  I pulled my dad on the side.  I say, daddy, our basketball team do not have any sneakers to play basketball in.  I know the girl, another Catholic high school.  My daddy bought those fifty pairs of sneakers for me.  I don't remember exactly what he paid for them, probably two bucks a pair.  I sold them for ten bucks a pair and they were happy to get them.  That's the entrepreneurship in me, starting with my father when I was seven, probably seven years old, begging to go to town with him on Saturdays to sell fish.  That, that was--you're talking about a smell--fish, fish, fish, and some more fish.  We would catch shrimp and we would put them in the trap, would let them stay there for maybe a week.  And they'd clean themselves out, and we didn't have to devein them, you know.  And I remember one--a number of times daddy would--the buyers would come and buy the fish.  And daddy had like several six-foot traps that he'd put the fish in.  He had--daddy had a dozen different ways of fishing, and I'll describe them if you want.  He would sometime--"Irma, what happened to that big catfish or that big blue cat the other day--I, I put it in the trap Thursday?"  "You ate it yesterday," (laughter) was my mother's rhetorical, you know.  And daddy couldn't say nothing, you know, he'd just shrug his shoulders, yeah.  He's, he's--I'm thinking of things I haven't thought of in a long time and it's very pleasant thought to have these thoughts about my mother and father.
Story_ID: 227899
Speaker 1: I don't think I could have had a better mother [Irma Mazique Miles] and father [Henry Miles] than I had, you know.  And I had a great family--my mother's sisters and my grandmother, just, just great.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There was this, this one cousin, my first cousin.  Unfortunately, he died about three years ago in Chicago [Illinois], and he left a wife, two kids, and a couple of grandkids.  And I have their pictures of the grandkids and haven't seen them, would love to see them, you know, they're down in North Carolina.

Speaker 1: What grade school did you attend in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: [James] McCosh [Elementary School; Emmett Louis Till Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: McCosh, right, and so many people, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, out on 66th Street, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And McCosh, and then Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Englewood, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you find--there are a lot of Mississippi people in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Chicago is mostly a Mississippi town (unclear).
Speaker 2: Do you know why?  The Illinois Central Railroad, it went straight up.  Everybody from Alabama went straight up to Detroit [Michigan].  If they're from Georgia and the Carolinas--came straight to New York [New York] and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And then, some Louisiana people, they went to California.  I have, I have cousins out there.
Speaker 1: So, did you find--so, you must have been home on some level 'cause a lot of Mississippi people are in Chicago, but did you find, how did you adjust to it?  Did you adjust okay to--
Speaker 2: To what?
Speaker 1: --coming to Chicago from Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I knew, I always knew I was going to go up above the Mason-Dixon Line one day 'cause I know I had family there.  And I was going to have to get away from these white folks in Mississippi.
Story_ID: 227901
Speaker 1: Now, let me say this--my father [Henry Miles] was well-connected in Mississippi.  We never had any problems.  We were never threatened in any way.  But there was always that danger lurking that you will be fearful of.  My daddy had an idea--if we have a problem, and they come after us, we're going to take some with us.  You know, this one time, we had--guys came to Louisiana looking for my father.  We knew they were coming.  We had six people out in the woods with the shotguns and rifles, and we had our shotguns and rifles in the house.  My mother [Irma Mazique Miles] was telling, no, he's not here, he's not there.  And Henry is sitting there with the (unclear).  I don't think he knew what you want to use first--the shotgun or the rifle or the pistol, you know, but we got through that one without any bloodshed or anything.  I can remember times my daddy brought home a one-foot alligator, or a three-foot alligator, and an eight-foot dead alligator.  I helped him take the hatchet, chop him out of his shell.  We salt it down at the shell and scraped it, and (unclear) the hide.  And mother made, cooked the alligator meat, and it was delicious.  I don't know how it taste.  I, do I enjoy it then, but trying to remember that taste.
Speaker 2: An eight-foot, an eight-foot alligator?
Speaker 1: Yeah, shot him right through the head with a 30-30.  Daddy had, used to go in the woods in a small boat and fish single hooks and various lines.  He had bobcats.  The snakes will jump into his boat.  You can't shoot down--you got to shoot up.  You can't put a hole in your own boat, you know.  And it was a gun here, but a gun here, and a pistol here.  But it's, that was when I went back to Mississippi for 1950.  Daddy bought me a brand new truck, a two-ton GMC, and he had a governor on it where you could only drive so fast.  And I get down the road a few days, I'd take the governor off where I could drive faster, put it back on.  I don't know whether he ever knew it or not, but he never said anything, you know.  My daddy trusted and my daddy loved me, and I loved my father.  I just wish more kids had that kind of relationship with, with their parents because--and I've, I, I have two daughters.  And I have tried very hard to have that kind of relationship with them.  And I have two grandsons, and I work very hard to have a good relationship with them.  And there's another generation starting over there is my great-grandson.  So it's, it's, it's been a lot of fun, a lot of success I've had in my lifetime, and never made enough money, but somehow, survived.
Story_ID: 227902
Speaker 1: Now, let me backtrack to high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] here and just talk about--now when you went to Englewood, was the school mostly black by then, or was it still mostly white?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know the breakdown.  It was pretty even.  There were twenty-seven, as I remember the number, this is nationalities in that school.  We would give our own proms. Oh, here's one you'll love.  I told you, I grew up with the entrepreneurship.  I became a reporter for a club.  We had a club run by a lady in the community--I can't remember her name now.  I have a picture of her that would put on the proms for us because the high school didn't do it because of the interracial bit.  But we would invite a number of white kids to come to our prom--well, they did.  And guess where we had our prom--the Pershing Lounge [Pershing Hotel], 64th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], which is torn down now.  The Savoy Ballroom down 48th Street.  Now, there's another catch here.  I, by this time, I'm working for a photographer by the name of Adair on 61st Street near Vernon [Avenue].
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: A-D-A-I-R, Carl Adair, Carl Mike [ph.] Adair.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's a Chicago photographer, a black photographer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was one of the two best photographers, and the other one was Carl Maynard.  He was at 63rd [Street] and Rhodes [Avenue], I think.  That's when 63rd Street was quite a street.  Every Sunday we would go to the Pershing Lounge--hey, I want Jamal [ph.].  I had half a dozen guys who used to hang together and got about eighteen, and they would be to getting, drinking, and carrying on.  And I was already used to, used to liquor, so I wasn't partaking in the experimentation, I could say, but--
Speaker 1: So, when you were in high--now, when did you first get introduced to photography?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was in, in high school, probably the second year of high school.  At lunchtime one day, I heard a kid say to another--have you developed my film as yet?   So now, I'm going to--maybe I can save a little money, and I'm taking up all my allowance going to the drugstore.  So, the kid's name was Robert Orr [ph.].  I think he's deceased now.  He said, "Well, you can do it yourself."  Oh?  So, he wrote me out a list.  And I went home and told mother [Irma Mazique Miles].  And that Saturday, she took me to 63rd and Halsted [Street] to Sears Roebuck [and Co.], spent $11.69 dollars.  She later showed me that receipt.  I came home.  We had this big apartment at 635 St. Lawrence [Avenue], two full bathrooms.  And I took the back bathroom and (unclear).  First day, I took some little negatives and made a contact print.  Next day, I just shot a roll of film and developed it and made prints--aw, man.  And about three months later, I shoot the prom and made $129 dollars profit.  That, that did it.  There's money like this to be found.  Now, here come the good part.  For the next several proms at the Savoy and the Pershing Lounge, and they had this photographer at Savoy called--they had a--it might still be there at 46th [Street], 47th [Street] on the west side of the street next--near the theatre, there was a studio there.  They had the concession.  But now, I'm business manager of the prom.  But for us to rent it, they would have to give me concession, put up two tripod setters in the place to shoot pictures.  I hired my boss to shoot pictures of me during prom nights on three or four occasions.  I had got, I took pictures of this couple of popular kids at two doors.  My mother--by the way, my family had a restaurant at 5958 South State Street.  That was the best soul food restaurant you could ever eat in your life called Billy's Kitchen [ph.].  And a couple of doors from there was a sign painter, so I had him to make up these signs for me.  And there's promotional things to, to get people to, to let me take their picture.
Speaker 1: Who was the sign painter?  Was that a black person, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: It wasn't Vernon Guider, was it?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Vernon Guider?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I might remember his name if I heard it, you know.  I've had--can remember this so clearly.  We'd have two lines of people--fast as they could just stand there, and we'd have these 45 [mm]--everything was shot in 45 in those days.  And then, we had to go back and change the holders.  They had a bunch of holders, but sometimes they had to stop, go and change the bag, and change holders, but we had people standing in line--
Story_ID: 227903
Speaker 1: I made, last three or four proms, I made, on the average, a thousand dollars.  And what we would do, I hired the funeral car across the street from the, from the restaurant [Billy's Kitchen (ph.)].  They would pick us up, and we'd have three, three couples.  Here's one thing--one, one girlfriend I had named Juanita [ph.], she decided she wasn't going to the prom with me--for whatever reason, I can't remember.  She's still--I asked her about it in, in '98 [1998] when I was out there.  She still didn't have an answer.  So, anyway, I asked another girl, Ann Pouie [ph.].  Ann's mother fell and broke her hip about a week before the prom, so she couldn't make it.  So they'd opened an ice cream parlor at 63rd Street off Rhodes Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], on Rhodes off 63rd.  And I asked this pretty lady if she, if she had a long dress and she said yeah.  I said, would you like to the prom with me?  She said, okay.  So, fine, I said I'll pick you up at such and such time.  So now we go, we pick up Juanita's brother, Frank [ph.], and another guy and their girls, and now we go pick up my girl.  We go to the prom.  And I explained to her that I'm going to be working, and you can hang out with my friends, and what have you.  So, and we go down to, we're going downtown to the Blue Note [Chicago, Illinois] afterwards.  We--my mother [Irma Mazique Miles] was there and my, and her, a lady I call my aunt from Mississippi.  And they were writing down, taking the money, so it, in the time, I, I don't know, I probably put a hundred bucks in my pocket.  Called a limo, we all got in the limo.  We go downtown.  Coming back, the girl with me--I'm sitting in the front, she looks back.  She see the two couples in the back kissing.  She turned around and she start kissing me.  I had a good time.  You want to hear the twist?
Speaker 2: Well, what?
Speaker 1: She was already going out with Frank.  Now, my other girlfriend's brother, Juanita's brother, Frank, he's in the back seat kissing another girl.  So, she kissed me to spite him.  They later married, they're still married.  They have four full grown kids now.  Juanita never had any kids.  But we were to go to Blue Note, listen to a couple of sets.  And then, we would--oh, 17, 18, nobody worried about how old you are, and nothing like that at the time 'cause we, we were mannered.  We, we knew how to carry ourselves as ladies and gentlemen.  And we would go out by the boat basin on 65th [Street] and Outer Drive [Lake Shore Drive].  And don't even think about getting those girls out of those hoop dresses.  You might want to cut this part out.  But you got some hugging and kissing and that's all you got.  You don't think about nothing else.  But those were good, clean, fun days.
Story_ID: 227904
Speaker 1: But I'm thinking about--you asked me about the smells and the fish.  I've, I've handled a lot of fish over the years--fish, and on weekends, we would sell fish in four or five towns off the back of the truck.  Then we'd come home to Crosby [Mississippi] to the restaurant, and then repack all the fish, ice.  And my stepmother was there, who would be frying fish during the night, and selling it and so forth.  So, at times--
Speaker 2: So, you come from an entrepreneurial family?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, in Chicago [Illinois], my mother's [Irma Mazique Miles] oldest sister had married this gentleman who had been a chef-cook on the railroad.  I don't know which railroad.  And he opened a restaurant [Billy's Kitchen (ph.)] as a front because in the back, they had a bookie, and I was not allowed back there.  So, somewhere, they'd cut out the bookie.  He took over the place and made a restaurant out of it, a very successful restaurant.  I can remember whole cows, cut in half, come in the back door during the war [World War II, WWII].  And I helped cut it up.  We had a hundred chickens at a time that would come in the back store in crates.  I had to kill and defeather the hundred chickens, and take the innards out, and cut them up and what have you.  They worked my butt off, you know, but today, I'm, from this, I'm a very good cook.
Story_ID: 227905
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and back to the--now, what other subjects--did you take photography in school at all?  Did they offer anything like that?
Speaker 2: I took a little course at one point in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], and I was going to sleep in class the next day.  I got a call from my assistant principal, Mr. Cletwich [ph.].  Isn't it amazing how some names these teachers back there who taught over fifty years ago, I still remember, and some I don't.  Cletwich found out and said, I'm going to call your mother.  You have to stop, or I'll call your mother, so I stopped.  And he says, oh, by the way, you're going to have to take up typing.  I said, typing?  I don't want to be in a class with those girls.  He say, I'll call your mother.  I said, okay.  I took up typing and I learned to type sixty words a minute back then.  I don't type that many now, but I keep a steady pace.  But it was a, it was a good treatment from the teachers.  And we had the principal and Mr. Thompson [ph.], who was the bandmaster during World War I [WWI] at the [Naval Station] Great Lakes [Lake County, Illinois].  And he introduced these--have, have some of Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] string quartet come out and play.
Speaker 1: He was the bandmaster out of the Great Lakes?
Speaker 2: He was the bandmaster at Great Lakes during World War I, the principal of our school, Mr. Thompson.  That's where I was introduced to some classical music.  We, during the graduation, we had done some [Johann Sebastian] Bach and Marian Anderson came to the school once, and it was--it just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when Marian Anderson was really in the news, too.  She--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was, it was a good period back then.  Another thing, when I went to this class reunion in '98 [1998], I found like an old gold digger talking about '48 [1948].  I got up on the mic [microphone] and started talking to the kids.  I said, I want to ask all of y'all one question.  I cannot ever remember a fight in high school.  Anybody remember a fight in high school?  Nobody could ever remember a fight in high school.  What a difference a day make.  You know, we were just good, congenial kids.  We dressed.  I had felt hats and Argyle socks, and double-breasted suits, you know, Allen Edmonds shoes.  And I'm still wearing Allen Edmonds shoes till this day.  And it was some good times back then.
Story_ID: 227906
Speaker 1: When you graduated from high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], what were your plans?  Had you, did you plan to go to college, or did you plan to continue as a photographer or--
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to go to college, but I didn't think I had the qualifications 'cause I--those first three years in Mississippi was nothing.  One year in Louisiana was nothing.  I got out of Chicago [Illinois] about the fifth grade--I flunked it, and Mr. Thomas [ph.], Thomas class and, and [James] McCosh [Elementary School; Emmett Louis Till Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  And then, I had to go back to Mississippi where I did the fifth grade over.  Somehow I passed it, and got, got through several years there.  During the seventh, eighth, or eighth and ninth grade, I was class president at the Broomfield High School in, in Natchez, Mississippi.  During that period of time, all the big boys are gone to war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 1: So, you went to Broomfield.  Now let me get this straight.  Now, you graduated from Englewood, but you went to high school in--
Speaker 2: No, before Englewood, I'd gone to Broomfield High School in--
Speaker 1: Natchez.
Speaker 2: --and after my grandmother died, I went, and I flunked the fifth grade.  I went back to Natchez, Mississippi where I went to Natchez College [ph.] for one or two years.  Then I went to Broomfield.  You got, you got it?
Speaker 1: Natchez College, what was--
Speaker 2: That's in Natchez.  That's a small--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that was before high school?  I mean, that--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was before high school.  This, this was like grade school.
Speaker 1: Natchez College is like grade school.
Speaker 2: But it was a grade school, too.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: They call it Natchez College, but it was a, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay (unclear), okay.  Then Broomfield High School, then Englewood, right?  Then--or was it, okay.
Speaker 2: It--no, it was Natchez College, Broomfield High School, then Englewood.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, right.
Story_ID: 227907
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: After Englewood, I had several jobs around Chicago [Illinois].  I drove a truck.  No, right after, no, right after, no, no, no, change this.  Right after high school, I finished high school in June.  And in--I think, January, my boss said he wasn't making any money.  He wanted to move the studio, so he went to several cities and wound up choosing Atlanta [Georgia].  He wanted to move to Atlanta.  I asked my mother [Irma Mazique Miles] if I could go.  And she went and talked to [Carl] Adair, and agreed for me to move to Atlanta with Adair.  So, I moved to Atlanta with Adair, stayed there about ten months, and then, this partnership broke up.  And that's when I did one of the best things I ever did in my life.  I went back to Mississippi, and spent another year with my father [Henry Miles], and ran that juke for him in Crosby, Mississippi.  And I stayed there a year.  I had met a lady in Atlanta and she came over.  I told everybody in town that I was married, except my father and another couple knew the difference.  Even my stepmother thought I was married.  And so, we stayed there for about three months.
Speaker 1: Why did you tell people you were married?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I just wanted to keep the other ladies away from me.  I knew that she was coming--I wouldn't have no problems.  And we stayed there three months and moved back to Chicago.  So that first night in Chicago, we getting ready to go to bed, and we're making plans to go get in the same bed.  And my mother said, "Not here, you don't."  Three days later, we went down to the justice of the peace and got married, all right.  Well, that lasted about six months, and she left, went back to Atlanta.  She later went back to school, finished college, and then she got her Ph.D.  And she wound up as a librarian in a major city in upstate New York.  And, unfortunately, she passed away two years ago.  And six months--two months later, her husband passed away.  But that, that thing-the part, my mother or whatever, that was funny, yeah (laughter), "Not in here, you don't."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  It was a different way, huh?
Speaker 2: Oh, different time, different way.
Story_ID: 227908
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you were in, we had you in Mississippi--I guess with the juke joint in Crosby, Mississippi.  Now, you were there for a year--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --helping your father [Henry Miles].
Speaker 2: --yeah, 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you didn't get drafted for, or anything during this period of time (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I got married.  And I had flat feet.  I worked on the railroad for Illinois Central Railroad for a while.  And I got the flat feet, so I missed the Korean War.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I don't think I'd made a good soldier.  I could shoot well, but other than that, I, I was in--oh, what other thing saved me, I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  And then, I joined the, the National Guard down on 35th Street [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, that kept me out of the war--the National Guard, and then the ROTC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 227909
Speaker 1: So, now you're--are you still shooting photos?  Are you shooting during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Photographs?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, just some of my Harlem project [The Miles Group: Seven Part Harlem Project] and, and my grandkids, my kids.
Speaker 1: No, during this period of time, back in the 1950s?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, I didn't do very much photography in 1950.  I went back to Chicago [Illinois].  And my wife and I separated.  And I worked around Chicago for a while.  And then--
Speaker 1: Did you shoot any for the [Chicago] Defender or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I met a gentleman who worked for Ebony magazine through a lady cousin of mine.  And she was--I think going out with his, his nephew or something.  So now, I figure I got an entree to Ebony.  So, the Baptist convention was in Chicago--that one at the armory on 18th Street and Wabash [Avenue], or somewhere down there.  So, I got down there that day, and I shot some pictures on the stage of them marching in.  I went out to--got the photographer for the Chicago Defender to develop pictures for me, took it down to Jet, sold my first picture--big ten dollars.  [HistoryMaker John H.] Johnson was cheap--I love him.  He's one of the people I do admire.  And I start freelancing for him.  And seven months into it, I was also fortunate to move in a building at 5027 South Drexel [Avenue].  That was the residence of Kathryn [Kennedy Dickerson] and Earl Dickerson.  Johnson worked for Earl Dickerson when he first started out in the insurance company.
Speaker 1: This is Earl Dickerson, D-I-C-K-E-R-S-O-N?
Speaker 2: Yes---
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the Earl Dickerson, yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: The Earl Dickerson, okay.
Speaker 2: And his wife and I, she, she--Kathryn was her name, and she befriended me.  And one day, she said to me, "[HistoryMaker Bertrand] Miles, how would you like to work for Johnny?"  She called Mr. Johnson, Johnny.  I said, "I'd love to."  She got right on the phone and she called--"Oh, this is Mrs. Dickerson.  Is Johnny there?  Oh, hi, da da da.  Lunch tomorrow, yes, okay, no problem."  She says, "Okay, I'll talk to you when I get back tomorrow evening."  So, next day, I called.  She says, "Just be patient, you know."  So, about a week later, we're going up the steps to the Blackstone Hotel [Renaissance Blackstone Hotel, Chicago, Illinois]--Johnson and I.  And we're going up there to shoot some pictures for something.  He says, "Miles, are you married?"  I said, "In a funny sort of way."  And he smiled.  I smile.  He said, "How would you like to work for us and live in, live in New York [New York]?"  I said, "When do I leave?"  That's the second time I used that, that term.  I'll tell you about the other one.  So, I moved to--came to New York November 7th, 1952, three days after [Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower was elected--with tears in my eyes.
Speaker 1: And why the tears?
Speaker 2: Because I'd voted for Adlai Stevenson, my first vote.  You know, how proud I was to vote?  I voted an absentee ballot.  My father [Henry Miles] owned property in Mississippi and had to pay poll tax, and couldn't vote.  I have not missed the election.  I have to go out tomorrow morning and vote in the primary.  I ain't--it was just something that's important to me at the time.  And so--
Speaker 1: So, Johnson hired--sent you to New York?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you started--
Speaker 2: I worked for Johnson for almost two years.
Story_ID: 227910
Speaker 1: Now, where did you live here in New York [New York]?  And did you live in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, I lived at 112 West 45th Street.  I found, I lived in a hotel for a few months.  And I ran, ran into some musicians I knew that lived in this building.  And they got me an apartment in this apartment building at 112 West 45th Street.  There's a skyscraper there now.  And I lived there for a while until I met my wife, my second wife, that is.  And my first wife--she got the divorce, and went back to school.  My second wife, I met here, she's a social worker.  I met her at the Savoy Ballroom [New York, New York].  And I had just photographed an attorney and her husband, who's an attorney, that week before.  And I go up to this lawyer to take some pictures and I int--say hello to, to this attorney.  And, and I see this lady sitting over there in a booth, and I inquired as to who she was, and I was introduced.  I asked her for a dance.  And I whispered in her ear--I said, one day, I'm going to marry you.  Oh?  Yeah.  A year later, we went to Church in Damascus [ph.].  We got married.  I said, I don't know what I meant it then or not, but here I am.  And she got to be the mother of my two daughters.  And she, unfortunately, she contracted Alzheimer's at a very early age.  We had never heard of it before.  And my daughters were fifteen years old, and their mother didn't know who they were.  It was a sad point in my life and my daughters' life, but we survived it.  And we don't talk about it much.  What is there to talk about if it's hurt and pain, and just do it all over again?  But I kept two strong daughters.  My daughters--my wife was not much of a chatterbox as I am, and my daughters are more like me.  They're both entrepreneurial.  They're both very, very bright, and they are very successful now.  And they live and work in Harlem.  I moved them to Harlem in 1981 down to an apartment on 7th Avenue and--
Speaker 1: Where were they living before?
Speaker 2: Well, one daughter was living in Washington, and the other daughter was living here [New York, New York] with me.
Story_ID: 227911
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about the--working for [HistoryMaker John H.] Johnson in New York [New York].  I mean, how many years did you work for Johnson here?
Speaker 2: Just short of two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you were here for '52 [1952], '53 [1953]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Johnson fired me.  But he tried the next two years to get me to come back, but he wouldn't give me the money I wanted.  I wouldn't, wouldn't come.  And then, Moneta Sleet [Jr.]'s wife just had a second or third child.  And I had a working wife.  And my boss was Allan Morrison who was the editor of Ebony here in New York [New York].  So I told him to hire Sleet because he needed a job more than I did.  And he hired Sleet, and which I, which I think was, was very appropriate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's in 1953, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--are there any pictures that you shot for Johnson that you think are, that you consider like memorable or anything or classic?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right over my shoulder here is a picture of Mary Church Terrell in front of the bust of, of--what's his name?
Speaker 1: Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 2: Frederick Douglass.  That was taken in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.].  I got the medal award from the Chicago Art Directors Club, 1953, for that picture.
Speaker 1: It's a beautiful picture.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you.
Speaker 1: Anything else from that period?
Speaker 2: Pictures?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, I had as many as seventeen pictures in one issue of Jet.  I had to manage twelve stories in Ebony magazine.  One time, Johnson has five magazines.  I had all--covered five covers on the, on the stands.  All this was for $115 a week, you know.  And he was paying some of the freelance boys $100 a day, you know, in equity, but, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you were underpaid to be the (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was underpaid down there.
Speaker 1: He had five magazines--he had like Negro Digest [Black World], I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, no pictures in there.  There was Ebony, Jet, Hue, and then a romantic magazine [Copper Romance].  What was it called?
Speaker 1: Brown Serial [ph.], is that his or--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --there was another one.
Speaker 2: Tan [Tan Confessions].
Speaker 1: Tan.
Speaker 2: Tan, yeah.  And so five magazines he had.
Speaker 1: Did you--now, did you shoot any of the centerfolds for--
Speaker 2: Oh, sho, I shot a lot of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the Jet, oh, sure.  One of the most famous ones was shot in the club in Harlem [New York, New York], Baby, called Baby Grand.  It's no longer there.  This is a shakedown, sir.  And she kind of stooped, and looked back over her shoulders, her butt to the camera, and I got a perfect picture.  And we put that in.  Then I, I went through Operation Cheesecake, through black colleges [historically black colleges and universities, HBCUs], through the South, from Meridian [ph.] to New York.  And I found an old classmate at Tennessee [Agricultural and Industrial] State [University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] or Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], one or the other, Kentucky State [College; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky] or Fisk, one of, one of the schools.  And I put her in a bikini out by the swimming pool.  And it upset the school, her parents, and everything, you know.  And it's just a picture--it was no big deal.  I had a lot of pictures there, and I had a big fight with them.  I came to New York, and I worked out of a studio over on 3rd Avenue.  I had a dozen of photographers there.  I learned a lot from them.  And I tried to do some of these things, and they would oppose.  I was forced to use a Rolleiflex, 2-1/4, 2-1/4.  I was forbidden to use 35 millimeter.  I have letters around here somewhere from Johnson forbidding me.  I went out to Arch de Bay [ph.] to program and photograph Ethel Waters once.  Allan Morrison, the editor of the shop that wrote the story that she would possibly come to Broadway.  And it would not embarrass the magazine if she hadn't.  They turned the picture down because it was 35 millimeter, but now on--the fastest film at that time was Sup XX, 100 ASA.  You--it was, you couldn't shoot a black woman on a black stage with a 100 ASA that will come.  So, but the following year, they used it as Negro progress in 1953 or '54 [1954].  So I wrote them a letter.  Did you remember that was 35 millimeter, but you used it?  Ed Clayton, who was the editor of Jet magazine for--you shoot them 35 millimeter picture.  I can't blow it up big enough to fit a Jet page.  And Jet was smaller than the Jet that has the other thing now.  But yet, they would say, why don't you shoot something like so and so shot in Life magazine?  Our World magazine was doing double trucks of, you know, double, two, two pages in, in 35 millimeter.  And, but Johnson now sits on one of the largest archives of black history, black photography there is.  And he won't sell or give a picture to nobody for nothing, you know.  And what's going to happen to that, I don't know.
Story_ID: 227912
Speaker 1: Do you have any of the negatives that you shot?
Speaker 2: No, everything they, they [Johnson Publishing Company] got.  Fortunately, this picture of Mary Church Terrell, I made a bunch of prints before I sent the negative to Chicago [Illinois], even 16 x 20s and 11 x 14s, and I'm about out of them now.  And for Washington, they gave us 16 x 20 to a friend of mine in Harlem [New York, New York], and I think I saw it out in his garage.  I think he and his wife threw it out.  They got one of the finest brownstones in Harlem.  And this lady--I think, is a member of the sorority [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] that Mary Church Terrell started.  I don't understand anybody didn't like the picture.  You know, but in that house, everything else says, yeah, this picture should be here.  That's life--the things happen.  You just can't control everything.  And if some things have to be, like water off a duck's back, then sometime that's very hard.  It's very hard at times, yeah.  It's like to sold my Harlem project [The Miles Group: Seven Part Harlem Project], trying to get ahead, trying to change the face of community.  I put on paper and graphic stuff, more stuff that anybody has done for Harlem, any community, and its vision.
Story_ID: 227913
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the other Harlem [New York, New York] photographers.  Did you--now James Van Der Zee was one of the most famous.
Speaker 2: I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: You didn't know him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But did--
Speaker 2: Richard Saunders, [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks, Bert Andrews.  Bert Andrews died about ten years ago.  His picture is on the wall over there.  It says "Playbook" and--
Speaker 1: Did you know the Smith Brothers [Marvin Smith and Morgan Smith]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: They sat right here.  We had been right across the next building at John Fletcher's [ph.].  John Fletcher was the first black cameraman and union here in New York [New York], and I'm the second.  He was in 1961--I'm 1968.  And we had a little get-together over there, and they came over here, and we was talking.  And they would tell me about all that stuff was in these file cabinets out on this guy's balcony.  And I'm the one who encouraged them to give this stuff to Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], you know.  I will say eventually he did.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  I want to say that for everybody, anybody that's watching this.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had some fantastic--where they go way back to the '20s [1920s] and, yeah, shooting it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was a--another great photographer by the name of Bert Andrews.  Now, his stuff is lost.  He had one of these religious cousins who was the executrix.  And he had lost all his stuff.  His studio burned down.  He borrowed proofs and recopied everything, and supposedly give it to the Schomburg.  But he was going to keep the negatives to make money from, until he passed away.  We don't know what happened to him--what this woman did with it.  The super [superintendent] told me that she moved in, and she thought that she had inherited ten million dollars.  And all she got was a bunch of tapes, jazz tapes, and videotapes, and this, this, the negatives.  I had people call me, and I'd give them the number, and she'd get arguing with them on the phone, but she didn't understand the number system.  And the one woman, who's the assistant to Bert, who could have helped, she didn't like.  So, she's one of these born-again Christians, and we don't know what happened, you know.  I'd like to take her to court.  In fact, I did take her to court and forced her, you know, tell him because I was designated to get certain pieces of artwork in, in the will.  And I had to take her to court to, to get that artwork.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a sad point in my life when I lost this friend, and to see his life's work being destroyed by a blood relative, and it was just very, very sad.
Story_ID: 227914
Speaker 1: But unfortunately, I don't have very many negatives.  I don't think I have enough stuff to put a book out because a lot of good stuff was at Ebony.  A lot of just junk is at Ebony.  Then I went to Madison Avenue [New York, New York].  I shopped a bit of stuff for Life, Look.  I have a double truck of Eleanor Roosevelt and Look magazine.  It was a eulogy.
Speaker 2: The eulogy to--
Speaker 1: Eleanor Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Most of my stuff was Madison Avenue.  I'm the--jazz record covers of the stuff and the other, a little record player with the smoke coming out of the back.  I got my system on the floor with a rubber tube in his mouth and dry ice in there.  And he's blowing the smoke that's coming out of the holes and the little record player.  You know, that kind of stuff, it's not worth keeping, you know, not to me, it isn't.  Suitcases is the thing--Samsonite suitcases for an art director friend of mine.  That's stuff not worth keeping, you know, beautiful color.  But I have a number of pictures, some on the wall here, and some others in the case back there.  I got a family high school portfolio and some of the family stuff, you know.
Story_ID: 227915
Speaker 1: What's your favorite work or what's your favorite work of the work that you've shot?
Speaker 2: Favorite piece of photography?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I would say this Mary Church Terrell piece behind me, Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], Eleanor Roosevelt.  There's, those two there, Adam Powell, Eleanor Roosevelt, those, and those are my three favorite pictures, and three of the best pictures I think I ever shot are right there--those three.  And that's my mother [Irma Mazique Miles] and father [Henry Miles].  My mother was forty-eight years old that month in August of 1948.  And that my father, I shot that in, in January or February of '55 [1955].  And he's holding Ebony magazine in his lap, my name in there--he just loved that, you know, um-hm.  But I have--I would--a friend of mine was talk-, and another person was talking about me recently.  And he said, well, Bert Miles [HistoryMaker Bertrand Miles] is a dreamer.  And the lady rhetorical was, well, if we didn't have dreamers, we would have nothing.  So, yes, I am a dreamer.  I have vision.  I--as [Senator Robert F.] Kennedy said, I--"Some people see things as they are, and I see things different and say, why not?" [sic. George Bernard Shaw quoted by Senator Robert F. Kennedy].  And I use the term quite often--it's not etched in stone.  Even gravestones can be moved.  They tore down and moved a hundred buildings to build the Citicorp building, over a hundred buildings to build Rockefeller Center [New York, New York].  And I'm talking about two blocks in Harlem [New York, New York].  I'm going to raise money and I'm going to buy out the people.  Now, that was a guy in Harlem, got a city agency to do condemnation and eminent domain on a small building back in the early '90s [1990s].  I stopped that.  I had a meeting with four people right here in this apartment.  I stopped that.
Speaker 1: Now, I want to get to this, but I want to finish up the photography and all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there's some we didn't talk, we didn't talk about.  Now you were--I guess, in your prime as a photographer during the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: I was stuck here in New York [New York], excuse me.  I was stuck here in New York with a family and a studio.  I had six studios over years in Midtown, Manhattan [New York, New York].  (Unclear), business going was difficult.  So, I didn't have an opportunity to go out and shoot in the civil rights thing.  I use a term--I didn't--never got my merit badge, being arrested in the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Well, I saw some--there's some photos over here.
Speaker 2: Well, that's the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And that's the Civil Rights Movement, too.  I mean, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that I did, that I did.  Remind me--I'll give you a picture of that Washington [D.C.] monument in the [Lincoln Memorial] Reflecting Pool before you leave, if you'd like to have it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you shot those for--
Speaker 2: Myself.
Speaker 1: --just for yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, by the way, I'm walking around with my big tag on saying Ebony magazine.  And who comes right up to me--[HistoryMaker] John [H.] Johnson.  Oh, hi, Mr. Johnson, how are you?  That, uh, oh, by the way, I'll send you a set of proofs (laughter).  He didn't say nothing, he didn't care.  And I had to lie to get in somehow--I guess that's something, you know.  I had lied for him before about something to get, get somewhere to shoot some pictures, you know.
Story_ID: 227916
Speaker 1: --You gotta be fairly crafty to get, to get some places to shoot, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you do.
Speaker 1: What's the--to what length have you gone to, to get a picture?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things you--you might call up and find out who's the president of this company.  And the little guard at the gate, you walk by him--"Mr. Rafael [ph.] gave me permission to come in and shoot these pictures."  And you walk right past him.  You like, ignore him.  I'm not disrespecting the man, but I'm using my psychology on him.  A little bit of power is dangerous in the hands of someone who's not accustomed to having power.  And their first thought is to say, "No, no, no."  So, you go around that no with--I have permission to do it.  And you lie, you know, you get the picture.  I'd never, I'd never harmed anybody to do anything, you know.  Cops like to tell you in the street, "You can't stand here."  Why?  If somebody's standing there, why can't I stand here, you know?  I did Attica in '71 [1971], the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: The prison riots in Attica Prison [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], yeah--
Speaker 2: Prison riot, Attica [New York].
Speaker 1: --in New York.
Speaker 2: I was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and my crew and I volunteered and drove up there.  I got there at 4:00 one evening--assessed the situation, called the producer, and says, by mid-afternoon, I want a camper trailer out here, or you'll never get another rat.  Oh, we was out in Brooklyn [New York, New York] one day, and manned the buildings out there, and he wanted a picture of a rat.  So I couldn't find any.  He's going to give me takers [ph.], and give us a good expensive lunch which we got.  But that night, I got a bed of roaches in another apartment.  And I filled the contact screen with roaches.  They were in that transit that opens, going from the kitchen, the hallway.  It was, it was out in the open.  You figure this is usually behind the wall, but they were there in the open.  Boy, I just, just let the camera roll, and they were just crawling all over the (unclear).
Speaker 1: So, you're shooting the film at this time?
Speaker 2: I was shooting film, yeah.  I never shot video.  And it's that (unclear) a bit when I was teaching the school downtown.
Speaker 1: What were you shooting?  Was it a--
Speaker 2: It's (unclear) CB16.  And I bought my own orientable finder, which I could stand here, and then do this, and shoot a skyscraper without bending my body, you know.  I could put the camera down on the edge of the pool or the water and shoot, you know, put a plastic bag on it.  And it lands right there to the edge of the water and shoot, which just allowed me to do a lot of other things.  I was always going to machine shop at CBS, having something else made, shoulder braces, this, that and the other.
Story_ID: 227917
Speaker 1: When did you work for CBS--from what year?
Speaker 2: I worked for CBS--let's see now, '68 [1968], October '68 [1968] through, I guess, June of '77 [1977].  That's about as close as I can come to it now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let me backtrack a little bit.  And now, when you left Johnson [Publishing Company], you said you went--
Speaker 2: I, I freelanced.
Speaker 1: You freelanced on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, all those years, I freelanced.
Speaker 1: --Madison Avenue [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Madison Avenue, um-hm.  And, and a period, and then I had a, I had a job with Life magazine as an assistant photographer.  I belonged to an organization called ASMP, American Society of Magazine Photographers [American Society of Media Photographers].  You know, those days, the great days of Life magazine, you look at Life magazine.  You see all these names in there, and you get to know these names.  But now you go to the ASMP meeting and you can meet a John Mealey [ph.], and Jean [ph.].  And, trying to think of that other guy--just, just a bunch of names--can't think of them right now, Carl Madden [sic. Carl Mydans], one just passed away at ninety something years old.  He's the one that influenced [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks to write George Silk, Eliot Elisofin.  (Unclear) Kappa [ph.] and (unclear) Joe called me one day.  And they were staff photographers at Life and say, what are you doing for lunch?  I said, oh, nothing.  Say, meet us on 48th Street.  So I did, and we sit down.  We ordered a sandwich and a beer.  And they say--well, I said, what are you guys want to talk about?  They say, oh, you know, Life magazine is doing a takeout on space.  And you know, we have two assistants, and there's room for one more.  And we're suggesting you take the job.  We're not asking you to take it--we're telling you, too.  I broke out laughing for the second time, and say when do I start?  I didn't ask about how much money or nothin', you know.  Like I said, I had that good working wife that was a big help.  I, I paid my dues, too, financially, within the family.  But, this, this gave me that leeway and that support that I, that was necessary.  And I, I made good money with Life.  I don't remember how much, but I was satisfied with it.  I admit Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] for how--what's her name--Elizabeth Taylor's party given by [Michael] Mike Todd--took me a week.  I took 60,000 watts of strobe light, distributed it there, and hooked them altogether with no slate where other cameras could set them off--all wired together--60,000 watts.  I went to the bursar, and I told him I needed five hundred dollars in five-dollar bills, and I got it.  I'm an assistant.  This is how Life worked.  I was trusted.  It is important to be trusted.  And you cannot ever break that trust because it will then move itself into other areas, and bigger than it should be perhaps.  The union there was very--how can I say--overpowering.  And they--every time you wanted--"You can't do this, you can't do that, and we'll do it, but we want some money," and, and hand out five-dollar bills here and there.  And Elisofin came there with me, and we took a look and we meted it out.  He left it to me.  We had had our first run-in, and I succeeded with him.
Story_ID: 227918
Speaker 1: --We were talking about, you know, you were just finishing up talking about Michael--lighting this thing for Liz Taylor [Elizabeth Taylor] and Michael [Mike] Todd's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --all this, and the five dollar bills that for the union.
Speaker 2: Oh, just have to pass out money to, to the union hands to get this done, and get that done, move this, move that, 'cause you can't move it, da da da, you know.  And it did almost makes you anti-union.  And I'm not anti-union because I've been a member of Local 600 [International Cinematographers Guild] for thirty-five years or more.  Yeah.  But I, I have, I have the picture of Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] that I, I shot that night.  And we, we, for this thing, we came back.  And I lit the tape, the tripod place, took the 4x5 camera with me, went back to Life magazine's office in Rockefeller Center [New York, New York], changed clothes, put on my tuxedo.  We walked in like gentleman, and had about three holders or four holders with us.  I think we shot three, four pictures at the most.  I mean arrogant--we know what we were doing.  We're Life magazine.  We're big time.
Speaker 1: Three or four pictures?
Speaker 2: That's all.  At the, the bursting of the balloons and things that are happening or what-not, and got a Piper [J-3] Cub airplane floating over there.  I'll show you a picture.  I came back and developed one and, and maybe developed the second one just to make sure.  And that was it.  They--something those we did--there was two spots where Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle couldn't hit the baseball.  So, we had photographers in that local town.  The other team was planning to go out and shoot pictures from the rear of Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle.  Then we had the pictures blown up life size, and we had them put on the board.  And we put a huge studio there over where Kinko's is now, 54th Street, top floor, by the elevator going up there.  And I knew what--I ran the studio for a couple of years, so I knew what was going on.  I would bring my car down and park my car for free.  And we had dirt from Chappell's and Rockefeller Center.  Baseball diamond, big piece of glass, a radio signal thing to click the shadow when the baseball hit, and the baseball picture machine.  And we had to do a lot of pictures to get the ball into the right spots where you want it.  And I operated the camera for Ralph Morse.  Ralph Morse was probably the most genius photographer Life magazine ever had.  And I operated the camera and he stood on the side watching what was going on.  What we doing?  Put--I was putting the hole, the holes in, and taking slide out, and so forth, and so we got that picture.  And it ran single column, pictures about this size, too.  I'll show them to you--about this size.  And it took a week for about six or eight people to shoot the pictures, but it's Life magazine.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had in photography was the couple of years working for Life.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you shooting with on those jobs?
Speaker 2: Everything from 35-millimeter, 2-1/4, the Hauser [ph.], Hauser, I mean--
Speaker 1: Hasselblad?
Speaker 2: No, well, Hasselblad, yes, but another 70-millimeter camera--Hauser or something like that.  I can't remember the name.  Fast motion shoot, we did them--a lot of the outer space stuff with that.  We would use 8 x 10, use for 4 x 5's, anything, whatever.  We had a, we had a shop there--you'd go and requisition any damn thing you wanted.  So, it was--well, just a great experience.  I missed getting on the staff of Life magazine.  The same man that tried to keep [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks off kept me off.  I can't remember his name.  I would tell you--I just don't remember it.  But those, those were good, those were good days, good years.
Story_ID: 227919
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were telling us a story during the break about a friend of yours who--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 1: --Jackson story.  This is a friend of yours--
Speaker 2: Dave Jackson [David Jackson] was a staff photographer when I went to Ebony.  He was a great photographer.  Unfortunately, he was at a Baptist Convention in Florida.  And some preachers are arguing about something on this big stage, and knocked him off the stage.  And he fell all over some tables and hurt himself, and never was right after that.  I must say [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Johnson never complained to the Baptist Convention.  He was worried about his circulation.  And Dave never fully recovered from whatever happened that time there.
Speaker 1: That's the second story--now this is the National Baptist Convention--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the largest African American organization in the world.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: It still is, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it's about the second fight story I've heard from a National Baptist Convention.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they had a big fight in '61 [1961] in Kansas City [Missouri]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --over what?  They were trying to separate themselves from [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  And that's when Joseph [H.] Jackson, you know, was trying to separate himself after Dr. King, saying that all you have to do is pray, and you don't need to do, and can involve in activism, you know.  He was jealous of Dr. King.  That's the story that everybody tells.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: There was a fight, and the preachers got to fighting over that, too, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Story_ID: 227920
Speaker 1: Oh, I was asking you about--now, you were at Life--at CBS from '68 [1968] to '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then what happened, then what--where?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got hurt on a job.  I fell twice and hurt my back, so went out on disability.  And I wind up with a permanent partial disability.  And I got my compensation, and but when I hit sixty-five, CBS cut it off.  They, in the contract--I think this is when [Sumner] Redstone survived.  And we found all this money sitting there.  Everybody in the company, twenty thousand people, took out long-term disability insurance.  I paid for all of it.  The company didn't pay for any of it.  So Redstone took over CBS.  He found millions of dollars just sitting there in a fund to, to have his way with it.  I think that's one of the things that saved his Blockbusters.  I bought his book ['A Passion to Win,' Sumner Redstone with Peter Knobler], started reading it, and I realized this.  And I wrote him a letter, and got some off the wall answer.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the book?
Speaker 2: Redstone, his book, whatever the name of it was.  I gave it away--I don't have it.  I wouldn't have finished reading the book.  But I was incensed because I paid for the insurance.  And then, when I hit sixty-five years of age, they cut it off, you know.  And I could use that income now for--my neighbor knocked on my--I was awakened Saturday morning with some of the weirdest music coming from next door.  My neighbor came in yesterday and she turned it off, and she knocked on my door to apologize.  She has this radio, and its alarm would wake you up and, and the sound get louder.  Oh, man, I was playing my music so loud to block that out, so while they was on this side, so I could play it.  So, I had to endure two days of horrible sound.  Yep.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 2: Yeah, you were talking about CBS cutting off your disability payments--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) oh, that, that hurt very much.
Story_ID: 227921
Speaker 1: Another thing that hurt me with CBS--with this Harlem project [The Miles Group: Seven Part Harlem Project] I've been working on for 20--15 of the last 20 years, and I'm determined to succeed with a change in the face of Harlem.  We have so much history there.  And I'm trying to put it all back to--much of it as I can back together.
Speaker 2: Now, how did you get involved with this project?
Speaker 1: I was offered--I tried to open a barbecue restaurant at 135th [Street] and 7th Avenue.  And I got a real estate guy I'd met to help me with trying to purchase this building.  And I was unsuccessful at purchasing this building 'cause I was dealing with a person who was not reliable.  So this person knew of my entrepreneurial abilities.  And he owned a building, Smalls Paradise [New York, New York] building.  He offered me the, the lease.  The lease was coming due.  And I assessed it and said yes, and I put together a proposal.  And I couldn't raise the money to do it.  And also, I realized it really would cost a couple of million dollars and I wouldn't own a brick in the wall at Smalls--and I couldn't pay that kind of rent and not own the building.  So I dropped it.  And then about three or four years, and I went to the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] on the 13th of December--I think it was, in '91 [1991], somewhere in there, or '93 [1993]--'93 [1993] I think it was, to see the last performance of Cab Calloway there.  And in the lobby, I ran into Carnes [ph.] and Ringo.  They say, oh, Bert Miles [HistoryMaker Bertrand Miles], how are you, he says.  See, you know, you just might be in the right place at the right time.  Some other people own Smalls, and I'll get in touch with my office.  I did, and he put me in touch with a gentleman who's the chairman.  And I start working on it and worked with the people in Harlem trying to do it, but, unfortunately, was not able to raise the money.  And now, I had a commitment of $150 million down 57th Street, but a little something happened there.  And I can't remember quite what happened that killed that deal.
Story_ID: 227922
Speaker 1: Now, tell us exactly what is the project [The Miles Group: Seven Part Harlem Project] you're trying to raise money for.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: My ultimate goal was to reopen a Smalls Paradise [New York, New York] night club.  And I happened to own the name, Smalls Paradise, and the Savoy Ballroom.  Along with that, I wanted to put up a major name hotel because the tourist board here in the city told me that Harlem [New York, New York] can handle a thousand hotel rooms back in '93 [1993].  So I just said arbitrarily, I'll take five hundred.  And I tried to tell [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Dr. Calvin O.] Butts he could take his Renaissance Ballroom [New York, New York], build a 500-room hotel.  That was before he wanted to put the Thurgood Marshall School [Thurgood Marshall Academy for Learning and Social Change, New York, New York] in, in the small building.  I'd been in New York [New York] for fifty years.  There's never been any decent barbecue here.  I wanna--and I've talked to the people that owns Lem's [Bar-B-Q] in Chicago [Illinois] and they will work with me here to open a Lem's Bar-B-Q or a Bert Bar-B-Q, whatever we decide on.  And then, I want to open--my sister owns a juke in Woodville, Mississippi now.  And I want to--her name is Johnnie Mae, and I want to put Johnnie Mae's Blues Cafe, Blues Cafe in Harlem.  And I want to do southern cooking.  I'm a chef-cook.  My mother [Irma Mazique Miles] was a chef-cook.  And my daughters can cook.  I think we can do a pretty good job of putting together a sustained restaurant there.  And then, I come up with the idea--I want to put jazz statutes along 7th Avenue on widening the median--the, the bold (unclear) water is wide enough, and the sidewalks are wide enough to give away the space on both sides, and widening the median.  I've asked the city planning department in the city to give me an estimate of what it would cost.  And I've talked to C. Virginia Fields, the borough president's office.  They liked the idea.  And I planned to go before the congress next year and ask for funding for this.  And I'm trying to put together the--what the costs of it.  And I've been in touch with the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York].  And the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], I'm constantly in contact with.  And the maintenance program and to--I have another friend who has an extensive jazz collection.  I'm trying to gather a number of sculptures from around the world.  As long as you can do good, a piece of sculpture, I don't care who you are or what country you're from.  If you can represent my jazz musicians, fine.  I've put a--I have a name of approximately four hundred jazz musicians.  Whether we do them all, I don't know, but the major ones, certainly.  And maybe add some music that people can go and sit on little, little stools and head phones, weather permitting, and punch in the music of various people.  I'm a Duke Ellington fan.  I've loved big bands.  I grew up on big bands, and in Mississippi.  I can remember having the thing at a ball on the corner of Pine Street and Catherine [Street], where you put your quarter in, and you get a big band playing various music.  And this is a big video, it's a video jukebox.  That's what it was.  And it was fantastic, you know.  And by the way, there in Natchez, Mississippi, I gave--used to give dances--now, it's 15, 12, 15 years old.  And till when the big boys would go on a--if there's a war, I started doing it, have the tickets printed, flyers, and another big boy took it away from me.  I knew better than to involve my father [Henry Miles] 'cause somebody probably got shot messing with Henry's boy.  So I had the sense enough to, to just let it go.  It's water off a duck's back.  But coming back to Harlem, I worked night and day, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week--nothing but this.  I put together a business plan--things, pad, lots of drawings, things.  And right now I have, I need to help with [President William Jefferson] "Bill" Clinton, but I can't get a staff or have not told him of me.  And I'm determined to reach Bill Clinton who can help me.  Just today, I downloaded a list of forty names from the Internet, forty people under forty, worth from $106 million to $17.95 billion.  And I'm certain if that Bill Clinton wrote those people a letter, and send them the tapes that I'd like to put together and say, I'm, I'm trying to help to rebuild Harlem.  These people would give him--send him some money.  I'm going to set up a 501(c)(3).  In fact, tonight I have to call my lawyer again about that.  One of my friends is a lawyer.
Story_ID: 227923
Speaker 1: And just, just what I've done--I think sometime one of my daughters want me to sit and wait 'til I die.  And I told her, I'm going to work 'til I die, and I'm going to work on this Harlem project [The Miles Group: Seven Part Harlem Project].  I've been retired for twenty-seven years.  I have nothing better to do--until next Friday, I'm going to be seventy-six years old.  I'm in reasonable good health, and there's nothing better to do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But to--and I know a lot of, I've known a lot of the musicians--Johnny Horton and Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Wes Montgomery, Joe Williams, Bill[y] Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan.  There's a lot of musicians I've known over the years.  And I met a lot more through my friend, Chuck Stewart, who's a jazz photographer, you know.  So if I can do something to--jazz is America's only original art form.  And that's a lot to be thankful for, a lot to be appreciable of, and if I can do something to perpetuate it, good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I think my daily statutes who put there, I might--first, I had ideas of statues, once open a nightclub.  I was going to put up some statutes.  But now, I just come to the idea, just, that's what I want to do, and I think that will help me with, eventually the nightclub.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 227924
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  And it kind of dovetails off what you've been saying.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The African American what?
Speaker 1: Community today?  Yeah, what are some of your hopes and concerns for that community?
Speaker 2: I just like them to be more a way of giving.  Example, my daughter was involved with Little League baseball when the boys were like eight, ten years old.  Both my boys were catchers.  The youngest grandson, a little guy, he's back there catching.  I never had nerve enough to catch.  I had a lot of nerve.  I ran a baseball team in Mississippi for a year when I was down there with my father [Henry Miles].  But to see my grandson back there catching the baseball, it just thrilled me to death.
Speaker 1: Now, the team you ran with, would that be like a Negro league team?
Speaker 2: Naw, it was just, just a community team.  I went to the man who owned the town, Crosby [Mississippi].  And I knew he wanted to keep his people happy.  And I told him, do you want to start a baseball team?  I understand they had one there, but we don't have any equipment and, and uniforms.  So he told me to go to Natchez [Mississippi] to this sporting good place, and get everything I need, and make sure I got enough baseballs and bats and gloves.  I came back with all this stuff, put it out on the porch in my daddy's juke, and the guys' eyes were this big.  They just didn't believe--how did you do this?  It was psychology of it that they didn't understand.  This man wanted to keep his folks in this town happy, and this is one of his ways of doing it.  I just spend a few dollars that was tax deductible which they didn't understand.  Same thing here--this is, I planned to hire eight hundred people.  I want to raise enough money to take enough of these brownstones in Harlem [New York, New York], and turn maybe a couple of dozen of them into apartments.  And a lot of the people I hire, I want to give them apartments at a reasonable rate.  The apartments are going $1,500, $2,000 in Harlem now.  Twenty years ago, nobody wanted to touch Harlem.  There's an article in the paper I have here some place where Douglas Elliman, one of the big real estate companies here didn't want nothing to do with Harlem.  Now, everybody's trying to get a piece of Harlem.  [Mayor Michael] Bloomberg has come in and that's three, only three ways you can get a building in Harlem now, to cut down the spectators which is, which is great.  Bloomberg is someone else I've not been able to get to.  I talked to ten people on his staff, sent letters and faxes, letters and faxes, letters and faxes, and I don't think Bloom--
Speaker 1: And that's the, that's the mayor of New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the mayor.  I don't think he's ever heard of me.  Why, I don't know.  I talked to one lady and about the smallest building.  Oh, we looked at it and we decided not to touch it.  I know why they didn't touch it.  They're afraid of the preacher.  The preacher is not anybody to be afraid of--[HistoryMaker] Reverend [Dr. Calvin O.] Butts.  He's my family minister, but we disagree on this one.  I know I can--we're good, we're friends, but friends can disagree, you know.  When I talk about putting, for 775 people, and I don't, since I came up with the idea of a jazz theater, holding three times the seating capacity of the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] which is only 1,420.  When I looked at Channel 21 and they had the du-wop down in Atlantic City [New Jersey] and other places in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--why can't I have this in Harlem?  I can, I could do twenty shows a year, twenty weeks a year, four nights a week, and gross at fifty dollars a seat.  I can go--it's thirty-four million dollars.  That gives me enough money to hire any diva--other person I want, you know, with that kind of money.  I have the location right there, but I want to put an underground, some half on the ground theater.  We have it, so we can come out of the subway into the theater without hitting the street--can be done right there.  I want to raise enough money to move this complex they built.  They have a building there with thirty apartments, no names on the bell, and people in and out of the building.  Something is wrong, something is very definitely wrong there.  And these are some of the same people that went belly up on $3.7 million dollar loan trying to build a housing project on that spot of land about seven or eight years ago.  I have the articles out of the [New York] Daily News, but that's the reason I need [President William Jefferson] Bill Clinton to raise enough money to do it.  It's not etched in stone.  It can be changed and moved, but you need the money to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 227925
Speaker 1: When you look back on your life and all the things you've done, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there is.  I don't know what I can think of, offhand.  Money has always been short.  I've survived.  I had a good life, but I've not--I had big ideas.  I've always had big ideas.  I give you an example.  Before I came to New York [New York], I was sitting around one day.  And every female in my family went to some little beauty parlor up or down State Street to various places to get their hair done in Chicago [Illinois].  And Peking's Cleaners [ph.] had just opened up with Al Benson.  Do you remember Al Benson and notes of him?
Speaker 1: He was, yeah, he had a, he was a general manager of a radio station, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he, he bought--
Speaker 1: Or had--did he own it?
Speaker 2: --no, he bought time off a foreign language radio station, and charged his own rate.  And his biggest client was Peking Cleaners, and their one-hour cleaners.  That was new in Chicago.  Bright lights and a little publicity, you got the people.  I wanted to open up a beauty parlor, a large beauty parlor, where women could come in.  I knew nothing about it, but I had a vision--come in, have somebody to wash their hair, somebody to set the hair, and somebody to style their hair.  When I get to New York, I find [HistoryMaker] Rose Morgan owns a place called Rosa Meta [House of Beauty, New York, New York] on 125th Street and now on 45th Street.  She was the lady was married to Joe Louis.  So, my ideas were there, but I just never had the money--couldn't do it--luck, luck of the draw.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 227926
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on your life at the things that you've accomplished, what would you see at this juncture to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Smalls Paradise [New York, New York], jazz music, restoring of--excuse me--restoring of big band jazz in Harlem [New York, New York].  That's what I want my legacy to be.  And being a cinematographer, and we do several billion dollars a year in, in the movie industry here in New York [New York].  I worked seven years on my executive board of my union.  I was support of my union with my ideas of putting up a couple of cinematography studios.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 2: All right.  I was asking you about your legacy, what you saw as your legacy at this juncture?
Speaker 1: I've had a good life from photography.  I have had a lot of success.  I've owned a half dozen studios in Midtown, Manhattan [New York, New York].  I worked for Life magazine for a couple of years as an assistant photographer.  I have a good friend, [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks, who's a close friend of mine.  I talk to him every day at two.  I've worked as an assistant for some of the greatest photographers at Life magazine.  I cherish that--those, those times.  I've helped--I turned down a job at [The] New York Times because the grass is greener--
Story_ID: 227927
Speaker 1: I just opened up my last studio down on 44th Street [New York, New York].  I had 3,000 square foot of space.  I had one account--it was Schaefer Beer.  That was--give me [$] 75,000 a year.  And the thing with the Urban, National Urban League, and all at once, that died.  And I was left high and dry, you know.  So that's when I moved out and went to CBS, and I saw it--handwriting on the wall.  And there was at the--I was asked by the chairman from the city if I'd like to make a speech at the Ethical Cultural Society [sic. New York Society for Ethical Culture, New York, New York] down on 64th and Central Park West.  They were having a congressional hearing on the broadcast industry and Madison Avenue.  And that's when I got, and at the same time, like it is, called me, you know, I don't--average--a modeling agency, Alina Brooks [ph.], the American model agency, called me and said, "A new program, like it is on Channel 7, would like to photograph a photographer, and photograph one of my models.  Can we use your studio?"  I say, "Sure."  So the guys came over, and I watched them load the film, camera, and so forth.  And I went out on the street and watched them shoot, went over to the modeling agency, and watched them shoot.  And at the same time, I think, "Gee, I can do that.  I know lightning, I know exposure."  So I asked a neighbor of mine who worked for CBS--who do I see at CBS (unclear) in the shop?  I liked CBS at the time because of the correspondents there--Walter Cronkite and others.  I knew them from, not personally, but from on the air.  So he told me the person's name.  I made an appointment with him.  And I said to the guy, "I'd like to shoot film for CBS, but I never shot any, but here are my pictures."  I was--felt I was dead in the water.  The man flipped through half a dozen of my pictures.  I had about two dozen and he says, "I'll tell you what, I'll give you a camera and some film."  I walked out there with a Arri [ph.], some magazines, tripod, and film.  I shot pictures at the, at 800-ASA, but night time stuff.  I shot on 125th Street.  I shot ticks [ph.] of a friend of mine--his son to the zoo, shot pictures, and, and took it back to CBS, shot them, and they critiqued them.  Then I walked in the house with the family one night.  I get a call from CBS.  It's Charlie Van Bergen [Charles Van Bergen], "Hey, Bert [HistoryMaker Bertrand Miles], Bert?"  "Yes?"  "I want you to go to Cleveland [Ohio]."  I say, "Yes, okay, what's going on?"  He said, "There's a riot up there."  I say, "I, I, okay," I'm scared to death.  I went to CBS; picked up a camera; went to Western Union; picked up some money; got on the airplane; and went there; got a car; went to this TV station.  And had two guys there from the Urban League--took me to the ghetto.  Easiest assignment I ever had in the ghetto was in Cleveland.  And it turned out to be some--some group had stored some guns in an abandoned car.  And the sanitation department came along and wanted to tow the car away, and they got in a gun battle.  And the riots broke out and so forth.  And [Carl] Stokes was mayor at the time, and he calmed the situation.  He handled it very well.  But I made the air the first time.  It was a great feeling, going back to the station, and seeing I made the Cronkite show ['CBS Evening News'].
Story_ID: 227928
Speaker 1: You were just describing a scene that you shot in Cleveland [Ohio] in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there for three or four nights.  And that was kind of scary, but it turned out, in retrospect, to be one of the easiest riot situations I ever covered.
Speaker 1: Now you're talking about Chicago [Illinois] in '68 [1968] was really dangerous.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was--
Speaker 1: Oh, what happened then?  Were you shooting for CBS then, too?
Speaker 2: I was shooting for CBS.  And I was their new, bright, black photographer.  And they gave me a sound man who'd worked for '60 Minutes.'  I can't think of his name at the moment, and who was a great help.  I shot one story--one interview indoors, everything else outside.  I tell you, there was one time that we were at the bandshell [James C. Petrillo Music Shell], then with the--at Jackson Park [Chicago, Illinois] downtown right by the Field Museum [Chicago, Illinois].  We're shooting the--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Grant Park.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, the--some of the students came over and lowered the flag to half-mast.  The cops came over and beat the hell out of them.  So, the students start picking up stuff off the ground and throwing at the cops over on the side.  So, I say, oh, hell, things are going to break lose.  So, I went and climbed up on top of the bandshell.  And a lot of other people, including a comedian, what's his name, Gregory--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.
Speaker 2: --Dick Gregory followed, followed me, and we got on top there.  A hundred cops came in, in two's, marching our two's.  They had a right flank marching into the crowd and arbitrarily beat the hell out of a hundred or more students.  And I was yelling up there, "Selma, Selma, Selma, Selma."  I was yelling to the top of my voice.  So, after that was over and the speakers there, we walked over to Balboa [Avenue], set up there, and Balboa was a 30-caliber machine gun set up there, and I photographed it.  And the young hippies were coming along, putting flowers in the gun belt of the [Illinois] National Guard, guardsmen, standing there with their rifles at parade rest--not parade rest--what's the other position?  I can't remember.  Went down, then Balboa.  And can I use a dirty word?
Speaker 1: Well, the--I guess a pause will (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I'll, I'll camouflage it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ten thousand people start yelling "F-- LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson]" constant, constant, constant.  And I say, oh, hell, stuff will break loose (unclear).  I came out with a ladder to fix something.  I say, excuse me, may I borrow your ladder 'cause I can--and I took my crew up on the canopy of the Hilton Hotel [Chicago, Illinois].  And I looked at the Hilton there.  When I was in Chicago a few years ago, that canopy is gone--no longer there.  There was a window there into the--in the ballrooms.  I jammed that window so nobody could lock us out there so we had an escape route.  And I photographed these cops coming into the crowd, and just beating people and drag--one lady had long red hair.  She was dragged by her hair and to the paddy wagon.  Every time they would push somebody in the paddy wagon, they got a billy club just to--into the back of the person.  They went up to Lincoln Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And I got a bunch of cars there.  People--I got people turning cars around.  And I passed the word down that we would give a signal when to turn your lights on.  And they would make--all the hippies wanted to do was to go in the park and sleep.  But the cops had to go in and kick behind.  So, I had my car turned on an angle.  So, only once after we shot, had these lights come on, and start shooting pictures of the cops, they come after us.  I jumped in my car and, and build, build the cord, we had a little problem getting in the car, but we did it with the sound man.  And we took off, 'cause had the electrician man ready to drive the car, ready, the motor running, and the car in an angle.  So, we go around the other side.  They got tear gas for the first time.  And another friend of mine--worked NBC--got a tooth knocked out, and a rib broken.  I say, man, why did you--yeah, he say, why you got to do--Kappa [ph.] say you got to be where the action is.  I say, you got your action, didn't you?  So I survived Chicago, came back, and went on staff, I made the air, [Walter] Cronkite's, a number of times there.  And I went to Washington, D.C., I (unclear), American University [Washington, D.C.], I got tear gassed, pepper, pepper gassed, in broad day night--day light, sunlight, beautiful day.  And all at once, you walk into it.  You don't see it.  You don't feel it--I mean, you feel it.  You don't see it, but for teared eyes.  And I'm yelling through the microphone--don't--not a living so and so criticized this film.  I can't see a damn thing.  I'm tearing.  I'm shooting--doing the best I can, so don't criticize me.  I was famous for talking to people back in the editing room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're not out here.  You're not, you're not going through what I'm going through.  Try and get this film.  So don't criticize me.
Story_ID: 227929
Speaker 1: How did you hurt your back?
Speaker 2: I was going down 7th Avenue one day filming a politician, tripped over something, turned over, and saw the world upside down, and fell over, and hurt my back.  And then another time, I slipped on some ice.  And the third time, I went down a half-flight of stairs.  And so, that's when I hung it up.  This, I was in the park one day.  I just couldn't hardly walk--couldn't carry my camera.  I had to get someone to carry my camera.  I hated having to retire but the time, I had lots of trouble on my back for the next five years.  I got, eventually, better.
Story_ID: 227930
Speaker 1: Well, we always--is there anything else you want to tell us that you haven't--we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see.  Well, how about my things I've touched, come up, I've talked about like Chicago [Illinois].  What--I just haven't thought about Cleveland [Ohio] for years.  The day a man walked on a moon, I had a crew of five or six people down in Virginia.  And this one story, this old lady, laying there half-dead, about dying.  She had this little house.  And she had a tenant that paid a little bit of the rent out of his Social Security which wasn't much.  She couldn't get wealthy.  Of course, she had this tenant in this house.  And I felt so sorry for that lady, and then photographed this doctor who was kind enough to make a house visit to, to give her some comfort.  I remember that story.  That was very touching, you know.  On the way, I had--oh, the other funny thing--we went down to Pennsylvania once to photograph some union official.  And I told the, the reporter, we ran out of time.  We haven't got time to set up the lights.  You can get the guy to come outside, and we will shoot outside.  So the guy is standing there.  And all at once, I see his right leg shaking, his leg is shaking.  He's so nervous and I, I didn't put the eye to the camera.  I just opened the iris to the camera, and just tilt the camera down a little bit to let the people back in the (unclear) see how he had (laughter) made this man so nervous, you know.  Then, we don't get the interview, but he was--that was funny.  One of the best stories I ever did was early on.  [President Richard Milhous] Nixon fired a tea, tea tester.  And we went out to Brooklyn [New York, New York].  And we had--and these piers, we had to walk a mile and down this pier, and we found this room where the tea tester was.  And there was a big round table.  And he would put the hot water in on the tea and let, let it simmer.  And then he would go--(sounds).  And my sound man set up a mic inside this, this container he was spitting in.  And we got great sound.  It was a slurping--(sounds).  That was great.

Speaker 1: Then I did Attica [prison riot], I was the staff, only staff photographer at Attica, so my reporter wanted to toss of the other reporters, and I became pool.  I went out to Attica [Correctional Facility, Attica, New York] from Thursday to Monday--I guess, a dozen times.  I found two young black kids inside Attica who had been down here, and been trained by John Fletcher [ph.], who used to live in the next building with ABC for about two weeks.  They knew nothing about shooting a story.  I gave them film, magazine, left lights, and that for them.  I had to threaten their--my reporter was back in the station and my producer.  I had threatened the news manager at the other station.  I was going to pull all my equipment out of there if he didn't share the film that these guys sent out.  They sent out one 400-piece of film.  I think they saved some.  These guys built a reputation.  I don't know their names--two black, young black guys.  They built a reputation, 'cause about Attica, they came out with some film on the tail end.  I went in the last day to take over.  I had a camper trailer out front, a wide two-walker [ph.] was there.  I didn't call [Governor] Nelson Rockefeller.  I worked for Nelson when he was running for a nomination office for the first still photographer.  That was a great experience.  I decided not to call him because YT [ph.] was talking to him.  And the, going that, that day was after the takeover, I took a--was it away, from ABC with--and my reporter was not there.  And I took this other reporter in with me.  It was a sad situation to see all these people shot.  And one we thought that was captured, we--one reporter went out to his house.  And he had, had a bath, sitting up in his easy chair, he says, man, I got the gag out of my mouth just in time.  That big old, big old cop was about to shoot me.  I told him I'm one of them, I'm one of them, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.  Just all sorts of little things like this, and people had to put some leaders that were found dead afterwards.  They went in there shooting.  There were forty-three people killed.  One, I mean, [William] Quinn, he was killed the first day--a guard.  The other forty-two was inmates.  None had guns.  Cops killed them--big cops walking around there.  And one guard walking around with this pistol which I filmed.  It was wrong.  What I should have done was ask Rockefeller to come, but don't go, don't go meet with the prisoners--just come in and control these, these cops 'cause it's--they're definitely got out of hand.  Those forty-two people had to know he was dying.  I spent two horrible days being called as a witness--never knew why they were going to call me as a witness.  But I--one guy questioned me, is this your film?  That's my slate.  I don't know whether it's my film or not.  You could have, you understand the edits?  And I said to him, you could have cut my slate out, and put it on another piece of film.  And I don't know whether it's my film or not.  It's my slate, and that was my, my story.  Two days I sat up there and never testified, you know.  But it was, it was just and, and it was just wrong, just wrong.  I asked a question.  I was kind of famous for being the audience, a press conference.  I would ask first--whether my reporter was there or not I'd ask the question.  And I asked--the guard that came out saying so and so's been--throat cut, and his balls stuffed in his mouth.  I asked the question, how were the prisoners killed?  Everybody was shot.  And the inmate didn't have any guns 'cause the guards that they captured didn't have guns on him, you know.  So, that was a sad point in life, you know.
Speaker 2: So you learned a lot from being in these situations, huh, being able to observe.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Down in [New] Jersey once, and I had this dumb reporter with me, and turn here, and I turned.  We missed the turn, so we tried to go in a filling station.  And a cop come over and he said, you can't go that way, go this way.  And he going, he goes and he puts a, a shell in the shotgun.  I sped off and told the reporter, shut the so and so up (laughter), you know.  All right, and close call.  But that cop come at me in Chicago [Illinois] with that man and made me park, boy.  He, he hit the top of the car with his billy club and left a dent in it on top of the car, and was aiming for my head.  I got out just, just in time.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  It's similar to legacy but different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Somebody that loved and adored his family, mother [Irma Mazique Miles], father [Henry Miles], his wife, his daughters, grandson, his great-grandkids, and who tried to be a good father, and would like to be remembered as the man who put jazz back in Harlem [New York, New York].  And if I get to leave this world and have those statutes on 7th Avenue of 100 or 300 musicians--oh, and, open a couple of clubs and a couple of restaurants up there.
