Story_ID: 103163
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I want you to start out talking about your father [Oliver Sutton]  And can you talk about him and his family, his background--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and also what you know about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  My father was born in San Antonio, Texas.  He was one of fifteen children born to Samuel J. Sutton and Lillian Viola Sutton--fifteen children, no multiple births, same parents (laughter), and thirteen of them lived to adulthood.  So, my father was seventh, I think, in the line of that, of his siblings.  And from all reports, it was a really big, bustling, and interesting family to be born in.  His father, my grandfather, was a principal of the local high school.  He was also a businessman.  He had some, he had a mattress factory, he had a lot of different businesses.  He firmly believed in doing a lot (laughter) in his community.  My grandmother was a teacher.  She'd been born in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And she and my grandfather met in, in (unclear), Texas and she taught.  My father, having such a large family, you were as much raised by your older siblings as you were by your parents.  And his oldest brother, John, was one of my favorite uncles.  I should first say that the, the--my family, my father's family was really motivated by education.  I mean, they were really, really focused on it.  Each of the thirteen children that lived to adulthood were college-educated.  And almost all of them were graduate-school-educated which, in that era, was pretty unheard of.  And I am third-generation college graduate and graduate school graduate because my grandfather, as a high school principal, had had extensive education as well.  So, my father, but, but that legacy of education was both passed on by my grandparents, but also very much promulgated amongst the siblings.
Story_ID: 103164
Speaker 1: My oldest uncle, Uncle John, was a scientist, and he worked at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee, Alabama] with George Washington Carver.  And my favorite story about my uncle is, which I always think should be some--made into some sort of epic novel for film or TV, is that when he was a scientist at George Washington Carver, this was in the '40s [1940s], the United States and Russian governments were friendlier.  And they were trading information, scientific information, voluntarily, and they asked Dr. Carver to come to Russia to share his, his research on the peanut, and to send a team over, and to be in that team.  Dr. Carver decided he was too old to go, but he sent a team which included my uncle.  So my uncle John spent ten years in Russia.  My uncle was one of, was, was very proficient in languages.  He could pick them up easily.  He spoke seven languages, so his ability to go to Russia and pick up Russian--what, he did it pretty quickly.  He lived in Russia for ten years.  He met a Russian woman and married her.  They had a son.  And then the Cold War descended, and neither the United States or Russian government thought it was a great idea to have a Russian-American, black-white couple (laughter) in the United States or in Russia (laughter).  And so, they ejected my uncle from Moscow, from Russia--would not let him bring his wife or his son.  And my uncle spent the next few decades trying to get back to his son.  And, and it--he would have--his--the tragedy continues because his wife died shortly after he left.  So, his son was put into foster care.  And then, my uncle spent decades trying to get back to Russia to be with his son, to try to bring his son to the United States.  The--and, and I came into the story in the early '60s [1960s], remembering that we pick up my uncle from the Aeroflot flights at JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport].  He lived in New York by this time.  And he had remarried a wonderful woman who, my Aunt Betsy [ph.], who completely understood and, and supported his efforts, and so every once in a while, he would go, as often as he could, he would go over to Moscow and go to court and try to plead for the ability to bring his son back.  And we'd have to go pick him up at the airport when he landed--these Aeroflot flights, and he would be very frustrated.  He also was the first from--it was from him that I first, ever heard the FBI having a file on you because he maintained that they had all these documents on him and, you know, he was really, bright.  We used to--I mean, he was--the family's joke was he was the genius of the family.  And, you know, there is sort of a thin line between genius and eccentricity.  And almost now, so he would really talk all the time about being, you know, this file on him.  And, you know, the family, of course, believed him, but he was thought to be a little, sort of eccentric at best until the Freedom of Information Act opened up the (laughter) the, the files.  He was--lived long enough to be able to get his file, and it was reams and reams and reams of information so he was not wrong.  But the end of the story with my cousin--I, so I grew up hearing that I had a cousin in Russia.  And his name was Juan which was, was, Juan Sutton [ph.].  That was how his name was pronounced in Russia and never met when he was growing up.  I'd see pictures of him.  And when--the saddest part of the story is just--only when my uncle was dying that the Russian government allowed the son who, by that time, had grown and was married and had a son of his own, to come to the United States to visit his papa.  And so, he was able to see his father.  I can't actually now remember whether he saw him on his death bed or after he died immediately, but he was able to come, and promptly brought his family here and never went back.  And so, in San Antonio, Texas, lives my cousin, Juan Sutton and his wife, his Russian wife and Russian son, and (laughter), and he is, he looks like my uncle.  He laughs like my uncle, but his English is really limited (laughter).  And so, that's my uncle John (laughter) and that's--I always imagined that, that story could be told somewhere because it just, just all the drama and the tragedy, and my uncle never got to spend time with his son.  I actually talked to my cousin recently to get his side of the story and it was true.  I mean, I heard that--it's almost legend, you know, because I didn't get to see the two of them together.  And my, my cousin confirmed it.  And I, I said, how was it for you knowing that your father was somewhere, you know, trying to--how did you cope because when he was adopted by--he was adopted by a single man who it sounds, sort of used him as a valet, but in a good way.  It wasn't a, an abusive relationship, but taught him how to take care of things, you know, iron, and, and sort of, they lived--this, this gentleman that he lived with sounded sufficiently paternal, but not completely paternal and so, I asked him.  It didn't sound horrible, but it didn't warm and loving.  And I said, how were you able to cope?  He said, I knew that papa was trying to get me out.  I knew, I always knew he would come and see me, and I knew that my papa was working to, to, get me.  So, anyway, that's, that's my uncle John and--
Speaker 2: So, how, how old was Juan when his father when they got--
Speaker 1: He was probably in his forties, his forties or late fifties.
Story_ID: 103165
Speaker 1: He [Lewis' uncle, John Sutton] was the oldest.
Speaker 2: --he was the oldest of the, of the thirteen.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oldest, and well--actually, I, and I, I keep saying fifteen because there were some--well, George and Libby died, so thirteen is the number.  I grew up thinking fifteen--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because, you know, we had counted for everyone but--
Speaker 2: Right, thirteen.  So, how far back do you know the family history on the Sutton side?
Speaker 1: I, I, in terms of my active knowledge, it goes only back to my grandfather's father or actually--probably it stays best with my grandfather [Samuel Sutton] who was born in 1863 and was born when there was still slavery, but shortly before it was abolished.  And the legal abolition of it didn't mean the immediate removal of it from where he was.  He was born in Richmond, Virginia.  And so, family legacy is unclear as to whether he was actually a slave when he was born or he was just, he was born--he was not enslaved because it was the year of the [Emancipation] Proclamation.  But he was born in Richmond, Virginia, and we just recently discovered there is a branch of the Sutton family still in Richmond because he and his brother were separated.  No--their fathers were brothers.  The two Sutton brothers were separated and they--one stayed in, in Richmond.  The other one went to Texas.  So, I know that my grandfather, I know that the Sutton name came from an English captain of a ship now.  Whether that was a slave ship or what kind of ship that was, I don't know, but I can't trace it back to Africa.  I don't know where the roots are there, but that--it really starts with my grandfather.
Speaker 2: So, when you, your--okay, so they, they settled in San Antonio [Texas] when they--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, that's an interesting, they're not--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I know here's San Antonio then, right.
Speaker 1: No, it was a predominantly German town, as I recall.  And so, it was pretty integrated.  I remember that my, my family talks about having German neighbors.  It was a really sleepy town at that time.  It's really--and then, frankly, I don't know why San Antonio versus Austin [Texas] or Houston [Texas].  But my grandfather was really--I guess he knew he was going to have a big family and he really wanted to lay down roots.  And there was a lot of opportunity for him there.  He really, as I said, he was the principal of the high school and he had a mattress factory.  And the interesting thing about both my father [Oliver Sutton] and my uncle Percy, who are more well-known in New York City [New York] than the rest of the family, that they both left San Antonio because they felt as if in order to make names for themselves, they had to get out from under their father because anything they did in San Antonio would be regarded as Sam's sons.  They didn't want to be, they didn't want anything they did to be just because their father had done so much.  So, while they appreciated it, they definitely wanted to go somewhere else and make their own mark.  So, it's funny that sort of even back then, there was the sense of, you know, you don't want your, you don't--you want to step out from under the shadow of, of your father's accomplishments.  So, but, but in terms of--
Speaker 2: So, your grandfather was Samuel?
Speaker 1: Yes, my grandfather was Samuel.
Story_ID: 103166
Speaker 1: And all of the children went to, all of his [Lewis' grandfather, Samuel Sutton] children, all my father [Oliver Sutton]'s siblings went to predominantly black colleges.  I guess, historically, black colleges and my father went to Tuskegee [Institute, now Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama].  You name the college--somebody went.  When my aunts went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]--and I believe went, some went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  They were just, they were all over the map, and they went to a lot of them.  And so, they grew up understanding that there was something that they had to do.  And as I was saying before, the point of their being so many is that like--by the, they was a spread amongst.  It wasn't like fifteen in fifteen years.  So, the older ones started taking care of the younger ones.  And it was the job of the older ones to work to help pay for the schooling of the younger ones.  So, the expectation was not only that you would go to college, but that it would be paid for because the family worked together to make sure there was enough money to pay for everybody.  So, my older aunts and uncles, my aunt Lillian was the oldest girl in the family.  And she, she became a teacher and she--they worked really hard.  I mean, they were sort of pseudo parents.  I grew up--my uncle [John Sutton] being that sort of quasi-eccentric over-in-Russia guy wasn't as (laughter), wasn't as front and center.  But my aunt Lillian was definitely the, the matriarch, the second matriarch of the family.  And amongst the other siblings, there was my aunt Carrie Jane, but I never knew--she died before I was born, but she was a psychiatrist.  And my uncle, Garlington Jerome, who went by the name of G.J., became a state legislator in San Antonio Texas].  I had an uncle, Alexander Carver, named after George Washington Carver, the Carver part, who was very active in the NAACP in San Antonio.  I think--and, and my aunts were all educated.  They all were teachers--my aunt Cora Mary.  I'm struggling a little bit because in the family, every family had a, family member had a nickname that was totally divorced from their actual name (laughter).  So, I have to remember what their actual names are before 'cause I'm tempted to refer to them.  I mean, for example, I had an aunt, Cora Mary Sutton, and we always called her Janie, so I (laughter), in order to be--make it on the record, I need to give their actual names.
Story_ID: 103167
Speaker 1: But the funny story about their emphasis on education, and how it translated into my life is that my father [Oliver Sutton] decided, based on his family--two things:  He decided where I was going to school and what I was going to do.  He decided--and this always when I was very young (laughter) before, before I am--I am sure when I was five, he decided these things.  He decided that I was going to go to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] because either a sister had gone to Spelman, or no one had gone to Spelman, but Spelman was a school that I should go to.  And he decided that I should be a doctor because his sister, Carrie [Jane Sutton], had been a doctor, and there was time for another doctor in the family.  Well, when I was twelve, he took--we went, we used to drive a lot from San Antonio [Texas], from New York to San Antonio.  We would make road trips in the summer time.  And on one road trip, we stopped in Atlanta [Georgia], and he showed me Spelman University.  The purpose of this particular stop was to show me the university to which I, I would--it's a college, university?  But he would show where I was going to college.  My, my--11, 10, 12-year-old recollection of this, when I got out of the car, I, you know, it's sort of like, I can see it, like a scene from a movie in my mind.  I got out of the car, and the tumbleweed blew by.  And the sun beat down on me as this tumbleweed, and I didn't even know what a tumbleweed was, but some big dust ball blew by.  It was very dusty.  It was extremely hot.  I saw the gates of this university, you know, the black gates, and I thought, there is no way, whatever this is (laughter).  I'm in a prison in (laughter), and a hair dryer--it's really hot, it's a prison.  I'm not going there (laughter).  And I--what I, I, I, so it's like, thanks, daddy, this is great.  I mean, we didn't do a tour.  He just sort of showed me.  He's like, this is Spelman, this is where you'll be going to college (laughter).  And so, I said, great, daddy--got back in the car and thought, okay, I know one thing (laughter), I don't know anything this place, but I'm not going here (laughter).  And so, I mean, no disrespect to Spelman.  I had no clue.  But it was a real hint in terms of parenting--do not take your child to the college you want them to attend when they are twelve in the middle of the summer if it's in the South.  So, that was a bad move on my father's part, but I understood his desire.  I mean, I don't want to paint him into the--I, I don't want to paint a picture of him of a guy that tried to dictate things.  I mean, he did actually try to dictate things, but he knew enough (laughter).  He was a smart enough guy to understand that he could, he could voice his opinion, but he wasn't--there was no, there was no desire to sort of make me do something that I didn't want to do.  I mean, for example, when I decided to go to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], he was completely and fully supportive, and there was no talk of, go or I'll say--I mean, something like that.  He just, he wanted me to be happy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But he figured, since he could probably figure that out me if I couldn't figure out for myself (laughter).  Why not tell me what I should do.
Speaker 2: He had dreams.
Speaker 1: He had dreams.
Speaker 2: But, but the important part of that story, I think, it leads towards my family's emphasis in education.  I mean, at twelve, he was telling me.  I've always said that in my family, it really wasn't a question.  It was never a question of are you going to college.  It was a question of, okay, where you're to grad-, what are you going to do?  You're going to college.  You probably should go to graduate school.  You probably think about what that is.  And so, it was a presumption and expectation that, that it was, that was what would happen.  My father would say to me when I was really young--
Story_ID: 103168
Speaker 1: I, I should take a step out of the story and say that we--I was born in Queens [New York].  And when I was maybe nine or ten, maybe a little younger, we moved to Manhattan [New York] which was very much against--we moved to Harlem [New York] in the '70s [1970s] which was very much against the grain.  Many families--my father was a lawyer [Oliver Sutton].  My mother [Renee Sutton] was a teacher.  They were solidly middle class.  And that move for African Americans, who were solidly middle class, was further east to Long Island [New York]--or their peers were moving to Hempstead [New York] and Uniondale [New York], and all, you know, with pools in the backyard.  And my father said, we're moving to 139th Street, and his rationale was simple.  He and his brother had a law practice in Harlem.  I think, by that time he was eyeing some political positions.  And my uncle Percy was already really seeking political--their clients were Harlem, Harlemites.  And it made sense for my father to get closer to his work in, in the neighborhood.  And he saw beautiful brownstones that he envisioned fixing up and being able to live in, and so, and, and sell.  I mean, he had a sort of--again, following in his father's [Samuel Sutton] footsteps, the multiple businesses.  He wanted to get into the neighborhood and see what he could do to fix it up.  So, we moved into Harlem which was (laughter), which was pretty bold at that point.  I mean, Harlem is, was, was, very much different than it is the Harlem of today.  It was--while it had pockets of beauty and, and great spirit and great enthusiasm among its residents, it was crime and loved drugs.  And it was a different, definitely a different...  So, so just the, that was the setting that staged in that we were, we were, by the time that, that--
Story_ID: 103169
Speaker 1: Let me jump in.  So, you're saying the two brothers that left San Antonio [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --were your father [Oliver Sutton]--
Speaker 2: And my Uncle Percy [Sutton].
Speaker 1: --and your, Percy?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are they--I know where your father's about--
Speaker 2: He's seventh, I believe, and my uncle Percy was the last.
Speaker 1: So, he was the youngest?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his story, which I'm sure has been told, if not by him, by others, is that he ran away from home when he was a teenager, and took a train to New York.  I have an Uncle Bill who was a Pullman porter.  He was--he worked on the trains, and he--now Bill might have been the only one.  Bill went to college, but I'm not sure if Bill graduated, but Bill was the, Bill was the gambler.  Bill was the, the bad boy and he was great.  I mean, I remember we would--he would stop in New York every once in a while.  And the train routes--and we would go have fun with Uncle Bill and his wife or girlfriend or whatever she was.  Anyway, so, my uncle stowed away on a train.  I don't think it was his brother's car, but and came to New York on his own.  And he had siblings.  I had my aunt Lillian was here at Teachers College at Columbia University [New York City, New York].  And there were other siblings up here, but he ran away to New York.  I think he felt, as the youngest and by that time, my--his father [Samuel Sutton] had been so well-established, I think he felt most the weight of the expectations and the weight of the San Antonio expectations.  And he was also that, you know--I guess, in part, this focus on education was 'cause all of the children were pretty bright, pretty savvy, and really wanted to do things, and encouraged by their father to do so.  So, my uncle ran away (laughter).  They brought him back, but he was, he had his eyes on New York even before my father did.
Story_ID: 103170
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did your father [Oliver Sutton] talk about in terms of growing up?  Did he share any stories in, in San Antonio [Texas]?
Speaker 2: He--my sense of San Antonio, through my father and through my other uncles as I, as I said, it was very diverse.  It was--they had such a large family.  There was also, there was--I forgot to say that one of the other businesses was a funeral home business.  My uncle G.J. [Garlington Jerome Sutton], who went into the state legislature, also had a big mortuary, and my sense was that they had friends.  They had a couple of cousins, but because they were so large a family, and so much was always going on, that they were kind of a unit unto themselves.  But, because my father--I mean, my grandfather was a teacher, there was always, there was a principal of a high school--education was always focused on.  I mean, I, I think for my father, the expectation was that he would go to college.  It wasn't sort of the--a dream.  It was, okay, this is what happens.  This is, the next step is for, you know, follow--in my father's case, it was you would follow all of his siblings.  What's very interesting about all of the, all of the siblings is that, despite having been born into this large family, not--several of them had no children.  The most children any of them had was three.  I mean, I have one uncle who married a woman with a bunch of children, so there were many more in his family.  But in terms of getting children that he sired--three.  And so, what I know from everybody sort of half-joking stories was that it was tough.  I mean, there were a lot of people and, you know, mother--the running joke was that the grandmother was always pregnant.  I mean, that might, their mother, she was pregnant for a long time.  I mean, can you imagine--fifteen pregnancies, no multiple births?  There's just a lot of time to be childbearing.  And so, I sensed that while they were devoted to one another--they really enjoyed having siblings to fall back on--but because the relationship was a little different because the older siblings had sort of patriarch and matriarch perspectives, and because they were just so many of them, it was challenging to sort of find your own space.  They are all, they were very close.  There, there really were no outliers--no, no one that wasn't a real part of the family, but I don't sense--certainly none of them decided that was a good, a good enough experience to have a whole bunch of children themselves.
Story_ID: 103171
Speaker 1: So, how many, how strong is the legacy still in, in San Antonio [Texas]?
Speaker 2: It's pretty--well, it, it--
Speaker 1: And how many really stayed?  That's what--
Speaker 2: The ones who stayed--actually, only two of them really stayed because the, the women moved to San Francisco [California], interestingly.  All three--no, my Aunt Lillian stayed in San Antonio, but she passed away a long time ago.  So, she, like she was a very strong San Antonian, so my aunt Lillian stayed in San Antonio.  My Uncle G.J., Garlington Jerome, state legislator, legislator, obviously stayed there.  My Uncle Buster, but known as Alexander Carver, but we called Uncle Buster, he stayed there.  So, only three really stayed there and, and made their lives there.  My aunts, as I said, moved to San Francisco, interestingly--I guess one moved there, and the other one sort of moved in that direction, too.  And then, my father [Oliver Sutton] and my uncle [Percy Sutton] came to New York, so that's the sort of the three areas, but, but there wasn't--many of the, many of my cousins are in San Antonio and Houston [Texas].  And there's still a strong Sutton presence in San Antonio.  I have a cousin, Charles Andrews, who is the eldest cousin now, and his, although his mother was--he was born in San Francisco, he migrated back to San Antonio.  So, it certainly isn't anywhere nearly as strong.  There's a lot of, there were a lot of things in San Antonio, but they have Sutton names on them (laughter), not a lot.  But I mean, there's enough--you can learn about the Sutton family if you're in San Antonio if you--with, with an effort.  I mean, it's not like we're all over the place.  But there's still a strong enough presence that you can hear about it, but it's certainly not anywhere near as strong.  I would say that about where the Sutton family generally of that generation, really was, was focused on doing a lot in an era where it was hard, harder to do a lot.
Speaker 1: You know, it's interesting about blacks out of Texas because I find that their roots weren't that deep and they were landholding--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and so it sounds like the Sutton family was to San Antonio like [HM] John Rogers' family, the Stratfords, were, too, on [HM] Jewel [Lafontant-MANkarious]'s side--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --to Tulsa [Oklahoma].
Story_ID: 103172
Speaker 1: But let's, I want to talk to you about your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay, sure.
Speaker 1: Can you tell--give me her name and what you know?
Speaker 2: Her name was Renee Sutton, Renee Hopkins Sutton.  Hopkins was her maiden name.  Her, her actual name was Renee Audrey Hopkins Sutton, but she took her maiden name as her middle name when she got married, as I have.  I followed her example because so now, I'm Carol Sutton Lewis.  But she was Renee Hopkins Sutton.  She was born here in New York, and I am always so proud to say that I am third-generation native New Yorker because her mother [Ethleen Hopkins] was born in New York as well.  And often, in professional world, the professional world, you meet people.  New York is such a transient town for professionals, and people are incredulous that there are people who actually were born and raised here.  And so, I, not only was I born and raised here, but I come from a line of people born and raised here.  Her--my grandmother's mother and father were from different parts of the West Indies, but they came old, early enough to have my grandmother be born here.  And my grandmother was born in 1920-, no, that can't be--1904, I believe.  So, she was, she was, they've been here for a long time.  My mother was born in Harlem [New York] and moved to Queens [New York] when she was young.  So, it's only funny for her.  She's bounced back and forth between Queens and Harlem all of her life.  She was born maybe four blocks from where we ended up coming--living in, in Harlem.  And grew up, I think, to the age, until she got to high school.  And then, her family moved to Queens because that was the era when moving to Queens was sort of moving on up.  And you got a house and, you know, they shared a house with her grandparents, with my, my mother's grandparents, you know.  So, they had a two-family house in Queens.  And it wasn't until my mother--my mother was the--I was about to say it wasn't until my mother left home for school that she moved back to Manhattan [New York].  My mother was the first in her family to go to college.  And that was a real dream of hers--hers almost more, so than anyone else in her family, I mean, they were supportive, but my mother was really--she saw education as the way for her to improve her circumstances and she was smart.  She did well in school and so, she went to college, and worked through college to pay for it.  She went to Queens College [Flushing New York].  And we, we--when Tyler, my oldest was three, because I was pregnant with my son, Carter. We celebrated her 50th, her graduate, her 50th, her anniversary of graduating from Queens College, fifty years, so I was really proud of--I mean, I wasn't, I didn't grow up knowing that I should be proud of her.  But, but in retrospect, she worked really hard to--and, and she, she, and she, she encountered and endured some hardships.  I mean, I remember the stories vividly of--there was a prize that was given in high school, I believe, for--perhaps it was an academic prize.  And there was money involved, but it was maybe some sort of scholarship.  And they told her that they were going to give it to the other white student because they had some family issue.  It was sort of--it was fitting that she not get it.  She should give it up to the, the other person.  And that happened again in college.  I mean, she encountered a couple of incidents where she was--but she was but, she was--prejudice sort of got in the way.  She was, in both instances, it wasn't--didn't stop her, but she experienced several instances of being told that her ambition needed to be kept because there were other people who could take better advantage of the opportunities that the schools were offering.  And to her credit, she didn't let that stop her, but it sort of--she told me those stories.  So, in retrospect, like wow, they--I didn't, at the time, there was nothing I could do, but it was rather tough to hear that she was not as deserving or that, that prize that should have been hers was given to someone else because the thinking was they could make better use of it because, clearly, the, the opportunities were better for them than they were for her.  So, but she was, she went to, she graduated Queens College.  Then she enrolled in Columbia [University, New York City, New York] for Teachers College.  And it was then that she sort of--she was paying for her way through graduate school.  And after that got tough after a year or so to paying her way and so she stopped, she sort of took a leave, and started working.  And she started working for the phone company and she worked for the phone company for several years.  And just to fast forward, she, ultimately, she got married and my, my father got married--had my brother and I, and then went back, and got her master's in, in teaching, and then got another sort of a second graduate degree in teaching, reading specialty.  So, it's so funny that I, as I said to you, my mother passed away in July of this year [2013], and I wrote her obituary and it was really a daunting task.  You have to do in a real short period of time.  And as much time as I spent with my mother for all of my life, writing her obituary was daunting because you don't think about your family members in terms of how you, their accomplishments, and how you cite them.  But after I forced myself to do this in a really short period of time, I stepped back and thought, it was so enlightening to me.  I, I sort of saw in this moment--this full picture of a woman who was fiercely independent and worked really, really, really hard to get what she knew she needed.  Whereas on my father's side of the family, there was a great deal of support, both philosophically, financially, and, and there were high expectations, but there was a lot of support for those expectations.  My mother's family did not have as high expectations--not because they didn't, they just didn't have them.  And they couldn't support them financially and so, it took a lot of grit from my mother to stay with her dream.  And she, she really did a great job of doing that.

Speaker 1: I said, where was she, your--
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton]'s, mother's family was from an--from Dominica that, not at--my, my grandfather on my mother's side's family was from Antigua.  But in both instances, my grandfather [John Hopkins] and my grandmother [Ethleen Hopkins] were born in the United States.  And so, interestingly, my mother bristled at being called West Indian because she didn't--unlike today when the legacy of West Indian heritage is, is carried very proudly, my mother preferred her African American heritage.  She preferred to be viewed as African American, literally, because she'd never set foot in the Caribbean.  But also, I think she viewed it as--she was, she viewed herself as very much part of the African American experience.  Of course, they didn't call it that, the Negro experience, and to suggest that she wasn't born and raised here and part of that experience, I think offended her, interestingly.  I mean, it wasn't so much a dislike of another culture, but it was more ownership of the culture that was hers.
Speaker 1: She wanted to be part of the American dream.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: She was not--this wasn't something that she was--she didn't want to be viewed as someone who had come from somewhere else to, to--I mean, of course, we all came from somewhere else.  But she didn't want to be known as West Indian.  She wanted to be known--I mean, she, she, from her perspective, she was black American.  She was--the West Indian heritage was just that.  It was in the past.  It wasn't an active part of her, of her being.

Speaker 1: So, what, how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: My parents met because my father [Oliver Sutton]--I'm thinking the easiest way to say this.  They were in a wedding together.  My mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was the maid, a, a bridesmaid, and my father was the maid of honor for their two friends, and they met at the wedding.  And the neat thing is that the couple that they, that was getting married--the woman in the couple was, it's, was a--
Story_ID: 102291
Speaker 1: You had asked me about my mom [Renee Hopkins Sutton]--
Speaker 2: Your mother.
Speaker 1: Should I--
Speaker 2: Well, we were talk-, you were talking about West Indian and the--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  And, and, so my, my parents, as I, my parents--I think, what I was talking about my parents--
Speaker 2: I asked you about how they met, right, in the--
Speaker 1: They met, and they met in November and they were engaged in February of the next year, and they were married the following August, so it was quick (laughter).
Speaker 2: And yet, it's a wedding?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then they--wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know they, they--
Speaker 2: Love at first sight.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know it was very quick.  It was good.  My, my father [Oliver Sutton] was nine years older than my mother.  And I think that my mother really liked that and liked the fact that there was a man--she often said, I was bringing a man home, not a, not a young man--a man.  And her father [John Hopkins] was a really strong, and my grandfather was really a force in the family.  And I think that my mother was happy to have found a mate who could stand up to her father, you know, who she felt was someone that could be as--
Speaker 2: Forceful.
Speaker 1: --forceful.  And, and, so that was great.  They, they were married and happily married for--until my father died which was in 1983.
Story_ID: 102292
Speaker 1: I had mentioned some time ago about my father [Oliver Sutton]'s interest in my education, and I just wanted to bring back that story.  I, I stepped out of the story to describe where we lived.  We lived in Queens [New York].  And as I said, many people were moving further east, but my father wanted to move to the city.  And I was not that happy about that because I, you know, get pools, and people have really nice houses and we're living in this brownstone.  And at that point, it was gut-renovated and it didn't look like a fun place.  And Harlem [New York City, New York] certainly wasn't my idea of--it wasn't picturesque (laughter) under any circumstances.  And there were lots of people hanging out on the street.  And my father said to me that, first of all, it was important for me to understand that what people had was not important as to--that didn't mean--that wasn't who they were.  And so, my looking at the pools and the, the, all these professionals, doctors and lawyers and dentists who had moved further east--that was fine for them.  But that wasn't the mark of success as far as my father was concerned.  He also said to me that he made a vow to me.  I remember this--not the exact wording, but he had, but from when I was young, he said, I will always pay for wherever you want to go to school.  He said, and that will mean, that may mean that you may not have the house with the pool, or you may not have all the fanciest clothes that you think you want at the time.  But just know, that wherever you want to go school, I will always make sure that it's paid for.  And I think he started saying this to me when I was really young because I remember hearing that saying, okay, but I want my Fred Brown shoes (laughter)--sort of, that's not going to be a pool in the summer time.  I remember feeling like, okay, that's whatever (laughter).  That's not a really good answer but okay (laughter).  But if you fast forward, I happened to pick really expensive schools--I mean, and I did it.  I had the luxury of never having the, the ability, the financial ability to go to school--enter into my calculus.  And, you know, it's funny when you have things, you don't realize how--I mean, my father didn't, he would tell me that was important.  Obviously, from when I was little, he wanted me to know that.  But that goes back to his expression of, "that and 50 cents will get you into a subway."  My family didn't ever think of the things that we had or were able to do as things that made us different or better than anyone else.  But they definitely did make me different.  I didn't know this, but when I got older and realized that, that was such a gift and such a privilege.  I mean, it's good that I knew it was privilege ultimately.  But I just grew up knowing that wherever I wanted to go to school, my father would pay for it.  And so, when I decided to go to--at the time, the most expensive law school in the nation, Stanford Law School [Stanford, California], my father did not blink. Even though my choice was between Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Stanford Law School, and as far as my family was concerned, there wasn't a choice.  I was East Coast.  I mean, why would--everyone was just sort of getting out the Crimson and then flying the flags.  And when I told them that I was going to Stanford, the disappointment was palpable.  Now my uncle Percy [Sutton] went so far as to try to lobby me not to do it.  He would have people who had gone to Harvard call me.  I mean, this--he was on a full-out campaign to change my mind.  My father didn't do that at all.  Like I said before, even though he was trying to tell me where to go to college, he was--when I was twelve--he wanted me to be happy,   And he accepted my decision, even though it meant paying more money than (laughter) and so, I was going to a school that wasn't his first choice, and he had to pay more money.  So, when I can--I think I cringe now when I think of how close to the time that I needed to wish him that I would say, oh, daddy, by the way, I need this check (laughter).  And even though, in today's dollars, it sounds like it wasn't that much money.  I mean, it was a lot of money, a lot of money to say, oh, by the way, I need that check for--and, and so, my parents really, together, gave me a life where I was able to have so much without really knowing and, and not making a big deal about it.
Story_ID: 102293
Speaker 1: My mom [Renee Hopkins Sutton] really--I, I lived through some of her dreams in terms of the ease with which I went to college.  And I'll never forget that in my junior year, I really wanted to go into a program that took you to the South of France.  Through Penn, I went to the University of Pennsylvania [Pittsburg, Pennsylvania], and I--they had a program that I had my eyes on since freshman year where you could spend part of the summer in, at the Cannes Film Festival because Penn had a program that they had--they were situated in a villa that was near the South of France, and you could spend the three weeks.  They had a professor who had connections with the film industry, and you spend these three weeks at the festival--two weeks at the festival, and another week in the south of--it just sounded the--the combination of film and French and (laughter).  And my father [Oliver Sutton], who was my--I was daddy's girl.  It's like, daddy, I want to do--he's like, I am not paying for that.  Are you kidding me?  He said, I pay for all for all of your college.  This is not college.  This is a trip to Europe.  I mean, I'm not paying for that.  And I was astounded.  I mean, it was really--he was adamant.  And my mother said, I want her to do this.  I'm going to pay for it.  That taught me so much about--she was very, she had an independent income that she could decide to use to do that.  And it was really important to her that I get to do something that she thought she would have loved to have done.  I mean, it was really--I did, of course, I didn't realize at the time, it's like great.  Somebody's paying for this (laughter).  But really, I was gifted so often.  I was so privileged and blessed to have this without--I, I took it for granted.  I was, I was--but not in a negative sense.  I was happy to be able to take that for granted.  That was really a luxury.  That's the word I'm looking for.  It was such a luxury that I didn't acknowledge it was a luxury at the time.  I really, growing up, I thought, wow, I don't have those, you know, those fancy shoes.  I don't have--I mean, I wasn't spending a lot of time feeling that way.  I didn't feel--I didn't want for anything, but I did feel like we were making choices that were different than some of his peers, some of his fellow lawyers.  And he became a judge, and some of the people that he worked with were making choices that gave them lives that looked a lot fancier.
Story_ID: 102294
Speaker 1: But the flip side of that is that by the time, my uncle [Percy Sutton], or, or--not the flip side, but an, an additional aspect to that is that my uncle was in politics by that time.  And my father [Oliver] was dipped into politics.  He had to run for his bench, in his seat on the bench, he had to run for the first judgeship that he got.  He was elected to the Civil Court of New York.  He ultimately was appointed to the State Supreme Court, but he was elected.  So, there were--politics sort of ran in my family.  They ran in my entire family.  I have many members of my family throughout my father's side who were interested in politics and who were active in politics.  And that's where that expression, "that and 50 cents will get you on the subway," came from, because if you're going to be a politician, if you, if it is in you to want to help people in a political way, that concept is opposed, diametrically opposed, to the concept that was kind of rampant and still is, to some degree, in the black community that there were haves and have-nots.  There was an elitism--and there still is to some extent--in the black community, sort of that bourgeois mentality that if you achieve a certain level, you should associate with only those who achieve that level.  And while it's sort of despicable on the one hand, you kind of get that you want, if you spend all this time focusing on bringing your family to the certain height.  You get that you want to associate with other people that are in that same level.  It sort of--if it's easier, it makes sense.  So, I, I don't--I get where that came, but my family was very much--not so much anti-that because it wasn't--we didn't talk about that a lot.  But definitely pro--whatever you have and 50 cents will get you on the subway.  I mean, that is sort of interesting.  It, you know, it, it's sort of, you know, whatever you can do, or whoever you get to meet, or whatever you do in life is great but just know.  I mean, it's sort of the equivalent of everybody puts their pants on one leg at a time.  It really--they really both felt very strongly that sort of the glam life, the sort of what, what looked like great success and, and fun from afar, nothing was as good as it looked up close.  And just remember, basically, you know, everybody pays the same amount to get on the subway.
Story_ID: 102295
Speaker 1: And, and actually, that's funny because my father [Oliver Sutton] believed in, in talking about schooling and education, my father's theory on school was that public school worked until it didn't work.  He didn't think that because certainly I had academic--I, I had academic promise that I should be put in a private school.  He firmly believed that private schools were for children that needed additional attention.  And you should pay for that additional attention, and that can help them get to where they need to be.  But I didn't need that additional attention because I was doing well in public school.  And so, what my brother, who didn't fare as well in school, was put in private school, it seemed to me that there were a lot of advantages to be in private school.  But I never really felt--I didn't feel deprived.  I just felt like he needed private school, and I didn't need private school.  So, when we moved to Manhattan [New York] and I got older here, and I met all of these young black people who were going to these private schools in New York City, it was sort of a new world for me.  But I didn't feel like, oh, shoot, I'm sorry I missed that.  I, I, first, I thought, oh, those poor people (laughter).  They need that.  But I didn't understand--it's so funny because being a native and having raised children here, and now understanding the value, but also the, the--what private schools are in New York City.  People always say to me, you know, where did you go to school?  And I proudly say, I went to public school, but there was not ever a sense that, oh, I should be going to private school.  I mean, that was sort of--I didn't even understand.  I mean, I understood that they existed, but I didn't understand the benefits other than--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Certainly, if you, if you didn't need those benefits, what were you paying for so--
Story_ID: 102296
Speaker 1: So, so your, so I'm going to ask you about your earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is probably informed by pictures I've seen.  There's some classic pictures that--and one is of me in what passed for a walker when I was really young.  This was sort of a device that you kinda fit the child in and there are little wheels on it.  And (laughter), it just fit around the child (laughter)--no bumpers (laughter), no--.  And, and it'll lock, like there was a little circle at the bottom and it was a lock.  And I, I remember a picture of, I remember the picture, but I'm, I've convinced myself, but I actually have the memory.  This is when we lived in Queens [New York].  We had a patio off the back of the house.  And I would--and be in my walker and my older brother would be in the backyard.  But the dog, Rusty, would sit by me and the dog was my protector.  And my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was able to go into the house and look out the window from the kitchen, and see me and my brother playing.  I wasn't playing.  I was just sort of little enough to play with whatever was in the little tray in front of me.  But the dog would just sit by me (laughter) and not let anybody come near me.  So, my dog was my first babysitter (laughter), Rusty, but that's my earliest memory.  We--
Speaker 1: I lived in Jamaica, Queens [New York], and a lovely--I think it was a predominantly black neighbor-, it was, it was black neighborhood and St. Albans, Jamaica, and had really fond memories of growing up.  And we had a backyard and front stoop and walked to school and--
Speaker 2: So, how old were you when you remember being in the little--
Speaker 1: I was probably--well, I wasn't really, I was probably, how old--now I have to see what makes sense because if I wasn't, if I was locked into something, I had to be pretty little.
Speaker 2: You had to be pretty little.
Speaker 1: Maybe, I mean, I have to say it's probably the memory borne of that picture.  I've seen it so often, so maybe I was, I don't know, two, I don't know.  But, but school probably marks my earliest memory of actually on my own memory.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 102297
Speaker 1: And I went to P.S. 116, which was--oh, maybe a ten or fifteen minute walk from home.  And the thing that I, I, the first thing that I really remember about elementary school is that I learned to read when I was three.  My mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] taught me to read and I picked it up really easily.  And my uncle John [Sutton], the eccentric older, the eccentric oldest in the family, was an educator as well, and he would help me.  He had this device which, which would flicker words.  And I would have to guess the word, know the word--it would tell you the word from a nanosecond, and you had to see if you could read it quickly.  And so, he was really a big proponent of me learning to read early and getting as much information as possible.  But my mom, my mom read early, too, so I learned to read when I was--so I knew how to read before I got to kindergarten.  That's the point.  I--my mom put me in a nursery school.  I was valedictorian of the nursery school.  I don't know what that means, but I did make a speech (laughter).  I remember they told me--I had a picture of me in a little cap and gown, and then I made a speech.  I can't imagine what I said, but in any event, it was like a park nursery school.  It wasn't anything particularly precious.  It was just--sounded really cute.  So, then kindergarten, I learned to read.  I knew how to read.  And open school night, or whatever they call it--yeah, open school night of kindergarten, my mother comes up, probably open school afternoon, and they knew she was a teacher.  And they're sort of--the teachers had kinda let their guard down a little.  And they're talking about, you know, the class. And they said, can you believe it?  There's one kid in here that knows how to read.  Oh, my God, what a drag--not, not a drag, they said, how ridiculous is that?  She tries to read the stuff on the captions and the slides, and it's ridiculous.  What parent would teach their kid how to read ahead of time?  It's such a disruption.  My mother promptly had me switch to the other kindergarten class (laughter) where the teacher let me read the captions out loud (laughter) from the bottom of the slide.  And so, that was the earliest example of parental engagement which I, which I modeled, and when I became a, a parent with a child in school.  I remember that.  She's like, okay (laughter).  She never identified herself as that mother, but she's like, we're out of this classroom (laughter).  So, school, I liked school a lot.  School came relatively easy to me.  I skipped second grade because I knew how to read.  That was apparently what you were doing in second grade, so I skipped.  I went from first to third, and that actually worked out really well socially because a lot of the kids in my neighborhood happened to be a year older than I.  So, I went into the class with my friends and, and then, I did well.  I mean, you know, I had to beat back teacher's pet claims, you know, but, but, you know, they knew.
Story_ID: 102298
Speaker 1: My third grade teacher, who I still see, is--her name is Portia Paterson, and she is our former governor, David Paterson's mother.  And her husband is [HM] Basil Patterson, who is a very well-known attorney here.  And I loved Mrs. Patterson.  And I'm sure, in retrospect, she was really looking out for me because she knew my family.  But I didn't feel more looked out, I didn't feel the object of her attention over the other people in the third grade.  It was great 'cause I was her class when I got moved into.  When I, when you skip a grade, you spend a couple of weeks in the grade you're in, and then they move you up, so it wasn't like I just never went to second grade.  I went to second grade for a couple of weeks.  And she made that transition wonderful, a wonderful transition.  And she was so--it was like, this lovely black lady in the front of the room.  It was like mom--sort of.  I mean, she wasn't, you know, but it just--it was, in retrospect, it was such a nice thing to have Mrs. Paterson as my teacher.  She was kind, she was wonderful, and that was the thing about public school, and public school in the, a black neighborhood back in that era, they were just really nice teachers.  I mean, who, of course, there were really horrible teachers (laughter), but they were really nice teachers who just made being in school very pleasant.  I liked school--not only was the work interesting, but I really liked having people who knew me and, and who would watch out for me so--
Story_ID: 102299
Speaker 1: So, let me ask.  What--can you take me back to that, that time period that you're talking about?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And I'd like you to describe what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: I--it's so funny.  Just recently, I was thinking about--I, I, my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] made a big deal about birthdays always.  And I make a big deal about birthdays--mine, my family's.  And the biggest thing about birthdays, one of the biggest things about birthdays growing up was you got to pick your meal for the--you got to pick the family meal.  And my meal was always fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and string beans.  And so, a family smell, a smell that is fond, a fond smell (laughter) of my childhood was that meal because that was my birthday.  I mean, that wasn't the only time we had that meal, but I got to call it, and I called the same meal every year.  And so, food smells are very comfortable smells for me growing up.  My mom was not the classic--she was a good cook.  But that was not--our lives did not rotate around the kitchen.  And I would not say when you asked me to think about the contribution my mother made to the family--certainly, she cooked regularly.  But that was not, she was not that beloved cook that I had to save all the recipes.  And I don't--I mean, I cook when I have to.  I don't have that love.  She loved cooking.  I don't love it but, in other words, that wasn't her thing even though she really loved doing it.  So, but, but this, the--I think it was as much the ability to control the meal, and to be the special--get all the attention and have the meal be mine (laughter).  That was golden. The sights, I really enjoyed having my very--being really young in that neighborhood.  There was trick or treating.  There was--it was sort of a lot of kind of "Beaver" Cleaver, you know, suburban almost moments.  And while I treasure the time--I, I loved that we moved to Manhattan [New York].  And I often would say I'm from Manhattan, for forgetting, but the--I mean, I can say I was born in Queens [New York], but I grew up in Manhattan.  There were aspects of being born in that, in, in a neighborhood with a front stoop and a backyard that, I think, really cemented for me the importance of the family picture, and sort of eating together at the table.  There wasn't bustle around us all the time growing up.  There was definitely--it was quiet.  It was residential and I think that was a good beginning.
Speaker 1: And then so, what about smells?
Speaker 2: Well, besides the chicken smell?
Speaker 1: Chicken, okay, chicken.
Speaker 2: I would say--I mean, my parents, I would say perfume smells because my mother and father went to benefits and things because they were politically active, and so they were going out.  They went out to lots of Democratic Party things, political things mostly, but they also belonged to sort of organizations.  My mother was an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha], and my father [Oliver Sutton] was a Kappa [Alpha Psi], but my sense is that their partying was not so much with the sororities' (unclear).  They were always doings, like political things.  They were doing their version of, you know, benefits now for organizations, but I think they were mostly political.  So, my mom had to do a lot of dressing up and going out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Interestingly, she's pretty introverted by nature, and would much rather have stayed home (laughter).  But I grew up thinking it was the most glamorous thing in the world.  And so, I couldn't wait till I got older so I could sort of do what--
Speaker 1: Go out, right.
Speaker 2: --spritz the perfume (laughter) and go out and come back and tell me, here I would, you know, they would tell me all about it and--
Speaker 1: How about sounds?
Speaker 2: Music.  Stereo was in the living room and R&B, 45s, showing my age, you know (laughter), the spindle in the middle.  I--when I was still in Queens, we would--the RKO Valencia, no, the RKO Alden and Loew's Valencia Theatres were right across the street from another in, on Jamaica Avenue.  And when they, they'd show movies in the daytime, but as soul groups became popular, they would have shows every once in a while.  They'd have like shows of the Chi-lites and Stylistics.  And, you know, they would make their way out to Queens, and we would get tickets and go.  I was really young.  I used to have go with older people, but Black Ivory, which is a group that, if you talk to anyone from Queens, they would know instantly.  I'm not sure they had one national hit (laughter), but they, they were really big in Queens.  They were from Queens.  Black Ivory, Ivory would perform. Music and culture.  There was a park near us that had Shakespeare in the park, black Shakespeare in the park.  It was St. Albans Park and they had--there was a black theatre company, and they would put on Shakespeare in the park.  So this, the, the sights and the, the sounds were the musical scene.

Speaker 1: And, and I should say that my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] used New York City, Manhattan [New York] particularly, as a real classroom for me.  She was, she loved all different cultural things.  She loved opera, which I did never share her interest in, but she loved museums.  And we would come to the city all the time and do things.  And then when I moved here, we would do things even more.  But we'd go to Lincoln Center.  We'd go--I can still remember standing in line to see the "Mona Lisa" when it came to the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art].  I don't know what year that was.  All I remember was that it was a long time, and I didn't quite understand why we're doing this.  And I remember seeing this picture when it was all done and profoundly feeling like what was that about.  But I will tell you that when I'm fortunate enough to travel to Paris [France], I always go to the Louvre.  I make a bee line for the "Mona Lisa", even if I have time for nothing else because I remember sort of feeling when I was really young that whatever it was I was doing, it was special (laughter), and that it was important for us to do that.  I also stood in line with a "Harlem on My Mind" exhibit.  I mean, there--it wasn't just one of the classics.  My mother--
Story_ID: 102301
Speaker 1: And then the flip side of that is because my parents were very politically active, I stood on part, picket line, so I can remember, I remember this again through a photograph.  But I was five and we, we were picketing a place called Rochdale Village [New York City, New York] because they were not hiring black contractors on the site.  And because a five-year-old is in the picket line, they took a picture.  And I watched my neighbors get arrested, and it was really frightening to me, but my father [Oliver Sutton] was a lawyer that was getting them out.  And I remember at the time thinking like, ahh!  But the, the comfort was that was my mom [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was with me, and I was doing what they were doing.  I was not--I, I vaguely had the sense that we were doing what we were supposed to be doing, but as long as my mom was there and my father, everybody was telling me everything was okay.  I, I was fine.  I mean, it was, it was so.
Story_ID: 102302
Speaker 1: The, the sights and the sounds--I mean, the church, I mean, we went to church.  Church was not a--it was an important part of our lives, but we used--our church-going, I went to Sunday school and I belonged to the neighborhood church.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the name of, what, denom--
Speaker 1: St. Albans Congregational [Church].
Speaker 2: Oh, it was Congregational.
Speaker 1: And it was a triangular-shaped church.  The whole structure of the church was triangular.  So, if I ever meet anyone in Queens [New York City, New York], I say I went to the triangule, they know what I'm talking about.  And our experience--I think, my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was Episcopalian, my father [Oliver Sutton] was a Baptist.  My father ultimately became Episcopalian when he moved back to the city, much to his family's (laughter)--not quite dismay, but sort of shock (laughter).  But for them, they, they wanted me to go to church.  They didn't want--I, I didn't have so much, I had religious instruction in church.  I think they just thought it was really important to go to church to understand God, to understand the stories, to know, to understand the morals and the parables.  But it wasn't--we weren't a religious family where I didn't grow up hearing my parents' reliance on God or Jesus.  Or, I mean, they--it, it wasn't, they all had personal, spiritual beliefs, strong ones.  But they didn't feel--they felt like there was an obligation to introduce us to religion, and to give us the opportunity to form our own.  But there really wasn't.  We had to say blessing and I mean, there were things that-I got confirmed.  But it wasn't, and it wasn't perfunctory.  It was important, but it wasn't--it was regarded as a very personal choice, like here are the tools to figure out what spiritual sustenance you need--find it and get it.  We have our own.  It was--that sounds kind of off-putting, but it, it wasn't--my mother certainly, certainly she's Episcopalian, and that the religion doesn't--isn't really sort of everybody has to feel the Spirit in the same way.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: It was a really, so I appreciated that.  I, I, and I--we've sort of--my husband [HM William Lewis] and I have sort of done the same for our children.  We want to make sure that we--I home-schooled them in Sunday School, my kids, because we couldn't coordinate the Sunday School.  They didn't want to go to Sunday School while we were in church, and they would sit in church and fall asleep.  It didn't really seem like they were getting the same thing, so we did home school Sunday School for years and years and years (laughter).
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: In fact, when they're all together, once in a while, I'll still make them do (laughter), do Sunday School.
Speaker 2: So, you, you describe, in many ways, a, a privileged, but activist, you know--
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: --very aware of the things that are happening in society--
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: --you know, and that way.  Now--
Story_ID: 102303
Speaker 1: I want to, I want you, describe your block to me in Queens [New York].
Speaker 2: My block?
Speaker 1: And there's a, the other thing--I want to get some chronology.  What age are you when you move into Harlem [New York City, New York], your family 'cause that--
Speaker 2: You know, that age slides around in my memory.  I'm sure there's a real easy way to figure that out (laughter), but I guess since I'm, I'm the last man standing, I have to do some research for this.  Nobody's around me to ask.  I want to be seven, but I'm probably more like ten or eleven (laughter).  I mean, I, I feel like I was younger, but I was probably--
Speaker 1: Do you know what grade you were in?
Speaker 2: I was in--well, see, that's confusing, too, because I was young for my age.
Speaker 1: Because you skipped?
Speaker 2: Let's say, I think that I was, let's say, I was eleven, or maybe even twelve, because I was in high school, but I was young in high school so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I graduated high school when I was sixteen, so I was--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --so let's say, for--I was twelve.  I could, but I feel as if, in part, because my father [Oliver Sutton] worked in the city.  We spent a lot of time in the city and I went to high school in the city, so I--every I, I--
Speaker 1: But what about junior high, where'd you go?
Speaker 2: Oh, junior high, umm, junior high, I went to a Queens junior high, so I must have been eleven or twelve when I moved.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I, I feel like, it's funny--I want to put myself much younger because I feel like I kind of grew up in Manhattan [New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I think it was just I had so much more independence, and I really did grow up more on my own in Manhattan than I did when I was in Queens.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, yeah, I went to-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And--
Story_ID: 102304
Speaker 1: And so, the other thing I have a question about.  Your father [Oliver Sutton], the, the judge, when he--what were the--do you remember how old you were when he became the, you know, what judge--
Speaker 2: A judge?
Speaker 1: --and then he went, you said he was, he was in one part of the court--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then he--
Speaker 2: I think he was elected.  That's the other thing.  We campaigned all the time in the city.  I really felt like half of me was in the city.  I mean, most, even when I was younger, we did a lot of campaigning for my uncle [Percy Sutton] and for my father in, in Manhattan [New Yorl].  The age of--I would have to say that I was probably, it was probably about the time that we moved to Manhattan that my father was elected to this court because he, he was a judge all the time that we lived in Manhattan.
Speaker 1: So that makes sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I would--well, I, I mean, he was a judge when we moved to Manhattan.  He then got elected to a higher judge, but then he left the bench, and went into business.  So, he wasn't a judge for the entire time we lived in Manhattan, but he was a judge.  When we got to the city, he was a judge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it probably made sense for him to--I wonder even if his election, if he had to be a city resident, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: That part, I was--
Speaker 1: --he might have.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Story_ID: 102305
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, can you--so, the other question I have is your community black in Queens [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, it is.  So, your teachers are all black?
Speaker 2: Not--my teachers weren't all black, but many of my teachers were black.
Speaker 1: Black, okay.
Speaker 2: We had one white student in our class, William Casanovas [ph.].  Maybe he was Hispanic (laughter), but he was very light and he had straight hair.  But I remember, I was in an all black--the student body was all black.  I imagine there were some--my best friend's mother was from Honduras and her father was black, so I mean there was mixtures--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but there was--
Speaker 1: It still--
Speaker 2: --it was all black.  The teachers were not all black, but some of the teachers were black.  I can remember there was a fourth grade teacher who was white and really mean, really mean, but it was a good lesson because we were--my, my parents knew--I mean, having a mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] who was a teacher was really helpful in going to school because she had a good perspective.  She had a perspective on whether I was learning what I was supposed to learn.  She was a fifth grade teacher, so in elementary school in particular, she had a perspective of what was going in the classroom.  But she also had, had a perspective of not to freak out over any given thing.  And when I had this really bad teacher--mean, not bad necessarily--
Speaker 1: After you had such a great teacher--
Speaker 2: After I had with them, my third grade teacher [Portia Paterson] was golden.  And then I had Mrs. Droghesin [ph.] who almost seems like that name.  It's like a made-up name for a really mean teacher.  And they often--she would--who knows actually in--I don't know how mean she actually was, what-- Mrs. Droghesin [ph.] berated the children as I, as I recall.  She was mean to the kids.  I mean, if you didn't know something, she was, she didn't make you feel good about yourself.  We went from Mrs. [Portia] Paterson, who was just--every day was a golden day (laughter), and, and Mrs. Droghesin was really mean.  And they, at the end of the school year, the two people who emerged the least scathed from the Droghesin experience were a guy named Bruce Harrison who was class cutup.  He got in trouble all the time, and me (laughter).  And I--we, both of us--I mean, I'm, I'm saying this because other people said this to me.  But she was just, she made children not feel good that they didn't know things.  And she was mean.  She was notoriously mean.  But Bruce was so bad.  I mean, he was just really mischievous.  And so, he was able to like, get through and not let her faze him.  And I--she didn't faze me in part because my brother had--I don't know if he'd her, but we knew about her.  I knew about her before.  And my mom [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was really level-headed.  And, you know, I had a mom that could explain stuff to me if I didn't know what she was doing, or she could say to me, that's not the way you're supposed to teach.  I mean, I had a real ability to go home and, and get the better perspective on whatever was going on in school.  And, besides--
Story_ID: 102306
Speaker 1: I was definitely--you know what?  For a myriad of reasons, I was even, at that young age, really attuned at how to get along.  I really understood what to do to not, to, to go with a path that would get me where I wanted to go without encountering a lot of resistance.  It was combination of, of--I'd like to think savvy, but also I, I wasn't--my brothers, both of them, I--the one I grew up with, and the older one had rebels--rebellious period and a mischievous period.  And, you know, and watching them go through the trials and tribulations, and making my parents tear their hair out, I didn't want to go that way (laughter).  I mean, I knew--I watched both of my brothers, but particularly the brother that was closest in age to me--the one who was my full brother [Paul Sutton].  My father [Oliver Sutton] previously married and had an older son [Oliver Sutton, Jr.], but we didn't grow up with him.  But the one that I grew up with really had--gave my parents a hard time.  They, they gave each other a hard time growing up.  He had a really tough adjustment to school, and he wasn't fulfilling expectations.  And, and then, he wasn't fulfilling my parents' educate-, educational expectations.  My parents weren't being particularly flexible about what he wanted to do.  So, it was a lot of conflict and because I watched, I grew up watching this,  I definitely learned at a very early age how to navigate--really early.  So, school was sort of just more the same (laughter).  I could figure out if I do well, it's all good.  And I liked doing well and, you know, I didn't want to not do well.  And so, that made school easier and it made avoiding the really bad teachers easier.
Speaker 2: So, you, so give your brother's name.
Speaker 1: Paul, Paul Michael Sutton.
Speaker 2: Paul Michael Sutton, and he was four years older?
Speaker 1: Four, four and a half years older.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you were almost like, by the time you come, your--he's been an only child for a little bit, too.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum, uh-hum, yeah, he was almost, yeah.  He was--well, he'd, yeah, he was definitely the only child for a while.
Speaker 2: Was, was he like a big brother to you?
Speaker 1: It's funny.  He was a big brother to me.
Speaker 2: I mean, but you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But I think the nature of our childhood--certainly we were very little, absolutely.  I mean, he was my big brother.  We have all these pictures--again, living through pictures.  But he would sit in the backyard with me and hang out and he had a really good sense of humor.  He was really silly, and silliness was big in my family--not showing it all the time, but the ability to be silly.  Even my father [Oliver Sutton] who had a really kind of stern countenance, generally to the world, he wasn't like--he was an affable enough guy, but he was a guy.  You know, he was a serious guy, but he could be silly.  And my brother was really good at silly.  And so, we grew up when we were really young, you know, with that.  I think school created a problem for us because he had not been doing well in school.  By all measures, he was very bright, tested really well, but couldn't figure out how to take that intellect, and make it work in the classroom.  And I'm sure now, he would have, in this day and age, he would have been diagnosed with some sort of learning disability.  And, and there would have been more effort made to figure how he could adjust his way to being in the classroom.  But back in the '60s [1960s], that wasn't, you know, boys were bad or whatever--not just boys, but kids who couldn't figure out how to be good students.  There was something wrong with them.  And so, my brother labored under that and it was really unfortunate for him.  I mean, this sounds weird to say.  It wasn't unfortunate for him to be in our family, but when you're in a family where education is such a great importance, and that's pretty much what everybody is focused on.  And he got the same pledge in terms of having things paid for when he couldn't make--he couldn't meet the expectations.  It just became a sort of constant tense point.  Again, another reason why it was sort of easy for me to figure out, okay, if I can do this, I can actually--
Speaker 2: Be okay in the world.
Speaker 1: --avoid, yeah, yeah.  I can't, I can't afford a lot of tension here, like and like... Fortunately, our different perspectives on this didn't make us at odds with one another.  But it did--I mean, he didn't blame me.  He didn't sort of dislike me because I figured that out.  But I think--I mean, periodically, I'm sure he resented the fact that I got, you know, sort of all the kudos for the schooling.  But it did make us grow apart because I couldn't figure out what he was interested in.  I mean, he was an artist actually--I mean, he was truly an artist.  He drew, but he wanted to be more of an artist.  And that was something that I don't think my father, particular, who was sort of that classic '50s [1950s] boys do sports, you know, whatever.  He didn't--and they sent my brother to art school.  It wasn't like that wasn't a thing but he--I think, my father was not good at hiding his disappointment about all his expectations not being that.  If my father were, if my father were now, I would counsel him greatly about his parenting a boy (laughter).  He parented a girl pretty well, but the parenting of the boy--I think, left things to be desired, but purely sins of omission and not commission, I mean.
Speaker 2: Now, this is also the time, too--
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 2: I mean, it's a time, it's his oldest son, you know, it's his firstborn.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: I mean, he had another son but the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--no, no.  But--
Story_ID: 102307
Speaker 1: And, and his older son [Oliver Sutton, Jr.]--interesting you say that because the story of his older son is that he [Oliver Sutton] was married briefly.  And he had a son and the--it was an acrimonious divorce and it was a divorce in a time when divorce wasn't that common.  And his ex-wife remarried an [U.S.] Army sergeant and moved overseas.  So, my brother went--grew up.  She changed his last name.  And he grew up till about the age of eighteen in Europe.  So, those are the days pre-internet where she basically said, I'm taking your son and you will never see him again effectively (laughter), and took him to Europe.  And so, I did not know that I had a brother.  They did not--I guess they decided that why tell a five-year-old that there's a brother out there that you may never see.  And there weren't any ways to really investigate where--I mean, you know, certainly now there's the internet.  And now, if you have the resources, you could hire people.  But my father just sort of hoped through her family that he would--he was in Texas, were in Texas.  He would be able to find him, but never I--so it wasn't until they found him that I knew that I had a brother.  So, not only did he grow up with us when we were little, I didn't even know he was there.  But I met him when he was eighteen.  And there was, you know, wonderful ever, wonderful ever since.  He didn't have any sisters, and I had this big brother.  And he happened to be really good-looking and he was sort of like magical.  Suddenly, I had this much older good-looking brother.  I mean, really, when he was eighteen, you know, he could have--he did model.  I mean, he was really good-looking.  It's like, what do you, what could you do for a seven-year-old to drop this, like guy who could be in a magazine, and then say this--he's related to you.  And he's thrilled with you because he has no other sisters, and you have to, so it was just like.  And then, my poor brother, it was like, okay, great, I'm not even the oldest anymore.  So, he was (laughter), in retrospect--
Speaker 2: How much was, how much older was he to--
Speaker 1: Eleven years older than I and, I guess, seven years older than (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, so he was really, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I see (unclear).
Speaker 1: He was a rock star.  It's like, who is this guy?  But, but I mean, going fast forward, he really helped both of us a great deal.  He helped my brother.  I mean, he was a good guy.  He turned out to be a really good guy.  But, but for that first few, the, the entry years (laughter), it's just like--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --girls would line up coming to see me.  Ohh, is he here?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Nothing like--and I wasn't, I mean, I was, I wasn't so popular.  Well, I wasn't one of the "it" girls.  And suddenly, I got a little taste of what it's like to be really sought after  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He's sleeping now.  Do you want to watch (laughter)--only a quarter (laughter).  No (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  That's cute.  So, where does he live now?
Speaker 1: He lives in San Antonio, Texas now.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: He's had, he's had--but he's, he came back to the United States.  He had a kind of a tumultuous--his mom, you know, the impetuous spirit that takes the son away, and says you'll never see him again did, you know, sort of also kind of created a life that he was happy to find an alternative to.  And so, he came back and he changed his name back to Sutton and sort of became as much a member of this family.  And so, he was in San Antonio for a long while, then he moved to South Africa for a while, and now he's back in San Antonio.  He lived in New York for a while, too, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 102308
Speaker 1: So, so your, so school is, is sort of the center of the universe.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I want you to also share a family, some family stories, whether it's holidays or things, especially in this time period because we've established that you're probably going into high school around that high school when you--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.  Let's see, holidays--
Speaker 1: Holidays, vacations.
Speaker 2: We, okay, great vacations, family vacations.  We would spent some part of the summer making our way to San Antonio [Texas], making our way to some member of my father [Oliver Sutton]'s family.  That was pretty much what we did.  And we would drive to San Antonio periodically.  Once we took a train from New York to California to visit my aunts.  And I remember that, again, through pictures.  But I do remember it was, it was the era of the train.  There were the observation cars and, and it was an elegant way to travel.  And we went all across the United States.  And I remember stopping to look--what, see what Wyoming looked like and seeing what, you know, various places, like just from the stopping at the station and seeing the sign, and sort of having my picture taken on the side of the train.  And it was really an adventure, it was a great adventure.  That one, the train trip, my mother's mother [Ethleen Hopkins] went with us as well and it was really--we went to Disneyland.  I was really little--I was like five.  We went to Disneyland.  There's still pictures of the sort of now, almost comical-looking characters of 1960--I don't know whatever, Alice in Wonderland and Captain Hook.  But we--I--travel was really, but my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was a big proponent of travel, and my father was as well.  I mean, they--but we all went on family trips every year.  And, interestingly, the drive, the drive to San Antonio--it was, it was a big, it was a road trip.  We had to take the dog and we put the dog in the back seat.  But I should tell you about the cars.  My father, before he became a judge, was a criminal lawyer, and its practice was in Harlem [New York City, New York].  And often, his clients would pay in interesting ways.  And so, we--he would have sort of always an interesting--they didn't always pay in goods, in kind.  But every once in a while, we'd get some interesting thing in our family by virtue of some client who didn't need it, or was going away for a while and didn't need it, or to have no other way to pay.  And we have an Eldorado, a Cadillac Eldorado, '60-[1960]-something with the lights that were down.  They popped up at night and it was really a fancy car.  And we got in that Eldorado and we drove to San Antonio.  And there was enough room in the back for my brother [Paul Sutton] and myself and the dog, and we would just--we'd put our pajamas on.  We, we'd sometimes drive through the night.  Now, that is a five-year-old's perspective of it.  The adult perspective is that they were driving their children down South in an Eldorado (laughter), and trying not to stop because there were hotels that they could not bring us to.  We were--I mean, it was an adventure.  We'd put our pajamas on.  We'd drive straight through.  We thought it was great fun.  What I now know is that they were trying to get through places where they would not be welcomed to stop.  We always went to a Howard Johnson's, and I didn't know at the time, but Howard Johnson's was pretty early in their acceptance of black people in the restaurants and their treatment of people, but we'd always go to--have HoJo colors (unclear).  I mean, my parents were very aware, but we were sort of blissfully unaware, of what it meant to be driving from New York City to San Antonio, Texas in 1960-whatever. My favorite story about that is that one year--we were a little older, but we had the dog.  And my brother and I were in the back, and we were on our way back to New York.  And we were in some Southern state--ended up, stopped at night by--on some road and I remember feeling my parents' fear.  I remember, you know, sort of this was a little unusual.  The guy was not that nice.  I don't remember what he said, but I remember feeling it was a little dramatic, and I was a little concerned.  My father couldn't find his driver's license.  He was really nervous and he couldn't find his driver's license and, you know, I think the, the--it must been like, what are you doing in this car?  I mean, it was--I remember feeling tense, and this guy must have been talking to my father the way that I didn't think he should talk to him.  And the guy flashed the flashlight in the back and saw my brother and I in our pajamas and the dog, and we were sort of half-asleep--and let my father go--I mean, did not sort of haul us in.  And I can remember, what must have happened was my father must have told this story about how concerned he was at the moment.  Come to find out, he gets back to New York and that his driver's license was in New York, but he had done that entire trip--my father had a little touch of absent-mindedness to him (laughter).  He had done that entire trip without his driver's license.  So, that was a lesson to me.  It's like, always check (laughter) before you go.  But I can remember that moment--
Story_ID: 102309
Speaker 1: It's funny, the only other time I have had that moment was in South Africa when my brother was getting married.  He got married, oh, seven, eight years ago--no, more than that, maybe ten, eleven years ago.  Wait, I can tell, my kids were eight and five and Drew was--
Speaker 2: The oldest brother.
Speaker 1: The oldest was eight.
Speaker 2: And his--
Speaker 1: And she's twenty-one now, so that was--it was more, oh, my God (laughter).  It was much, much longer ago than I--what, thirteen years ago.  It was--apartheid had been ended, but it was such that I was a little concerned about our trip just to make sure that how was it going for us to go, but I just took the kids and we went to this wedding.  The point is we were on a deserted highway in South Africa, Johannesburg, and the police stopped us.  And it's the only other time--I have flashbacks to when I was little because my hus-, my brother's fiancee was driving and her mother was next to her.  And they were so nervous, so nervous because, you know, they were asking about papers.  And it was a white policeman, and there was a sense of let's just make it.  It was a deserted highway, and let's just make sure that this ends well for all of us.  It was really a kind of--it was a flashback to that, that I hadn't had.  I mean, you know, I'm, I have been a victim of stop and frisk, and I haven't had any circumstance here in the United States which made me really fear.  But I, but I can recall feeling palpably--something with my parents in that car.  And now, of course, when I look back on it, it was like '60 [1960] something, and they're driving in a Cadillac through Alabama or whatever so (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.  And they have a Cadillac, too.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have a Cadillac and been driving it, and so.

Speaker 1: So, what are you--any other memories that sort of come to mind?
Speaker 2: I--we were big, so my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was a huge celebrator of everything (laughter).  And, and so, Christmas was big and, and a production--not, not a, not a production in a sense that--a production in the sense that things had--were certain ways, like the tree--
Speaker 1: So, the tree--
Speaker 2: --was always decorated.  And we'd have to go to sleep, and presents were put out after we'd go to sleep.  And we'd wake up, then we come downstairs.  It was very traditional in that sense.  And we were, at that time, we were in Queens [New York].  We lived up, we had a two-story house, and so we really did come downstairs.  And I certainly, certainly have inherited--I took that for my family, and I make a big deal out of holidays.  And, it's not quite, they're not as food-focused in my, and I--for my family, my immediate family, but I love that feeling of, of birthdays and Christmas, and Christmas pageants at church.  I mean, the whole thing was very--and it was really what my mother's doing.  My father sort of went along but--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --So--
Story_ID: 102311
Speaker 1: --So-- are you, are you aware of things that are happening in the Civil Rights Movement?  I mean, how, so how is that manifesting and how are you, you know, we get to a point where things are being discussed at home--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --you know.  I mean, I, I don't get a sense you--did you know a lot about your father [Oliver Sutton]'s practice?  Not so much?
Speaker 2: Not when I was really little.  As I, I mentioned before, standing on a picket line, my parents believe very strongly in, in what they were doing in terms of civil rights.  And their--my father's father, my grandfather [Samuel Sutton], told all his children that the, the motto was do, do right, do, do the right thing.  I mean, it wasn't--he would say, do right, with a short for, do the right thing, which didn't mean, do whatever anybody tells you, but do the right thing to avoid, do the just thing.  And my father was, was, if nothing else, he was a man of, of principle and of his word, and of making sure that the right--he was honest and he wanted to make sure that the right thing was done.  And so, that meant--I mean that helped him in the law because he was trying to get justice for his clients.  But he and my uncle Percy [Sutton], when they were in New York, so--saw so clearly that it was important to help people get the right thing done.  And so, I grew up knowing that my father was helping a lot of people.  It's funny.  He had a criminal law practice, and on the one hand, we have these fancy thing--he had like, jewelry and fancy cup--but it wasn't a sense of helping people get away with things.  Even though--I mean, on my perspective, from a young age of his criminal practice was he was doing important work (laughter).  It was not that he was getting criminals off (laughter) and he was doing, helping people get their just day in court.
Story_ID: 102312
Speaker 1: And because they [Lewis' father, Oliver Sutton, and her uncle, Percy Sutton] were so politically active, that sort of permeated.  I mean, we were--I, my father, I grew up waiting for my father outside these smoky Democratic clubs.  I would go in every once in a while and try to find him in the smoke (laughter).  And I grew up handing out pamphlets on election days, being very careful to stay on the requisite feet away from the polling place, and speaking on a sound truck on election day, encouraging, encouraging people to vote.  When I was really little, that's what we did.  I mean, that's what--we were in the city so much because that's what we did.  We--I gave out stuff.  I, you know, it was the treat to be able to say stuff over the loudspeaker and the sound car--spent a lot of time waiting and--I mean, around the political things.  I said, my parents went out a lot at night.  I had an understanding of some sort of what they were doing, but I did not--it wasn't as if I'm sitting around the table with them discussing the issues at all (laughter).
Story_ID: 102313
Speaker 1: My uncle famously represented Malcolm X, but my father was his law partner at the time.  And so, he knew Malcolm X well and Betty Shabazz, Dr. Shabazz's wife, and I do remember--I don't remember any of Malcolm X being assassinated.  I don't remember that, but I do remember my father taking me to his daughter's birthday party--I guess it was Attallah [Shabazz]'s birthday party, her seventh birthday party.  I don't know if that number works in the real world, but that's what I thought it was then.  And it was the part-, first birthday after her father was killed.  And he, he wanted--they wanted to make a big party for her because her father wasn't, you know, to sort of distract her from the, the fact that her father was gone.  I didn't know her, but I remember my father taking me to the city--was to Wells [Supper Club], the House of Fried Chicken and Waffles.  And I didn't know her--it was her birthday.  To me, it was kind of odd 'cause I was at a birthday party for a girl I didn't know.  And there was famous-looking people at the birthday party, but they really made an effort to make a big party for her, so that she wouldn't feel so sad about her father being gone.  But it wasn't as if Malcolm X or [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] sort of came to the house.
Story_ID: 102314
Speaker 1: However, my father [Oliver Sutton] and my uncle [Percy Sutton] both knew the Kennedys.  They knew Bobby Kennedy [Robert Kennedy] and they knew President [John F.] Kennedy, and there was this thinking that when the Kennedys were in office, things would--my, my--
Speaker 2: Things would be better.
Speaker 1: --things would be, and my father and my uncle would be more actively involved on a national scale.  I mean, I remember the sense after the, you know, the shock of all the assassinations that it's--it, it, not only was it horrific for the nation, but very personally, my father and my uncle saw their dreams of being more involved on a national scale, scaled back because of their connection.  I mean, they knew [President Lyndon B.] Johnson 'cause he was a Texan, but it wasn't the same kind of connection.  My--Johnson, President Johnson was actually more connected to my uncle [G.J. Sutton] who was the state legislature, legislator in Texas but, and so I always had a sense of being on the periphery of the world events, very much on the periphery as a child, but that my family was involved, but not--we weren't the hub.  We weren't the--which, in retrospect, I'm grateful for because it--now being, have a normal childhood (laughter).  I was--didn't, I didn't have to share my family with the rest of the world, which I've seen very personally, and the nation has seen generally--it's never a really great thing for the family.
Speaker 2: That's, that's right.
Story_ID: 102315
Speaker 1: So, when you, so you're aware of things that are sort of going on in that way--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --not, not so much.  Are you, are there any strange--are you, first of all, are your--is, is Percy Sutton, and your father [Oliver Sutton], are they, are they in the same office?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --except that soon after we moved to the city, my uncle was elected as Borough President [of Manhattan in New York City, New York], and my father became first, Commissioner of Jurors--that was his first election--and then he was elected to the Civil Court.  So, they were both in city government, but in different areas.
Speaker 1: But think about that.  So, there, you know, 'cause I have heard about the Democratic, you know, organizations.  There were different names to them, I think, but your, your--the one that your father and your uncle were part of was like the one, the main one?
Speaker 2: It was based in Harlem [New York City, New York].  I don't remember its name but there was a name for it [Harlem Clubhouse].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was--certainly the, the story goes that my uncle saw Charlie Rangel [HM Charles Rangel] on a soap box.  Back in the day on 125th Street, people would just get up on literally on like, milk crates and talk and try to engage people.  I mean, well before--and couldn't happen now 'cause everybody's too busy on their phones.  But, you know, they would just talk about issues of the day.  And my uncle took on Charlie Rangel and they debated, you know, and sort of, you could--the risk you took when you got up to give your views was that somebody in this crowd was going to take you on.  And they became friends after they debated periodically.  And so, they literally, they get in these clubs, and they--what they saw were a group of guys who had--and it was mostly guys--who had energy, who had drive, who had ambition to change things, and who knew what they were fighting against.  I mean, these were--everybody was sort of huddled in, and huddled together to give each other strength because this was an era when you were fighting.  Even though you were in the North (laughter), you weren't fighting the same kind of issues that you were fighting in the South.  You could vote, but you were fighting back a lot of prejudice.  You were trying to help your brethren elsewhere because it was, you know, sort of your security, and what you have was limited because you knew that the nation didn't have that same security.  And you really wanted to do what you could have, you know, Harlem was impoverished.  And, and so, this group of guys--they saw in each other, you know, spirit, ambition, vigor.  And they kind of figured out, okay, who's going to do what, you know, they really were.  There was a sense of unity like, and, and you're going to do this, and you're going to do this, and you're going to do this.  My father was much more of an inside man, kind of behind the scenes.  He was like the anchor to the balloons that were floating around.  And that was--he was happy in that role.  Everybody was happy to have him in that role because you need somebody who's going to figure out how to turn the lights on and put the key in and, you know, get the job done while everybody is having their visionary moments.  And so, I saw that my father was sort of the guy that people came to, to sort of--when everybody's issues and egos were sort of running, you know, he was the one that could sort of pull them all together.
Speaker 1: Running around to--that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the one that was really just trying to get people moving.  So, I think they really felt that they could do something.  So, there was a sense of the, that they were--had a mission of sorts.  And my father and my uncle, I do think had sort of a plan.  You know, okay, you do this, and I'll do this, and I'll support you, and you support me, and we'll get this done.
Speaker 1: Well, it sounds like that was the plan, was actualized and when you, you know, when you moved into the city but that was--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, no, it definitely, that--I'm sure my father was motivated for that.  I mean, how could you live out in Queens and try to do all this stuff in, in Harlem?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, of course, I didn't know that but that was--and my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] was kind of on a wild ride.  I don't know that she (laughter)--I mean, she, she went along with everything, but it was sort of--my father [Oliver Sutton] definitely had big dreams, like she knew that when she met him and so.
Story_ID: 102316
Speaker 1: So, when you moved in to the, into Harlem [New York City, New York], what year is that?  That's 19--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's got to be '70 [1970], early '70s [1970s].  I, I should do the math but, and Harlem was--it was scary.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: I mean, I did not want to admit that because my Queens [New York] friends were like, I am never coming to visit you.  Why are you moving there, which hurt my feelings (laughter), but it was scary.  I mean, in some instance, I had a beautiful block.  We lived on 139th Street between 7th and 8th, now Frederick Douglass [Boulevard] and Adam Clayton Powell [Jr. Boulevard], and it still is a landmarked--Stanford White houses, beautiful, and it was always called Striver's Row.  It was always where professionals from this Harlem's history would move.  And the houses were just beautiful, but 140th Street was where the post office was, was filled with tenements.  I mean, our neighbors to the back of us would throw their garbage out the window literally.  And it was just--I didn't feel un-, it was scary, I didn't feel unsafe.  I didn't feel like I couldn't walk around.  I wasn't quaking in my boots, but it was just an adjustment to a different way of life.  I was told by my parents, this is important, we need to be here.  Enough fun things resulted from living in Manhattan [New York] that I didn't feel like why did we move here?  I felt like it was important to move there and I was happy.  But I have to say that like when, when we started doing this, I'm like, well, it's scary.  I mean, I, I--to walk around to the post office, I had to sort of steel myself.  It was a real crash course in living in a different neighborhood. I mean, nobody, I--
Speaker 1: Were you, you had to be (unclear).  It's up to them working (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I did, I did.
Speaker 1: And then, you're coming into a (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, no (laughter).  But truly, I can say, you know, aside from once when I was older--my car being broken into, you know, we didn't have--I didn't, I--there was never any--my concern was never realized.  It was not--
Speaker 1: It was, it was no evidence of it.
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  I wasn't, I mean, I was never mugged.  I didn't feel threatened, I never felt threatened.  I felt scared (laughter), but not threatened.
Speaker 1: So, give your address.
Speaker 2: 249 West 139th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, yeah, I felt, I never felt threatened.  03:29:35:15 I also adapted really quickly to the city ways.  I mean, you knew not to do stupid things, like don't walk by yourself in the street.  And, in Harlem, I would always say, you knew blocks, and you'd walk down the blocks you knew.  There were some blocks where, even as an adult going back, it's like, I'm not going on that street.  I don't know that street, and there are people on that street (laughter), I'm not going there.  I'm going this street and this street.  I mean, you were comfortable in the--you got to know the neighborhood that you were in, and you got to know the dysfunction of the neighborhood that you were in.  There was--they didn't call bodegas, like a little--it's effectively a bodega on the corner.  I'll never forget.  I never used to go in there for some reason, and my mom--we needed bread or maybe I needed bread.  This is when I was a little older, and I went in the store and it was classic bodega style where the windows are filled with product.  So, you just, like there's glass, and then you just see all the different product.  When I opened the door, and the entire store is empty and there's this card table--these guys sitting around the table.  And I remember closing the door really quickly and leaving everything.  Okay, I don't know what that was, but that was not a bodega.  And that kind of experience happened a lot.  You're like, okay, this is not what I, okay (laughter).  I'm good.  I'll go this way.  So, that certainly didn't happen in Queens, but I felt like, growing up.  I felt like it was a good thing to know, you know.  I mean, I, I, you know, riding the subway, I mean, we didn't have--my parents never ever like, they would really frown upon the concept that I needed to figure out how to escape all of this by living in a place where I didn't see this, or by, you know, taking cars or having driv--that wasn't even a possibility because we couldn't afford that, and there wasn't that so much means.  We weren't trying to live a privileged life in a, in a neighborhood that had varying privileges.  I mean, but we did live on a really nice street so, but I mean to say that they didn't tolerate my fear.  They thought that it was ridiculous to fear living amongst a lot because I lived with black people in Queens.  But they thought that that was--it was ridiculous to indulge the concept that just because people didn't have as much that you should be afraid of them.  And so, they were really adamant that I not sort of feel sorry for myself or, you know, not, not take advantage of where we were.  And I could complain but not a lot, and I didn't really complain after a while.  There were some disadvantages living in Harlem because if you were in Midtown, they would never find any cab to take you.  I mean, there was a lot of--there were issues and they seared deep into my soul because to this day, getting in a cab, I'm steeling myself if I'm going above 96, steeling myself for my--and I'll fight with them now and I'll make them take me, you know I mean.  But that sense of I could have a big discussion of where I'm going and, you know, and then the, the perception of Harlem everywhere else.  I mean, from my neighbors in Queens, they weren't going to visit me, too, if you travel anywhere and you say I live in Harlem because I wasn't living in the sort of golden age of Harlem with the jazz clubs.  I mean, you either get one person who has idealized this and thinks that it's just magical, or you get the other person says, oh, my God, you're dodging bullets.  I mean, this was just kind of tiresome to kind of live that--have to deal with that all the time 'cause it was just like a nice house on a nice block, but in a weird neighbor-, not weird, but a neighborhood that you had to adjust to.
Story_ID: 103173
Speaker 1: So, so when you, so you moved there [Harlem, New York City, New York].  What--where are you going to school at this point 'cause--
Speaker 2: Now, I'm going to Music & Art, High School of Music & Art [now LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City, New York], which went from being very far away from my home, but to being like six blocks.  I moved very close to my high school. It was in the City College [of New York in New York City, New York]--what's now the City College complex.  It was 135th Street and Convent Avenue.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.  You were going to the--wait, you were--
Speaker 2: Because I was young, I mean, I moved in my, I must have moved in my freshman year when I was twelve.  That would probably make sense.  So, I spent a few weeks, maybe months, commuting, but then I moved to the city.  And I moved close to the--very close so I could walk.  I did walk, so I walked to school.  I got a ride every once in a while so.
Speaker 1: So that school was for music and art--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --so it was, it was not the Acad-, it was, it's not the--
Speaker 2: The Performing Art School, no.
Speaker 1: LaGuardia, but it's--
Speaker 2: It is now LaGuardia.  Now, imagine, there was--when I was in school, it was the High School of Music & Art, which was on the, on the--the high school on the hill because City College is up on a hill.  And it was a castle, the castle on the hill--it looked like a castle.  And our archrivals were the [High School of] Performing Arts, which were like 47th and something, so near the theatre district.  We had similar setups in that you auditioned for the school.  And they were arts-related, and there were some, some kind of umbrella in that there were some administrative connection.  But we were archrivals--I mean, think, you know, what--I mean archrivals, just, there were no sporting competitions.  But we weren't performing arts, and they weren't music and art.  And then, fast forward, some genius gets a bright idea of merging the two schools, and now they are LaGuardia [High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts].  So, my alma mater is now the combination of my school and the Performing Arts school, and so it's so weird.  Just yesterday, I was listening to a speaker who said he went to LaGuardia and I looked it up.  And I found he went to Performing Arts.  Oh, my God, he went to (unclear).  He didn't go to my school.  He went to that other school.
Story_ID: 103174
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I, I went, the reason---
Speaker 2: Now did you have to apply to this school?
Speaker 1: You did--you have to audition.  And I went there because, now, after I, after having said that we embraced public school, we did, but I wanted a specialized school.  And I was young, recall I skipped second grade and so I was maybe fourteen or fifteen.  I guess I was fifteen--
Speaker 2: So young--
Speaker 1: --when I had to apply to high school.  But I had to figure out where I was going to high school.  And I wanted to go to Stuyvesant [High School] and or Hunter [College High School], but the problem was I was too young to take the test.  They wouldn't let me take the test for Hunter because I wasn't old enough.  I hadn't--chronologically, there was a cutoff.  And my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] fought that, but she couldn't get it, so I think we had a mind toward specialized high school.  And there weren't that many--it was science and, but I was, I was not able to take the test for any of those.  So, we tried to figure out specialized high schools that I could go to.  I'd been taking piano lessons forever, and [High School of] Music & Art, if you were a musician, you could audition on piano and so I did.  I auditioned on piano, and I got into Music & Art, and I went--the, the structure of Music & Art, the school, was that you couldn't play piano.  That couldn't be your instrument in school, but you--once you were proficient on piano, you could take up another instrument, instrument in school, so I took up clarinet.  I have to say that my entering into that school--I mean, I certainly appreciated music.  And, and music and art was divided.  There were art students and music students.  It wasn't as if you were getting a grounding in both.  I may have had to take one art class but probably not.  It was mostly music classes.  But I--day one walking in the door, I had, I knew I wasn't--I, I liked music, but my interest was in not in, in being any kind of a professional musician.  And a good thing because I learned from day two that there were some incredibly talented people there.  And God help me if I had had an interest in this because I was not going--it was not going to be fulfilled.  I mean, there were some amazingly talented high schoolers.  Our back staircase, you know, putting aside what most back staircases in high schools are used for, was used for the acoustics.  And so, people would practice their instruments or they would sing on the back staircase.  So, it was a really musically--it was an arts infilled [sic] school, infused school, and I loved that.  That, actually, definitely shaped me for the rest of my life, that there were so many.  It taught me many things (laughter), and for, like (a) that I wasn't, that was not my career path.  I didn't think it was but, you know, I, I was confirmed from day one that--but it also taught me that these people that were really talented at such an early age were mono-focused.  I mean, they were really talented in their music or in their art.  And they really weren't paying much attention to everything else.  And so, that enabled me to do two things:  One, really excel in the school because they have--the focus on academics while it was solid, it was easy to excel 'cause, really, there were a lot of people that were focused on other things.  And, secondly, I thought that it was the germ of the concept that these people were really gifted in music and art--are going to need people that appreciate their gifts, but are focused on helping them because they're really not--I mean, if you're going to spend all your days in the back staircase, you're, you're--that passion for their gift really kind of precluded them really from focusing on other stuff, like class (laughter).  So, so I could just see people that were make--if you made it, they wouldn't have as great of a basis.  So, I think it was then that I started thinking about what I could do in that field that wasn't, wasn't performing, but have the appreciation for performing.  And I, I think my decision to go to law school ultimately was fueled by that sense that there're going to be people that need help.
Speaker 2: Are, are you thinking law school at this point?
Speaker 1: No.  With my--ultimately, is I did to go to law school.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Noooo.
Speaker 2: No, no, you're not thinking so--
Speaker 1: I don't know what I'm thinking but I (laughter) wasn't thinking law school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 103175
Speaker 1: And how--so what is life like at, you know, at--living in New York and Harlem [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was--you--it was great.  It was--
Speaker 1: So the, the brown-, so, your, your parents renovated the brownstone?
Speaker 2: Right.  And my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] still worked in Queens [New York].  She was still a teacher in Queens.  And my father [Oliver Sutton]--
Speaker 1: What did she teach also?
Speaker 2: She taught fifth grade for a long time.
Speaker 1: In the same school that you went to--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, never, we were never in the same school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering, okay.
Speaker 2: We taught--she taught fifth grade, and then she became a reading specialist and so, she taught reading.  But the best thing about her teaching fifth grade was that when she taught fifth grade, when I was in fifth grade, she taught fifth grade.  She had all the teachers' editions, so I was really good.  I did not go to the teachers' editions first, but it did enable me to check my work (laughter).  She kind of banned me from like using them, and I didn't have every textbook, but that was a good year (laughter).  I remember feeling like I was good.  I was golden for the fifth grade (laughter).  So, no, but she was a really happy--she loved teaching.  And being a teacher's child was so interesting.  It gave me such respect because I would go visit her school.  And I remember vividly the children looking at me, like I looked at my teachers like what--you have a family, like really?  Your life is not totally in this classroom?  And I remember being on both sides of that instantaneously.  It's like, yeah, yeah, I'm the family but, yeah, I get it, I get it.  I don't know what it's weird, but yeah,, she does have family 'cause teachers were revered.  I mean, they really were.
Speaker 1: They were revered--they were.
Speaker 2: They were.  And so, it was sort of like, oh, my gosh.
Story_ID: 103176
Speaker 1: That's I think why I loved my third grade teacher [Portia Paterson] so much because I knew about her other life.  I had, I kind of had that inside track.  I knew she had--and I would run into her every once in a while at some political thing, and feel so special because this was my teacher.  Literally, three weeks ago, I went to a memorial service for a guy whose father, for, for the father of a friend, and he was raised in Queens [New York City, New York].  And the father was a big Queens guy.  And I saw Mrs. Paterson, and I can only call her Mrs. Paterson, even though--I mean, you know, I'm as old as I am.  And every time I see her, I have to tell her about how thrilling it is--she looks the same.  I always tell her that.  She looks exactly the same which, of course, she's delighted to hear.  But she really does--in my eyes, I only see my third grade teacher.  Her son, her, her grandson is in my son's school.  And my connection to, to both David [Paterson] and his brother, Daniel--the, the former governor and his brother is, is attenuated.  I mean, in that, I didn't roll, I didn't hang out with them.  In fact, I'm sure when I viewed them--it's like, oh, that's Mrs. Patterson's sons, you know (laughter), but I, I didn't hang out with them.  But I just have such an affinity for all of them.
Speaker 2: Because of, because of her.
Speaker 1: Because of Mrs. Paterson, rock star teacher.
Story_ID: 103177
Speaker 1: But, anyway, so living in Harlem, living in New York City, the '70s [1970s] were so, you know, it's hard to explain to people that come to New York now.  We're kind of in, like the mall, Disney version of New York.
Speaker 2: Well, because New York was, it was dirty, it was--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was, it was an edge, it was a real edge.  And while you didn't love that, it was like dirty (laughter) and, you know, there wasn't--it wasn't like you wanted to be in, in a dirty environment, nobody wanted that but you, you accepted it.  It was sort of the price you paid for being in the city that didn't sleep, for being in an exciting place, for being around all of this art and culture.  You're kind of like--that's the dues you pay.  You get in the crazy-looking subway that's filled with graffiti.  You watch your bag, you, you know, you know where to go and where not to go.  You, you know that there's danger around you.  You try to avoid it.  But you, like, it was, it was definitely an edge, which both worried everybody and parents and all, but kind of kept you, you know, focused and alive and exuberant.  So, it was not that--I marvel now that, that the license my parents gave me to run all around the city and stay out late.  And, I mean, knowing as a parent now, what can happen, knowing as a kid, what did happen.  I mean, you really--but it did, that it really instilled in me desire that if I, and I, this came to fruition.  And I said if I ever raise kids, I'm raising them in Manhattan [New York] because they would, they'd be all these suburban kids that would come and visit.  And they'd be afraid of the subway, and they'd be afraid of the city, and they were the targets 'cause you just see, you know, if you were walking around looking scared, something was going to happen to you, 'cause kind of a badge of honor about being able to be, to survive and, and you know, make it in a city that was just hard, it was hard.  You accepted so much.  And it wasn't until I left New York City to go to college, and then to go on to travel.  Traveling, you didn't really get it 'cause you always wanted to go home.  But when I lived in other cities, it wasn't until I lived in other cities that I understood why people would not want to live in New York City.  I mean, growing up, it was like, where else would you live, you know. Suburbs just seemed so not interesting (laughter).  And that was my only other thing to know--I mean, then, and then, you know, I got it when I moved to Chicago [Illinois] as an adult.  It's like, oh, this is very pleasant (laughter).  I get why people might not--if this is your reality, I get why New York is really not that, that much fun.  But, you know, if you, all you know is the way, way upside and the downside--I mean, you just accept that's the way that, you know, that's what you get.

Speaker 1: Now, were you in Jack and Jill [of America] or any--?
Speaker 2: I was in Jack and Jill.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, what, what, so, so--is that the social outlets that, that are sort of happening, and who are you meeting?  Why are you, why are you--
Speaker 2: (Laughing).  Why are I making these faces?
Speaker 1: Let me see--yeah.
Speaker 2: Jack and Jill is very interesting.  And I'm making the faces because my--of my own personal current experience with Jack and Jill which is my children want no part of it.  And I'm desperately trying to keep a toehold in there in case somebody changes their mind.  But my--when I was in Queens [New York], I was in Jack and Jill.  And I think my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton], you know, in retrospect, she wouldn't have wanted to hear me say it in this way.  But my mom was a bit of, even though she was completely in accord with all of the, you know, the activist part of our family, part of her really was--had a mindset of sort of getting to a better place.  I mean, like I said, she grew up in a family where she didn't have such expectations.  And she really--
Speaker 1: Striving.
Speaker 2: --she was striving, more so than my father [Oliver Sutton].  I mean, he was kind of taking all the stuff he had with him and trying to build on it.  But she was definitely trying to sort of move to a different place.  And I think she was much more interested in these kind of things as seeing them as a vehicle.  She wanted us to know kids that were in Jack and Jill.  I mean, she wasn't a zealot about it, and she would never compromise her principles for it.  But I think she thought it was a good thing.  And she was in a sorority--I mean, she thought it was a good thing.  In Queens, I learned through Jack and Jill the, the concept of the bourgeois.  That's not what we called it then.  But I saw in Queens, kids that thought they were better, you know.  I, I knew that they were this black--I don't want to paint Jack and Jill in Queens with a broad brush because I had lots of friends that were in Jack and Jill.  But it was there that I kind of learned the stuff that Jack and Jill has been slighted for and criticized for.  It wasn't prevalent, but I did see people who thought they were better than other people.  And there was, you know, sort of this sense that we are the chosen, you know, we have the ability to do this and that, and that sort of takes us to a level.  Because that so didn't resonate with me, I thought that was kind of silly, but it didn't make me not want to be a part of whatever little activity there was.  I was never like the "It Girls" growing up.  I mean, I was, I was never, I was always younger than everybody else.  And I really wasn't that--I, I was, I looked young, so my, my ability to sort of fit in, I could fit in, but I wasn't ever one of the, like really hip and "It Girls".  And they were kind of the--there were these families and, you know, they were sort of--and I remember thinking that Jack and Jill, as an organization, sort of promoting that sense of there were these families.  I didn't analyze it that much when I was young, but I could just tell that, you know, you were in Jack and Jill.  But when I moved to Manhattan [New York], that all changed for me because Jack and Jill actually became the outlet through which I met these kids that were in private school.  I mean, I lived in Harlem.  I had a great block, but I really wasn't going outside trying to find friends on the street, not because--I did have a friend across the street, but I was in high school.  But my high school [High of Music & Art] fed from all over the city, so I had friends in all boroughs.  So, I didn't have neighborhood friends, and looking for neighborhood friends in Manhattan, an easy way to do it was Jack and Jill.  Jack and Jill, I actually gave so much credit for my adjustment to Manhattan because there were all these kids.  When you live in Manhattan and it's kind of edgy and dangerous anyway, you couldn't feel so privileged.  That whole bourgeois stuff was out of the picture because everybody's taking the subway.  Everybody, you know, it's not your, there're trappings of a life that you have that are finer than everybody.  You can't--that's something I love about Manhattan.  You really, whatever you have, however much money you have, however wealthy you are, a gazillionaire--you've got to travel.  You got to see that other people aren't the same.  You're not living in a gated community.  You're living around everybody.  And so, Jack and Jill in Manhattan was a different vibe.  It was sort of--and I--these kids are all in private school.  I was in public school.  There was no issue there.  There wasn't like, oh, you know, you don't know private school, so you can't hang--I, I mean, at all, I didn't--.
Story_ID: 103179
Speaker 1: It's funny, I should just say this, growing up in my family, which was both known, my uncle [Percy Sutton] was certainly--the last name made us well-known, admired, because my family did really interesting things.  And even though there wasn't initially a lot of money involved--I mean, ultimately, you know, they went into business and they did better.  There was this sense--we were imbued with a sense of, of family that was important and was of note, and so, so that gave, that was sort of a, a--
Speaker 2: There was status in and of itself.
Speaker 1: But it was a pathway to being elitist in bourgeois if we chose to make it that--
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: --because, you know, certainly, well-known politicians have been known to sort of ultimately get caught up in their ability to sort of be different than everybody else.  And black people, in particular, if you've given the option to sort of have more or do, you know, you sort of--it's a sense of, you know, distinguishing yourself in a way that you're not like everyone else.  So, but because it's back to that 50 cents--"that and 50 cents will get you in the subway."  I think one of the reasons my father [Oliver Sutton] said that so much was because both being a politician when you couldn't really feel like you were better than anybody else 'cause you needed votes.  I mean, that was just--it didn't work.  You couldn't really--I mean, if you were a doctor and you'd made a lot of money, and you moved out to Long Island [New York], and you lived in this lovely community with the pool, you could probably get away--feel more comfortable and feeling like I got it like this.  And, therefore, I only need to associate with people that I have like--had it like this and it make sense to me.  You could build your construct of that and you could raise your kids in that way.  But because of where we lived, we couldn't.  And from day, from an early age because my uncle was such a public figure from when I was growing up, I, I witnessed people that were trying to penetrate my family, both sort of--everybody wanted to--not everybody, but there was always a sense that they wanted to know who we were and that you could, as a member of this family, get away with trading on that if you were so inclined.  And certainly, my father was mindful of that, and I think he was really focused on that not happening.  And I was glad that he was because I was not interested in--I always used to joke that I had a really early BS detector because, you know, there were people that just wanted to be around.  It got worse when they went into music, you know, the radio stations and Apollo [Theater], worse in the sense that they were just more people that wanted to sort of be a part of--who wanted to know people in the family, who wanted to be, who are attracted to the attention, and who wanted to, who just wanted to be a part of it.  And if, by chance--I grew up getting to do some amazing things.  Throughout my entire life, I remember meeting John Lindsay because he swore in my father.  And talk about a rock star mayor, I was just thrilled.  I was, however old I was, I was little, and I can still remember, like I'm in the City Hall and I'm looking at the mayor and, you know, I got to do a lot of things from a very young age that not a lot of people got to do, but not, but I didn't, at any time, thinking about the fact that not a lot of people got to do it.  I just got to do really fun things.  And when I got a little older and realized that, that in and of itself, was something that would be desired.  Thankfully, by that, my father had laid on that, you know, it doesn't, it's not that big a deal, you know.  It sort of it's not, you know, so that again, and so, I mean, it's sort of--I was and now, and I will say, I'm saying this specifically for two reasons:  One, because I had, even members of my family who didn't quite get that.  I mean, they--it's harder for them to get that.  And with my kids, every one of them has that, and I credit myself and Bill [HM William Lewis, Jr.], my husband.  Both of us have that perspective and, boy, it's really important to us that our kids not feel like anything that they have or any access they have, makes them better.  It just gives--it's their lives and it's really interesting and it's great.  Don't feel guilty about it, but don't feel like it makes a free subway ride, so.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 103180
Speaker 1: So, you, what else, so you're in school, what are subjects are you really good at?
Speaker 2: I'm really good at English.  I was really good at math, and then I had a really falling-off--I went into an honors math class in geometry and then tanked it, and it scarred me.  But I was really always very good in English.  That reading--the early thing kind of stayed with me.  I did well in all of my subjects in high school [at High School of Music & Art in New York City, New York].  I mean, in high school, you know, I figured out how to do, you know, there's a figuring out of how to do well.  If you read well, that gets you a long way because you can read in all in your courses how to do well.  And, but I was much more of an English, humanities kid than a math and science kid, and still am.  But, but I respect math and science.  I'm not afraid of them.  But I was definitely--when I, when I got to college, I was an English major, English and communications, and I really didn't test myself too much in other subjects.  I could have, in retrospect, if I went back to college now, I'd take a lot of different courses to see what else I might have been interested in.
Story_ID: 103181
Speaker 1: Go on.
Speaker 2: Sorry.  I was just going to say a funny story about that.  I had mentioned earlier that my father [Oliver Sutton] wanted me to be a doctor.  Freshman year of college, I come home.  I'm undecided as to major which is typical of me.  I didn't have any--I didn't know.  I come home.  I say, daddy, you know, I haven't, I'm not quite--what are you going to major in?  I don't really know.  He said, it's time for another doctor in the family--you should be a doctor.  And, he said, okay, so that's what you'll do.  And I said--I mean, he was taking advantage of my indecision.  But I mean, it wasn't like if I had said, I'm going to be a whatever, he would have said no.  But he said, if you don't know, you should be a doctor.  And I was aghast.  And I went to my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] and I said, daddy's trying to make me be a doctor.  And I fully expected her to say, oh, don't worry, you know, we'll, we'll stop that.  She said, well, you know what, we're paying a lot of money for you in school, and if you don't know what you want to do, you know, why don't you--why not, you know?  So I promptly marched back to school, dutiful daughter that I am, and I enrolled in a biology class.  I lasted one lecture.  It was on lipids.  There were the weird things dancing on the screen.  I walked out of there and I said, I'm going to be a lawyer (laughter).  I'm going to have another profession.  I know I don't want to do that.  So, literally, my lawyer dreams were borne of the, the running away from the doctor dreams.  And so, I, I was, I was, and that actually made law school a bit of a challenge--not a challenge to get into, but a challenge to stay invested in, because by the time I got to law school--'cause I did well in school, I got into great law schools.  And I could take tests really well.  I was a good standardized test taker.  But, boy, when I was surrounded by people that really wanted to be lawyers, like from day one, it's like, oh, my gosh, different concept.  Well, I mean, you can relate to that.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Story_ID: 103182
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you this.  How did you end up choosing the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and, and--
Speaker 2: It was really kind of haphazard.  The upside of being at this music and art school [High School of Music & Art, New York City, New York] was that, you know, I was around all these talented people.  And as I said, it made the academic pool a lot smaller.  It was easier to be a big fish in the academic pool.  The downside was--they weren't really all that focused on college stuff.  I mean, you know, they had a lot of people that were not trying to figure out what college to go to.  And I will say that, you know, when my father [Oliver Sutton] discovered that I did not have the burning desire to go to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], he thought that that there really wasn't going to be much college discussion because I was just going to go to Spelman when I evidenced that--not, that I, when I told him, like I wasn't really looking at Spelman, I felt like he lost interest.  But they weren't--he wasn't as--I don't even want to say he wasn't as invested.  He was disappointed, and so it was really on me to figure out, well, if I didn't want that, what did I want?  And in retrospect, that was an era where parents were tangentially involved.  It really--God knows when you think of the degree to which parents are involved today.  And I say not that critically, because I think they need to be involved today (laughter), but my parents were not involved.  I had to go to college, no question, and because I'd done well for so long, there were these expectations that I'd go to a college, a good college.  My father's idea of the best college I should go to was Spelman.  He wanted me to go there, so it wasn't like you'd go to an Ivy League school, but it was like, you go to the best college.  Now, if he thought if that was not the best college, then I need to figure out what the best college was.  Curiously, I'm sure I must have had some guidance because I did apply to several Ivy League schools.  I applied to Penn [University of Pennsylvania].  I applied to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  I did not apply to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I found out recently that I must have applied to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] because I ran across something, but I had no--I had such a non-memory of it that I, I didn't get in, but I didn't even remember applying.  So, it wasn't like I fell in love with Yale.  It ended up--I applied the, I--somehow the concept of going to an Ivy League school must have been planted in me.  I have no sort of hazy romantic memory of some teacher saying, you know, this is what you should do.  And certainly, my parents knew about schools.  I mean, I'm sure that they told me about it, but I don't remember anybody sitting me down and saying these are the schools you should apply to.  I may not be doing my parents a service.  I'm sure they were focused on it to some degree, but they didn't say, oh, why aren't you applying to Harvard?  You know, they didn't--it didn't even, and, and my--the legacy of education in my family was historically black colleges.  And I, I was really adamant.  The combination of watching my brother--my brother went to Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] from New York, and really didn't like it.  He, I mean, he managed to get out of high school and he got to college, but he had really not a good experience--dropped out just not long after he got there.  And that taught me also--I didn't want to go that far away.  So, my interest in college--how I got to Penn was really through the process of elimination.  I'm not going to Spelman.  And I'm not going really far away.  And there are schools on the East Coast that seem like they'd be good.  I'm in an urban place.  I don't want to go to some really remote place in the bucolic suburbs.  I, I need a city.  So, I ended up applying, I think, to several schools.  I applied up and down, you know, SUNY [Stony Brook University in New York City, New York].  I applied like, I don't know a lot of schools, and, and ended up coming down to Brown and Penn.  And I then visited both of them for the first time after I got accepted with my mom--no, I, I visited Brown with my mom.  And I visited Penn on my own 'cause they have like a weekend thing.  And I said, ooh, I got to Penn.  It was big and exciting and city-like and but felt like it was a campus, and it was a little comforting.  It's like that--I'm done, so.  It wasn't, it was not--and my family was very proud of me, but there was not the sense of, oh, my gosh, you know, the, you know, I, I have--nobody felt like I took the family educational legacy to any other level (laughter).  It's like, we're continuing it, but it wasn't like it's--now it's Ivy League so that means, oh, besides, my mother and my uncle--my uncle Percy [Sutton] had been enrolled in Columbia [University, New York City, New York] for grad school.  It wasn't like I was the first--I think in my generation, I might have been the first to go to an Ivy League school, but not in the generation before me so.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 103183
Speaker 1: So, you, so, what--who are you associating with when you get to college [University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and who are you meeting and--
Speaker 2: Freshman, you know.
Speaker 1: Freshman.
Speaker 2: There were so many people there.  It was great, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --mostly black people.
Speaker 1: And this is a good time--there, now, at this time period, there--it's a very exciting time 'cause kids are coming from all over.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Definitely affirmative action was in full swing.  And it was being well-taken advantage of.  And there were people there that wouldn't have been there the decade before, but who were really making the most of it and really excited by it.  I did a fairly good job, as I say.  And most of my close friends were black, but I did a fairly good job of getting out into the world of Penn and sort of making--
Speaker 1: It's good.
Speaker 2: --inroads into areas where I wasn't just--andt he beauty of Penn 'cause it was so large that you could actually have a fairly large black population.  So, you could go to--in fact, someone said to me about Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], in that going to Harvard in that same era, it's like I went to a small black school in Harvard (laughter).  So, you know, it sort of--you could do that at Penn.  You could really almost--I mean, you were in class with a lot of other people, but you could really just surround yourself.  And I tried--I mean, I did that for comfort, but I really did kind of step outside and meet a lot of different people.  But I was, I, I, my roommates and, you know, it was a really--I had a lovely, not particularly traumatic--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --four years.
Speaker 1: And then, did you--are you going straight into--okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Yeah.  No, I was not playing with the--
Speaker 1: So, you graduate in 19--
Speaker 2: In '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: 1980.
Story_ID: 103184
Speaker 1: Is that right?  Yeah, I graduated in '80 [1980] and went straight to, straight to law school [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California].  When I--two quick things about that.  I--seriously, when my father [Oliver Sutton] said medical school and I wasn't going in this, I had to start figuring out what I was going to do.  And I decided I was going to law school.  But it was just that.  It was like, I didn't take any classes.  I mean, I didn't take any political science.  I just like, I'm an English major.  Can I get to law school?  Yeah, okay.  Let's do that.  In my senior year, I took a business law class by a woman who was a JD/MBA at--had gotten her JD/MBA at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I knew that because there wasn't a day that went by in that class and that she didn't mention it that she'd gotten her JD/MBA at Harvard.  She gave me a grade.  It was either a midterm grade--probably it was a midterm grade, some poor grade, like a C or some C+ or something on some paper I had done.  And she was asking me about my future plans.  And I said, I'm planning to go to law school or, or, yeah.  And she said, you know, I don't think law school is for you.  She said, you know, you may have some, maybe advertising, you're kind of creative.  But, you know, I really don't think you should entertain law school dreams.  And, you know, you're not, your work is not that good.  I don't think it'll be a good career for you.  So, this is my senior year.  I was applying (laughter) to law schools.  And I went--I left her office in tears.  She didn't see me cry, but I left her office desolated--devastated.  And I walked over to the law school and I went to see Ralph Smith.  It's so funny because I ran into this guy like two weeks ago.  I recount the story for him.  I went to see the professor, a black professor of law, whom I knew--Ralph Smith, at the law school.  I said, Professor Smith, I just went to see this teacher and she gave me a C, and she said I was not going to be in law school.  And he said, don't listen to what that teacher says, just keep doing what you're doing.  This is ridiculous, just keep moving and, you know, figure out how well you can do in that class, and just it moving.  Do not let her you dissuade you.  And, you know, I knew that was the right answer.  I was really grateful for him to giving it to me.  I could have--I would have gotten that from my father [Oliver Sutton] if I had called him.  So, I felt fortunate that I was going to be able to get to that answer.  It was really nice to be able to leave that professor's office--go over, like literally walk to the--and find him and have somebody say that to me immediately, 'cause, you know, with all the self-doubt that you have is a (unclear).  And so, the end of that story, the very happy end of that story is the day that I got an acceptance from Harvard Law School, I ran into that teacher.  I mean, it was like scripted--on the walk, I ran into her.  And she said, oh, what are you doing next year?  I was like, bam (laughter). I remember that.  It was like, uhh, it usually doesn't happen that way that you get to--
Speaker 2: What did she say?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's very nice.  I'm sure she thought--uhh, you know, affirmative action at its worst or whatever.  I didn't care what she thought.  I was jumping--I could give her that letter.  It's like here, this is what I'm doing--no thanks to you (laughter).
Story_ID: 102329
Speaker 1: So, so, I get in, I get into Stan--as I say, I applied to ten law schools.  I decided that Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] is the one I want to go to.  There was a black admissions director from Yale.  I can't remember his name, but he was a really nice guy.  And I just thought, it's small, it's--it looks intimate.  It looks like people think about different issues in the law, as opposed to really trying to learn the law to be some crackerjack lawyer because I knew I, I--the more I investigated a law school, there, there are things about it that greatly appealed to me--the writing element, the, the argument element, the rational debate element, and the justice element.  And, but there were--it wasn't the burning desire to do all this.  It just seemed like academically, intellectually, this is a good thing to do.  And having had, as I will confess now, the, the privilege of knowing that I could do this without any hardship, any hardship to me (laughter), obviously to my poor family, but I could do this, I had a license to choose to go to graduate school--not with a specific profession in mind, but be--for further enrichment.  And I have what I think many college students have--it's like, the real world, you know, and sort of--if I can delay it, although I did apply for a--I was contemplating stepping out for a few years, and then going back.  But my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] really, really, really, really didn't want me to do that because she thought that if I stepped out, I wouldn't go back.  Perhaps now, I never thought about this before, but now that I know that it took her so long to get back--maybe she was concerned that 'cause she knows how long it took her to get back, that she was concerned that I wouldn't get back.  I really wanted to work in television and I was interviewing with CBS TV.  I really envisioned, even through law, that I was going to do something in TV and so, I was disappointed.  I got an interview, and she's like, don't do it, please don't do it--go on to law school.  So, I did.  But, anyway, the--so, when I got into the--when I didn't get into Yale, I had to choose between Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  And everybody, first of all, didn't think that was a choice because if you get into Harvard Law School, you go to Harvard Law School.  But they also thought, okay, if you have to choose, that's not--I mean, that's--nobody is feeling badly about that choice.  And here's the difference.  Harvard sent me a follow-up to my acceptance with some information about the next step with someone else's name on it--it was Michelle, Dear Michelle.  No, I knew I'd gotten the initial acceptance, so I knew that it was me, but they sent me the wrong--somebody's different name.  And Stanford had professors calling me to ask me if I had any questions.  They were really good in recruitment.  There was a woman in the dean's office there, the admissions officer, LaDoris Cordell, who was amazing, a black woman at Stanford.  And they were trying to encourage all the black people that had been accepted to come.  I mean, they had a harder sell.  I was in New York and, you know, so but they worked really hard.  And they did make me feel like they really wanted me--I mean, Harvard sending me wrong names.  They're calling me and asking me what they can do for me, so I, I--they--I bet, I mean, I was like--California, three years in California.  That sounds good.  I mean, I don't think I want to live there, but it's an adventure.  And I really did have the strong sense of since I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with this law degree, I want to come out on the other side the same person because, you know, as I said, I saw 1L.  And, you know, it looked, it looked so intimidating--the process of getting out of law school at Harvard just looked out such an ordeal, independent of whatever you were learning.  It just looked like they layered on ways to make you feel really badly.  And Stanford is just like, talking about the weather, and like (laughter), we'll teach you law, and you'll have a really nice time.  I thought, since I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing here, it's not like I need a Harvard degree to get me to this level.  And a Stanford degree is pretty darn good.  So, and I really wanted to go to Yale, so it wasn't like I needed to go to Harvard.  So, for me, it was sort of like a very simple decision.  It was not one I agonized over at all.
Story_ID: 102330
Speaker 1: So what, so what, how did you find it?
Speaker 2: Stanford [Law School, Stanford, California]?  It was great--it was exactly what I thought it would be.  I got through very--it was, it was a lovely place to go to law school.  First of all, it was an opportunity to spend three years.
Speaker 1: How large is each class and each--
Speaker 2: A hundred and fifty--
Speaker 1: Do you have a section?
Speaker 2: A hundred and fifty--
Speaker 1: And then, do you have sections?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were small sections.  But it was really the, the (unclear)--I mean, there were bigger lecture classes because there were about 150 something people in my class.  So, you know, there were bigger lectures when they had multiple years, but it was all very collegiate.
Speaker 1: So, a class would be like how many, fifty, thirty--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it was all very small.  We didn't have--
Speaker 1: You didn't have sections, like we had--
Speaker 2: We had sections but they were very small.  There weren't that many.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And maybe there were twenty people in a section.  But they didn't--because the school was so small, the sections didn't become our only outlet.  We had friends on everywhere because the school was so small.  I know, through my husband [HM William Lewis]'s business school experience, is that your section mates were really the people that you knew because it was a big school.  And you really focused on them, but while we focused on our sections, we were, we knew everybody.  I mean, and there was a healthy--they were twenty black people in a class of 150, which was healthier than we were in--ten men and ten women.  And so, we were--it was actually, it was really, it was lovely.  I mean, it was a great--
Speaker 1: So, who, would we know some of the people in your class?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No, actually.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I mean, I certainly--no one in my law school class has got--I mean, people went on to clerk for the Supreme Court and all.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But no one has--well, they would probably argue with me.  There were people that are very distinguished in their careers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But because I left the law such a long time ago, I haven't been following them.  But it's not like we have a Supreme Court Justice (laughter) in our ranks.  We may well someday, but we don't have it now.
Speaker 1: So where were you--what classes did you gravitate to?
Speaker 2: In law?  Oh, psychology and the law.  And I actually, you know, I'm--President [HM Barack] Obama talks about this, and so many law schools talk about this.  You really don't need three years of law school so and, and Stanford has really been in the forefront of that.  They have a lot of clinics.  I'm on the board of trustees of the law school at Stanford, and we always talk about the fact that you have to give people something to do in the third year because, basically, you've gotten all the coursework out the way.
Speaker 1: And so, in my third year, I clerked for [HM] Thelton Henderson who was a federal district court judge.  And it was an internship, or externship--I did it in his office.  And I spent a semester being his law clerk, or being one of his law clerks which was great.  I mean, so I gravitated towards classes that had combined law with something else.  And then, I gravitated toward this program because I mean, frankly, Thelton is a black judge, I just felt comfortable.  My father being a judge, I mean, seemed like it was a really good thing to do--great for your resume, but also, he was such a good guy.  He was a nice guy and I just was proud to be working in his office.  And it was just--I might, might that--it is telling that my career has had such really sort of--has really floated around in different directions because I certainly didn't start out with this like, what will get me to point X.  I didn't know what point X was and so, to go from sort of taking some psychology in law classes to clerking for a judge.
Story_ID: 102331
Speaker 1: The thing about being in a courtroom, though, is I was really comfortable because my father [Oliver Sutton] was on the bench.  And when I decided to go to law school, my father had me come--I'll never forget this--  he had me come to his chamber--not the chambers, he came into the courtroom, and I got to sit next to him on the bench.  And I'll never forget--he asked, it was an empty courtroom--he was doing some sort of divorce thing.  It wasn't any kind of trial packed in.  They were doing the settlement part of a divorce case.  So it was a lot of mathematical equations going back and forth.  The guy was an illustrator, and they were trying to figure out the present value or future value of his earnings to divide them up, so it was a kind of a dull case.  But, it's just the two lawyers in the courtroom.  And I remember him--my father saying to them, gentleman, my daughter is about to start law school, and I'd like her to sit on this case.  Do you have any objections?  And they both said, oh, no, no, Your Honor.  And I thought, aren't these guys nice (laughter), ha.  Little did I know that, you know, who's going to say no to Your Honor, you can't have your daughter sit here.  And I sat there, and I was like, have I really had the bubble over my--had there been a bubble over my head, a cartoon bubble would have read:  "Oh, my goodness.  What am I doing?  This is incredibly boring."  I felt sorry for my father who had to take notes on all this gobbledygook accounting stuff.  And I was sort of, you know, I have my notes for the--just look what (laughter), you know, the little scribbles.  I thought, yikes, what have I gotten into?  It was incredibly boring.  But, and my father would say to me in order to do well in law school, you have to love the law, you have to love the law.  It's like, I am in big trouble (laughter).
Story_ID: 102332
Speaker 1: So, where did you work summers then?
Speaker 2: In [Stanford] Law School [Stanford, California]?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: I clerked, for my first summer, I split it between the New York law firm, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan in LA [Los Angeles, California], though, their L.A. office.  And then I went to LA--I mean, I went to New York and worked in CBS Records for their law department, I think.  Throughout the summers of my high school, I worked for CBS in various entertainment (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh, so that--
Speaker 2: --and so, I kept going.  And then, I clerked the second year for Dow Lohnes & Albertson because they were a [Washington] D.C. law firm.  And I had already spun this story of how I wanted to--it wasn't a story, it was the truth.  I wanted to work in the government.  I wanted to work for the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] because I wanted to effect family viewing hour.  I knew that I always wanted to have a, a media component.  I wanted to work in the media.  I wanted to effect the images, particularly of African Americans on television and film.  I thought that there was some reason that I could help change--that there weren't enough realistic images.  And the image was so important because it was really impacting people's perception of what--who black people were.  And I grew up through all the, you know, Sanford and Son--all the different, through the exploitation films.  And I kept thinking--I never see my family there.  I never see anybody like me and, and this is not a sum total and whoever it is that's doing this, there needs to be more done.  So, I ended up working for a firm that had a lot of clients in media except that when I was in, huh, when I was in my second year, I think, maybe, whatever year that was that [President Ronald] Reagan was elected, I, I watched my dreams go down the drain because then the FCC just became a rubber stamp for cable acquisitions.  And it's like, okay, well, that's not going to be fun.  But, by that time, I was, maybe it's my third year because that time, I was like on my way.  I couldn't change, so.
Story_ID: 102333
Speaker 1: So, where do you practice when you get out?
Speaker 2: At Dow Lohnes [& Albertson], the place I clerked for.
Speaker 1: Oh, Dow--that's right, Dow Lohnes.
Speaker 2: And it was--they, they were, it was great.  They had media clients, they had newspaper clients, they had cable.
Speaker 1: Well, that was very, you know, those were unique situations to get 'cause those jobs weren't that easy to (unclear)--
Speaker 2: They were.  And it was a good job to get, except that my entry into practice was traumatized because my father [Oliver Sutton] passed away of a heart attack two weeks before the bar exam.  And so, it really--there was a sea change.  First of all, I was twenty-three, and that was mind-boggling (laughter), to say the last.  But it also robbed me of any real desire, quite frankly in retrospect, to really dive into this practice because part of my--even though my father wanted me to be a doctor, I was really looking forward to having my father sort of--
Speaker 1: You probably--
Speaker 2: --come along with me on the journey as a lawyer.  And so, my interest in it dissipated pretty quickly--not and, and I practiced and I liked winning, you know.  I certainly was ambitious enough to not give up.  But I--it was, I was really ready to move on to do something else by the time I left.  I, I left after four years.  But I never felt the--it, it never became a thing that I was really excited about doing--enough to envision myself doing it for the rest of my life.
Story_ID: 102334
Speaker 1: So, what--did, did you get a call?  How did that--I mean, you got a call saying your father [Oliver Sutton] was--
Speaker 2: Actually, the story is even a little more traumatic because the morning of my graduation day from Stanford Law School [Stanford, California], I got a call at 6:00 in the morning from my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] who said my father had had a heart attack at the hotel.  And they transferred him to--the only good thing about being at--having a heart attack at Stanford University--if you're going to have a heart attack when your child is graduating, do it at a place like Stanford where there's a world-class hospital on campus.  So they took him to the hospital, and they gave him incredibly good medical care.  He didn't get to come to my graduation (laughter), but I mean, it was traumatic.  I kind of made my way through the rest of the ceremony.  And then, I actually had to leave him there in the hospital because Stanford has a very late graduation, and bar study had started already.  And from all reports, he was going to be okay, but I had to leave him there.  So I went back to [Washington] D.C., and he went home and recuperated.  And in my estimation, went back to work too soon because in the middle of July, he went back to work.  And shortly before the, the bar exam, I got a call in D.C. that I need to come home.  Thankfully, they didn't tell me what had happened.  They just said, you need to come home right now.  You kind of know, but, you know, you don't really want to have to focus on it.  But I remember vividly being in the airplane, looking at the clouds, and thinking, okay, if the worst is the worst, I'll have to do it.  I mean, I kind of knew, but I didn't want to--it was interesting.  It gave me some time to sort of process it, kind of.  And so, I knew but they didn't, you know, when I got--I knew that it was going to--it was either really bad, about to go bad, or I didn't know where he was in.  But I was glad I didn't know that he had passed away yet.  I sort of gotten it when I got home.  I mean, I got hit when I--and they picked me up.  So, 'cause I was bad--I mean, that was bad.  It's an understatement, but that was tough, but he got to see me graduate.  The most wonderful story, and what actually endears Stanford to me to this day, is that a professor of mine took a plant, 'cause they have the big gloss, the big university graduation, and then they have the law school graduation, and you go to both.  And the professor at the law school took a plant from the stage of--that had decorated the stage at the graduation--took it to my father in the hospital and gave it to him, and sat with him for a few hours and talked law 'cause he was the civil procedure, criminal procedure guy.  So, he knew my father was a criminal lawyer.  And this--that, the professor would do that--just, I mean, I--there were no words.  It's like, oh, my gosh, you know, that, that would--that, that was a tribute to the school--it's to the professor, and just--I really felt that made my father really happy.  I'm sure it made my father really happy so.
Speaker 1: Did you--you passed the bar examination?
Speaker 2: I did, not immediately, though, which was another trauma.
Speaker 1: How does it--
Speaker 2: I did pass it but I had to take it again.  I thought I was going to--
Speaker 1: Of course, because it's too (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was sure I was going to pass it.  I'd been studying--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: --and, you know, and, but I did not.  And I was devastated, really devastated.  I mean, what worse could happen (laughter)?  It's like, I'm not only, but that I didn't have my father to, to cry to.  I didn't have a--I wasn't a lawyer.
Speaker 1: It's hard.
Speaker 2: It's really hard to be in a law firm when you have to take it again.  But, but, you know, things, things happen for mysterious reasons.  When I sat down to take that bar exam, I brought with me a teddy bear and some raisins.  I mean, I was like, whatever I need, I just need something to, you know.  And I sat next to a women who had like M&M's, whatever, a black one.  We started talking at the break.  Incredibly, she had lost her father when she was twelve.  And so, it's funny, particularly when you're younger, when you meet somebody that has had that experience, you're easily bonded because there's just a lot of stuff you don't have to say.  Because the rest of the world can't figure out if you had a father that you knew him or were close to all that time--how you could suddenly lose him?  The rest of the world is just like stymied.  So, you either know that feeling or you don't know that feeling.  So, she instantly got it, so I didn't have to say much.  And incredibly, her mother was from San Antonio [Texas], and my father had taught school briefly before he went to law school.  My father had taught her mother.  We didn't figure that out until like the next day, but she knew that her mother was from the same town, and had gone to the high school where my father had taught.  So, it was a sign like, you know, life will go on.  It was really--
Speaker 1: Your father was there that day.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: I bet he was.
Speaker 2: So--
Story_ID: 102335
Speaker 1: So, so you then, where--you're down on as you're in, what--
Speaker 2: I started out on like the K and so, what is--I don't remember in [Washington] D.C.  It's not Midtown.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I was in Dupont Circle, and then we moved over near toward the Georgetown area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, it was an interesting time.  I never felt fully invested in that--in a firm, in any firm.  It wasn't like I wanted to go from there [Dow Lohnes & Albertson] to another law firm.  I really wanted to get out of the law.  I just felt like bad entry, you know, I was not like the people that looked like the superstars.  I didn't care that much.  I didn't have that way of thinking.  I was stuck in litigation because I really--having not passed the bar the first go-around, I felt like I had no leverage to argue the, the--what division I wanted to be in.  I had to take whatever they gave me.  It was just not a really good experience.  The people were fine, but it was just not--it wasn't a good entry into practice.
Story_ID: 102336
Speaker 1: Now, had you met Bill [HM William Lewis] yet?
Speaker 2: No. I met him when I, ahh, I met him at the end of my time there.  And he actually influenced me to leave--not directly at all.  But I met him, and he was an investment banker at a time where who knew what that was.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And so, I--really who knew what that was, I had no idea.
Speaker 1: Because it was a new, it was, it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--I'd heard talk of it in law school from a very ambitious friend who was interested in it, but I didn't know what that was.  It sounded like accounting, and since I'd had my fall off in that, that wasn't particularly interesting to me. Since high school, I wasn't interested in that.  And I remember meeting him and having brunch and saying to him, what is that you do, and why do you make money than we do?  I don't understand, you know.  I, I, and then he tried to explain it.  It didn't sound--I, I really thought he was an accountant, and he clarified that.  But, you know, I was like, you know, accountant, please.  I don't, you know, so, so not--that sounds so boring.  But he sounded, he sort of said what he did--not really, but kind of explained.  I could--still couldn't figure out why they made more money.  It's like, what kind of job is this?  And, but he really loved what he was doing, he really loved it.  He worked all the time and he really loved it.  And as we got to know each other better, there were times when I'd be at the office really late working on interrogatories or something--bored out of my gourd, and not really happy.  And I would call him and he--the rare occasion, would be at home watching a game at 9:30 or 10, having just left work.  And I remember vividly hanging up and thinking, okay, this is something really wrong with this because he really loves what he does.  I'm not really happy.  He's making more money than I am, so if I'm just trying to make--I'm making good money.  But he's making better money.  So if it's the money I'm looking for, I need to do something else.  I need to do what he's doing.  I just--this isn't right.  And so, I decided that rather than--but I couldn't find a job in New York City because there was a line of lawyers trying to find jobs in New York City, and trying to get a line--I wanted to go back home because D.C. was basically a government or--
Speaker 1: A government town.
Speaker 2: --a government town and a--
Speaker 1: And it's a lawyer town, too.
Speaker 2: A lawyer town, government town, sort of international work town, but it was all the guys of lawyering.  And it's like, why am I going to do that?  So, I needed to be, I decided I needed to be in New York to find a New York job.
Story_ID: 102337
Speaker 1: And so, I called up my uncle [Percy Sutton] and he said okay.  I'm coming, I'm going to take a sabbatical from my firm [Dow Lohnes & Albertson], and I'm going to tell them that I'm coming to work for you because by that time, he had Inter City Broadcasting, which was a media company, and they had just acquired the Apollo Theater.  They had--
Speaker 2: Which was huge.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had radio stations.  And I said, I'm coming, I'm going to tell them, so back me up if anybody says what (unclear) are you.  You don't have to hire me.  I, I may come around to see what you're doing, you know, you don't have to pay me.  But, actually, that was the key.  That's all he really wanted to hear.  It's like, you don't have to pay me--I just need something to do.  I can't find a job here.  And I don't want to quit because I don't want to have no job and look for a job.  So, I'm going to tell them, you guys need me because you're launching this Showtime at the Apollo Show, and you need extra hands on deck.  So, let's make this work (laughter), and he did.  He agreed.  And they let me go.  I was, I was on unpaid sabbatical.  I mean, I'm sure they knew I wasn't coming back, but I guess it was easier all the way around (laughter) for me to just like go away for a while.  So, I came to New York and I hit the ground running to find a job.  I actually did go work for the Apollo.  And much to their surprise, they're like, what are you doing here?  (Laughter).  But I said, I got to work--I mean, I need to be in the industry.  And I, I tried to work.  I, I--
Speaker 2: Well, things were just really--I mean, it was really taking off for them.
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: Because he would, your uncle was also involved in cable television--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and cable franchise.
Speaker 1: He was pretty much a visionary on that front.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And he really tried to make a lot of things work at the same time.  I, I--once I started working there, I did audience coordination for Showtime at the Apollo, which was fun, because I had to make the audience, such that Iowans watching the show wouldn't feel like they were watching all-black show.  And so, I had the fun job of, of like leading the white people past all the black people that had been waiting in line forever, to like put them in special spot.  I had to curate the audience (laughter) in a way that the cameras handling on them would make it look like all America was in the audience.  It was like, ohh, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] is really going to come after me (laughter) on this one.  I mean, they didn't know, but it was sort of--it was fun and, and nobody got really upset.  But I did have to sort of--my job was to coordinate (unclear).  And I, you know, I took it seriously.  And I also had to study Amateur Night to see what were the--I had to go to a lot of Amateur Nights to sort of help them figure out what the magic was, so they could bring it to TV.  So, I really liked it.  I loved that being my--I loved to have a job that required me to think creatively and figure out how to do stuff so totally away from the law.  But, but it, it was a great, it was a great transition--so great in fact that I decided I wanted to work for my family's company.  And I decided to build up a business plan on what I could do and how I could add value.  And that was one of my great lessons in life.  I went to see my uncle, and I laid out this business plan.  And, quite frankly, I don't even remember what I said.  I don't remember the plan.  I mean, I remember, but I'd worked hard on it and I thought that I could add value.  And I was certainly the most highly-educated of my generation.  I should say, as an aside, that my brothers worked for the company.  My uncle's son and daughter worked for the company.  A lot of family members were in the company, and were in various high places in the company.  But I felt like it was--I could bring something to the company.  And my uncle listened to me, and then he said no.  He said that there were too many Suttons in the company already and that it wasn't going to work out.  That, I think, was one of the pivotal points in my life because it was really a, a rejection by a family member.  I felt both rejected personally and I felt rejected professionally.  It was pretty bad.  But I was already--I had--was looking for other jobs.  I mean, so it wasn't like this is my only hope.  But I really--it did, it was a big, big lesson.  My father [Oliver Sutton] had--was gone.  And I felt that wouldn't have happened if, and, obviously (laughter), my father was--would have been the person I would have gone to.  And, and my uncle and I talked about that years later because on the one hand, it was devastating.
Speaker 2: Of course, it would be, in this string of things, and plus you're having fun even, you know, there--
Speaker 1: I know, I was enjoying it.  I thought that I could really bring--add value.  But on the other hand, even in my devastation, there was a core part of me that was not, that felt like there was probably a way to interpret that as the right answer--not because I was wrong in thinking I could add value, but it wasn't going to be clear to me that whatever value I could add, it was going to be appreciated fully, even if I worked there.  It was pretty patriarchal--I mean, my male cousins were--
Speaker 2: I was going to say it's more--
Speaker 1: --and I, I do think that it was, it was, it was a decision that--I mean, I was a little young and a little naive.  I couldn't really process why he would say no.  I mean, it was--and there was some business element to it.  It wasn't like they had money to budget to pay an additional person.  But I thought that there was a justification there.  And he did not, but the, the--in retrospect, it was, it changed my life in a very good way profoundly because it forced me to figure out, okay, what do I want to do?  I mean, I never thought of myself as someone who relied on the family.  All my family members just kind of slid into the business, and while I was never told that would happen, I kind of had an assumption.  And when that assumption was ripped away (laughter), it's like, okay.  Now, this means I've got to figure out what I've got to do.
Speaker 2: On my own.
Speaker 1: On my own, I'm on my own, and that was okay.  I mean, ultimately, it got okay pretty quickly.
Story_ID: 102338
Speaker 1: And I, I was not--it was hard because of the family.  I mean, it was hard to--
Speaker 2: Well, everybody, it's hard over there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was hard because, yeah, because it was--I mean, the truth be told, family business is very complicated.  And even having worked in it, I knew how complicated, and they tend to be a little dysfunctional because if you are relying on family members to take on roles, the fact that they are family members supersedes their ability.  So, you have an uneven kind of structure.  Any family business--it's not just my family business, but when it's not pure merit that gets you to where you are, you're going to have an interesting dynamic.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, having worked in the dynamic as like an audience coordinator, I saw that it would be a challenge to, you know, make things the way that I had been accustomed to making, to working with them in other environments.  So, it wasn't like I was going to sail in there and, you know, I was going to be the best thing since sliced bread.  It was going to be a challenge as it is in any family business because you've got--I mean, I'd be reporting to cousins and uncle.  It's just weird in that respect.  So, part of me, although I was completely devastated, said okay, well, that, I don't have to worry about (laughter).  I mean, that's, that takes a pressure off of me.  I was mad, but I was really angry and, particularly, I was an angry--my father wasn't there, you know.  I was angry for reasons that were beyond this job, whatever it was.
Speaker 2: What, what--
Speaker 1: But, but it was really, in retrospect as I said, that was a pivotal point in life, both because it was so difficult at that moment.  But in retrospect, it was definitely, definitely a very good thing that could have happened to me.  I mean, fast forward to 2013, the company is bankrupt.  I'm in good shape (laughter)--I mean, and I don't mean to sound like, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's not a--I don't, I don't relish that at all.  I'm very sorry about that, but it just goes to, it, it is--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --and I don't think that my presence in there--I mean, I'm not suggesting that would have happened.
Speaker 2: But, but, you know, but I also think you might have been frustrated, too, because you might have taken, you would have wanted to take your new world thinking--
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely--
Speaker 2: --into that?
Speaker 1: --absolutely.  This is--what I've just described happens all the time in family businesses everywhere.  And I was what--twenty-three, twenty-four, if that.  I had, I had huge dreams.  But from their perspective, I was a twenty-four-year-old kid straight out of school.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't clear.   I, I--even though I saw it very clearly, the people that had been working there for years and years and years, understandably, didn't share my vision of how I was going to sort of make everything better.  So, in retrospect, I get, on lots of levels, why it didn't work.
Story_ID: 102339
Speaker 1: So, what, what happens next for you?
Speaker 2: Then I went to HBO, and they made a great job for me because I had a friend from college actually who was working in the HR.  And they developed this--it, it wasn't just for me, but they were in the process of developing it.  And I was the person that did it first--a, a program that took you through various departments of HBO.  And so, I started out in business affairs which made sense because I was a lawyer.  And then I went on to original programming.  And it was there that I felt out, aha, the sun, like the, aha moment, like I really want to be in the making of TV.  And I wanted to do a little bit of the negotiating, I wanted to be in the world of how to create a television show.  And what better place than HBO that had subscriber money up the wazoo, and nobody to answer to in terms of critics or--not critics, but ratings.  Because at that time, they just had all that money from the movies and they could just put on shows, so I was--it was thrilling.  And so, I was very, very happy there.  And that would have been the end of my story except that then, I was with my then-boyfriend, Bill [HM William Lewis] who--Morgan Stanley, the company for which he worked--gave him an offer he couldn't refuse to move to Chicago [Illinois] to run the Chicago investment banking office.  And I had to face the question of what I would do.  We were not engaged, but we had been going out for a while, and it was kind of heading in that direction.  So what I made clear to Bill is that I'm not going to Chicago (laughter), I'm not going to Chicago as your girlfriend, so let's be clear.  So then, he asked me to marry him.  Then I thought, okay, well, I'll stay in New York and stay in my dream job, and I'll just be married to a guy that lives in Chicago.  That didn't--I decided that, but he wasn't all that thrilled with that as a concept, like we're going to get married, and you're going to live here, and I'm going to live there?  It would have made sense if I was running something in HBO, but it was--I was only there for a year.  So, I had the unenviable--the decision was actually relatively easy to make.  And I made it on this basis.  What are the odds of me running HBO because that would be my, you know, it's like two paths.  What are the odds of really, of great happiness in either one?  If I ran HBO, that would make me really happy 'cause I love this company.  What are the odds?  And if I marry this guy and it works out, that would make me really happy, and what are the odds?  And I looked at the structure of HBO, and there was already a ceiling with all these faces smooshed up against it because everybody who loved working at that company stayed there forever.  And the guy--there was, the executive suite was filled with people who were waiting for their turn.  And I was just what--twenty-something?  So, the odds of me--I couldn't see the path where I could just blow through, and I was going to be at the top.  It was going to take a long time, and I was going to have a lot of competition, and I couldn't see it.  Maybe it would--if I had worked there for more years, I could see it, but I couldn't see it at that time.  So that seemed like, although it was a great dream, that that was not going to happen any time soon, and if it happens at all.  And, and on the flip side is if I don't, if I--by giving up the other one, how unhappy will I be?  Like, if I don't make it to the top of HBO, how devastated--and I'm happily married, how devastated will that be?  And if I am--if I don't get married or in the, how does that work (laughter), if I, but I, I, which would--how worse was the downside?  If I stayed at HBO, I make it to the top, and this was the guy for me in life, and I miss that out, you know, is it worse to be in a very good position in my life, marriage-wise, or sort of outside of work-wise, and not good with work, or really good with work?  And I figured, you know, how do I make decision?  And I decided that, you know, what, I'm not going to run HBO--at least I don't know how, so that should not be the reason that I don't get married because if I had a clear path, maybe I would think that would--but I got to be realistic.  I'm not even sure, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So, what date was the marriage?  What--
Speaker 2: May, May 7, 1988.  The interesting thing was I made that decision relatively quickly.  I mean, because I could sort of--even though I am not known to be the most decisive person, there were the big issues.  And I could sort of sort through, and then I made it instantly.  Telling people was really difficult.  I truly felt--I had all these women bosses, and I felt like I was really letting everybody down and myself to some degree.  I felt like I was--how could I, after all this, I'd finally gotten to the job that I really wanted.  And I sobbed--I couldn't see the pathway to the presidency, but I could see like I can flourish, and I had to give it up.  I was really not happy about that, about saying that.  I meant, I decided it, I was not happy about saying that.  And it was hard to tell people.  And I felt, and I'll never forget, that the guy that was running HBO at the time--Michael Fuchs said to me, how romantic, you're giving up your career for love.  And if I could have been able to hit him, and not have been arrested, I really would have--and lose the job, did I still have a job?  I was so angry that he had verbalized my greatest fear of the perception of what I was doing.  It's like, no, I am not doing that.  In fact, I worked for HBO in Chicago [Illinois], but it was some marketing position 'cause they didn't have production there.  So that was, it was tough.  It was a good life lesson though.  It was sort of like--I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: But you gained a great life.
Speaker 2: I got a great life (laughter), you know.  But that, it just tells you, you know, it's not easy.  You have tough decisions in life because you know, I, I have, I, I had a great life, I have a great life.  It was not the one that I perceived.  I mean, and I don't know what would have happened if I had stayed at HBO.  And, but it was interesting to have to make that decision--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to stay, to, to like--rarely does it like face you like that, you know.  Had I been married for a while, it might have been different.  Had I been at HBO for a while, it might have been different.  But I was sort at the beginning of both things, so.
Story_ID: 103185
Speaker 1: Talk about your life, so, you, you--let's talk about your life in Chicago [Illinois] 'cause you're, you're a New York gal.  I mean, you're a--
Speaker 2: I'm a New Yorker.  I was definitely--I had that poster, that sign, that New York cover, where there's New York, and then there's this little strip called California.  And then there's Europe and Asia, but there's like flatland.  I was not--what, Chicago, what?  That's that flyover city (laughter).  That's what--you didn't have to stop there anymore because it can go nonstop to California.  So, I was not looking--I wasn't envisioning a time in Chicago as something that I would really enjoy.  I, I didn't think I would hate it, but I really felt like, I'm just--I can't believe that I am moving to this city that I know nothing about because I'm marrying this guy [HM William Lewis].  It's like, who am I?  Who is that that does that?  So, but so, the joke is that I was dragged and screaming to Chicago.  And then four years later, when Bill got moved back to New York, I was dragged, kicking and screaming, away from Chicago because both of us loved Chicago.  I was so sad that my--I was pregnant with my oldest, Tyler, when I left.  I was so sad she wasn't going to be born in Chicago (laughter).  I really--I could envision my life there, I could envision the rest of my life there.  I was really happy.  It was to be fun in a city that was manageable.  It didn't have quite the edge that New York City had, but that was okay.  I understood how it was okay to live without an edge. Really friendly people. A black community that was really a black business community that was incredibly supportive, incredibly congenial, and large. There were a lot of people that were doing a lot of different things.  Yeah, it was cold, but it never got--I never experienced a winter in my time there where it made me think, you know, this is ridiculously colder than New York.  They had beaches.  It's beautiful (laughter)--just it celebrates the heck out of summer because they have such harsh winters.  I just loved it--I really did, and I made really good friends.
Speaker 1: It was vibrant.
Speaker 2: It was vibrant.  And I made--I had really good friends there.  And it was very, you know, you moved to a city that has a reputation of being the most segregated and difficult times, post-Harold Washington.  But moving in there--frankly, from a certain perch of privilege--I mean, we had a lovely apartment.  New York City prices in Chicago--I mean, we took the money that Bill sold his apartment for, his little apartment in New York for, and bought this great apartment in Chicago.  And I--we moved into the North Side and--
Speaker 1: Now, where were you living?
Speaker 2: Lincoln Park West, and moved into the North Side.  And they all these really interesting people, black and white, who are doing really interesting things.  And then, I just went to a party on the South Side.  And I met all these black people who I didn't know before who were doing interesting things.  I felt as if I really, by virtue of coming in as an adult, and Bill's business being one that was, you know, he was the only black guy in the office, I think.  But it was one where he had to be in a lot of different circles by virtue of what he did.  I didn't feel that segregation of the city because we sort of coming in at a level where it didn't--I didn't--it didn't impact me as much.  I certainly acknowledged it over time, the more I spent there.  I understood, so that the, the--how it actually worked.  And it wasn't quite as rosy for everybody in Chicago.  But as a newlywed in a new city, it was wonderful.  It was great.  I, I loved it and, and I would have stayed there.  I mean, we--it's funny.  When we moved back to New York, I was thinking, oh, no, 'cause the one thing Chicago does have is a bit of a Second City complex.  In particular, in that era, they loved putting a front page stories about how New York was falling apart, and horrible things were happening every day.  And I would read this and I'd think, okay, so now, we have to move back.  Where are we moving?  And, literally, we looked in the suburbs before we moved back into the city.  We looked all over the suburbs when I was pregnant moving back in.  But then, I was so pregnant, we decided to rent because I couldn't look any more, and discovered that actually living in the city wasn't so bad.  We weren't dodging bullets, like we thought we would be, and it's like the Chicago paper said we would be.
Story_ID: 103186
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, so, what did life become here then for you?  And can you talk a little--
Speaker 1: Here, being in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, in, in New York.
Speaker 1: Back in New York?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: I should just say that--
Speaker 2: Well, talk about some in Chicago.
Speaker 1: When, when I was in Chicago, I really tried to find a job.  And it's interesting.  All these little moments, I found a job and got a job at the Tribune [Media] Company.  Back then in Chicago, there was no Oprah Studio--there was barely Oprah [Winfrey].  There was no studio.  There was no Chicago media operation.  And so, the best I could do, in terms of what I have done at HBO, was the Tribune Company had an entertainment section.  And I almost took a--I got the job, and then I didn't take it because the Tribune Company was pretty conservative at that time.  And it wasn't clear to me that it was a far enough away from the law practice, 'cause it was in the legal department and--sort of business affairs, but it was mostly legal.  And I wasn't sure that, that was what I wanted to do.  And my husband [HM William Lewis] was really encouraging.  He said, look, you got an opportunity here, that we have some resources.  What do you really want to do, versus just doing the job that seems like the next thing that'd be easiest to do?  So, I decided to do--start a production company with a fellow friend that I had, who is also similarly--Royal Kennedy who was in Chicago because of her husband's work.  And she was a documentary film producer.  So, we got together and started trying to market with the same vision of wanting to tell stories of African Americans to the world--different than the ones that we had seen growing up, and that were on TV now.  So, we would acquire stories and try to make them into shows, one-offs, and series.  So, we spent the four years that I was in Chicago trying to do that--not particularly successfully, but it was a really good, not successful at all.  We never got anything into production, but it was a good experience.  We optioned a lot of interesting properties and really experienced why, why it's so difficult to do (laughter).  It was tough.  But then, coming back to New York, I was a very good--
Speaker 2: And, and then the other thing is you've--[HM] Jonathan Rodgers was Royal's husband?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And he had come in to manage CBS?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And, in fact, that's how I got to Royal because I went to see--my, my, the--I've always done this way.  When I go to, when I want a job, and I don't know exactly what job that it is, I start trying to meet everybody I can in any aspect of the field that has any interest--not to ask them directly for a job, but just to ask them about opportunities, and just tell them who I am.  And I did that with Jonathan.  He was general manager of CBS at the time.  And I was like, what, what can I look for?  He said you need to talk to my wife (laughter).  And he's like, what you need to do, is meet my wife.  She's been working on a script.  She's really the same person--you guys have the same ideas.  And we met, and that I'm really--he was right.  We really enjoyed working together on a variety of projects.  And we'd go out to LA [Los Angeles, California], and we actually produced a play together.  It was fun, but it was frustrating because we really couldn't ever get anything off the ground.  And it ended when--well, we, we still maintained our operation, but it became a lot less viable when I moved back to New York, and we kind of all continued doing our own thing--.
Story_ID: 103187
Speaker 1: I also worked for the Public Television Station 'cause I couldn't just sit around.  I mean, I have to tell you that when I was a lawyer, and Bill [HM William Lewis]--I was dating Bill--and I would meet these women in investment banking, these wives from Greenwich [Village, New York City, New York], who were just--they were raising their children.  And, you know, my eyes would--I mean, I was trying not to roll my eyes in front of them, but the concept of just being this wife of someone.  And I didn't have any children.  I mean, I couldn't imagine that I wouldn't be really working hard at this point in my life in my career.  So I worked for WN, WWT, WTTW Public TV Station part-time.  I worked for Katherine Lauderdale.  It was really fun, it was really a lot of fun.  I, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't really moving anywhere near--towards any kind of career, but it was a lot of work that I felt like I was supposed to be doing.  I mean, it was good work, but I, I was frustrated throughout on some level that--it was kind of, didn't know what I was doing, but it was--meaning I didn't have a master plan, which became even more evident when I started having children.
Story_ID: 103188
Speaker 1: So, I was pregnant with my daughter.  We moved back to New York and had my daughter.
Speaker 2: And this is what year?
Speaker 1: '92 [1992], 1992.  And I had my daughter and lo and behold, I, I was ready to--I remember drafting a contract, like when I was going into labor, like, really, like taking the work to the hospital so I could get it done.  And I still did that--read scripts--did a bunch of stuff in New York, but found fairly quickly after my daughter was born that I was really interested in her development.  And I thought that there would be a moment where I would--early on, where I would say, okay, now I have to, now I'm, I'm back in New York.  Let me find a job in New York.  What I did very early on was connect with women who are in media in New York.  And I would organize meetings and just sort of hear what was going on.  And I have to say that there was nothing that I heard that made me think, oh, my gosh, I've got to--this is an area that I really want to move into.  And, you know, new motherhood was really interesting and fun, and so I ended up spending a lot more time, not literally focusing on my daughter, but being a part of that environment with, you know, going from like the initial baby care to sort of baby development.  And so, it became a lot more interesting than I thought, so I always had--I was always reading scripts,  I was always doing something involving the media, but never--I didn't shift out and decide to go back to work for HBO.  That wasn't an actual option, although it was when I was pregnant, when I--after I had my daughter for a couple of years, I went back.  And they offered me a job, a part, like a project that had an eighteen-month project.  But the woman who offered it to me, who I had worked for before, said to me, but you can't get pregnant.  I need you to be, you know, you can't get pregnant.  If you're trying to have another kid, you shouldn't take this job, which, of course, is highly illegal.  But (laughter), I was trying to have another kid, so I didn't take the job.  Now, I was told, you know, you should have taken it.  And what would they have done if you'd gotten pregnant?  But I just couldn't see my way, it wasn't my way.  I mean, perhaps, perhaps it should have been, but it was not.  I could not, sort of, knowingly know that, 'cause I did not want--I was really adamant about not wanting more than a certain number of years between my children apart, because there had been more years between my brother and I.  And I wondered whether that kind of contributed to our going very different ways.  I was superstitious, call it, and I wanted there to be sort of a few times.  So, yeah, I knew I was going to get pregnant--if I could, I was going to.  So, anyway, so but I, that, so there was never a clear path back to what I wanted to do.  So, I just figured I would be--I, I'd very much worked on developing as much as I could.  But at the same time, being around, so.
Speaker 2: So your first--the, your daughter was born and her name, give her name.
Speaker 1: Tyler, Tyler--
Speaker 2: Tyler?
Speaker 1: --Renee Lewis.
Speaker 2: And she was born in 19--
Speaker 1: '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: '92 [1992].  And then your son?
Speaker 1: My son was born, my son, Carter William Lewis, was born in 1995.  And then my son, Andrew Taylor Sutton Lewis, was born in 1999.  And after two, I wondered whether I was done.  After three, I was decidedly done, happily, but done, so.
Speaker 2: They say often three is, is, is magnified.  It's harder at that point.
Speaker 1: Three, yeah.  One, one to two is a big transition, 'cause you can't imagine all the time you spend with one, that you could share that time.  Two to three is less of a big transition, but the three children is just a lot of people (laughter).  It's like, it's just a lot of activity all the time, which I was enthralled by, but I can get why.  There's a lot, there's a lot going on.
Story_ID: 103189
Speaker 1: So, what--how are you managing that and what do you become active in because--
Speaker 2: I, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  How I am managing it, and what am I--being back in New York, even though I wasn't working full time, I was immediately drawn back to the things that I was interested in, and wanted to become active in.  And then, again, I, I loved art and, and from when my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] took me around to the different museums.  And I got involved with the Studio Museum in Harlem, having gone there from its inception.  And my parents would--I can remember vividly some--my mother was part of a group called the Barristers' Wives, and they would have events in the Studio Museum, and they have talks and things.  So, I knew this to be a museum, and it was fallen--it had fallen upon hard times, and it was having budgetary trouble and I got involved.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was '89 [1989], maybe '90 [1990], maybe--no, that can't be right.
Speaker 1: No, no, no--
Speaker 2: No, it was after I came back, so like '94 [1994], a few years after I came back.  One of the things I should say, is--well, because my family was in public service growing up, the concept that you gave, you volunteered your time, and you worked with organizations, and you, you helped them was just what we did.  That wasn't a thing that--I mean, if I wasn't going to be working full-time, I was definitely going to be spending time doing something other than playing with my children.  You know, just like my eyes rolled back when I saw these women in Greenwich [Village, New York City, New York] that were raising their children, they also rolled back when I found women who said that they found their life's work in their kids.  I didn't feel that way.  I felt like it was a great--I was happy.  It was a great privilege to be able to spend that much time with them and I really enjoyed them.  I enjoyed watching them grow and doing all that I could to sort of help that process, but that couldn't be what I did exclusively.  I had to--I didn't see myself as that concept of stay-at-home mom was just--the words would make me shiver because it just sounded like you didn't do anything else.  And, and I--there were people that wanted to just do that.  And I was not among them, so I couldn't find them, couldn't find the terminology, although just this week, I have found terminology.  I was reading an article about a family, and they said that the woman was a practicing attorney, but after she got married and started having children, she stayed home to anchor the household (laughter).  And so, I liked that.  That, that kind of summarizes it very well.  I definitely anchored the household and I was on all fronts and I was--that, I thought was--that was a big job.
Speaker 1: Well, you were very dedicated to your--
Speaker 2: That was a big job.  Yeah, I was, but I wanted to be that, and not have that be the only thing that I did.
Speaker 1: Right.  So you got involved with the Studio Museum?
Speaker 2: I got involved with the Studio Museum
Speaker 1: Now, at what point did Studio Museum, you know, it had fallen on hard times?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about losing the leadership and--
Speaker 2: Well, the, the leadership when I joined--it was actually about to depart.  I mean, the, it, they had been really--the museum had been very well-run.  [HM] Mary Schmidt Campbell was the leader and it was, and, and she left and her--the woman who took over with her, from her was--also did a great job, but was much more of an administrator than an art person.  And so, the conversation began to be sort of what is it, what do we need the leadership to look like?  And she was really good at what she did, but it was falling on hard times, you know, trying to get people to donate and trying to take care of the art, and it was just a lot.  So, when I joined, it was going through the same kind of struggles that all organizations go through, you know, leadership changes and then sort of trying to figure out the strengths of all the leaders.  And by the time that I came, it was clear that there was the, the Board was trying to find a new direction.  So, I liked getting into a situation where there was actually something to figure out how to do.  And we ended up asking Lowery Sims, who was at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a curator there, and Thelma Golden, who is a curator at the Whitney [Museum of American Art], to come to the museum, Studio Museum.  That--
Speaker 1: That's huge.
Speaker 2: It was huge and it was highly satisfactory because at the end of the day throughout the '70s [1970s], and particularly in the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s], the goal was to go out into the world to get as much experience as you could finding out how mainstream operations worked, and then bring that information back to help organizations in the community.  It was like a perfect kind of--it's like sort of go out into the Ivy League and do really well, and then figure out how to bring it back.  It was like, it, it was just a perfect thing.  And the fact that both of them were able to do that and wanted to do that was huge, huge, huge.  And it gave both of them an opportunity to really pursue, very deeply, subjects that they really cared about.  I mean, Lowery focused on African American art at the, at the Met.  And Thelma, while that was not her focus at the Met, she curated a lot of shows that related to black artists.  Both of them--Harold did black artists and were friends, too, and supporters of, and it made all the sense in the world for them to come back to the museum.  So, it was really a kind of sun, moon, and stars alignment.  And while we were really grateful for all the hard work that Kinshasha [Holman Conwill] did and that certainly that Mary Schmidt Campbell did, it was really a turn that really needed to be made.  I was thrilled to be a part--I wasn't--now, I, I can blithely describe it years later.  It was very tough and hard to do and hard to figure out, and but it was, it was--
Story_ID: 103190
Speaker 1: How did you figure it out because this is the--what you're basically--you, you've changed it into a very sexy, very vibrant, very legitimate--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --arts organization--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --you know.  And that is, that, your--it could have gone the other way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, how did you strategically do that?
Speaker 2: When we--I remember vividly that one of the first things that Lowery [Stokes Sims] did was bring in a consultant, who happened also to be a friend of hers, but someone she'd worked with at the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art] who assessed museums, and just sort of came in from, you know, 30,000 feet, came, viewed everything, and basically gave you--sort of a crisis manager--gave you a sense of what needed to happen in the short term.  And I remember vividly the board meeting where she said the doors of this museum needed to be closed (laughter), like there is, you know, the, the--from my assessment, based on how I know things are to be done, you need to close this museum, you know, your debts are too great.  Your--the, the operation--there's not a clear path to success.  And, of course, that just energized us all.  See, that wasn't her only message, but that was just the beginning of the message--how much work we would have to do to get in a better position.  So we had a dedicated board.
Speaker 1: Who was on the board?
Speaker 2: Ray McGuire [HM Raymond McGuire] was the chair of the--no, I don't know if he was the chair yet.  No, [HM] George Knox was the chair, but Ray McGuire was on the board, George Knox was on the board, Nancy Lane was on the board.  We had a lot of people who were still on the board now who were there--Art Humphrey [Arthur Humphrey], Sandy Grymes [HM Sandra Grymes].  We had a lot of people who were dedicated to this museum and its concept, and really struggled to find a way to--I mean, there was no mismanagement, per se.  It was just the times are changing and, or, or no, there was no, nothing that we could point to.  There was no, there were a lot--a series of unfortunate circumstances that led us to be in a really bad situation by no one's desire.  But so, strategically, we had to reduce the debt, which we all individually gave--contributed to doing.  And Lowery and Thelma [Golden] draw, drew upon their experience in working in these, these institutions that have vast resources, like what is it we have to do first, and then how do we figure out how to do it.  And--
Speaker 1: What did they say?
Speaker 2: Fundamentally, it was back to the work.  I mean, you have to--it was, well, a lot of things had to happen at the same time.  You had to have the scholarship and the desire to go back to the roots of the museum which is an Artist-in-Residence.  The Studio Museum, the studio part of Studio Museum, is the studios that are provided to artists.  And there are artists-in-residence every year, giving a year of space and, and ability to create.  And at the end of the year, they have a show, so we went back to that and tried to recruit artists--not that we had any difficulty recruiting, but we focused on that.  We focused on shoring up the infrastructure of the organization.  And we focused on fundraising because that's where we needed funds, so we had to figure how to fundraise.  And one of the things that I was happy to be a part of was trying to figure out how we grew the fundraising event from--
Speaker 1: How much was it on an annual basis before?
Speaker 2: Well, for, I remember going to a--the, the one I went to, as a new board member, was at the Hilton and we raised $30,000.  And I remember that I didn't know what, how, what, what that was.  I mean, I didn't know how that--I knew there wasn't enough money to retire our debt, but I also didn't--I remember there were artists in the room and they all stood up, and they were all congratulated.  Ed Bradley was the host.  It was still sexy elements of it, but it was in the hotel ballroom.  I don't remember there being any dancing.  It's like those classic, you know, organizational benefit evenings.  And we needed to change that.  And we had a woman, who's Gayle Atkins, who is no longer with us, unfortunately, but she was very active socially in the city.  And she was very focused on sort of bringing lots of different worlds together.  And she was instrumental in trying to sort of re-envision the benefit.  And so, she did the first year and it was slightly larger, but it was sexier.  It was downtown, and it was sort of infused with elements of party-giving that weren't usual to a benefit.  And so, I got involved the next year and with the help of my--
Speaker 1: And this is what year, 199-?
Speaker 2: '98 [1998], '99 [1999]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, because we, we're doing a lot of things at once.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And we were fundraising in other ways, but then we started to tackle the benefit.
Story_ID: 103191
Speaker 1: And in--we tried to keep the elements that Gayle [Atkins] had introduced of sort of what makes a fun party, as well as what could we do to raise money. And I was inspired by the Met's [Metropolitan Museum of Art] Costume Institute and the Central Park Conservancy's Hat Luncheon, two events that are classic New York annual events that raise goo-gobs of money, and where, if you have to think about it, the event itself draws the people.  I mean, people go to that Costume Institute.  The celebrities go, and it's a vogue influence, and if you stopped every second person--said what exactly are you supporting?  What is the significance of the Costume Institute to the Metropolitan Museum of Art?  You would have as many different answers as different people that you stop.  So, my sense is if you can get the people in the room--I mean, you don't want to do this forever because you do want people to support what you're doing.  But if you make an event that people want to attend, almost independently or in, in close proximity, whatever it is that you're celebrating, whatever it is they do--you got, you make a thing, you build it, people come, and you, you do well for the institution.  And, and you make everybody feel good 'cause they want to be there.  So, same with the Hat Luncheon.  They raised millions and millions of dollars, and what you get to do is go to the park on a beautiful day, and sit in a hat with a lot of ladies, and it's all very lovely.  But it really is a thing that people want to do.  I mean, independent of wanting to support the park, which is a great thing to do, and everybody there wants to support the park.  Every one of our galas want to be there for the Museum, but there's also this element of we're here, and it's fun to be here. So, I, with my co-chairs, we really worked to see how do we do that.  What do we, what do we do, in terms of building a party that makes it fun, but also celebrates a museum?  And so, we get lots of artists to come, and we get galleries to come, and we get a real cross-section of New York to come because like many cities, you have the sort of black society people, meaning not society people, but black people that socialize together, and you get white people to socialize together.  And they really don't cross paths much.  But we all had friends in all different venues and we said, why don't they cross paths much?  And so, we got together.  Gayle really instituted that, but we built on it, and just got really interesting crowds of people and would curate the table.  It was fun, it was fun.  It was like of us like to entertain and so, we tried to apply our entertaining principles to a bigger universe, and figure out how to make it lively and interesting, and then the monies that we raised from this--I mean, we really--
Speaker 2: So you went from 30,000 to what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, well, 30,000 to about 300,000, and then 600,000, and then we got to millions.  We've now raised--I mean, 1.8, I think, has been our highest take in one time.  But since I have been involved, we've made--it's like $8 or $9 million over the course of the years for this museum [Studio Museum in Harlem].
Story_ID: 103192
Speaker 1: And the, the--I remember vividly that 2001, the, our benefit is October, in early October.  And so, it was--the 9/11 happened, and New York City [New York] is in standstill.  And my immediate thought--I was in the, literally, when my husband [HM William Lewis] called me to tell me, incredulously, that I didn't know what was going on.  I was in my little office with no radio on.  He--did you, you have no idea what's happening, and I remember hanging up and trying to figure out where the kids were because they were in school, but then thinking, I am not doing any kind--what, what am I doing?  I'm doing benefit work?  I mean, this is, you know, this is not what I'm going to do anymore--so much for the benefit.  And Lowery Sims, 'cause I, I was like, we're done now, we're not doing this now.  I mean, we're--our city is in crisis, right.  We're not a benefit in X number of weeks?  That doesn't make any sense.  So, Lowery called me up and she said, you're absolutely wrong.  We have to do this benefit.  We have to celebrate the arts at a time when everything is falling down around us.  We can't give up.  We can't, we cannot just, we can't give up this--and then, for the Museum's sake, but we also can't give up the concept that we should be able to celebrate things like art.  It's like, okay, Lowery, but I remember vividly trying to think of what we could do to make it, to make people want to call (laughter) because I don't know if the people were ready to leave their houses.  But also, how could we commemorate this 'cause we couldn't just have another party. So, I tried--I was trying everything.  I wanted someone to come.  I was trying to find a celebrity to come and sing the "Star Spangled Banner," something patriotic.  Finally, I got Wynton Marsalis to come, and I was trying to--I was like, Wynton, can't you just play, play "God Bless America"?  Play something that is patriotic, and Wynton looked at me--was like, yeah, right, whatever.  I mean, I, I mean, I--Wynton and I know each other, but we're dealing through a, through an intermediary, but whatever, the concept came back to me like, fine, he'll just play.  Don't, you know (laughter)--let's not push this.  And I'll never forget this.  So, Wynton, and so, we get everyone in there and, literally, you know, the, the alert system, different colors, and it was, fortunately, not a bad alert that day, you know.  It was orange alert and yellow alert, but it was a better alert.  Everybody decided, you know, much to my dislike, they were actually going to come out.  And, you know, our people--they got dressed up, you know, we, we decided to suspend our concern about the world for a minute.  And we were all in there feeling very good and close and communal.  And Wynton plays the second line song with--it's a second line that's New Orleans [Louisiana] traditional.  They do it at funerals actually.  After the funeral dirge, they do the second line where you dance to celebrate sort of that the person's going to Heaven.  And it's a classic second line song, and I remember he started playing this song.  It's a very, it's like a plaintive trombone thing.  And then, it's like drums and it's really kind of basic.  Ed Bradley, who was attending the benefit, gets up and starts whirling his napkin around.  And that's what they did on the second line.  When you follow the band, you whirl your napkins sort of, you know, that's what you do.  And as everybody's whirling their napkins in the parade, he gets--he starts whirling his napkin and he gets up on the dance floor.  And everybody gets up with their napkins.  They start whirling their napkins.  And it's this moment of--we're going to be okay 'cause, you know, we got, we got Wynton's playing, and we got that courage.  We're all here together, and it was just--from then on, we just danced for the rest of the night.  The coda to that, though, is that we all leave.  We're feeling really close and loved, and like we'll be okay.  And the alert goes up.  I remember vividly driving home, and it's now been raised to whatever the next alert is.  It's so funny that, that wasn't that long ago, and now we don't have, you know, these orange alerts and red alerts.  And it's like, man, so much for (laughter)--back to reality.  But I think everybody that was there still remembers.  And, and that to me, was the moment where you could look at a celebration as something other than some frivolous party.  I mean, it was a celebration of people and art and, and creativity.  And so, it made me happy, happy, happy to have been a part of that. And so, every year--our benefit's coming up this coming Monday.  Every year, we try to make everybody feel really good about involved with art, and making all the artists feel really good that we're so happy that they're here.  And, you know, so it's a celebration of creativity and all different kinds of spirits.  And we're very happy now that we've been able to get people to pay up (laughter) and raise more money for the museum.
Story_ID: 103193
Speaker 1: Well talk about the institution [Studio Museum in Harlem] and where it is right now because even having that combination of, of people, you know, that was significant, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was, it absolutely was.  And, you know, the Studio Museum was founded at a day when people like Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence couldn't be seen in major art galleries.  And it was a place where they could show their work, so that people could see and appreciate it.  Now, you have artists that skyrocket from the Yale Gala, the Yale School of Art [New Haven, Connecticut] to, to the Studio Museum and some instances, and they get swept up by these master gallerists.  And their work is collected internationally, which is great, but a lot of their work comes out of their experiences.  And a lot of their collectors don't share those experiences.  They can appreciate it, but they don't share it, so we actually provide a different function now.  We provide a function for people who are not seen elsewhere, but we also provide an anchor for people who are seen a lot of places, but a place where they can be seen by people who might have a greater appreciation for some of the core of their work.  We also--the Studio, the Artist-in-Residence Program has really produced a lot of people that have done that kind of leapfrogging.  And we give them the space to figure out who they are and, whereas years ago, people like Bearden and Lawrence would stay in that space and be able, and, and, and try to work from it.  I mean, now they get swept up, and they want to get back to that space just so that they don't lose track of, you know, because the world of being an artist now is, can be very complicated on the--even when it's really good (laughter).  It can be really complicated.  So, we really try hard to--and Thelma [Golden] is at the helm of that.  Lowery [Sims], at, at some point--Thelma became director, and Lowery went on to be a curator at another museum, happily and, and is very supportive still.  But Thelma really has a vision, particularly for the contemporary artists, who give them as much space as they need.  And we celebrate in this museum--artists who are both in residence in our museum and elsewhere, where they can have the space to create.  And we can give them the forum that they might not get elsewhere, or we can give them the opportunity to come back and reflect on where they are, you know.  It's mindboggling to me how many of these artists--now, their stuff auctions off in the millions.  And they--you, you can't get to their work because of the structure of the art world because there are lists and there's--I mean, it's great, commercially it's great, sort of philosophically that they're there, but it's really important.  I can remember when I was really little going to the Studio Museum and being exposed to artists I wouldn't have seen otherwise.  And it's really important for us to have these artists bring their stuff back (laughter), so that, you know, these little kids can come in and see.  Even if this work is multimillion dollar work, it's there.  And it was born there perhaps because perhaps the guy was an Artist or the woman was an Artist-in-Residence, and to feel that connection, so Studio Museum is going to continue to do that.  We want to do that.  We'll be celebrating our 50th anniversary in 2018, and we want that to be a significant celebration.  We want to be--Harlem [New York City, New York] has changed dramatically--oh, my goodness, since even when I lived there.  It continues to change.  New York City changes.  Harlem changes.  But there are some institutions that can't change.  I mean, the Apollo [Theater] should be at 125th Street.  The museum should be and they should be (unclear), which reflect the importance they've had historically in the community and their--the importance they will have in the future.  I want--50 or 100 years from now for kids--people to be able to pass where we are, and to know that we're there and why we're there, and no matter what else the neighborhood looks like, that this is a place where artists come.  And it's a little museum with a huge vision and, and it's always so funny when people come to see us.  They're like, really, it's like this (laughter), but my dream, my personal dream would be to have some iconic structure that reflects that, but, but we know that whatever we do for this museum, our goal is to institutionalize it.  We always operate from the hit by the bus theory.  I firmly believe in having, knowing the history of organizations, particularly black organizations, it's important to not have the one person who can do this 'cause you need the hit by the bus theory because if all the people that are in leadership are suddenly hit by the bus--God forbid--you need the thing to be able to go on, so that's what fuels us.
Story_ID: 102349
Speaker 1: I mean, it's very--you were born--what if you had not been, had the affiliation with Harlem [New York City, New York] beforehand?  You know, you spoke very--'cause there are a lot of people who don't know the history of the Studio Museum [in Harlem].  They've only be exposed through the fancy parties.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And Thelma Golden has become an icon herself.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: But you know, you were sort of part of that.  And what I'm saying is part of me thinks, you know, because often I've been in a positon now thinking what is our legacy, our generation?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And are we giving back?  And I've been struck recently because remember I told you the oldest--I mean, our average age is seventy.
Speaker 2: Seventy, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, of the stories, like when I first started hearing stories of our generation, it was like it's so different, you know.  But I'm constantly reminded that the seeds were planted here.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: You don't have sort of (unclear) adjusted here?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum, no question.
Speaker 1: And I, uh-hum, so--
Speaker 2: And if, yeah, it took--but, but our board is filled with people who are not--nobody--everybody didn't live in Harlem.  Everybody's not from here, you know.  Everybody going to gets there, wherever--however, they're art collectors.  There are people that just love Harlem.  They don't, they didn't grow up there.  So, it come, you know, everybody comes to this, however they get there.  But I mean, I'm sure Janelle (ph.) has a similar story for you.  We--Apollo [Theater], certainly my uncle [Percy Sutton]'s desire to buy the Apollo was borne of his desire to keep it there forever.  It's funny, yeah.  If I, if I had not--I don't know whether--I, I actually, actually don't think the fact--I mean, if I, I like to think that I've had a good part in, in getting it to where it is now.  But I do think it's not just because I lived in Harlem.  I know my passion for it is bigger than just the art.  It's for the institution.  Really, it's bigger than the art although I love the art.  We have collected art in Chicago [Illinois]--I mean, but it's just, it's bigger than that.  It's like, there needs to be whatever because Harlem is changing like a crazy thing.  It's like--
Speaker 1: It's, it's going to be where it was--before it was black.
Speaker 2: I was going to say this at the last break.  But I have a friend from Compton [California], and she's talking about ducking bullets when she was studying.  And I don't, didn't disbelieve her, but I hated it that she would tell that story, particularly to people who were just like loved--I mean, people who have no experience in, in dangerous neighborhoods, and feel like that's what it is all the time.  But I will say that when I was growing up in Harlem, if I saw a white person walking down the street in my neighborhood, there were three options, and only three.  One, they were an undercover cop.  Two, they were looking for drugs.  Three, they were really lost, and then, I worried for them most because the--I mean, they needed to go because they didn't know where they were going.  And they went and stumbled into a place that really wasn't going to be hospitable.  But truly, though, the only black people walking around there--they were working there, they were, they just weren't there.  You only saw white people and you have lower than 96th Street.  And that's not a bad thing.  It wasn't like I felt like that was wrong--it just was.  And I still have to stop myself from staring when I go uptown, and they like, you live, live here.  It's like, why don't you look a little more concerned?  It's like, 'cause I live right here (laughter).  I went into this Venturia (ph.) Place and I saw a middle school teacher from Drew? School, (unclear), this boys' private school on 78th Street.  I'm like, what are you doing here?  It's like, I live two blocks away (laughter).  What do you mean, what am I doing here?  It's my place (laughter), so, it's like just mindboggling--I mean, and just mindboggling.  And, and I don't, I don't--I know I don't look like thrilled--it's like so interesting, like wow.  And still, though, when you go up there, you know that if you're staying up there, it's not an easy mix.  I mean, there's still a lot of people that are old-time Harlem.  They're like, who are these people (laughter)?  And they're a lot of, you know, new people walking around like ignoring, like old Harlem.  And so, it's weird.
Speaker 1: But you, but you're committed to keeping the history there or so (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, it needs to--yeah.  I mean, you can't--it's like Times Square.  I mean, you can't just like--you need Broadway.  You need it to be there and you need stuff to happen on that street.  You need a financial district.  Even if everybody has moved to London [England] or New Jersey to do their operations, you need there to be a Wall Street.  I mean, you need there to be a Harlem with 125th Street and Apollo Theater and the Studio Museum, and it has to--regardless of whatever else happens there and to the extent that there is--
Story_ID: 102350
Speaker 1: So, why don't you go and talk about what your dreams are?  And then, let's talk about your blog.
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  Okay, and then I'll let you go.  Gosh, what dreams do I have, Julieanna?  I don't have any.  This is really a telling time to do this 'cause now with my youngest about to, you know, figure out what he's doing next, I can't--I mean, a ninth-grader, but he could even go to boarding school.  It's just like the--the best and the worst time to ask me.  It's like, I don't--I got to figure out something fast 'cause now I have no excuses.  Those kids, I've watched them and now they're gone (laughter).  They're good.  My anchoring of the household days--there's no more household to anchor (laughter).  I mean, there's--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --I need to do something next.
Speaker 1: --but talk about the blog.
Speaker 2: I will.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, and that's--I think where I will next go 'cause, you know, the unfortunate thing is I really can't have a stellar career at this point.  Try as I might, I'm not, I can't really start a career so.
Speaker 1: But you've, you've contributed a lot, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I think so.  And I'm, I'm comfortable with that, more so now than I have been over the years.  But, and as Jackie Kennedy says, "If you bungle raising your children, then nothing else really matters" so (laughter).
Story_ID: 102351
Speaker 1: Okay.  My children, I have my oldest daughter--Tyler is twenty-one.  She's a senior at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  My second son, Carter, is eighteen.  He's a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And my youngest, Drew, is a freshman in college--in college--a freshman in high school.  He wishes he were a freshman in college--a freshman in high school at the Collegiate School [New York City, New York], which is an all-boy private school, that he's been in since kindergarten that his brother went from kindergarten through 12th grade.  And my daughter, Tyler, went to Hunter Public School [Hunter College High School, New York City, New York], but a public school for children.  You have to test into it, so it's sort of an intellectually gifted public school.  She was there from K to 12.  So, all of my children--Tyler had a public school experience, but a sort of public school in quotes because it was a selected, a selective group of people in public school.  And my boys had a private school experience--vastly different in New York City, but all very good educations.  I mean, they had very good--they had, they were very privileged to have really good educations.  I, by the time I came back to New York and had children, I realized that the public school system was not what it was when I was in public school.  And my investigation of schools determined that I could best give my kids what they needed--what, for each kid, depending on what they needed by looking at all the schools.  And so, I chose to send Tyler to Hunter, versus the various private schools that she was admitted to, because I thought that was best for her.  It had greater diversity.  It seemed like the fit for her.  Carter was accepted to Hunter--I mean, I've been very fortunate.  All of my children had a lot of intellectual curiosity, and it was evident when they were really little.  They were--I mean, they were tested when they were little, principally, because I was trying to see if they could go to Hunter.  But they all have really a lot of--and I did my level best to encourage that.  So, as my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton] did with me, I definitely used every resource I had.  And I don't mean money--I mean, sort of time and focus and opportunity being in New York City to just engage them on many different levels as I could--not activities, like my daughter doesn't do any sports.  All of my sons do more sports, but just stuff, you know, using the--New York City is a classroom which is my mom did.  So, my, as I said, my daughter is, as I, she's graduating.  And she is, she has a job offer from Google, which I'm sure she will be accepting.  And my son is just starting out--the one in college and so.  And the baby is still--got a few years before he heads out.  But they, like I, had the privilege of knowing that there was an expectation they were going to college--not whether, but where, and graduate school, if that makes sense, as it probably will (laughter), as I will hope it does, and that we would provide them with the ability to do that--that they had the luxury of being able to go to whatever school they want to go to.  But they had to figure out what school they want to go to and get in there (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, you've created a continuity?
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: You and Bill [HM William Lewis] together?
Speaker 1: I have.  He came at this very differently because he was the first in his family to go to college.  And certainly, the first in his family to go to graduate school, but we both came out it with--from the same perspective of:  It's vital and it's natural--it's what you need to do.  It's not--it's a privilege certainly, but it's something that is expected.  It sort of what makes sense.
Story_ID: 102352
Speaker 1: So, your concern, the project that you've started [Ground Control Parenting]--
Speaker 2: I, and I, I was, I was--to segue into that, one of the ways that I--I was very fortunate and, and actually purposeful when I--Bill [HM William Lewis] and I had a lot.  We felt very similarly about a lot of different issues--education being one of them, even though we came at education from different vantage points.  And I had a really, I had a lot to think about education.  I thought a lot about education, I should say, because after going through all this about my family being so well-educated, my brother [Paul Sutton] who is a little older than I, didn't fit in so well into the educational process.  And I watched him struggle and that struggle continued, you know.  He left college after a couple of years.  And I watched him struggle against the sort of traditional parents' role back in that day of not--of, of just making you do what you're supposed to do.  And it was hard for everyone to understand what his motivation was or was not.  He really, throughout his life, I don't think ever came to grips with what his true talents were, and as he got older, had more and more difficulties sort of working with them.  He worked for the family business throughout his life and really troubled, as I've said before.  I believe, had he been born later, he would have had a lot more help in trying to figure out psychologically and academically, how he could feel better.  So, I grew up, but, but what that meant was that I was the younger sister who did well in school.  I was the smart one.  He was very smart.  No one suggested he wasn't smart, but he just couldn't make it work in school, so he wasn't doing well in school.  So, I was the one that did well in school.  So, it was more that than the smart one, but I was the one that did really well in school.  And there was always a comparison, made to some degree by my parents, although not intentionally, but made by everybody else, like your sister, why is she doing so well and, you know, what you're doing.  And I watched my brother struggle with that as a concept that this little sister of his was doing so well.  And even though that didn't negatively impact our relationship so much, it did.  It impacted it to the extent that I always felt like I was a little older, like I had to sort of watch out for him.  And I did throughout his life.  I had, I was able to sort of help him if he needed help.  But as I looked around, so I, I knew my brother situation.  I felt for him because I could see, even at a young age, that he was not meeting my father [Samuel Sutton]'s expectations.  My father wasn't bending what those expectations should be, and it was just tough for everybody.  And I watched--I looked outside of my own family, and I saw lots of other families where the boys in the family just didn't seem, regardless of the resources--and I'm focused on families that there were resources--not where there were none, and education was the ticket out, but when there were resources--but the boys just didn't seem to be able to make the best use of them.  They would sort of, you know, take the benefit of their parents' hard work, but they couldn't make it.  They couldn't take--extend the legacy of education beyond even through themselves, or beyond themselves until the next generation.  So, when I had two boys (laughter), I was really concerned about how I would parent them.  I felt like my parents were wonderful parents, but that with the fix, my brother, they missed some stuff, and not intentionally at all and not by any fault of their own 'cause they tried, but they did miss stuff.  And I think, in retrospect, one of the reasons why it turned out that I did not decide to sort of return to the workforce full time was a, a subconscious concern that it would be easier to miss something if I wasn't around.  And I don't mean standing there staring at them all the time, but always having a good grasp of all the stuff that was going on because I saw in my lifetime and watched with my brother how that happens--how it, how it can happen inadvertently.  And God knows, they loved him to death--just that that wasn't enough, just caring about him wasn't enough to help him.  So, I really was focused on my boys in particular--not in any overt way.  I didn't sort of focus on the boys versus the girls, but all the kids.  I really just wanted to make sure they were all feeling, as engaged as they possibly could be.  And if there was something that wasn't going well for them, and I don't mean any particular academic subject, although that's included in it, I just wanted to make sure they felt good about their process.  Now, if you ask them, they would say, I, you know, that you, you hand, you, you show me your work that your peril because mom is like a ridiculous editor.  And, you know, she'll make you feel badly that you're not doing your work.  Well, I try not to do that.  I have been in a--but, but I will--I am a ruthless editor.  I love to edit.  I'll edit everybody's work, my work.  I love editing.  It's more fun than writing.  So, yeah, I will sort of go hard (laughter).  It's easier when they're older and they're in high school.  I mean, they stopped showing me stuff after a while though (laughter).  Just recently, my son showed me something from college and he's like, just typos--I want nothing but typos (laughter).  And so, my, my freshman in high school was, he'd gotten the word from his sister and brother.  It's like, don't read it for anything for typos (laughter), so I get that.

Speaker 1: But I really, I need--I, I realize that I, I--let me back up, and say that in an effort to make sure I didn't miss anything, I did a lot of research.  I've been in a parent group for about twelve years.  I went to the Toddler Center, which is a Barnard Toddler Center, which is a toddler group.  I--all three of my kids went through the program.  And part of the program is teaching parents how to be really good parents for toddlers--understanding their, their communication skills, as limited as they are, can really inform me about who they are.  And in each instance, the beauty of this Barnard Toddler Center is there's a one-way mirror.  The kids are really little--they're less than two.  There's a one-way mirror that you can observe your child--not all the time, but periodically.  And see, first time, you really get to see your child interact with other people without the influence of you in the, in the room, so you get to--their personalities become more evident at that age.  So, it was really fun to see that happen and to have, to understand where their personalities were and to be instructed as a parent--how I helped those persons to grow, and don't step on them, which is really all I wanted to do.  I didn't--my, my goal after watching my parents with the both of us--I feel like my parents did a good job with that with me.  But that it was harder for them to understand my brother's personality and not step on it.  And so, out of the Toddler Center came these parent groups because we wanted to continue these kind of conversations.  And twelve years later (laughter), I still meet with women whom I've known forever.  And we talk about--well, it's really sort of a confessional.  We get to go and say, okay, I did this.  I said this.  That's really screwed up.  I know I shouldn't have said this.  How do I fix it?  So, it's been a great group to just kind of confess our sins, figure out better ways to communicate, and not with an eye towards making perfect children by any stretch, but just getting out of their way and sort of helping them, not stepping on them and, and helping them lift off and so. The boy thing, though, and I'm--I happen to be the only black person in my parent group.  And so, and, and, you know, as a black person with this opportunity to have spent so much time with these kids, to have spent so much time with all these resources, gathering all these resources--I figure, okay, I got all this information now.  What do I do with it?  And I, I thought, there's so many things you can do as a parent that a lot of people are not focused on because they're really busy.  I mean, they're really busy working hard to pay for their children's opportunities.  So, if I can help parents do little things all along the way, which could sort of stop the possibility of them missing something with one of their children, or in a more positive sense, give them the ability to give their children things in little small doses, which could add up to a generally happier family or happier kid, I need to share this information.  I've seen how it's worked.  I've seen how it doesn't work, but I've seen how it's worked for me, and it's worked for my kids.  I mean, by no means--so I started this blog [Ground Control Parenting].  I figured, let me start.  And my husband [HM William Lewis] said to me, in, in understanding my angst about, okay, what do I do next because these kids are moving on and I need to do something.  And I really envision myself as doing something in life other than staying home with my children.  He said to me, instead of looking to see what your skills can enable you to do, look for what's missing.  What's missing in the world that you can fill?  And I had a friend who was always with me, a partner in a law firm, and she similarly felt like there's something she should be doing, that were her creative talents were more but, and so we started talking about what's missing.  And, invariably, we would end up talking about our kids.  I mean, our sons, particularly, and our struggles with the way our sons were being interpreted in school and, you know, you have this element of black people of color in these predominantly white institutions say these private schools where this is layer in addition to everybody trying to do the best they can academically.  This layer of being not one of many, of being, if you can afford the private school, then you become the sort of anomaly where, you know, people don't understand because you're not that stereotypical black kid that's in the school--not that there is, that is a good thing to be, not that there is a stereotypical black kid in the school, but the sense that, you know, there are lots of stories of struggle that get you to a private school.  And then, you have the opportunity to sort of expand, but for kids that, that's not, you're not, that's not all new to you.  You're not sort of a stranger in a strange land from, with respect to the ability to pay for it, but you're still a stranger in a strange land, but expect the people don't look like you around there.  And these boys that, you know, with hip hop culture--all of the, all of the stereotypes of black young men are put on these boys in school.  It's just like that don't get discussed.  Pressures like that don't get discussed because we're all busy, understandably talking about kids that have no education, no access to it, and how we help them and grab them out of circumstances so they can see a new world.  We got boys who know what the new world is, but they can't figure out where they fit it in.  And so, that--all that mushed together made me think, I've got to do--my, my friend and I started it originally but she, being a partner in a law firm (laughter), had to drop out pretty quickly 'cause she couldn't take the time to focus on it.  My blog is called Ground Control Parenting.  It's designed for parents of boys of color--not exclusively, but and, and not exclusively black, and not exclusively boy, because most of the stuff that I write about is really gender-neutral.  But the combination of these pressures that boys experience, and the experience by anecdotal experience of my brother and my friends' brothers, and watching my friends who have children who just don't seem to be even achieving where their parents were academically.  And the parents who are kind of really busy doing what they're doing to not care so much about that.  So, you know, we are people that the educational legacy is strong for us.  And yet, we're not really heralding it as we could.
Story_ID: 102354
Speaker 1: You know, there's the perception, I think, from the outside world that we don't care that much about education.  But any--look, if you take, if you scratch the surface, you know that we have generations of very well-educated people.  And it's a, it's a privilege, but it's also, it's a right, and we need to make sure--do all we can do--the objective of education is not to get a really great job and then forget about it (laughter).  It's to make sure that all the generations behind us are well-educated so, and well-developed.  And so, the blog focuses on education.  It focuses on--there, there are different parts of it.  It's sort of young children, very young children.  It's geared--different articles are geared toward different--it's geared toward all parts of the spectrum.  And then, it's also--I also write pieces that are just inspirational.  I want to know something really great.  There's a scholar athlete that just, you know, it--any, any given day, there's a scholar athlete who is--gotten a college scholarship who's a straight-A student.  You want to hear that.  I want to hear that, in addition to these guys that, you know, are being rescued from some horrible neighborhood to play college football.  That's important, but I want to hear all the stories.  And, you know, they're not easily as picked up.  And so, I want to both provide that kind of information and then just say to parents, okay, it's a new day.  Even parents that my peers, that we benefited from everything and went to great schools, and have an expectation that our children will follow in our footsteps, which is sort of a natural expectation, if we can make that happen.  And it's such a new day.  There are 30,000 people up the line for college.  There were not 30,000 people applying for college when I was going there.  Affirmative action is threatened daily--all the way up to the Supreme Court.  We really need to take ownership of what we're doing, educationally, for our children, all of our children, especially the ones that really can't get out of it, but even the ones who have access to it that are just not doing all that they can.  And I'm not pointing fingers at parents, but I'm saying, hey, there's something you can do and it's not that hard (laughter).  And so, I'll help you out.  I got it.  I know you don't have time (laughter).  And so, that is what--it's called Ground Control Parenting because rather than being helicopter parents, we're on the ground control, we're on the ground, readying the plane, so that they can take off.  And I really see it that way.  Let them, you know, I am so happy that two of my children are gone in, in college, and I don't edit their papers.  And that's my son did let me read or proof typos, but I listen to their dilemmas.  And I say, well, what do you think you should do (laughter)?  I'm really happy to say, well, you might want to try this, but you do what you think is best.  It's great to have them in that position, but it takes a lot of work (laughter) to get them there, so that is the genesis of my blog and my dreams.  It will become very popular and there will be parent conferences just like there are expos for teachers.  There'll be expos for parents.  I mean, I really do think it's such an interesting profession of parenting that they have no training for.  And everybody kind of does, does whatever they feel and hopes for the best.  So I, I think that there's a lot of opportunity for parent education, but in the meantime, it, it's been, it feels like it is--I always feel like it is important to do.  So, that's what--in my, in my perfect world, I would so now combine and I--the somehow is what I'm working on now, sort of my interest in the arts education.  And my interest in education generally 'cause those are my two passions, arts and education.  So, I'm hopeful that in my next chapter, which is upon me, that I'll be able to figure out a way, so that I'm not causing--so that I don't roll my own eyes when I run into the young (laughter).  I don't--we don't roll our eyes together when I run into the young man or woman who's trying to figure out what they're doing with their lives (laughter).

Speaker 1: You know, the other thing, I have three last questions.  One, you've had a very successful marriage.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you credit that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) There's some funny line.  I get the--let's see (laughter).  Our, our marriage is successful because we, we actually like each other.  I mean, he [HM William Lewis]'s a good guy (laughter).  That's a good thing.  It starts out with healthy like and respect for each other.  A sense of humor is key.  We both have a sense of humor and it's maintained twenty-five, twenty-six years later.  Even though we came from very different backgrounds, we have very similar values, core values.  We are very different in what we like to do, in the things that interest us, but we have enough overlap so that it makes it palatable for each other, but also we, we have core values.  We both instinctively felt very similarly about the way that we would raise our children.  And this is the way we felt about--both of us have had great exposure to a lot of great things in life.  We've had great independent lives, lots of opportunities to do things that--I don't want to say we never dreamed of doing.  Maybe I dreamed of it, but things that--I mean, I've been in rooms with--I've, I've had a lot of exposure to a lot of really interesting things, as, as had my husband, independently.  And both of us subscribe to "that, and 50 cents will get you in the subway" concept, which means that it's a great, it's amazing, but doesn't make--it doesn't change you and it doesn't make you better than anybody else.  I think we both share that very solidly.  We also--not only do we like doing different things, but we like to let the other person do different things without us (laughter).  We (unclear) believe in sort of pursuing our passions independently.  So, I, I have that thought, you know, you need to be able to do that, to be able to stay together for a long time because it's work (laughter).  It's work just like anything else, you know, it's, it's hard work.
Story_ID: 102356
Speaker 1: And what, what do you want, what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: You know, interesting that you ask that.  I, I wrote my mother [Renee Hopkins Sutton]'s obituary recently and really had an awakening that you can have a really full life and a really rich life that never hits the front page of a newspaper and, and that sounds a little silly.  I mean, of course, you can, but because I grew up in a family and I live in a world where a lot of, where a lot of my friends do--hits the front of the newspaper, if not the front some part of the newspaper.  I think I've always associated success with public acknowledgment of success.  So, when you asked what I want to be remembered for, I think that some component of it is that it was publicly acknowledged, but less so now.  Now that I've sort of have focused on my, my mom and, and I see that the end of the day, it's really--I, you want to be able to--I want to be able to have made a difference in lives.  I mean, certainly my own family's a better, betterment of my own family's life.  But in people's lives, I would have been able to use what I have to help others and be as comfortable and, and happy in myself.  That's not--I don't want anyone else to remember me for that.  Those are my goals for myself but in terms with other people, remember before that I was, that I made contributions.  I helped, and I served, and I succeeded on my own terms.  I mean, that that I demonstrated that one could, that success is not just making a whole lot of money or, or being on the front page of a newspaper.  I mean, if, if that happens, but, but it's not that.  It's really just being able to give back--making the most of your own talents.  So, I want to be known for having made the most of my own talents and share whatever I had with people around me.
Story_ID: 102357
Speaker 1: Legacy?
Speaker 2: Certainly, education.  When I get this little one into college and all my grandchildren better be there.  They'll be funded, so they better be going somewhere (laughter).  I want, I want our family to stand tall in a proud legacy of education.  And it doesn't mean they all have to go to specific schools, although we tease the baby that, you know (laughter), he's got, he's got a mighty, he has a pathway before him.  But I--it, it means that they have to follow their passions.  They have to be intellectually curious.  They have to, but their, their measures, I want them all to--I want education to continue to be very important to my family.  I think it's going to be harder and harder as time goes on, but it's really important.  An appreciation for the arts, although I failed miserably.  One of my children, who's assured me that if he's left any art work, he will sell it (laughter).  But I want there to be a legacy of happiness in my family and just that we did all we could to promote that in the world.  And I don't mean, like laughter, happy, yeah, but just happiness in the sense of self-satisfaction.  I want everybody--I want to have done all that I can to help the people around me feel good about themselves and feel like they've--helped them accomplish what they want to accomplish.  Chocolate chip cookies, I make a mean chocolate chip cookie (laughter).  Somebody better learn that recipe (laughter).  It's pretty much mean the things that I'm most passionate about, I would love to see replicated in my children and my grandchildren, and henceforth and forever more.  And I, I'm a firm believer in the importance of institutions--educational, art, you know.  I, I like that and I want, I want everybody to be able to sort of fly as high as they want, where they want, but be drawn to sort of institutionalizing whatever it is they're doing so.

Speaker 1: This is in my house in Queens [New York] when I was five years old and it's a family portrait.  It might have been taken for some political, political capacity (unclear).  My father [Oliver Sutton] was probably running for something.  And I remember that they, they wanted me to use a doll, and I had this cropped doll.  And my--two things I remember about this are my cropped doll and the striped socks (laughter).  My brother had on striped socks.
Speaker 2: So go left to right.
Speaker 1: So I'm sitting to the left with my dolly--not, that wasn't my favorite doll.  That was just the doll that I had for the, for the--I think it was mine, but one I never used.  My brother, Paul; my father, Oliver C. Sutton; and my mother, Renee Sutton.
Speaker 2: Oops--
Speaker 1: This is my son, Carter Lewis's graduation, from high school.  From left is Jemina Bernard who is my husband's daughter from a previous relationship.  There is my son, Andrew; my son, Carter, holding the diploma; his mother next to him; and then my daughter next to me--Tyler.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Was Cary Brin [ph.] headmaster?
Speaker 1: He was during the time--
Speaker 2: Where were you when you were--
Speaker 1: --that I was there, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  That's my brother-in-law.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: This is the campus of Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut] when Bill's daughter, Jemina, was graduating from there--undergraduate.  And that's my--I like this picture just because we, we look so coordinated.  And my (laughter), my daughter is to my left, and to my right in the picture; and my son, Carter, before the baby was born.   This is me, my one--
Speaker 2: So, you look so cute there.
Speaker 1: --foray, that was my foray into modeling.  I was the local, a local--
Speaker 2: The what?
Speaker 1: --well, my first and last foray.  My local store--I think, was having a show at the school, and they asked me to model, so my mother (laughter) put me in there.
Speaker 2: Now, do you have anything from the Studio Museum?
Speaker 1: This is--you can do one.  I mean, the one to the right, it's not--this is my husband and I at a, at a party for a friend.  But it's a rare instance where the both of us--we're at a party together and looking happy so--I mean, not that's rare but (laughter), but we don't have too many of us--just two of us.  This--I hope that's not too smudgy.
Speaker 2: Is that (unclear).
Speaker 1: This begins a series of pictures that we take every summer to commemorate our, our time as a family.  My son, Andrew, or Drew to the left; and Carter; then Tyler; then myself; and then Bill.  And this next series of pictures are all from different points.  We spend the part of the summer--
Speaker 2: Some are in the Vineyard.
Speaker 1: --in the Vineyard, on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  And we always get pictures taken at that time to commemorate the summer, and then often they get to be Christmas pictures.  This is when--clearly before the baby was born.  The youngest was born, so this is circa 2000.  Let's see here.  Drew was born in '99 [1999].  I think I was pregnant with Drew, so this is probably 1999.  So, Tyler is seven and Drew is probably--I mean, Carter is probably four.  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a school shot (laughter), one of my elementary school pictures (laughter).
Speaker 1: What age?
Speaker 2: Six maybe? Maybe six.  I was--
Speaker 1: So year, approximately--
Speaker 2: It's 19-, let's see, I was six in 1965.
Speaker 1: This is another Vineyard shot.  We're getting older.  Yeah, this is pretty much it.  I mean, another Vineyard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, another Vineyard shot.  We're all getting older.  This is just our--
Speaker 2: Do you know years?
Speaker 1: Oh, this is probably 2010.  We're--yeah, they look almost the way they look now.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much--
