Speaker 1: That is correct.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the location of this interview, we'll just say 66th [Street] and West End [Avenue] in New York City [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 283738
Speaker 1: We'll start, I'm gonna start with five basic questions that we like to ask that we like to (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You'll give them to me one at a time?
Speaker 1: One at time, they're like short answers like People magazine type questions.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: Your favorite (laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean for sure. (Laughter)  I don't wanna cut anything out that is good (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I think that would go towards the purple area, lavender and purple.  I can be fickle in that area also.  I tend to dress in colors that was--a system that was given to me by I guess we could call him a seer and nine colors, it seemed to help organize my life, but I would say purple.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite kind of--?
Speaker 1: Time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm kinda fickle in that one too, I adore spring and I'm passionate about fall. Both of those times of the year are reminders of this greater thing that we've come from, especially the fall as you see the leaves and you see the light coming through the trees and it's almost as if the trees have the light and it then reminds me of the light that each of us have as we go along, you know. So both of those times of the year. And the, and the, and for the spring it's the awakening that is so exciting.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: H-O-M-E, home!  As a matter of fact when it comes--vacant time, I don't want to hear about a bus, a plane, a train, a car, a ticket or nothing, and what a place to be living in to take a vacation, I mean it's my home and it's New York City [New York, New York], for heaven sakes (laughter)!
Speaker 1: So do you have a favorite phrase or a favorite saying?
Speaker 2: I think bless you is my favorite one, or God bless you, and I found myself recently saying to folks God love you, God loves you and I do too, and I'm trying my best to love human beings.  You don't give me much of a chance, but I'm trying my best (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So--.
Speaker 2: And I remember there was a bumper sticker one time and I got it and it was out on the West Coast, in like Seattle [Washington] somewhere, Washington, and the bumper sticker said God loves you, and I'm trying (laughter).
Story_ID: 283739
Speaker 1: So we're gonna start with your childhood and being born in the South, in Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Birmingham, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what you remember about your life and the South?
Speaker 2: Not very much. I do remember being in my maternal grandmother's home.  I do remember that house, I do remember the yard in that house and the pathway and the honeysuckle bush that grew on the side. And I do remember how to get from one grandmother's house to the other grandmother's house when I had frayed the nerves of one grandmother (laughter), okay, and it wasn't very far, a few little blocks. And so whenever going back to Birmingham, I don't know how to get there but as soon as we get close to those abodes, I--it rings a bell.  We left--my stepfather, his name was Zadock, Z-A-D-O-C-K, Felious, F-E-L-I-O-U-S, closest thing to a saint in the form of a human being I've ever been around.  Absolute wonderful man. He worked in the steel mill, he developed a lung condition that was not tuberculosis and my mother [Flora Saunders Felious] told us later until about ten minutes before he died, which was in Los Angeles [California] in the hospital. But they treated him as if he had tuberculosis, and that was bed rest and clear air and whatever.  So the doctors told him he had to--he should move to a drier climate and I'm not quite sure Los Angeles was a drier climate, but I do know that Birmingham, Alabama people lived out there, and those people are so stuck together, I mean (laughter) they will go where the other is, so we moved out to California.  Daddy and his brother, Uncle Otto [Felious], drove to Los Angeles, they found jobs and they found a house, and then we, my sister and my mother and I went out on the train with tons of food being packed so we shouldn't starve along the way, right, okay.  So we moved to Los Angeles for drier climate and for his health.  I was six and my sister was three, so we mostly grew up in Los Angeles, and went through school in Los Angeles and we, neither one of us knew, outside of family, much about Alabama.
Story_ID: 283740
Speaker 1: So you talked a little about your stepfather [Zadock Felious].  Can you tell me your mother's name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Flora.
Speaker 1: Flora.  F--.
Speaker 2: Flora Saunders was her maiden name, Flora Holmes was her married, her first married name and my father's [Reuben Holmes] name, and then Flora Saunders Holmes Felious was her last name.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know your mother's date of birth and where she was--?
Speaker 2: No, I--.
Speaker 1: And her place of birth?  Was she born in Birmingham [Alabama] as well?
Speaker 2: In Alabama. I don't think the family traveled much away from Alabama until we moved out to California.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have the opportunity to meet your biological father before your stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter-of-fact I did, and I started meeting him and it was a long time after I met him, I've seen, I'd seen him many times before.  Someone told me that when he was younger he played the guitar, and I was playing the guitar at the time and so I said, "Papa, if you teach me how to play a chord I'll be a real folk singer, right?"  Well, he didn't remember (laughter) what he did with the guitar, as I don't remember what I did with the guitar.  At this point, I stopped playing, yeah.
Story_ID: 283741
Speaker 1: So your family moved to the West Coast, do you know, I mean even if it's as an adult, do you know why so--why Alabamians, why people in Birmingham [Alabama] were choosing to move out to the West as opposed to Detroit [Michigan], or someplace north? Was it for work, were they working on the railroads?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, definitely--.
Speaker 1: Did they work on the railroad?
Speaker 2: Those who worked in the car industry--that was Detroit. Out on the West Coast there were jobs as well and more people I think moved to Detroit and Chicago [Illinois] than did the West Coast. And now, maybe the West Coast had something to do with the drier climate that my father [Gordon's stepfather, Zadock Felious] needed, I'm not quite sure, but I remember daddy was in the hospital as they treated him as if had tuberculosis.  He was in the hospital all the time, and my mother [Flora Saunders Felious] would work. And maybe you will be able to find what they used to call welfare.  It was a system, a social system where professionals would come by and help people who were marginal as earning monies and who needed help along the way. And I remember my mother working and our house was spotless and we were spotless and there was always food there.  My--she may have had a hard time, but my sister and I didn't know of it.  'Cause no, we were never hungry, or we never got--maybe we wanted a toy and couldn't afford it, or maybe we wanted to go to the movie and had to sell the, the Coca-Cola bottles in order to get the movie fare, but you know, we didn't--my sister and I didn't really have a hard time of it. My ma did, and she was visiting daddy all the time. So I'm not quite sure where and why I went into that part, but--. Oh yes, did it have to do with why moving in different areas?
Speaker 1: We were talking about were they moving, did they move for a specific job, was it working on the railroads that your, that he moved out (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they weren't--they didn't work on the railroads, no.
Story_ID: 283742
Speaker 1: Now, you spoke some about both grandmothers in Alabama.  Do you remember your grandmothers' names on both sides, starting with your mother's [Flora Saunders Felious] mother?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother is my guardian angel, and her name is Mama Lizzie [ph.], and I swear she's kept me outta trouble (laughter), and found some great things for me to get into as well.  My--Zadock's [Gordon's stepfather, Zadock Felious] father and mother were the Felious' and I didn't know Mama Felious and Papa Felious very well.  It was--the Felious family were very snobbish.  If you weren't a Felious, you just barely made it to the human charts, okay.  Now, the grandparents weren't like that, the kids kinda--. Anyway, so I don't know really much of either my maternal grandmother and my, my paternal grandmother had died by the time I was an adult visiting my father [Reuben Holmes], but the family always said that I looked exactly like my grandmother and that I was like her, very much like her.
Story_ID: 283743
Speaker 1: Were there ever any, did any--were there ever any legends in the family?  Were there ever any stories about people who'd done things in the family prior to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know that's one of the areas that concerns me and also an area where I do have to congratulate the both of you for doing the work that you're doing.  In the past there has been, and as I think a result of Hollywood, a shame of freed, we do--. In this country, let's start it this way, everybody wanted to be an American.  Now, we weren't quite sure what an American was.  We knew it was not an American Indian [Native American], so then maybe it was the Geddes and the Rockefellers and the robber barons, but whatever, they were of pale color, and male.  Okay, Hollywood comes along and I don't care how often they scream that their films or the television does not educate, it does educate.  These kids see these films and that is the information that they are being fed, all right?  So, when I was growing up Hollywood was very big and nobody was right according to Hollywood. And every time you saw somebody black in a film they played stupid, and just yesterday, I had on television, surfing the television, and there was some movie on and there was a black actor in there, and what was his name? Sambo, okay and he,  "Ma-da-ma-du-" all over the place and so when we would see that, we as a black community, especially the kids see that, we were ashamed of it and, but we were being told that, that was the way we were so we swallowed it.  We took it to ourselves and we're still suffering from that.  You see how movies are produced today and what is going on and what is called funny?  Funny is where you have to hurt somebody or be mean to them or put somebody down.  Where is that coming from, that's not helpful to anybody, and so you have to be quick and smart in order to put somebody down and if you can't think of enough words, you go into the curse words, right?  And I, I have a very low view of what is happening and how in the world can this be fixed?  I don't know how this can be fixed.
Story_ID: 283744
Speaker 1: Well, when you were a child in Los Angeles [California] and you were in, yeah practically in Hollywood, who did you look up to?  Who were you role models?  As a kid, I'm saying when you were young, even before you had the opportunity to start school, when you were young and in California and L.A. [Los Angeles, California], who did you look up to?  Who did you wanna be like?
Speaker 2: Oh, well I'm not quite sure that a kid at six years old wants to be like anybody, I think maybe if someone had asked, "What do you want to be," I want to be a nurse, you know, or as little boys would say, "I wanna be a fireman, I wanna be a doctor." You know those were, those were the areas that were presented to us, you know. So there were people around my family who was sort of straight up and down and straightforward people that I liked.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: Okay--.
Speaker 1: And the straight up and down and straightforward, that sounds good?
Speaker 2: Well, they were friends of my, of my mother's [Flora Saunders Felious] and my, well actually of my mother's and of the family and Ethel [ph.] was one, who was my mother's sister-in-law, okay. And there were several women within the neighborhood.  If I were taking a note on people to be like, just looking back now, but I wasn't taking notes in those days.
Story_ID: 283745
Speaker 1: Thinking back to when growing up, we had for our information the AM radio. No television, no, but we had the movies also.  Now, on the radio, we had the classical musical station, we had the top ten popular song station, we had the church stations and gospel and we had rhythm and blues stations, we had drama, oh yes, we had drama, and suspense and stories that were written for the radio and oh, I still am a radio baby because of it to tell you the truth. And then in the movies they had symphony orchestras, they had the soprano voices, singing with the symphony orchestra or the tenor voices, so our musical supply was across the board. And then daddy [Gordon's stepfather, Zadock Felious], whenever he was out of the hospital would take us each week to the Orpheum [Theatre, Los Angeles, California] or the Paramount Theatre [Los Angeles], which was a black theater, and we would hear the big bands as they changed each week.  So we grew up with a healthy, wonderful, broad bunch of music.  The--I remember, oh on Saturday afternoons, we would have the Metropolitan Opera from New York [New York] and then Saturday evenings when daddy was home, we would listen to the Grand Ole Opry from Nashville [Tennessee]. And when I became interested in classical music, having been influenced by Marian Anderson, a magnificent contralto, a black woman voice, and Paul Robeson, an incredible voice, baritone bass voice, black man, and I remember my getting interested in classical music and assuming the, the area of looking down on all that, that was not classical.  Oh, please, oh, honey, if it wasn't classical, it wasn't--I don't know really how my mother [Flora Saunders Felious] put up with me, to tell you the truth.  Anyway, so when it came to Saturday night and the Grand Ole Opry was coming on and I was, "Um-um," with some kind of attitude, years later when I started becoming interested in folk music, it is amazing how much I remember from the Grand Ole Opry shows, which I thought I was not listening to, including names of people and words to songs and whatever. (Laughter) Yes.
Story_ID: 283746
Speaker 1: So my musical education was really very--I came along at a time when it was very, very broad, very wide and which is good, because I did know that as I studied, they discovered I had a voice and when I was eleven years old. But the teacher told my mother [Flora Saunders Felious] put wait till I was thirteen, because a little, because our bodies were changing.  So when I was thirteen my mother managed to afford music, voice lessons for me, and when she couldn't anymore she took me to the theater she worked at which was the Turnabout Theater in La Cienega Boulevard in Hollywood [California]. And it was, they were like a family, the Yale Puppeteers, they were like a family to all of us. And the puppeteer, Harry Burnett then started sponsoring my voice lessons until I got out of school and could pay for my own voice lessons. And the, the area of folk music I really went into as a hobby, and I was so busy figuring out my C chord and my G chord and my easy F chord on the guitar, and my teacher loved it because I would forget to get into my throat and mess my throat up, right, okay. So always around the voice, there has been help, I mean people have reached out and helped guide me in some kind of way. And so I was singing, I was coming into the area of folk music around the time that we were writing out and having signed petitions to save Ethel [Rosenberg] and Julius Rosenberg, and they were accused of being spies.  Later on they were not, they were exonerated, but they had been executed.  So always around the folk music, it has been my political, the political part of me which is about all of me. (Laughter) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 2: But you talked about as a child on the radio, there was classical, there was gossip, gospel, there was big band in the home.  Why was there so much music in the home, why was there--was it just naturally a musical family or?
Speaker 1: No, you just turned on the radio.  It was over the radio, and it wasn't done self-consciously at all, you get up I guess you just turned on the radio, and there were things that we tune in to hear like the 'Lux [Radio] Theater' and the Saturday morning children's programs that were drama, and things like that but, it was, it was there and all you needed to do was turn on the dial (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Turn it on.
Story_ID: 283747
Speaker 1: So when you started school in Los Angeles [California], first grade, do you remember first grade, going to first grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, no I don't remember.
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of school?
Speaker 2: Holy Moses, I--I do--just generally I didn't care for going to school.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: I was very shy and to the point of being backward, and I didn't like myself or anybody else and--.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you like yourself?
Speaker 2: I grew up in a country that portrayed what I came from as dumb and if it was Africa we would say, "Ooga, googa, moonga," or if we were American we were just plain dumb, and I took those for gospel, I took those attitudes.
Story_ID: 284098
Speaker 1: Okay, now I think I was in the area of not liking myself or anybody else, okay, because I swallowed what was the education of us in this country which was movies, and although there were not signs in Los Angeles [California] that said colored drinking fountain and white drinking fountain and/or toilets, we knew where we shouldn't go.  They just didn't have signs, in the South they had signs but they didn't need the signs out in California, okay.
Speaker 2: And I just wanna explore that just for a second.  They--you said they didn't need the signs, it was just an awareness that you knew or your mom [Flora Saunders Felious] told you or you could just sense where you were not supposed to go in California?
Speaker 1: I'd appreciate your not doing that--.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry I was just--.
Speaker 1: Let me, letting me finish with whatever (unclear)--okay, that's all right.  One and one is two, so as you go to some place you know you're not wanted, you know you're gonna get some flak, you know.  That doesn't take a terribly highly sensitive person to recognize that, okay, so Mama didn't have to tell us that.  The whole of a society told us that.  What other, as we saw, what we were and how we were projected on the film was how other people saw us projected on the film, so that must the way they were thinking of us as well.  Okay. And I didn't like how they were doing or what they were doing and that I was figured into that one was a hard row to hoe.  Okay, now on the train, in the daytime we were in our little starched dresses. In the night time we would get into our little pajamas--this is going from Alabama to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and wash our face and brush our teeth and go to sleep and wake up in the morning, take our little wash off and put our little starched dresses back on and get some food, and, and really have a good time on the train.  I don't remember where it was that the train was stopped at a station and this conductor came back saying that, "All the colored people in this train had to move to another train."  That all already, that's the deepest wound that I had received to that date.  There was something wrong with me, it wasn't us, it wasn't black community, it wasn't--it was something was wrong with me. And I took that to me, and I didn't like that I was there and something was wrong with me.  So, the hatred was built up in me as response to how I was projected and/or treated within our social system at the time.
Story_ID: 284099
Speaker 1: I, when we got to Los Angeles [California] I was quite thin, and black mothers, as I understand it, liked to have chubby little babies because everybody knows that you're taking good care of your baby with a chubby little baby.  Well, my mother [Flora Saunders Felious] took to taking me to the hospital and getting me a shot with the thyroid shots in order that I might put some meat on my bones, okay.  I guess that was okay, and then I started gaining weight, and one day my mother and I were going to the store and I was walking ahead of her and I had gained a lot of weight and my mother had said to me, "Oh, girl you so fat."  Okay, so we have--I wasn't right 'cause I was thin, then there was doctoring of me to make me fat, and then I wasn't right 'cause I was fat.  Okay, that, that's all in the thing, so that didn't make me love myself anymore either, okay.  When I discovered folk music, there, my thrust and interest were the prison work songs.  Through those I could get my rocks off, my anger.  They didn't know where the prisoners started, and I ended or vice versa, and I could just spill it all out there.  There were times when the venom was so hard and so heavy that by the time I finished a song people would be up on their feet clapping and screaming, and you know and that was just to get some of that negative off of 'em I'm sure, you know. So, now, the good news of all of that is that being able to let's say get my rocks off through the prison work songs, it got to the place where I could not act the songs out.  If I were not in that hating state doing the songs, and I was trying to act the song like 'John Henry' was the first song that got up and walked out of my door.  I was trying, I was trying, I was acting it out and I remember what it sounded like before, when I was really into it and I felt like I was cheating somebody, you know.  So I couldn't, I could, I can say that it's been through that repertoire and my getting into it that's healed me so that I could start working and writing on another board that is of my making and choosing, not of somebody else's view of, of me.
Story_ID: 284100
Speaker 1: Well, when you were younger and you were doing the classical music, when you were studying voice--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was there, what was that about?  Were you still--had, you had the anger at that time but you had no outlet for it so the classical music provided you with what, or at that time what was the classical (unclear) what was that outlet(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I loved the classical music just for itself.  It too is healing; it's something healing about music, period.  The classical--I did not fool myself.  Marian Anderson was not invited to the Metropolitan Opera [House, New York, New York] to do 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi] before, just before she retired, so I knew this little black girl was not going to be in opera and so what I had in my mind was to get a bunch of us voice students together, learn the repertoire of the oratorios, and then offer ourselves up to churches and schools who were going to do like the 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel], the 'Four Seasons' [Antonio Vivaldi] or the whatever, that's what I had in mind to do, but I, I had no illusion of, of being discovered to do opera in the United States, they'd have let me know of that already.
Speaker 1: So when you were doing the--you were in a chorus in what was--the 'Rainbow'?
Speaker 2: 'Finian's Rainbow.'
Speaker 1: 'Finian's Rainbow.'  What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, that was really quite exciting.  First off, I was around dancers and singers and before that the other grouping of people I'd been around or were our high school, and junior college, you know and so here we were and there was some dancing and some singing and it was very exciting.  I was in the chorus, and they brought the dancers and the singers to a great huge rehearsal room and they had us stand around and the maestro said, "I just want you to listen because you won't be able to take direction the first time you hear what is gonna be happening," okay.  Well, in 'Finian's Rainbow' the opening of the show is a harmonica being played and Sonny Terry played the harmonica.  He did it in New York [New York], the original.  Well, in Los Angeles [California] when they were going to do it for the summer production, they looked around and found all kinds of harmonica players, and they finally just had to bring Sonny Terry out to California to do it at the, at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. So we stood there and listened to this man do unbelievable things with his harmonica, and so and that, so was like a--now Sonny Terry is in the area of the folk music.  I hadn't been into folk music yet, right.  And so here, here my guardian angel is pulling some things together here you know. (Laughter) She's knitting and (unclear) and carrying on, okay.  We did it one year and then they did it the next year, exchanging places with 'Guys and Dolls' which was at the opera house [War Memorial Opera House] in San Francisco [California] and we were at the Greek Theatre in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], then we changed places.  So that was the first time I was away from home by myself.  Oh, was I sophisticated.  It only took two days before I was so homesick (laughter) two days, okay, the world traveler, okay.
Story_ID: 284101
Speaker 1: Now, a friend of mine I had gone to junior high school with, heard that I was in San Francisco [California] and she and her husband Paul Mapes, she's Jo Mapes found me and I would hang out with Jo and Paul at Vesuvio's [Vesuvio Cafe] in North Beach in San Francisco with the sawdust on the floor.  Oh, was that romantic, oh please. And I think we were the last of the bohemians, after that we became beatniks or something like but whatever (laughter), we were the last of the bohemians, okay.  So after they threw us out of the, the Vesuvio's, we would go to Jo and Paul's house and the eaves were dropping, and there was some Gallo wine or something and people was playing the guitars and playing, accompanying each other and singing and harmonizing and that was how I was introduced to this huge area of folk songs that people came together on, and with and it was like communion, you know. It was very encouraging. And there's still one song I heard back on that day, 'I'm My Mother's Child,' and as I told you two days and I was homesick.  I haven't run into that song.  One of these days I will run into that song again, right. But when I got back to Los Angeles [California] I was, went back to the job that I was away for two weeks from, and I was a live-in housekeeper and when I finished my work I'd go down to my room, take the guitar and play my C, G and easy F [chords] and with a capo to put on the neck, I had at least three keys I could sing in, and people would sing songs and be easy to learn the songs and you played the records and learned the song and you get together and you--it was a wonderful time. And I went back to visit Jo Mapes and her daughter, my godchild, Hillary [Mapes], and I was offered a job singing at the, at the, what was it--Enrico Banducci his, maybe his club name [hungry i, San Francisco, California] will come to me.  This where Mort Sahl was for a long time, anyway, I did go back to San Francisco for the job but I couldn't get the job because the people, the person who was there regularly said only on his days off, but I found another job, and then I found the Tin Angel [San Francisco, California].  As I say you know my guardian angel just has woven these things through magnificently, yeah.
Story_ID: 284102
Speaker 1: You mentioned the Tin Angel [San Francisco, California], and that was one of the places that you found work.
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: The Tin Angel was--.
Speaker 2: No, that was where, that was where I became professional, the Tin Angel.  Jo Mapes brought Peggy-Tolk Watkins to Cable Car Village [San Francisco, California] where I was singing, I had one night gig, and she had told Peggy about me. And Peggy heard me, and she owned the Tin Angel, and when I finished singing I went over to the table, she said, "Why don't you come over to the Tin Angel, get your drink."  She had said, "If I hire you, I'll buy you a drink," okay.  So she hired me. Went to the Tin Angel, there was a music critic by the name of Frankenstein [Alfred Frankenstein] and he had a column that ran about four columns.  He was big, and he was on vacation. And there's a writer by the name of Robert Hagen, and he wrote in Frankenstein's column about the Tin Angel being on the Embarcadero across where the boats parked and whatever, and the train, the freight trains that went, rode right in front of it picking up manufacturing goods right along the river there. And [Jean] Varda was a man who was born in Greece and he did collages and he had a boat, every Sunday we'd go out on the boat and sing folk songs and eat and whatever and an Odetta and let's say the article came out--. Oh and Robert Hagen called me Bessie Smith with a crew cut, yes (laughter), cause I had cut my hair and washed it and left it.  Now that is what folk music and the stories and that I've heard of my--the strength of the people I came from did for me.  It straightened my back and it kinked my hair, and what was called a natural or an afro used to be called an Odetta. I was the first one in the country walking around with my hair washed and left, okay.
Story_ID: 284103
Speaker 1: But you were singing folk music, what had ins- was it just that harmonica?  Hearing that harmonica and you being in San Francisco [California] that you'd come across (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no it was a whole lotta different things.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what some of the mixture of those things were?
Speaker 2: Well, I heard the harmonica and there was something really very real about the music that was coming from that and when in San Francisco, and hanging out with these people who knew a lot of songs that were called folk songs, they would sing 'em and they would harmonize with each other and they would play the guitars together so I was being introduced to a whole span of music that I'm not sure if ever anybody can reach the bottom of what all that music is and it's there in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] waiting for us, because we've had people who did not believe that culture only had to do with Europe or England.  They knew that we had something going here and they collected it.
Speaker 1: And I've read something I can't remember where but I--that spoke about you and the Library of Congress and putting a lot of the research together.
Story_ID: 284104
Speaker 1: One thing I wanna go back to is at the time in the country where women--were black women mainly wearing their hair straightened?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was it--did you think about what you were doing at the time--is any sort of political statement?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, nothing but political, absolutely, absolutely that was on purpose.
Speaker 1: Well what were people's reactions to your hair?
Speaker 2: Well I had an aunt that said, "Girl when are you gonna get your back to natural?"  Now that was straightened.  I said, "If you'd like to rephrase that question, I'll answer you," (laughter).  Now, whenever on the road I went into a barber--I would have to go to a barbershop and if I walked in and the barbershop looked like he thought that was a great idea, if the barber guy, I would sit in his chair and have him cut my hair because if he messed it, if anybody messed it up there was nothing to cover it up, right. But if it looked like he didn't really know about this thing with earrings and this short hair, I would all of a sudden remember an appointment I had to go to, and get outta there.  It was, I always hated fooling with my hair anyway. And that was really--that was easy, easy, this is even easier (laughter) just to braid 'em up and leave.
Speaker 1: But that's such a statement to make in the country at that time with your hair when so many black people have been concerned with hair and looking you know a particular way, that it was a really bold step to wear your hair natural.
Speaker 2: Well it was further away from the attempt to look white, 'cause your hair was straight.
Speaker 1: Now who had--?
Speaker 2: It looked like you had good hair or whatever.
Speaker 1: Who had you seen with--like how, how, like you know they say you can't be what you can't see.  Who had you seen with natural hair to even, that allowed you to give yourself permission to wear your hair naturally?
Speaker 2: Nobody, I didn't see anybody.  That doesn't mean that there weren't people around, women around this country who cut their hair short and washed it and left.  It's--I had not seen that, and as far as I know I was the first one running around the country with, with the hair short.
Speaker 1: And in your mind you were being as further, as far away from white as you possibly could by wearing your hair--?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't, it wasn't that self-conscious, I was--I was projecting me.  It had nothing to do with objecting to anybody.  I was projecting me.
Story_ID: 284105
Speaker 1: So along with projecting you, how did you do that through the music with the folk music?  What sort of music (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was no way to keep me outta the music. (Laughter) Because whatever it is that we get into, we bring to that particular area what we have experienced before there's--so there's no way to take you out of what it is that you're doing.  There's no way to take you out of what you're doing, you know, it, you can't subtract it, it's just there.
Speaker 1: I mean I guess what I'm interested is you talked a lot about the hatred and the music and you'd been so angry that and I'm--.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, not in the music.
Speaker 1: Not, okay.
Speaker 2: I was angry with myself, I hated myself.  It was through the music that I was able to work on the bitterness and the hate.  As prisoners worked with a whip on their backs from sun up to sun down, you know there was resentment, there was hate, there was fury, it was all kinds of these negative things going, and I used, I used that area to work on what areas I had to work on, to and I had no idea that it would cure me or heal me.  I just knew that I felt--I felt wonderful getting it out, because there was no way I could say to anybody, you know, I hate you and I hate me and I hate everything and I hate everybody and I'm frustrated and I wish I was somebody else, and you know there was just no way, but through that, through that, that music, all of a sudden I'm a wholer, a wholer person (laughter).
Story_ID: 284106
Speaker 1: You spoke a little bit or you just mentioned in passing, your sister.  Did you only have one sibling?
Speaker 2: I have an older brother by my father's [Reuben Holmes] first marriage.  His name is Reuben Holmes, Jr. and he's in Birmingham, Alabama, and then my sister, I lost my sister about four years ago.  That's quite a loss. (Pause) That's it.
Story_ID: 284107
Speaker 1: Just to go back a little bit in time before you got the first professional--before you became a professional at the Angel, Tin Angel [San Francisco, California], can you give me, are there any steps that led up to you becoming professional, or are there any smaller important things that were happening that you can think of?
Speaker 2: Well, in Los Angeles [California] we would all of us, guitar tooting persons, we would get together and we would have hootenannies, and the people who were working on, actually on the firing line, like people who are actually working toward saving the Rosenbergs [Julius Rosenberg and Ethel Rosenberg], let's say.  They would give parties or evenings where people would pay money to go in order to mimeograph or whatever it is to fund whatever it was they were up to funding, and they would call singers in to do a program, and they'd, they'd give us five dollars, something like that, right.  So, always we were in that area of supporting. And then, then we were of course pro-union people and we bounded together and we said well we have to have at least ten dollars (laughter). Really socked it to 'em, okay (laughter).  So we would do that and then--. As a matter of fact the word within the folk music community, if someone hit a great lick in New York [New York], we would hear about it California the very next day.  So when Paul Robeson came to Los Angeles, he had heard about me on the grapevine.  I hadn't--I wasn't professional yet, it's just on the grapevine, okay?  And so I was asked to sing at a concert he was doing downtown Los Angeles and I'd sung in front of people before. I never was nervous about singing in front of people, I, because I knew if I could just concentrate on just what I was about to do and don't worry about reaction to whatever it was I was gonna do, I didn't have to get nervous, right.  Well if was gonna be in the same building as Paul Robeson, well that got me to going, okay.  Well, I got out, I was wearing a dress that was (unclear) oh, okay, and the ruffle, my-- bottom of my dress was ruffling and I looked down and my dress was ruffling and my knees were shaking cause I was in the same building with Paul Robeson (laughter).
Story_ID: 283758
Speaker 1: You're speaking about playing for Paul--with Paul Robeson, Paul Robeson in the room for the first time.
Speaker 2: Well, he was in the building. (Laughter) That was enough to make me nervous.  I remember they--the house that I was rooming in when Paul Robeson was there in town, was owned by a woman who was very much into union and unionizing and they worked closely with Paul Robeson.  Paul Robeson was coming to Los Angeles [California] to work with ministers to work on the area of voters' rights and civil rights and whatever, and this was before they took his passport away from him. But there were ministers who were afraid of the red scare and being called a communist and all that kind of thing, and so he was there on, on a political mission to bring people together. And I remember in, in her house, sitting at his feet, you know just looking up at him. And of course being brought up in the South we were to be seen and not heard, you know about that part, and I was also very shy to the point of being backward and there was no way that I communicated or talked or said anything outside of "How do you do, Mr. Robeson?" you know or "How do you do Reverend [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]?"  I met a lot of people who were in leadership roles but I didn't know them.  There was no talking, exchanging, I was the kid that was sitting at their feet, staring in their mouths as they talked, (laughter).
Story_ID: 283759
Speaker 1: I read that your first guitar you named, was it chumpy-chump or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no that's the technique that I play is chumpy-chump.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: The first one is Baby.
Speaker 1: So what is that technique, can you explain it the--?
Speaker 2: Chumpy-chump is really like a rhythm guitar.  I never did, it was a good rhythm guitar but it, I never did play the guitar.  I mean I've seen and witnessed people who really play the guitar, okay?  And as I broke my hip and there were musical organizations that arranged in the hospital to have me in a private room I could have the guitar, get the guitar and see if I can, you know start replaying the guitar, and they brought the guitar over to the hospital and I started playing it and it was hurting my fingers and it was being as messy as it was when I was playing, I said "I'm gonna work hard to get this guitar to sound as bad as it was before," no thank you (laughter).  I do kind of miss the guitar because with a guitar, you know Richie Havens?  Well, I got really very angry with Albert Grossman and his company who when they recorded Richie Havens didn't get the sense that, that man's pulse that was represented by that guitar was over half of what he was doing, and Albert Grossman's partner was into jazz and so he just had, you know just sort of put a decal Richie on top of some jazz and just miss the whole point, right?  Well when you play an instrument you can set up what you're whole, what your pulse is.  Other musicians can catch that and then carry it on, and but I was never really so very good on the guitar and I'd like to find something else that, that I would be able to maybe play and give a clue as to a sense of a song and where I want it to go.
Story_ID: 283760
Speaker 1: I also read that Paul--you--Paul Robeson politicized you, that--?
Speaker 2: It was through what I got from what I read of him, and his focus and his going around the world and his being, his need to be helpful to the human race that told me that it was not only possible, it was necessary to be responsible to your brothers and sisters on the face of this earth, you just can't give it over to the robbers.
Speaker 1: So and then that takes me to an area that's, that I would, like the Civil Rights Movement like in the '60s [1960s].  By this time you were a professional folk singer and you were, I would assume performing a lot around for different events, voters rights, voters regis--you know, at events, political events, and the one that I want to talk about now is the March on Washington, was, I've read that you said it was a great day in your life?
Speaker 2: Well it was, and one of the reasons was, what do I call it, an illusion or the idea that we as blacks wouldn't stand together and that was disproving that saying.  I would imagine that nine-tenths of us following Reverend Martin [Luther King, Jr.]--supporting Dr. King did not believe in turning the other cheek, thank you very much, but we would try.  We would support him and try that, and as we did that more and more of the news found their way to our objections, our objections had been going on a long time before Rosa Parks was involved in areas of, of getting things righted, you know long time before the press started--even chasing, they didn't take us seriously nor do they take us seriously now, okay.  So the witnessing of and the sensing and knowing that there were people who by one way or the other were bound and determined to make the buses that got to Washington, D.C. in order to make their energies known, and add their energies to this man who was pulling us together.  It was stunning, as far as you could see there were people, focusing towards the positive.  I don't know the individual stories because I got there and was then on the other steps or wherever the speakers and performers were.  So I wasn't out in the crowd at all.  As a matter-of-fact, crowds frighten me, I don't go into crowds, you know.  I sit and wait 'til the crowd gets there and then I sing to 'em (laughter). Okay.
Story_ID: 283761
Speaker 1: You mention, then even before the March on Washington that Rosa Parks had, in, in Montgomery, Alabama with the bus boycotts, do you remember Emmett Till, the Emmett Till case in Mississippi (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember the reading of that in the newspapers, and I remember the story around that but, do I remember?
Speaker 1: I mean in, in the sense that did those big events bring up certain songs for you, were there songs with messages that were--.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --were tied to those, to any, to any political event that--?
Speaker 2: Well the songs I was singing was dealing with that kind of, that kind of area, always have been political.  The area of being wronged, being imprisoned, being lynched, that's, that's where I lived, that's the music I was singing about, singing, yeah.  I think that's the way I'd say it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let me just keep moving forward in time, so--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We are 19--, were you just like 19--during the--were you in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] during the time of, in the late '60s [1960] when the Watts riots?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You were, you were do you remember where you were in the country when that was going on in L.A.?
Speaker 2: I think I would have been in New York [New York] at that time. What year do you know about that you moved to New York?
Speaker 1: I don't remember years, don't ask me year, I just.
Speaker 2: Just times, right, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know this is 2006, and I know I was born 1930.  In between is a mystery (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 283762
Speaker 1: So you decided at some point to come to New York [New York], what led you to that decision?
Speaker 2: Well basically, we finally got an apartment in New York to beat the hotel racket.  Now, much of what we were doing with college and university campuses, it's an awful lot out here in the East Coast, as well as the recording for Vanguard Records which is here in New York.  At one point, my ex-husband and I lived in Chicago [Illinois], awful lot of schools around the Midwest there also.  Got an apartment to beat the hotel racket here, then I got a divorce, then I found a place that I was gonna live in here in New York.  We had a house in Los Angeles [California] at one point. So--and the East Coast, a lot of schools and things, right. So it's been for, for the campuses and areas where I could get in and out of at any time of the day or night preferably, so I could get to wherever I needed to go.  So I finally found New York, and that's definitely for me.
Speaker 1: New York felt like home when you arrived?
Speaker 2: It's, it offers you, I could be a hermit here or in my house for goodness knows how long and then all of a sudden I'll need to hear somebody's live music.  Get myself dressed, maybe I'm getting into a cab at eleven o'clock, go down to the Village, hear a singer or songwriter sing and come happy as a lark. Or just off by myself.  People tend to mind their own business here.  When they do mind your business, they kinda make it up anyway so that's--(laughter). And the energy is what I need. I could generally sit and contemplate my (unclear) forever, but in the Christian-Judeo religions that's an absolute no, no.  You just don't do that, right.  So, in New York I get a little something done.
Story_ID: 283763
Speaker 1: So today before we end, I wanna kind of go back a little, cover a few things from your early childhood that I didn't cover.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And one of the things that you mentioned was religion.  Now did you grow up in a religious household?  Did you attend church on Sundays?  Was your family religious?
Speaker 2: The family was religious, but not over, they weren't preachy, nor was my mother [Flora Saunders] preachy. And we were expected to go to Sunday school and to church and we were expected to behave in church or we got a pinch. [Laughter].  I remember in Los Angeles [California] of seeing the old sisters and hearing them talk about each other or to each other being mean to each other about somebody, and but it wasn't what was I was being taught in Sunday school, you know it was the opposite of what Christian--I was forming as a Christian life or a person or whatever and so I stopped believing those old ladies until the music started.  When they were singing the music, I believed them.  I believed they believed themselves, but as soon as that tune stopped honey, they jumped right back into Mrs. Mean, you know, Mrs. Evil, Mrs. Conspiring to do something to somebody, yeah.
Speaker 1: So religion, do you--on Easter Sundays was, were you in a family where you had to have an Easter speech and on Easter Sundays you'd recite a speech in church?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know, are you putting your--.
Speaker 1: No, I'm just--
Speaker 2: --experiences on me?
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm asking if that was something you did in your experience because it was just--.
Speaker 2: No, no. Easter Sunday had to do with your new shoes, and your dress and your bonnet, that's what that had to do with.  One day I was getting back into New York [New York] and it was Easter Sunday and as we were driving from LaGuardia [Airport] into where I live, it was raining and I felt so sorry for those little girls in their shoes and their little hats and the spring hats and stuff, you know. It--and Easter eggs, the Easter egg hunt.  So you had to write things?
Speaker 1: No, we had, we had to, we had to learn a poem and then you recited that poem in front of the church on Easter Sunday.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.
Speaker 1: What about Christmases in your household when you were a child?
Speaker 2: Well we had a tree and we had presents.  We had things and, and stuff so we, my sister and I didn't feel as if we were neglected or left out of anything.  We may not have gotten exactly what we wanted, but, but we never wanted for anything really.
Story_ID: 283764
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: You got me there I'll have to think about that one.  Maybe the next tape we, I'll come up with something.  Sights, sounds and smells?  Sound was a streetcar in the front of--on Virgil Avenue in the front of the first house that we lived in, in Los Angeles.  Sights was a kumquat tree walking up to the Vista Theater and some of it hung over the fence and we would love to steal those kumquats, and smells, chitterlings and maws, popcorn in the theater, my mother's [Flora Saunders] rolls, icebox rolls.  Oh, did she knew, know how to get that together.  She was a good cook, yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for this session (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, thank you, Shawn [Wilson].
Story_ID: 283765
Speaker 1: Continuing on tape four with Mrs. Gordon [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon] and today's date is December 3rd [December 3, 2006].
Speaker 2: Fourth [December 4, 2006].
Speaker 1: Fourth, December 4th, and so the last time we spoke we left off speaking about sights, sounds and smells of your growing up and you'd mentioned some things, so we will move on from there to speak about your early professional career achievements and what I have listed, and we can, you can tell me if I'm correct or where we need to around that, is in 1947 you began touring in a musical.
Speaker 2: I don't know the year, but that doesn't sound--I wasn't touring in a musical.  Let me clear that one up.  I lived in Los Angeles [California] and there was a call for tryouts for the chorus of a musical called 'Finian's Rainbow' and I tried out for the chorus and I got into the chorus.  That was put on at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, a wonderful outdoor theater. The next year they produced it again, the Greek Theatre and they changed places with a musical called, at the opera house [War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco, California] called, oh, the name, Harry the Horse was one of the characters--'Guys and Dolls.'  So we switched theaters, and I went up to San Francisco [California] in the chorus of 'Finian's Rainbow' and that's where I heard hours and hours of things they called folk songs, and so I was not on tour.  It sounds like I was--
Speaker 1: Traveling around.
Speaker 2: --you know one of those wonderful gypsies on the road; you know, going all over the country, no. It was just that one trip.
Story_ID: 283766
Speaker 1: But you said that, that you heard hours and hours of folk music.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was that your introduction to folk music?
Speaker 2: Well, now in school they had music, (laughter) in those lovely days, they had music in school. And they had books, music books, and in the books you would see that Cornwall [ph.] wrote this song or Stephen Foster wrote that song and that song, and that song, and every once in a while you'd see something that said folk songs or public domain.  Those were the songs that had been collected by the musicologists throughout the United States for people who just made up their own songs and entertained themselves.  So now in San Francisco [California] when the bars were closed at two [o'clock] in the morning, we would go up then to Jo [Mapes] and Paul Mapes' apartment, and they were the ones that played the guitar and sang the songs, and they're friends, and so that's how--. And I had gone to school, I think maybe and before I mentioned, I'd gone to junior high school with Jo Mapes, and so she's very important, you know, roads in, in my life. And so I heard these songs. I was studying voice at the time and I heard songs that had more to do dealing with my life and the life we were living in this county right now, right then, right, and an awful lot of them were moaning type. You know you were getting rid of your anxieties, you were wishing for something.  You were asking that you may just carry on and through in spite of what was going on, and it made more sense to me. I mean the classical music is still a favorite of mine, but for me to do, I really liked being connected with where we as people have come from, and with the folk music and the narratives and the stories of peoples' lives, we have the history of us as people within the United States.  We weren't taught that in school, you see and so when I say I'm gonna go someplace, I'm gonna make up something, there is so much to call upon to give a demonstration of the strength and the beauty and the cleverness of people we come from and how they got over, around, through or in spite of.
Speaker 1: So that being your introduction to folk music, did you begin writing your own music at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, no as a matter-of-fact I still, I'm shy of writing. And words are very important to me. Either words or the dramatic tension of words that are repeated like in work songs, very important to me, and if--. I'm afraid of writing because someone may see something in my writing and find out something about me that I don't know about. (Laughter) And they ain't gon' have that power, (unclear). (Laughter) But basically even if I were to write, I don't have the genius that some other writers do have, and but I favor myself as an interpreter, as a music or a song interpreter.
Story_ID: 283767
Speaker 1: During those early days in San Francisco [California], can you create for me also the environment in which you lived?  The streets you lived on, the places where you met with other musicians?
Speaker 2: No--. Well, Vesuvio's [Vesuvio Cafe, San Francisco, California] was a famous place in North Beach in San Francisco. And it had--I think I was coming up at the end of the bohemian area after that they got, what did they get beatniks, right.  It's the same kind of questioning community, okay.  And we had people sitting at bars talking about what they're gonna do and what they're gonna write and we had some writing and at Vesuvio's they had sawdust on the floor.  Well that was so romantic (laughter), not now but then it was.  The bars closed down at two [o'clock]. And I was about nineteen when I was first there and, not drinking or anything and we'd go up to the Mapes' [Jo Mapes and Paul Mapes] apartment.  That's where I tasted some wine and that's--I was felt very sophisticated, I was nineteen and away from home and I would get so homesick I tell you (laughter) and people would sit around tuning their guitars together, singing songs, exchanging songs, harmonizing with each other and there was a feeling of as I look back on it, of community and communion.  No one, we didn't have to stand up for a particular right or anything, we just sharing human, kind type stuff.  So, now this apartment of the Mapes' it was at the, on the top of the building, it was a big house.  So it was a garret apartment with the ceilings and the beams sliding down and oh, very romantic, very chic, very bohemian.  Oh, you couldn't tell me I wasn't grown and out in the world (laughter).
Story_ID: 283768
Speaker 1: When I went back to Los Angeles [California], it is marvelous how as you get interested in some field, how guides come to you.  I started meeting people who were into folk music, met one lady she had a guitar, she was gonna study the guitar but then she got married and then she had children and she never did so she loaned me her guitar and taught me C and G and easy F [chords] and then with the cable, you know I could go into three, three keys at least. And but, so back to Los Angeles I was working as a live-in housekeeper, went back to the job, did that job and got an offer to come back up to San Francisco [California] and work at the--not the Purple Onion [San Francisco, California], but the other, maybe that name will come through to me--hungry i [San Francisco, California] and that, that was much too tempting, I, of course I had to get myself packed and go back up.  Well, I was not in the union, musician's union.  So I had to belong to the union and I didn't have any money to pay my way into the union, right (laughter) and that's called, that's not the Peter principle that's some kind of principle whatever that is.  Anyway so I sang as much as I could around places and got enough money to join the union. And so I was staying--Jo-Joanne Mapes and Paul [Mapes] had separated at the time. So I was staying with Joanne Mapes and a project and her daughter, my godchild, Hillary [Mapes] and working at--. When I came went back to San Francisco the folk singer who was working there said, "Oh, no, no," only when he was off could I play there, so I could play there on Wednesday nights. And then I looked around and I found a place the Cable Car Village [San Francisco, California] where I--it's mostly a jazz place and I would do my program and Joanne Mapes brought by the owner [Peggy Tolk-Watkins] of the Tin Angel [San Francisco, California] which is nightclub on the Embarcadero in San Francisco, and with thinking that maybe I could get a job at the Tin Angel, that was Joe's thinking.  So I met Peggy and we talked and she, "Well now I'll listen to you, and if I think you'll fit in at the Tin Angel, I'll buy you a drink when you finish."  So I finished the program and I went back over to the table and she said, "Why don't you come by the Tin Angel and get your drink."  So I was hired.
Story_ID: 283769
Speaker 1: I was there for about a week when Bob Hogan [Robert Hogan] came to the Tin Angel [San Francisco, California] and reviewed the Tin Angel, which was really a charming place on the Embarcadero and the trains would go, it was in the warehouse district and trains would go back and forth in front of it and there and the waterways were just across the street there, and there was a Greek painter by the name of [Jean] Varda.  Well he had his collages around at the Tin Angel and I would sing and then I'd go to the dressing room and the dressing room was the broom closet where they had those real deep sinks you could rinse the mops out in. (Laughter) Well Robert Hogan was a journalist and there was a very famous critic by the name of Frankenstein [Alfred Frankenstein], and he was off on vacation so Robert Hogan took his space which was about four columns.  He wrote about the Tin Angel and Varda's paintings and myself.  It was in the days when people were curious.  The day after that article came out I went to work at--in those days I was always late.  I was a run scared little puppy and many times I wouldn't even start dressing until it was time for me to be there.  You may have heard of such things.  Anyway I got to the Tin Angel and I looked into the window and there were people standing, sitting at tables and all standing around, and it frightened me.  I turned back to the car to get back into the car, but then I went back in to my dressing room with the deep sink and got myself on the stage and did the program. And in those days my main thrust were prison work songs.  Those songs took care of and attended to my frustration, my bitterness, my anger, my fury.  We couldn't come out and say, we still can't, "I don't like this, that and you and me and whatever," you know. You can't do that but because I was dealing with them, those emotions, it seemed that those were the things that cured me, that healed me.  I can't do any of those songs anymore because I remember when the hate came through and people at the end of the song would jump up screaming, and clapping and yelling and whatever, and an awful lot of that was to shut that negative that I, that I put out there was to shut that off right, well I don't know if I mentioned it before 'John Henry' was the first song that got up and walked outta of my door.  I hadn't done it for a long time, and someone requested it years gone by and so I was gonna do it and I played and it was so unhappy.  I tried to act it, but I remembered what it sounded like when the fury was there and I felt as if I was cheating people, you know.  So it was the prison songs that really did a good job of healing on me.  Now, I will say that God loves you and I'm trying.  So I'm not saying (laughter) that I'm in love with the whole world (laughter).

Speaker 1: How much time did you end up spending in San Francisco [California] before you decided to move to the--what brought you east?
Speaker 2: Okay, with the article that I mentioned that [Robert] Hogan wrote, there was a man from New York [New York] who owned, was one of the partners in the Blue Angel in New York. [Herbert] Jacoby was his name and I knew nothing about cabarets or, right, and Jacoby was on vacation in San Francisco.  A friend of his read Hogan's article, brought him to the Tin Angel [San Francisco, California], and when I finished singing that night that he came, he knocked at my dressing room door with the big sink.  Well, in those days when I finished singing I was no good for anything or anybody.  I was completely zonked and I didn't wish to see anybody, okay.  He knocked at the door and I opened the door and he said that he was Herbert Jacoby from New York, the Blue Angel and he'd like to bring me there one day.  All I could think of was to get rid of him.  Well, my mother [Flora Saunders Felious] brought me up to courteous, so I was courteous to the man, but I think he got a sense of, I didn't know that people would fight and kill to get into his (laughter) Blue Angel.  So he left.  About three days later Peggy-Tolk Watkins, the owner of the, of the Tin Angel and I and some of their friends were gone to Tiburon [California], we were on a boat going someplace there in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California], and Peggy got a call from Herbert Jacoby and looking for me to bring me to New York to the Blue Angel because Rose Murphy; now Rose Murphy was a popular singer and she, some people would know her as the Chi Chi Girl.  (Singing) "I can't give you anything but, Chi Chi, Baby," but she was held over in Europe, so he was gonna have me replace, you know stand in for that.  So he brought me to New York.  Peggy, all of a sudden, from owner of the Tin Angel became manager. (Laughter) And got herself back to New York which she didn't mind terribly anyway.  Opened at the--and it was a really sleek supper club. And the way that club worked, the kinds of, of artists they had there, people may not know their name, but they always knew the caliber was superb. And so I got there, opened, and Mr. Jacoby brought my--. Oh, my dressing room at the Blue Angel was upstairs, you opened the door, there's a table with lights over the table where you can put your makeup, not one deep dish in there (laughter).
Story_ID: 283771
Speaker 1: I got a knock at the door one evening, opened the door and as I opened the door I was looking up to find Mr.-- looking for Mr. [Herbert] Jacoby, but my eyes kept going up and it was [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte.  He brought Harry Belafonte by to hear me.  Ten years later when Mr. Belafonte had his show on CBS he invited me on.  He's always been one to bring performers that he has admired into his spotlight.  He's always been open and generous like that, anyway and he's a brilliant thinker, that Mr. Belafonte guy.  Anyway, how long--I was here, it was in August that I got here and the heat was unbearable and I got mad at New York [New York], but then a lot of folk music people started coming you know, and Pete Seeger came to the Blue Angel [New York, New York] one evening and the next day one of the unions was gonna have a strike and of course we weren't gonna cross the union picket line. So he took me upstate, to Beacon, New York to his home and I spent the night with he and Toshi Seeger. And the next day he got up he was building the children's fireplace and the, and I saw a hammer, a big hammer that you crack rocks with and some rocks and I asked him if I could you know, sing a work song, and not if I could sing it but if I could break up a rock.  So I took a hammer and I went to a rock, I was gon' break it up and sing this work song.  (Singing) "You can take this a hammer" and went wow (gesture). "Take it to the captain" ['Take This Hammer']--three of those wows honey, I got exhausted. (Laughter)  So by me you couldn't prove that those prisoners did that.
Story_ID: 283772
Speaker 1: After he brought you into the television did you do your first recording before that?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's before that.
Speaker 1: Before that, so how, can you--?
Speaker 2: When I first went to the Tin Angel [San Francisco, California], Fantasy Records [Berkeley, California] did a long play of my songs.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me how that came about?
Speaker 2: Well Peggy [Tolk-Watkins] called--I almost had the man, I think his name started with a G, over at Fantasy Records, and they were really mostly interested in jazz.  I think he had Dave Brubeck on his label. And anyway he came over to listen and they recorded me.  So that was my first record.
Speaker 1: And then after meeting Mr. Belafonte [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte]--.
Speaker 2: Now, Belafonte had me on his television show. That was ten years later, after.
Speaker 1: And I read something about Fantasy Records.
Speaker 2: That was, Fantasy was my very first.
Speaker 1: So that was the first, so that was prior to--?
Speaker 2: Mr. Bela--.
Speaker 1: Mr. Belafonte, okay.  And that, was that album released, was it called '[Odetta Sings] Folk Songs' is the title of that album?  I'm just trying to get the facts straight.  The, the--.
Speaker 2: It may have been. I'm terrible in that department.
Speaker 1: But it became one of the year's best selling folk albums (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 283773
Speaker 1: Which brings us to, sort of the era of the '60s [1960s] and people coming forth and then asking you to participate in larger venues, and one of the ones I would like to have you talk about is the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay, I have to go back a bit.  As I was singing with my prison songs getting, healing myself and I was singing also children's songs and love songs and ballads and things, you know, there were--I talked a lot about where the songs came from or what they represented.  Now the Civil Rights Movement was on the--on the burner, all over this country.  It was getting more and more together, right.  There were people in different places working on their problems, then after a while there were people helping other people and joining you know, to call attention to the complaints.  So as I was, was addressing social problems through my performances, these people who were actually on the firing line would then get in touch with me when they needed to bring attention to what they were doing, the work they were doing, when they needed to make money in order to make up, to mimeograph, that's an old fashioned (laughter), that's right back when they had typewriters, okay. (Laughter)  So they would bring us folk music performers in to bring attention to, to earn monies and so, my stuff was growing as the civil rights was growing, that audience was growing.  So they would call upon us who were socially aware and minded and so that's how I got to--because people had heard of me even though they hadn't heard me yet throughout the country because of their work with the, with the civil rights.
Story_ID: 283774
Speaker 1: You have a very good recollection of all of this.  You have a great recollection of your story, the order and the facts, you know 'cause there's so much out there you read, it's good to get it first hand and to see what's true and what's not true.
Speaker 2: I guess sometimes you find it hard to make me stop talking?
Speaker 1: No, it's good.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you mention some of the other folk singers that you were, that you were working just in the, in the, around at the time, just--?
Speaker 2: Well, Larry Mohr, M-O-H-R [Lawrence B. Mohr]; now, I think he came from the Midwest, he played the banjo. Within San Francisco [California] folk music family, there he was all of a sudden.  He was very good. And he played for Peggy Tolk-Watkins who owned the Tin Angel [San Francisco, California], and she hired him. And we would do some duets together also.  As a matter-of-fact, there was a film called 'Cinerama Holiday' and the screen I think was excessively wide, and people would have to wear glasses to see the whole thing.  Anyway, the 'Cinerama Holiday' people asked if we do a duet together and so Larry and I did a duet and they filmed it.  I never did see it because, well first off I was a very big woman and I couldn't see myself spread from one wall to a next in the film (laughter), so my ego wouldn't let me see it. (Laughter)  Anyway, and Larry and I would do duets and but just as things that we liked to do, we weren't partners or anything.  And, okay Larry Mohr was one, he is, has now since gone to teach some obscure subject at a, at a university.  I think once ten more banjo players came up within the family, Larry said there was too many (laughter).  He got crowded out (laughter) he's just esoteric, that's just him okay.  Anyway there was a magnificent, is, Frank Hamilton, he played the guitar, he's still going, doing beautifully.  Jo Mapes isn't doing much these years, but Jo Mapes had a special quality that one could not learn.  It just was so appealing to an audience, as well as Bob Gibson. He had that gift, that you know it just eked out of them and people just drank it up, you know, but I--. Let's see now of course there was Pete Seeger, but now he's like the daddy, the granddaddy, you know, he's the one that is past, been the pied piper and encouraged people and helped them to learn the banjo even when they didn't have books to teach you the banjo yet. And of course, there was Lead Belly, Lead Belly.  I never did see him live.  He was here in New York [New York] and when I was growing up in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and the--Pete Seeger and the Weavers and around then was (singing) "Jimmie crack corn and I don't care,"--his name, that might come to--Burl Ives. And there was oh, a wonderful man who played the sitar.  I mean there're just wondrous people around and Jean Ritchie and in the '60s [1960s] we were hearing about [HistoryMaker] Bernice [Johnson] Reagon and the Freedom Singers, and she is the one that also caused Sweet Honey in the Rock, you know to happen, yes.  I hate, I hate that I've maybe have missed somebody, but I know I've missed people, but (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's an extensive list of people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 283775
Speaker 1: Going back a little, if there's anything that stands out for you, the 1963 March on Washington about that day. Was there anything that stands out as being really remarkable or special about that particular day itself?
Speaker 2: The wondrous feeling or witnessing--you know within each of our, let's call us neighborhoods or tribes, we have a certain amount of hate for ourselves that displays itself in many different kinds of ways, and sometimes we can get to be heavier on casting aspersions than anybody else can, you know, outside of the community, and always there was the field niggers and the white nigger, and the house niggers, and never would they pool or work together whatever, you know. So there was generally that feeling that there was separation and to witness all those people, to think about how they got there, the sacrifices they went through to get there, most all of them not believing in turning the other cheek, but would try because they had a faith in this man, called Dr. Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], they'd try it.  They, and they bound it together and that, so that broke that, that bubble that we had set up. For me it did, saying that we would never get together you know, so I see that it is possible.  I guess that was the most powerful memory I have from that march; that was quite a lesson to be, to learn.
Story_ID: 283776
Speaker 1: So, on a lighter note before we move away from this period, were you dating anyone?
Speaker 2: No, I did get married to Danny Gordon, in 1959.  We were married for about seven years. And an American black man and an American black woman and she's traveling all over the place, and not home that much.  It wasn't a time also when people were talking to each other about what their relationships were.  We were still in what I call the Hollywood mold where if you love me you'll know what I need (laughter) cause it happens that way in the movies, okay.  Well, the cruelty of people is quite something because after a while he's hearing this Mr. Odetta stuff.  Well now that was not going to sit very well with an American black man for sure. And then our separation for so, so--there were times when I was on the road three months at a time, you know, and this was at a, around the time when the bass player, Bill Lee, whom I met in Chicago [Illinois] and we worked with for years said that he couldn't go on the road anymore cause his kids were growing up and he wasn't there you know. So he had to stay home and he produced a Spike Lee so (laughter), amongst his other achievements. (Laughter)  So it got, it got harder and harder and finally, then got a divorce.  He was a magnificent person and I always wished that he would take to writing because he wrote so beautifully. But that's the way--so I wasn't. After Danny, I wasn't really much on dating and--a few times, but--
Story_ID: 283777
Speaker 1: What were you reading at the time?
Speaker 2: I wasn't reading anything.  At one point I was reading, I would wake up with a book on my chest, I'd gone to sleep with a book. And then I got busy on the road and so that was going to sleep as soon as you get home from the concert.  So you get up the next morning and catch the plane that goes up (unclear).  So that kind of distraction was there. And then my dyslexia got stronger and stronger, somehow rather and it just doesn't--I hear better than I read.  So I need to get to audio books, and I was fascinated with the reading thing because it takes your mind to places, it gives you places to go that you never would have thought of before, you know, yeah so.  I'm way behind in the reading area.
Story_ID: 283778
Speaker 1: So moving forward to your presidential performance when you were asked to sing on the nationally televised civil rights, 'Dinner with the President'?
Speaker 2: Oh, Josh White [Sr.] was alive at that time by the way.  I didn't call his name with that list. And Josh White was one who had a little bit of an end with [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, and so he knew presidents, honey.  Well we got into this dinner, you know room where they're gonna have the dinner and the director was directing where he wants this, that and the other thing. And then the Secret Service comes in and said oh no, rearranged the whole thing and they couldn't do that when it was feasible for the director--and work with the director, no.   Give a little power, right?  Well, they arranged, rearranged the whole thing and when the president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] walked in, up jumps Josh White over the table, over to the president to shake his hand cause he's a man with presidents, and you should have seen (laughter) those guards, they didn't know what to do with themselves. (Laughter)  It was, I, I think people are impressed with that.  I don't knows I am.  I don't know what to say about that, I am honored to have been asked and all on that, you know, but it was another performance.
Speaker 1: Another performance, and I'm getting the feeling that the performance with for the March on Wash--at that march [March on Washington] had much more significance, or felt different for you?
Speaker 2: It was, oh yes, because cause it was the folks, it was the people, it was having to do with all of us, whatever stripe as people. And the other was a privileged kind of command performance, and it was okay.
Story_ID: 283779
Speaker 1: Do you remember your participating in the march in Selma [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No, I never did participate in a march by the way, I have to let people know that, cause I feel like I'm cheating.  I would be taken to the stage and waiting for everybody to get there (laughter), and then I'd put in what I had to offer.  I'm afraid of being in and amongst a crowd of people.  You never know what can be stirred up in that, so I do feel much more comfortable being apart from the crowd.
Story_ID: 283780
Speaker 1: During the time that you were performing for you know the March on Washington and then the command performance for the president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], what was happening with companies like Vanguard [Records, New York, New York], or had you started to make records for Vanguard yet?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was a long time ago.
Speaker 1: And you started during that (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Vanguard, as a matter-of-fact, I had left Vanguard by the time the dinner for the president ['Dinner with the President'] came along, I think.
Speaker 1: When were you making music for Vanguard?
Speaker 2: I don't remember years, by the way so, we would have to look those up.
Speaker 1: Okay, but those were pleasant years; that was, working for Vanguard?
Speaker 2: Yes, enjoyed very much working with the Solomon brothers [Maynard Solomon and Seymour Solomon], enjoyed that very much.  They were not in the area of designing the performer.  They wanted, they wanted good material on their record, but they weren't you know putting a gold (unclear) on a dress on somebody in order to sell more records, that kind of thing that happens within the record industry. And I know when we were looking around for record companies that would be the first thing that I would hitch up and run as soon as someone said they didn't know what to do with me.  Well how do you--does one not know what to do with a creative artist?  I mean you look at what they've created and you do like or you don't like it or you tweak it or whatever, but you don't start from scratch making this person, and I was not a gold (unclear) type nor was I a jean and cowboy hat type (laughter) and so I knew that they would fumble around and that would lead to my betraying the music and that can't happen, that, I mean that's my savior, that cannot happen.
Story_ID: 283781
Speaker 1: So where did you, who was helping you or where did you get--craft your looks from? How did you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --the way you wanted to present yourself?
Speaker 2: From, evidently from what had happened before. I was still working, I just wasn't recording until MC Records, Mark Carpentieri, came, has his record company and he, I'm working with his company now, and he's an independent record company and he isn't looking to, to dress somebody in some kind of fashion that they are not in.  He's wonderful.
Speaker 1: So you've been lucky that way for most of your career--
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: --in a sense that you've been able to craft the look, your own look?
Speaker 2: It falls whichever way it falls (laughter).
Speaker 1: So in the early days who would you say that inspiration came from, when you saw, when you're thinking of yourself as a singer and how, what you wanted to wear and how you wanted to wear your hair?  What do you think (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was up to 250 pounds. So that did a great deal towards what to--was gonna be worn.  Also there wasn't any wardrobe money, end of quote (laughter) there, there.  So I would go to Lane Bryants, the big ladies store and I would shop around for things.  They of course couldn't fit me, they had to be tent-type large dresses and I would dress out of the lingerie area, the big dress area and I--my taste in clothes is pretty good and in accessorizing stuff, and I don't particularly like, what--oh, I don't know what we call those theme, I don't want to dress in a theme fashion or a theme way, and it was good that I wasn't little when I was younger, cause if I had been little I would have been the best dressed thing in the poorhouse (laughter).
Story_ID: 283782
Speaker 1: What was your, what did your family think about you just at this time when you're starting to travel around and have some success on your own, did you have any contact with the family back in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: What were they saying about you?
Speaker 2: I think my mother [Flora Saunders Felious] was very pleased.  She wouldn't necessarily let me know, but you know it's a thing of protecting those buttons that you have to push (laughter).  I, we would, we would sit, have concerts in the Los Angeles area and my family would come to the concerts, and then there would be a party after the concert, and my mother was there.  So they'd take my mother to the party while I signed autographs or said hello to the audience or whatever, and then we'd go over to where the party was.  Well, all through the night people be going to Mrs. Felious, her name was Flora Felious, "May we get you this?"  "No, darling."  Now, she's from Alabama.  She is a Southern Belle, okay?  There it is.  "Mrs. Felious, would you like--?"  "No, sweetheart, I don't want anything."  Then it gets to the party, "Tell Odetta [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon] to come see me soon as she--."  I would get the message to go see my mother as soon as I got to the party, and then she would send me to get her this drink or that something or other.  So that happened a few times. Then I said to Ma, I said, "I'm gonna ace you outta my parties." (Laughter), "I'm just gonna have to ace you out of--I'm supposed to be the star and you sending me around." (Laughter)  No, the family was pleased.  My niece is not so pleased with me right now.  She misses my playing the guitar, and she just won't get over that.  She loved my playing the guitar, but I was gonna go into blues with MC Records and my guitar was a good-rhythm guitar, it gave you a sense of what my pulse was, you know, but not much interesting after that and I knew I was not gon' be able to play the blues guitar.  I've heard some magnificent guitars and so, and so I know my barriers here.  So I put the guitar down and started working with the piano. And doing so, I can even get deeper into the characters that the songs represent than I could when I was playing the guitar. And which is really fun, cause so much to find out in those interpretative areas.
Speaker 1: So the guitar became somewhat of a barrier you think?
Speaker 2: Because I didn't have the facility nor the gift.  There are people who are just--as a matter-of-fact when I broke my hip and the music foundation got me a private room in the hospital so I could practice up on the guitar once again, and I took the guitar and I was playing it and I saw how, how un-obedient my fingers were as far as getting on each string, and I said, "Well now if I'm gonna practice a lot to be as bad as I was before, I don't need it" (laughter).  So I gave it up.
Story_ID: 283783
Speaker 1: Some of these things may not be as newsworthy as you read that they were, but something else that I read was, was very inspiring for you was performing at the Newport Folk Festival.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was a ball!  Well, the festival was held in Newport [Rhode Island]. It's an island. Walking from the festival place to the Viking Hotel [Hotel Viking, Newport, Rhode Island], people would meet and greet and we'd go into the coffee shop and we'd be able to talk together, right?  And so there were lots of times when we'd heard of each other from one part of the country or another and we got a chance to meet up with each other there and so it was an exciting time, and I don't think you've ever heard of a folk festival where anybody got hurt or killed. Within that area there is community feeling and the area of helping each other.  It truly is there. And even today you know someone will finish a gig, a new singer and (unclear) will talk to the owner of the place and say, have you heard so-and-so, you might like to hear, have them come and play your club too, you know.  And so that was that wonderful thing, I compare it to the folk festival given in a city or a jazz festival.  The jazz festival was held on the island too when people could really mingle together, and the city is a concert here and then a concert there and never the twain shall meet, I mean we just don't meet up, it, it--. I'm glad that it's happening but it doesn't offer the same milieu as on the island.
Story_ID: 283784
Speaker 1: Was performing at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] as exciting as people (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know when I first got to Carnegie Hall, my first concert there, they had been talking about tearing that down and redoing something. And I had heard from New York [New York] concerts that had been given at Carnegie Hall, and I was on the stage before they tore it down. And I breathed a sign of relief.  I was really pleased that I could be on, walk on that floor, that Marian Anderson walked on, that Paul Robeson walked on, you know.  I was really pleased and proud of that one and fortunately they didn't tear it down. (Laughter)  It was too, too much of the people in New York was--I guess just they're just not gonna sit still for that.  They had to leave that baby up (laughter).
Speaker 1: And rightfully so (laughter).
Story_ID: 283785
Speaker 1: And then your acting career starts to blossom?
Speaker 2: Well, maybe it, all I did was act pitiful.  I don't really think myself as an actress (laughter) to tell you the truth.  There's so much they have to go through to learn how to do--
Speaker 1: But you've appeared in so many--
Speaker 2: --their skill.
Speaker 1: --movies.
Speaker 2: A few, and grunted and looked pitiful, but that's not hard (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well what about 'The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman'?
Speaker 2: There was a little one who played Big Laura was the name of my role who was her son as a little boy, and we had escaped in the film, we had escaped and we were in a barn and the paddy rollers, those guys who were after the runaway slaves, and taking them back and earning their monies off of that kind of thing, came in, found us and they were beating up on us, and they gave me something that looked like a stick from a tree.  Inside was a rod, on the outside was foam rubber painted to look like it was a limb, hitting is my least favorite suite.  To see someone hit or to hit, it is, does not sit well with me.  Well they, the cameras went on and I'm, Big Laura is supposed to be fighting at these paddy rollers. Well this little guy, he's seven years old. The director says cut, and this little kid looked at me.  He says, "You call that fighting? I can fight better than that," (laughter).
Story_ID: 284108
Speaker 1: So after this little kid says, "You call that fighting," the stunt man came over and reassured me that they knew how to fall away from the hits so that they wouldn't be hurt.  I still didn't throw myself into it but evidently I did it, I fooled enough people including the director for them to go onto the next scene [in 'The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman']. (Laughter), "You call that fighting?"
Speaker 2: Do you like acting?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm a ham from way back, and I wouldn't mind learning techniques of what an actor goes through and how they have to separate things and keep, especially in movie making, where they start in the middle and work both ways and you, you know there's never a thread from beginning to end. But I love it.  I, I love imagination going other places, yeah.
Story_ID: 284109
Speaker 1: What do you think your life on this planet, what do you think the time you've been given is for?
Speaker 2: For me to learn something (laughter) and it may only be three letters and one word, and that is yes to the whole of what the universe is, what we are, what the spirit is.  It may be just three letters, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you feel that your talent as a singer was God given or is it something that you yourself developed or was it just innate, you were born with it?
Speaker 2: It was God given, born with it, but you see now I'm one who believes in reincarnation. Not transmigration, but I believe we continue coming back as man, as woman, as children, as whatever to continue working on learning what it is we, the lessons that we do have to learn and I believe that we come in with some, a knowledge of other past times.  I mean explain to me a child who cannot put together tying his shoe and can tell you about the constellations and the heavens, all right.  Where does that come from?  That does not come from a gene.  That does not come from the physical; that comes from someplace else, right?  Now, why is it that I'm honed in on music?  Now just because I'm honed in on music doesn't mean that I'll be able to do music or earn my living with music, just happens that I've been fortunate to be at the right place at the right time all right, and how is it that you're up there with all this paper and all this research.  Where did you get that from, you know?  We've come with some knowledge from someplace else and we couldn't do it, same way we can't change the color of a tree leaf, so whether people do or don't believe in, I believe that I'm here to serve something that is much bigger than myself, and to learn something through this stuff called music, and I'll be, keep coming back until I get it right I guess (laughter).
Speaker 1: Are there some things you feel you've learned this time around through music?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm the delightful person that I am because of what I've learned in music. (Laughter)  I don't have a better answer than that, I tell you.

Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, what about the Montreal Jazz Festival you hosted?  Did you host it at some point?
Speaker 1: I hear I hosted it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: But it was just one of many things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what about when you hear about people that you have inspired, like Joan Baez and you know, Janis Joplin, or people who use you as their inspiration?
Speaker 1: Well, it's a mixed bag, I cannot say how thrilled I am that something or whatever I was doing offered some kind of example to another soul to get into their, what they had to give.  There could be no better compliment that than.  It could not be.  As it is used though, it is almost as if I'm pinned on the bottom of the coat of [Bob] Dylan, Baez, Joplin, whatever.  Had it not been for them I wouldn't have existed, and so I really am kinda mixed as to, in giving you a straight answer that is a one-way street.  There, it isn't.  I'm pleased and how it's used I am sometimes a little drugged by it.
Speaker 2: Understandably so.

Speaker 1: What do you think?  Do you put any stock in winning awards like Grammys or you know awards that have been given to you?  Do you take pleasure in those?
Speaker 2: Well I take pleasure in awards that I've received, but when you get to Grammy and those great big awards, that's politicking and I have as much faith in that politicking as I do the politicking for the president of the United States, which isn't too terribly much (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Speaking of presidents though, you were awarded the National Medal of Humanities by President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is he someone that you have some respect for, great respect for, little respect for?
Speaker 2: Well I do respect Clinton, I do, and I, I like that he still is a spokesperson and saying things that are positive in my view.  Yeah, I like Clinton.
Speaker 1: So looking at--.
Speaker 2: Real personable you know, he's a person, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He is personable, yeah and he's fun to be around I'm assuming he gave you a big warm hug and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --accolades that you rightfully deserved.
Story_ID: 284112
Speaker 1: Now, you have--I wanna just talk about the different eras in which, with popular music. For example during the disco era and popular music of the (unclear) the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], well I don't even have to go--oh, the '70s [1970s] is when you made the album of yours that I liked the most was 'Odetta Sings the Blues.'  Well, I'm from Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So I like the blues.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: And that was the, that was in the mid-'60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s] whatever, but can you, as I'm looking at all of these albums, I'm more familiar with the latter ones than the early ones--.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any for you that have more personal meaning than others?
Speaker 2: I, I don't, no, I don't have any favorites.
Speaker 1: No, but I mean maybe there's a time, any that speak to you, like this was going on and I made this album and that put it all to rest for me?
Speaker 2: Put it all to rest for me?
Speaker 1: Meaning, you know somehow you said the music makes, the music soothes you in a way, makes it okay, it gets the demons out.  Were there any of these--?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, there were, there was music that didn't take, didn't fulfill that demon part.  I remember really being very pleased with doing the Bob Dylan record ['Odetta Sings Dylan'].  I liked the way I approached in arranging his songs. And I remember we were sitting around a friend of mine's table when he was recuperating from the accident he had on the motorbike. And my friend Zapoppa [ph.] was the doctor who attended him to his wellness, and I went up to visit my friends and momma, poppa and the kids had gone to bed, and Dylan and I were sitting around the kitchen table and he never did say he didn't like the record, but he wondered how people could do the songs so different than how he conceived them. And so I think I proceeded in telling him that as we listen to his song, we put our own experience in on what these words are talking about and there's no way to keep us out of it, you know.  And so when we sing his song, that's a part of what?  It's the difference between the two, you know. So if there is any record that I would say I was really, remembered that I'm pleased with it, it would be that one.  As a matter-of-fact there are some of those songs, his political songs, I have, I've wanted to redo.  As time has gone on, I see deeper into the song.  I'll give you an example, there is a song that he wrote "It's All Over Now Baby Blue," and I think of the words and some of the words are "All your seasick sailors have packed their gear and they're going home" [sic.].  All through that song it had suddenly occurred to me that "Baby Blue" is Mother England herself, losing her empire.  I mean I, and I don't know if some of that can come through just the doing of it.  Maybe it will need help with the notes to point the way towards it, but there're some of those songs that, that are heavier and seriouser than, than I knew they were before and I want to tinker around with that a bit.

Speaker 1: Just because it's the holiday season, did you, do you enjoy Christmas music?
Speaker 2: I do, as a matter-of-fact when I come to the Christmas, spirituals is what I enjoy.  I hear jubilation and I hear joy and I hear celebration.  Okay, at that time of the year in the agrarian culture in the country, you can't plant and you can't harvest.  So the slaves you could say had something like a two-week vacation or something like they didn't have as much work to do on those days.  It was time of celebration.  When you think of regular Christmas songs outside of the silly ones, it's all very somber.  When you, when I think of the spirituals, it's, it's 'Go Tell It on the Mountain.' It's bringing news.  There was such identification with--now they didn't teach us how to read, but they read the Bible to us and there was such identification with the Jews and what they went through and what we were going through, it was like that was our family and they, they were rejoicing and there's a spiritual, "Wasn't that a pity, wasn't that a shame, wasn't pretty and ashamed, poor little Jesus, born in manger couldn't find no hotel room."  Okay, now that hotel room is probably a later injection, but the Savior is in a stable, where are we in the stable, you know.  And it's, so it's celebrative, and there's one delightful song where the kids were taught months of the year, it was the game song and so--so they couldn't learn to read or write so it was a repetitive song.  I'll sing it for you if you don't mind, (singing), "What month was Jesus born in, last month of the year, what month was Jesus born in, last month in the year.  Oh, Lord you got January, February, March, oh Lord you got April, May and June, Lord you got the July, August September, October and November, you got the twenty-fifth day of December and it's the last month and the year." ['Last Month of the Year'] That delicious.
Speaker 1: Amen (laughter), amen, amen.  That was wonderful.

Speaker 1: --When you look back at this point, what do you still wanna do with the music?
Speaker 2: I don't think I've set up a timetable or a menu.  I think I'm mostly just open to learn or receive what comes along, and it's not just the music.  It's where I go and the experiences I have with the people that I'm doing the music with and for and so it's all of that, that wonderful mixture of herbs and spices in this bowl that is happening, so I don't, I don't know what that recipe is, but I'm, I'm willing to partake of it.
Story_ID: 284115
Speaker 1: (Laughter). Do you have any recollections of past lives?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: You don't.
Speaker 2: No.  One kind of a quick--it was like dark blue, it was a time I do believe I was in a dish and sacrificed--you see I just lied to you.  I do have that, that, a feeling there and sacrifice and it was in South America, somewhere down in Mexico, South America.  I do have that kind of--but I don't know, I don't know.

Speaker 1: So do you have any hopes, and these are sort of questions we end with.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're standard; do you have any hopes for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Yes I do have hopes. I have--I guess the closest thing that's gonna come to it are is a magic wand somewhere.  We, this time from the time I was younger, the canvas is different that we're painting on, and our children are getting the short end of the stick, and we're not connecting with our children. And I would, I would hope that something or a person can be spotlighted that would encourage people to try to, to get together. And I understand the me, me, me, mine, mine, mine thing, and of--because our society so uses us to keep their bottom line higher, they use us against each other, you know. So each neighborhood is, is against the other neighborhood and within the neighborhood we've gotta get ours and you know I, I don't know anywhere short of a magic wand. But maybe there is, maybe I just don't have the imagination.  I would hope that would be the case and that something would bring us closer together.

Speaker 1: Well, when you have moved from this experience and into the next one, what is it about this one that you'd like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Gee, I think I'd have to give that some bit of thought.  As long as it's positive, I'll take it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have any--you talked about working with [Bob] Dylan, which was or the gentlemen that you did the duets with--.
Speaker 2: Larry Mohr [Lawrence B. Mohr].
Speaker 1: Larry Mohr. Is there anyone else that you can think of that you enjoyed working with that you'd like to add to this oral history of yours just to, so that we have--when I'm doing other research I know that these are people you enjoyed working with?
Speaker 2: Actually, I've worked alone for the most part.  Larry was the only time, except for like at festivals, at the end of the festival we'd all get on the stage and sing something together, but he was the only one.
Story_ID: 284118
Speaker 1: We would like to end if at all possible if you could sing something else for us.
Speaker 2: Hold on now, how much time do you have on that tape?
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE: Nine minutes.
Speaker 2: Oh, all my songs are a little less than nine, so that's--. (Laughter) I have to think about something, I have to see what it would be.  I'd love to, thank you for asking.  No, no.  Maybe I'll--I think I thought of one. Okay, let me know when you're ready, okay.  I think I'd like to do this one for ya.  It's so universal; it fits at any time, I think.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Glory, glory hallelujah, when I live here my burden (unclear), glory, glory hallelujah, when I lay my burden down, I'm gon meet my dear ole mamma, when I lay my burden down, I'm gon' meet my dear old mama, when I lay my burden down, I'm gon' meet my precious mother when I lay my burden down. I'm gon' meet my dear ole' maker, when I lay my burden down, I'm gon' meet my precious maker when I lay my burden down.  Glory, glory, glory hallelujah, when I lay my burden down, glory, glory, hallelujah, when I lay my burden down," ['Lay My Burden Down'].
