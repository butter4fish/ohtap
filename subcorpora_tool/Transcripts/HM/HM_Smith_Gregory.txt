Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're gonna start by talking about your history, your family's history, the family tree.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we're gonna take it one step back at a time and we'll, so we'll start with your parents, your mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] and father.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know you get a little older, you get a little senile.
Speaker 1: Well, you're not that old.
Speaker 2: "To much is given, much is required," is probably the phrase I probably use more than anything.  It's, it's a, it's a piece of scripture--scripture out of Luke [Luke 12:48].
Speaker 1: And it says what is that, "To much is"--
Speaker 2: "To much is given, much is required."  It's out of Luke.
Story_ID: 475614
Speaker 1: Okay, where do you wanna start?
Speaker 2: We're gonna start with your mother, your mother's full name, date of birth, and place of birth?
Speaker 1: Oh my goodness, okay.  Her maiden name was Bennie, Bustill, B-U-S-T-I-L [sic.], Robeson, R-O-B-E-S-O-N [Bennie Robeson Smith].  She was born in Paterson, New Jersey, October the 14th, 1928.
Speaker 2: And what was her first name?
Speaker 1: B-E-N-N-I-E, Bennie.
Speaker 2: Bennie.
Speaker 1: Middle name Bustill and we'll talk more about that later, B-U-S-T-I-L-E [sic.], which comes out of part of the family out of the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area, and we'll talk about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And her maiden name was Robeson.  That was her surname.
Speaker 2: So what do you, and, and this is kind of second-hand information, but I wanna know what stories that your mother tell you about her growing up in Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: No, actually we didn't grow up in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: No, your mother.  Where did she grow up?
Speaker 1: My mother, she didn't, she grew up in Paterson, New Jersey.  She's the--
Speaker 2: Paterson okay.
Speaker 1: She is the youngest of three children, three girls.  She is a PK kid.  PK is preacher's kid.  Her daddy, my grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] was a pastor in Paterson, New Jersey, and she was born in Paterson and she came to New York [New York] two years later after she was born when he came to pastor the church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] that I am a pastor of now.  So, there is two and a half pastors or two and a quarter pastors between my grandfather and myself.  He came in 1934, passed away in '63 [1963] and I knew my parent, I knew my grandfather.  As a matter fact, he raised me, and I've come back as the pastor the same church.  So, she grew up in Paterson.  She grew up here in the city, and she was a preacher's kid.  Preacher's kids do everything that preacher's kids do (laughter) in that sense attended schools here, went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] for a year, then she got married.
Speaker 2: What did she do for a living?
Speaker 1: What she was able to do.  Matter of fact, matter of factly, because for many reasons she lost her job, couldn't have jobs.  They didn't want to give a Robeson a job back in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].  She retired from what is now called Verizon [Verizon Wireless Communications, Inc.], which was called New York Tel [New York Telephone Company] where she worked there for thirty-some odd years--
Speaker 2: And then she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) from an operator all the way up to management.
Speaker 2: Okay, but she, I guess she started that then, then during the time operators were, most women were operator, telephone operators (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she started as an operator where they had the old operator, you know the old boards with the plug and play that kind of thing, you know.  She was my grandfather's secretary for a very short period of time.
Story_ID: 475615
Speaker 1: Well, you said your [maternal] grandfather raised you.  Do you know his, what's your grandfather's full name?
Speaker 2: Benjamin Congleton Robeson.
Speaker 1: Now that middle name, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Congleton, okay.  I better look on the plaque there for corrections.  C-O-N-G-L-E-T-O-N.  There's a plaque behind, there's a portrait behind us on the wall.
Speaker 1: We'll, we'll check the spelling.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: But he raised her in what sense?
Speaker 2: Well, let me just show you this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, my wife, my mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] was the last of three kids.  I could tell you this story my grandmother [Frances Cline Robeson] said, "This is it, no more."  So, he didn't have any boys.  The oldest girl was named Marian [Marian Robeson Liggins], named after my grandfather's sister [Marian Robeson Forsythe].  The second was named Vivian [Vivian Robeson] named after one of my grandmother's sister.  So, since she wasn't gonna have any more children and it was a girl, they said well we'll take Bennie with an IE and then his name was Benjamin.  So, I just wanted to, that's the concept, that part of that story, and I'll tell you something else later about my father's name when we talk about him, but remember Bennie.  And you asked me about my grandfather about him growing up.  Well my grandfather is the son of a slave, son of a preacher, an A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] preacher who comes, who came out of Robeson County [North Carolina].  It's on the southeastern part of North Carolina.  My grandfather traces our family back to Nigeria to the-I'm gonna say the Yoruba tribe, off the top of my head, but if you look at 'Here I Stand' [Paul Robeson with Lloyd L. Brown] talks about that, but my grandfather, great-grandfather [William Drew Robeson] excuse me, escaped from the, came up from the South and my grandfather was born, he was one of four siblings.  There were three boys and one girl.  The girl was next to the youngest, and I'm trying to think, I think my grandfather was born in North Carolina.  I can't swear by that, but anyway my great-grandfather was an A.M.E. Zion pastor, built a lot of churches in, in New Jersey, First A.M.E. Zion Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 475616
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And your great-grandfather's name was?
Speaker 2: Was William Robeson, William Robeson [William Drew Robeson].  And he married a lady [Maria Bustill Robeson], a lady by the name of Bustill, B-U-S-T-I-L-E [sic.].  There's a little thing about the Bustill side of the family comes from Native Americans and Cyrus Bustill was one of the founders of the first Prince Hall Mason, Mason Lodge, Mason, Prince Hall Masonry lodge in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He and Absalom Jones and Richard Allen, and you can see is a charter member.  My great-great-grandfather was also in the army, Revolutionary army [Continental Army].  Ironically Prince Hall, who was a Mason that founded black Masonry in the United States had petitioned [President] George Washington that free Negroes should fight in the Continental Army for the independence.  Matter of fact Prince Hall Masonry was organized two years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Boston, Massachusetts.  So, Prince Hall got free black men to join the army, 'cause you know who the first person who was killed for the fighting of this country, you know who his name was right?
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) His name, his name was Crispus Attucks, thank you very much.  Crispus Attucks was in fact a Prince Hall Mason.  So, then the Continental Congress decided they didn't want these, these Negroes, these coloreds, I was gonna say niggers, in the army fighting after one had given his life at Bunker Hill [Battle of Bunker Hill], as you remember that.  So, my great-grandfather instead of fighting became, what became a traditional role for people of color in the [U.S.] Armed Forces up until the, up until oh gee until Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman] I would say.  A little later they did all the dirty things.  They were the cooks, they cleaned.  They didn't want any in the fighting role except for we'll talk about the 369th [369th Infantry Regiment] I'll tell you about that and the Tuskegee Airmen.  So, he became a baker.  The Bustill family went on to found Mercy-Douglass Hospital in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, that's the Bustill side of the family, so that's my great-grandmother's side of the family.  My grandfather as I mentioned--my great-grandfather had three, three boys and one girl.  One, the oldest brother passed away at an early age.  This next one was my grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson].  The next one was my Aunt Marian [Marian Robeson Forsythe] who married a physician.  She became a Forsythe whose family goes back also to Mercy-Douglass Hospital.  And then the baby of the, of the four Robeson children was Paul [Paul Robeson], who was born in Princeton, New Jersey.  My great-great-grandparents are buried in Princeton, New Jersey in, in the graveyard of the church, one of the churches he pastored.  I should of said he first was a Presbyterian minister, then became A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion].  So, my uncle was born in Princeton, raised in Somerville, New Jersey, and of course you know the rest he went to Rutgers University [The State of University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and so forth and so forth.  My grandfather went to the other way.  He attended Biddle University, which be, is now called Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina].  He was a chaplain in the First World War [World War I, WWI] with the 369th Infantry.  The 369th Infantry was the most decorated infantry in the First World War, and it was an all-black infantry, and it was, it was under the direction of Colonel Charles Young who reported, who reported in to "Black Jack" Pershing [John J. Pershing].  So, when Pershing marched through the--(unclear)--and said, "Lafayette [Marquis de Lafayette], we're here" it was black soldiers who did it.  So, my grandfather was the chaplain for the 369th, and I do remember as a youngster he and some of those that were still living went over to visit the, the, the, the grave sites of those who had passed away.  And if you come in Harlem [New York, New York] right now you see the armory, the 369th Armory [369th Regiment Armory] still in existence and you'll see the information about them on the walls and plaques.  He, of course, as you mentioned, I said he was a minister.  He had various pastorates and then in '34 [1934] he was asked to come here to pastor the mother church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion denomination.

Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandmother was a faithful girl from Asheville, North Carolina, up in the mountains near the, we used to call it Black Mountain, in North Carolina.  It's--
Speaker 2: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Frances Cline [Frances Cline Robeson], C-L-I-N-E was her maiden name, Cline, and they're from Asheville up near Maggie Valley [North Carolina] up in that part of the Smoky Mountains [Great Smoky Mountains], Smoky Mountains right, an area called Black Mountain.  She grew up there.  I'm trying to remember how many brothers and sisters she had, I can't remember.  Well one of those sisters was the first African American teacher in that school system.  My grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] ironically met my grandmother while he was pastoring in North, in California.  She was out there visiting one of her sisters, and the rest is history on that one.  They got married.  My oldest, my mother's oldest sister was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and I think my, the second sister was born down there too, and then of course he pastored here and what you see here is all this he paid off the mortgage, all the stained glass and, and many other things that he did here.
Story_ID: 475618
Speaker 1: Well, let's just talk about the church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] for a little bit the, this building itself.  Was it constructed as an A.M.E. Zion?
Speaker 2: Yes it was in 1923 on $400,000 dollars.  This is, well this last location was organized in 1796 came out of the Methodist Episcopal church which is now called the United Methodist church.  It was, Methodism of course was founded by John Wesley in 1784.  Charles [Wesley], John Wesley was an Anglican priest, which we call Episcopalian here, and he, and he, he founded Methodism, but he never left the Anglican church or the Episcopal church.  The A.M.E.s were organized in 1787, although we have documentation that shows that we go back even further, but the official date is 1796.  A.M.E.s under Richard Allen came out of the same, out of the Methodist Episcopal church as we did in 1796 over segregated sabbaths.  He wanted us to worship there, but we couldn't, we had to sit in the balconies, we couldn't have communion.  It was racism at its best.  So, we left them and so did the A.M.E.s.  Ironically, in 1796 in New York, slavery still existed.  It was not outlawed.  And African Americans no more than, well of course they called them coloreds back then, could no more than two could congregate at a time on the, on the, on the corner.  That was the law.  So, they let us form our own church, but they sent us a white minister, and we broke away from that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was that white minister?
Speaker 2: His name was William Steele [ph.].  There are several publications on William Jacob Walls, 'The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church:  Reality of a Black Church' is probably one of the most authentic, we'll talk about Walls in a little bit, but, so we were founded there and our first building is at Church [Street] and Leonard [Street].  There's a market there right now.  And as people of color grew, move up, we moved up north and various stages of places where we were located.  I told you about Isabella [Isabella Baumfree] who was Sojourner Truth and so forth.  And there are stories and you'll see it in our history that escaped slaves would come and stay in our church.  I remember one service the, the slave catchers were coming to take a person away and they raised the offering to, to free that slave.  John Russwurm [John Brown Russwurm] published the Freedom's Journal, which was the first publication on African Americans in nineteen, 1823 [sic. 1827] in our church.  Our founder, one of the founders and our first bishop, James Varick, was one of the persons involved in that.  But as you move further north as migration of African Americans, we were at location of 87th Street just off of Central Park [New York, New York] west in Central Park, and there was a place called Seneca Village [New York, New York], African American.  There were three churches there.  Also we had a cemetery and there were homes.  In 1854, the, the, a new law came on the books called eminent domain, and the first persons to execute emin- eminent domain was against us, this African church in, in Seneca Village.  And they came and took our property for less than value.  They desecrated our cemetery and made us move out.  And there's a marker there now that talks about us having been there.  So, they took us out so, so that Olmsted [Frederick Law Olmsted] can do his work with Central Park, you know, so (laughter).
Story_ID: 475619
Speaker 1: The story goes on and on in terms of who we are and how we're involved in the basic struggle for freedom and human rights.  And that's why we are called the Freedom Church [African Methodist Episcopal Zion conference] because the struggles and many of our churches throughout this area were part of the Underground Railroad.  I neglected to mention, of course, Harriet Tubman was a member of our denomination and Harriet Tubman's home was in Auburn, New York, and we have the Harriet Tubman Foundation [sic. Harriet Tubman National Historical Park, Auburn, New York] about forty acres of property up there.  Her original home is still there.  She was the advocate of women's suffrage, one of the first.  She had a home for aging women, what you call nursing homes now.  And everybody knows the story of Harriet.  So, we moved forward and as we, of course, by those years the denomination started to grow in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  The second A.M.E. Zion Church was in Hartford [sic.] called Varick [Varick Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New Haven, Connecticut].  The next one was in, no actually the second one was in Philadelphia called Big Wesley [Wesley African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  The next one was in Hartford called--New Haven called Varick and we've spanned, spanned.  We're now on five continents, and we have over two million members and over ten thousand churches.  Ironically, one of our bishops, James Walker Hood, who was here at the turn of the 20th cen- turn of the 19th, yeah, the turn of the 20th century or just before that.  No a little, no he was there in the late 19th century became the first colored superintendent of State of North Carolina, James Walker Hood.  But as you look at the role of the church in the role of the struggle for human rights, you see us very prominent, and I told you that's why we're called the Freedom Church.  So, as we moved further north, we came to on 136th Street, which is the building that you came through which is now family life center [James L. Varick Community Center, New York, New York].  We moved into a Dutch Reform Church in 1910, 1911, quickly outgrew us and in 1923 this church was built.  The architect is one of sixty certified black architects in the world in 1923, and he is the architect for this building and the Abyssinian Church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] which was built after ours.  So, can you imagine a black congregation paying four hundred--building, $400,000, the value of 400,000 in 1922, so they built this building.  The other building became our family life center community center.
Speaker 2: That's on the back side.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And in seven, in 1920, 19, excuse me 1973 we tore that building down and built the new building that you see.  And where you are sitting right now, if you go downstairs in our lower level our first bishop, James Varick, who I talked to you about, is buried there.  His tomb is there, and we're probably one of the few African American churches that have their founder, I mean in New York City [New York, New York], buried in the church.  A.M.E.s [African Methodist Episcopal] have Richard Allen buried in their mother church, which was called Bethel [Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church] in Philadelphia, but here--and as a youngster growing up here, I used to play hide and seek around in the tomb.  A lot of folk a little afraid to go down there, but I guess kids have no, children have no fear.
Story_ID: 475620
Speaker 1: So, at the time this church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] was constructed, did and I'm asking you 'cause you have a wealth of knowledge on the history of it, did, did, did the community have a sense of, of the image of God?  Did they see him as a you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess you gotta think about, I mean if you look--I don't think the urban community or New York [New York] community had any less an image of God than those who lived in the country.  If you read now in retrospectively and redactively the slaves narratives, if you listen to the songs of freedom we call spiritual, "Swing low, sweet chariot coming forward to carry me home, if you get there before I do go down Moses, you know, keep on going, take me back there," ['Swing Low, Sweet Chariot'] are, all that still was in the life of people of color here.  You gotta remember the turn of the 20th century especially when they initiated draft and so forth there were serious riots in New York City and there were a lot of lynchings and so forth.  But, again I think, and again we were founded and we dared to make a difference when slavery still existed.  You see people think slavery, slavery was not abolished until I guess 1830 to '40 [sic. 1827] or later in New York State you know and so and people of color, more than, more than three could not congregate.  So, here you have black men dare to stand on the corner.  Dare to organize.  Dare to make a difference.  And they were independently enough now to, to do, to, to build a church you know.  They didn't have much income, but they had faith.  You know that old song that says, "O, for faith I will not shrink," ['O, for a Faith That Will Not Shrink'] and that's what they had.  And I think you know standing on the faith.  You've heard Dr. Cole [Edwin Louis Cole] talk about, "The faith," you know that black faith that sense of faith, that sense of renewal faith that Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] brought.  That sense of faith that Malcolm [Malcolm X] felt when he made his, he made his pilgrimage.  You know he taught, you've probably have heard it, the Malcolm, the pre-Malcolm, and the post-Malcolm.  The pre-Martin and the post-Martin.  They probably kind of switch place, change places a little bit, but that's the essence of the church and of course the church was going through a series of, of changes.  I won't say revisions, but a renewal, renewal.  I think church had got caught up in the things that are not of this world, the things that are on the secular side, had lost its perspective, and now has returned back to the very essence of what, you know, you know God is a God of the oppressed  Bishop Tutu [Desmond Tutu] will tell you, you can't be faithful to the gospel of reconciliation and, and, and, and of liberation and not be active in the community, so the black church have to be active.  And when the black church cease to be that, they lose their power from God.  So, if you look at everything that happened--Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] who past, Adam Jr., Adam Jr. had pastored Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] the same time my [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] had pastored it, when they use to walk down 125th Street, which is a major black mecca business district, and people of color couldn't have jobs.  So, the preachers closed it down, said you're not gonna do business here and we can't have jobs-at your shops.  So, it's been the church, it's a theology of liberation, the quintessential understanding of who you are as, as a Christian and as a black.  And if you're true to the faith of, of being a Christian, you can't understand, misunderstand where Jesus, what he did, what he meant, what he said, what he believes in, and he had a sense of purpose you know, he had a sense of responsibility, you know.  He had the sense of knowing that accountability.
Story_ID: 475621
Speaker 1: If we get back to your family's history for a little bit do you know the story of your mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] and father meeting and marrying and what brought them together?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess I know bits and pieces.  I think I started to talk--my mother's roommate was also at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], her cousin, my father, that's how that met.  My mother went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with her roommate, met my father who had joined the [U.S.] Navy when he was sixteen at a Submarina [ph.], of course underage.  He, matter of fact my father was born in 1927.  He, I was born on, thirty-five minutes after his birthday.  He was born September 21st.  I was born September 22nd.  September 22nd (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Twenty years later.
Speaker 2: That's a little, that's a little, you know a little, little, little test you know, trivia and that's how they met.  Ironically, part of our family was in Philadelphia, my grandfather's [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] sister, but that's how they met, that's how they met and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 475622
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of your uncle, Paul Robeson (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh gee.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you--
Speaker 2: I can go back to when I was four years old.  My uncle--
Speaker 1: Yeah let's go back to when you were four years old.
Speaker 2: My uncle in the '50s [1950s] when these, the government and J. Edward Hoover and John Foster Dulles, we'll talk about that in a moment, when they took his passport, couldn't travel.
Speaker 1: You remember that?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure I do.
Speaker 1: So, that was in 1951? 1952 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure I do, yeah I remember that.  My grand, my uncle for a period of time came to live with his brother [Smith's maternal grandfather, Benjamin Congleton Robeson].  We lived next door in the parsonage, brownstone and I was on the fourth floor.  You know all the kids were put, put you know up on the top floor.  My uncle had his own room in the, on the other end of the--I was on one side of the brownstone.  He was in the back, and he had that, of course we had an area we had a big grand piano and ironically I'll never forget this, one of the, a couple of stories about my uncle.  I remember as a youngster he had a special bed made for him.
Story_ID: 475623
Speaker 1: So my uncle [maternal great uncle] had this specially made bed, and my uncle was, he rose late in the morning 'cause you know he was a man of the theater and actor.  I don't need to say who Paul Robeson was, 'cause I don't, I don't use him in the context of was, is, 'cause he's still omnipresent.  I remember as a youngster Uncle Paul would go downstairs, I'd come back and I'd go lay in his bed.  Look like I was laying in something that was made for a giant, like it just swallowed me up.  Of course when you're six, seven years old everything looks big, but this looked even bigger than normal, like the old Jack and the beanstalk thing.  I didn't realize how tall he was then, 'cause he was 6'5" and I was a youngster, but it was still a huge bed, you know.  It was like this big guy you know, oh God and his, his accomplice at the time was Lawrence Brown--or was it Allan Booth?  Well, I knew both of his--personal accompaniment--.  I think it was Allan Booth; but anyway, anyway uncle would, would be practicing and so forth, you know where we had the grand piano and, and things like that and I remember--see in those days, I should go back a little further, ministers were very close.  I remember as a youngster Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], my grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] were very late persons.  So late into the evenings they'd be sitting downstairs talking.  They both smoked.  I'll be very clear and very candid they were human beings.  Adam liked his, his, now I know later what it was, I didn't know you know.  Adam liked his Johnnie Walker and milk.  You've heard those stories.  My grandfather drank Old Hickory. And they both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've never heard of Old Hickory.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's bourbon, Old Grand-Dad, and they both smoked.  And they would be up until wee hours of the morning, you know, he and all the preachers.  But, so then there was always people coming in and out of the house.
Story_ID: 475624
Speaker 1: What street did you live on at the time?
Speaker 2: We lived on 136th Street next to the first church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] when we came, which began our community center [James L. Varick Community Center, New York, New York].  We lived in a parsonage.  You could come out of the back of the parsonage and come right into my [maternal] grandfather's [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] office, which I now occupy.  I remember coming through that door.  The interesting thing is about my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] though, I remember these people coming in.  I remember the times of working on the passport fighting for that and so forth, and so people used to come in, discussions.  I didn't know who all the people were, but I knew they were somebody.  I remember when my uncle got his passport back because he had gone down to the, he did a concert down in Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] matter of fact and we have that, and I've got, got that album.  So, just remember though, there were people coming in and out, I knew there were a lot, but didn't know who they were until later in years.  My uncle after he got his passport went back to Europe did a lot of work in Europe.  I need to tell you the things that he did.  He was the first one that fought against fascism and Franco [Francisco Franco], the Linc Brigade [Abraham Lincoln Brigade].  He was the first one who was against Soviet juri, and he worked hard really trying to when he talked about the USO [United Services Organizations].  They always talked about the things that they don't know enough about him, but Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] never said that he was a member of the Communist Party and they tried to say he was.  He never was, never said he was, but when you gonna make him say what you want him to say and I would say I would refer you to the minutes of the, the subcommittee on un-American activities [House Un-American Activities Committee] who, who the congressional person who chaired that committee was Richard Milhous Nixon.  Keep, make that a comma.  He was a congressman then.
Story_ID: 475625
Speaker 1: So anyway, going back to Europe and touring, while he was in Europe my grandmother [Frances Cline Robeson] passed away in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: That was his mother?
Speaker 1: That was, that was his sister-in-law (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Aunt. His sister-in-law, okay.
Speaker 1: That was his sister-in-law, my grandfather's [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] wife.  But, we would have family reunions here and Uncle Paul [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] would call back and we all would be sitting around the phone back here and when he came back to the states you know, on and off he--a matter of fact he did a concert right here and in the concert he talks about his, his sister-in-law not being here.  He talks about us.  You can hear him talking about you know his nephews and so forth.  So, Uncle Paul then he retired of course and when he came back and my aunt Essie [Eslanda Goode Robeson] who was one of the first black anthropologist, a prolific writer in her own right and scholar.  So, I do remember him, 'cause my Aunt Essie his, his aunt, his, his wife, excuse me, passed away in 1965 when I was a freshman in college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina].  So, I knew my uncle all the way through graduate school 'cause he passed away you know in the '70s [1970s].  So, we had often times we could talk, and what I'll say is of interesting is that--one thing, of course when Richard Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon] was elected president, he couldn't understand how the country could elect this same person that how soon they had forgotten, they never, they had never forgotten McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy], but Nixon was pa- part of that whole McCarthy blacklisted area, era, and there are a lot of people in the arts of what they tried to do to, blackball.  I remember some of the pieces of the Peekskill [New York], what they want to call riots, who they, and the Peekskill situation was planted.  It was started, you know, especially by the, by J. Edgar Hoover and his people to create riots and disenfranchise my uncle.  The other interesting thing is I've seen documentation, we are working on his archives which now contains more than almost 100,000 pieces from audio to video to film to print to writing, his writings, newspaper, and even writings of his that were written in backhand.  He came from the old school, you know, he wrote backhand and so did my grandfather.  So, those have been rewritten.  All that's been codified, and that collection is going to the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] and also had been digitized, every piece.  So, you can go in and call up the pieces. But anyway, so, so I remember the whole era.  There, there was a piece, I'll never forget and ironically at the time I was working for ITT [ITT Corporation, White Plains, New York] under Harold Geneen.  I had come and done my graduate work, and there was an article that a piece that we got that was a state department [U.S. Department of State] out of the Freedom Information, Information Act [Freedom of Information Act of 1967], a state department document said that, "You can discredit Robeson."  It was written in, under Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], so it had to be '54 [1954], '55 [1955], somewhere in there.  I'll tell you who it was signed by and said you can discredit Robeson and was coming from the information offer, information officer in the Ivory Coast, which is now Ghana, all right.  Excuse me the Gold Coast, which is now Gha- which is now Ghana 'cause Ghana, Angola, Ashanti [Ashanti Region] and so forth.  And, "You can discredit him and say he did nothing, he erred in ways and his judgment.  All you have to do is get a black writer and a black publication to say this."  Found the article, the article was written in Crisis [The Crisis] magazine by a professor who in the '70s [1970s] was still teaching at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], a black man, Crisis magazine, and the person who authorized this misinformation on Robeson was the secretary who was John Foster Dulles.  I've seen the document, okay, do it.  So, the things that were going on they, they tried to do to my uncle way back.  He spoke about Vietnam in the '50s [1950s] you know.  He talked about that you know, so whereas much of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the eras of the '60s [1960s], my uncle had spoke about it in the '50s [1950s] and in the '40s [1940s] and I remember bomb threats, remember those things happening.  My mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] told me about some of the things--
Story_ID: 475626
Speaker 1: That actually happened to you, to him [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] when you were a kid that you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I remember pieces.  I mean I didn't realize the extent, of course, in the '50s [1950s] as much as my mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] told about them, but I do remember, yeah, I remember some--
Speaker 1: So when you were, when you were that age say nineteen when in '50 [1950], before you started school in the early '50s [1950s], before you were--
Speaker 2: Well I was in school, I was, I was in third, remember I was born in '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: From '47 [1947] so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I was in elementary school [The Modern School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, in elementary school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who were the people that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm gonna tell you about that, some people that came by.  And I knew a ton of people and later on in the years I, and uncle I talked about that, and it was people like Jomo Kenyatta, Julius Nyerere, you know, to name, you know, and I'll tell you why I mentioned those names in particular.  And, 'cause later on as you know in my career I was a diplomat.  I was president of the [U.S.] African Development Foundation and responsible for all the foreign aid on the continent of Sub-Sahara.  Had a great opportunity to go to Tanzania and go up to Dar es Salaam [Tanzania] and sit with the last of the charismatic leaders, you know, people had passed on, but President Nyerere 'cause he retired was still living, and had a chance to sit and talk with him and it was, it was one because my uncle had passed on by then.  This was in, this is in '90 [1990], must have been '90 [1990], '89 [1989], '90 [1990] somewhere in there and, 'cause I had an office in Dar es Salaam, and sat and talked with him for more, for what I think must have been a half a day.  And we had, and then we had lunch and so forth and he, he taught me more about my uncle than I knew, and that kind of was a retrofit and he doesn't remember visiting him in his home.  Great, which is a great moment of, of, of reflection back, you know flashbacks.
Story_ID: 475627
Speaker 1: The other time was when I helped supervise the elections in South Africa on apartheid.  But it wasn't so much then as to when President Mandela came to the states we had a chance to talk, and he would tell me how my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] communicated with him.
Speaker 2: How did he communicate with him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, they wrote each other.  Matter of fact my uncle, you know, tried to go to South Africa.  You know my uncle would not--you know there are things that he, of course, you know he was against apartheid and talked about it--(unclear), but they had a, they had a great admiration or you know a love for each other, 'cause you remember President Mandela was incarcerated more than twenty years, so you know he knew of my uncle, they knew of each other, and my uncle passed away 'cause--I think '76 [1976].  So, it was just a wonderful time of talking with President Nelson Mandela.  Interesting thing is, he is as tall as my uncle.  I'll never forget and you'll see a picture in, in my office of he and I together.  When I shook his hand 'cause Nelson Mandela had been an athlete and a boxer, he had big hands. My uncle had big hands, you know he was an athlete, he was a twelve letter man at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and he played professional football and so forth, so he had big hands.  So shaking President Mandela's hand made me think about my uncle and how his physique and so forth.  So, that was a great, so when I say deja vu, those same people that I as a youngster, that I knew I would say partially about, but knew more about them as I grew more in knowledge and so forth.  It was just great. And my uncle and I would have some interesting discussions about the world and where we're living and what was going on and so forth.  Of course he lived, he went, you know when I got married and had children and all those things, but um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, when you were still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He even--he was a member here and he performed here many, many times.
Story_ID: 475628
Speaker 1: When you were still a kid, when you were still young and you saw Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], your [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] and he was a minister, did you know what you wanted to do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember, I remember, I remember Richard Wright.  I remember Langston Hughes.  Those two I do, I mean, I mean coming in the house.  I'm trying to think who--
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you wanted to be as a, as a kid?  Did you think okay, I'm gonna grow up to be like my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, well I wanted to be, I wanted to go in [U.S.] Foreign Service.  I always wanted to go in Foreign Service.  My uncle--one thing that we all were, is--I'm a sense of independence, a sense of strength and that we, we grew up understanding who we are, who we were, who we wanted to be.  It was in that sense that I cannot be my uncle, I have to be me, but I gotta work hard and be who I am and understanding and know that racists exists at all levels.
Story_ID: 475629
Speaker 1: When were you aware of racism?  How old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh gee, probably sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Why--okay sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Sixth grade.  I'll tell you, I got, I got a good example.  Was going to a school, matter of fact before that I went to, another interesting thing, the school I went to before then in early years--
Speaker 1: Can you name these schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah I can name the school.  Oh, I went, oh I can name all the schools I went to, that's easy.  But, I'm talking about with the earliest schools I went to a school called a Modern School [The Modern School, New York, New York].  It was a private school, and it was owned and the principal's name was Mildred Johnson [Mildred Johnson Edwards].  Mildred Johnson's father [J. Rosamond Johnson] and uncle, you'll never guess who they were, James, you know Johnson [James Weldon Johnson].
Speaker 1: Johnson yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, you know, you know where I'm going with that right?  All right, you know of course, you know her uncle and father wrote the, 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,' 'God's Trombone' ['God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse,' James Weldon Johnson].  It's interesting that I would be going to their school, and our school anthem was 'Lift Every Voice and Sing.'  When I was a fifth grader, I could sing every verse of, 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' all right understand, so then, so, it would be good to go to public school, so I went to the sixth grade.  Back in those days they had what they called SP.  If you were bright enough in the sixth grade, you went into SP, where you skipped a grade.  And so you seventh, you get a seventh grade SP, skip to the eighth grade and go to ninth grade.  High school was tenth, eleventh, and twelfth.  I'll never forget we had an old Jewish teacher, old Jewish teacher, tall, name was Ms. Brighting [ph.], I'll never forget this.  One thing I remember about her she taught us how to read The New York Times, how to fold it correctly.  She only let the Jewish kids go into SP.  I'll never forget it, never forget it.  Only the Jewish kids went to SP.  I'll never forget that.  That's, that, that's how plain it--'cause it was, I remember that and there were two of us, two or three of us that you know were just awesome.  But, you know we lived through it.
Story_ID: 475630
Speaker 1: Why had the family decided to send you to a private school?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't even know that.  I can't answer that so much.  It could have been for several reasons.  I think it was more important as the school they sent me to.  'Cause they could have sent, they probably could have identified other schools.  I do remember how much my mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] was paying, fifteen dollars a week, which included transportation.  And the school also had a camp up in Pine Bush, New York.  I went there in the summer.  Then I went to another camp up in Connecticut.  No, yeah con- no Massachusetts, it will come to me in a minute, called Atwater [Camp Atwater, North Brookfield, Massachusetts].  And Camp Atwater was where my mother and her sisters [Marian Robeson Liggins and Vivian Robeson] had gone.  It was run by the Urban League [Urban League of Springfield].  It seemed like there were a lot of us, what you will call middle class, whatever, went to that same camp.  So, I think the family was insulating and protecting us going to places, well of course going to The Modern School [New York, New York] was not knowing, knowing who we are.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other students at The Modern School?
Speaker 2: Oh gee, actually I had a cousin that went there.  I can't remember all the names.  I remember my cousin he went there 'cause he continued in private school after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, then who were some of the teachers that impressed you at the school?
Speaker 2: I can't, well of course I remember Mildred Johnson [Mildred Johnson Edwards] very vividly.  I remember my first and second grade teacher, but I can't remember her name.  I can assure you the same building still exists.  I remember sitting, us sitting on the floor singing and so forth.
Speaker 1: And you said--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember us having our graduation at the Audubon Ballroom [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right and you know, June (unclear)--and of course you know the Audubon Ballroom, Mal, Malcolm [Malcolm X].  You know it's a lot of little points in history.  Later on and I could say you know, "Look, ha!"
Story_ID: 475631
Speaker 1: You said they taught you, or they taught everybody about themselves (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no what I'm saying is--
Speaker 1: --you meant about your black self.
Speaker 2: Well, I think, well let me just say this I believe that the worse thing that could have happened to us was integration.  Desegregation killed us.
Speaker 1: You feel we lost more than we gained?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I think that in terms of knowing thy self and understanding and I--well, de facto segregation the educators were very poignant and emphasized on who you are.  I mean we studied Paul Laurence Dunbar.  I mean Countee Cullen was in the library down the street, when I was in elementary school and middle school.  There were no problems.  I read quite, I read James Baldwin, 'Another Country,' you know, which was a bad book, but I remember the, 'The Spook That Sat by'--'Sat by the Door' ['The Spook Who Sat By the Door,' Sam Greenlee].  I, I read the 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison] as a youngster, read it again twice since then, you know three or four times, you know, 'Souls of Black Folk' ['The Souls of Black Folk,' W.E.B. Du Bois], James Baldwin, 'Walk the Streets' [sic. 'Fifth Avenue, Uptown'].  You, you knew who you were.  You knew who you were, so what I'm saying is that and, and the African American teachers made sure you knew.  I guess again going to The Modern School [New York, New York] with Ms. Johnson [Mildred Johnson Edwards] of course who she was and who her family was; one, not losing your identity, but knowing who you are, but it was also I believe now that you mentioned it if I thought about it in the time that I went there in the '50s [1950s], it could have been also a protective measure.  It wasn't against other people of color, but there were all kinds of things happening to us.  You know, if you no--if you notice they tried to kill my uncle several times, and matter of fact we do know that while he was in the hospital in Europe in his later years there were some things which we can prove that was lead by officials in this government to sterilize his mind.  But I'm saying is that, so to protect the family and the youngsters I believe that's why they sent us there, too.  I mean Mildred, you know, and then I think that there was a need not to become elitist.
Speaker 1: Not to become--
Speaker 2: To become elitist.
Speaker 1: Not to become an elitist.
Speaker 2: You know, that means go to public school like the others.  Do the, you know what I'm saying, I'm saying.  Not that you would have become elitist where I was, but I think it was a sense of who were are and who we are and that's what I always think back to that we never was gonna live off the family name, but I knew that, I knew that in order to be who I was I had to be better than what I was.
Story_ID: 475632
Speaker 1: How important was religion to you as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean every youngster of my generation, I mean church was church.  Whether you understood it or liked it, you did it.  It was everything for us.
Speaker 1: So, when you--
Speaker 2: It was not only the Sunday morning service, Sunday afternoon, Sunday evening, but in New York City [New York, New York] it was something unique called release time education.
Speaker 1: How would you describe the God of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh protective, had to be, I'm still living, had to be.  But you know God, who God was.  We knew Jesus.  We knew he was Bethlehem, in the swaddling clothes.  We learned all that scripture, you know.  God. He was good.  He was good for us. God (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was good.  Did you have a sense of, or did you even think about what his nationality may be?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you think he was white man?
Speaker 2: --no, I didn't think that.  I just think he was the one that helped me to go to these other meetings and meet other kids and meet other young ladies and we all came together.  I mean for youngsters, you know, Jesus was real and you know I guess again I'm talking about pre-high school.  You know, it was just, Jesus was fun, you know, and we did what we were supposed to do in church, some of which we liked and some we didn't like, but we knew we had to do it, because you were supposed to do it.  Not only just because your mother and daddy said it, because your extended family.  So, Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] saying you know about it takes a village to raise a child and writing all her books is all the stuff she's reaching back trying to be what we've already, already had.  We know that.  You don't have to tell it to us.  We wouldn't be here where we are if we, if that had not been for Mr. Joe and Ms. Mary down the street.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: We're all latchkey kids.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 475633
Speaker 1: So he was real.  Now there are some of course, some who went by the wayside, but you know they did.
Speaker 2: Integration, what did we lose?
Speaker 1: I think again we lost the sense of direction, education.  Interesting, after we had, after we had desegregation and integration, then they came with multicultural education, right.  You see the thing that's interesting is that why would you have to put in, see if you read Carter, Carter Woodson's [Carter G. Woodson] book, 'The Mis-Education of the Negro,' if you, if you put the correct facts in history, you wouldn't have needed the other.  You wouldn't have needed it.  You see so if you did what you're supposed to do, it wouldn't been, it's a non-issue.  And the thing that happened is we still have a generation now that's coming up that doesn't have any idea who they are or their roots.  I mean you know we say you, you know Richard Wright, whose he?
Speaker 2: Is that a product of integration (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ralph Ellison who?  Oh I believe so, no question.  I mean we all know that in education, the nuance--(unclear)--because, I'm a little older than you of course, and how they change math and so forth.  We didn't have to have a course of African American history.  All right, but we knew the correctness of history.  And we, I didn't know it was correct because, but these black educators were gonna make sure you knew it.  Now I was fortunate enough to be living on the post-era of the Harlem Renaissance and remember seeing folk standing on the corner of 125th Street and Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard] or 125th Street and 7th Avenue at the time, which now Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] on boxes, and you seen it in films of Malcolm [Malcolm X] standing on the corner talking and people standing around.  I remember Adam walking the streets when we were youngsters, we're sitting on the si--on the stoop.  He walked down the street in his shorts, sit down there right next to us.  I remember athletes like Wilt Chamberlain.  We're playing basketball in, in the, in the str- in the courtyard.  He would come out there with his shorts and play basketball with us, Wilt Chamberlain.  He owned a restaurant here.  You ever see any of these athletes now wanna come in, come in the hood and play basketball with us, with kids, walk the streets, no, no, see it's changed and when we changed we lost a sense of community, sense of oneness--these athletes today are so, think they're bigger than life and they're crumbling.  They, they, they create an image for us that is, that has, that's desecrated who we are as a people.  Youngsters taking, have taken on that kind of mentality.  It's a shame and a disgrace, but some of them I'm realizing they meet the same ones going--(unclear)-- you know it's interesting I think this, this in retrospect I believe that and had the opportunity of course to meet Jimmy Brown and a couple of other folk, but as you look at professional sports and of course basketball is just so devast- it's all--the basketball players have no feeling of where, why they are who they are and why they're there.  I mean when they couldn't get a black player in a Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] school much less, the pros, I mean they forget about the Marques Haynes, the, the Harlem Rens [New York Renaissance], when they wouldn't let guys play you know.  Here you have Michael Jordan says, "Well you know, I can't talk about you know a Republican or you know or talk about what's right or the war because you know Republicans buy Nikes too."  Hey Michael, you forget who you are, son?  You're the little boy from North Carolina, they took you into, to UNC [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] 'cause you could play.  I don't know if you ever graduated.  You forget who your daddy was?  You see they got so high.  But, and baseball players though I gotta admit baseball players retrospect differently, still remember who they are.  Barry Bonds may not be perfect, but he knows he is where he is because of what has happened for him.  He knows about, what Curt Flood did.  You know in terms of the whole thing free agent.  We wouldn't have free agency without Curt Flood.  He gave up his life and his career.  He knew what Jackie Robinson went through.  He knew all--and, but and that's what happens there and, and even with--I can believe with some of, some of the football players understand, most of them don't, 'cause Jim Brown caught hell.  But, we can go back before him, you know, with Marion Motley, but I'm saying is that if you, they have lost a sense of who they are and I think it 'cause these youngsters came through an era when everything was integrated, that's what I'm saying.  And I graduated from a historically black college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina], and I think that's something that also manifested in re-emphasizing strength of who I am today.
Story_ID: 475634
Speaker 1: Where did you end of going to high--and graduating high school?
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] passed away in 1963, up until then I attended DeWitt Clinton High School here in the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: DeWitt Clinton?
Speaker 2: DeWitt Clinton, all boys, five thousand boys, integrated high school.  At that time, that high school did not require examination to enter.  Let me go back a little further, part of my Walter Mitty is I wanted to go to High School of Music and Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and the Performing Arts, New York, New York], which is a special high school, and I could not get into that school.  They said I didn't sing good enough or something, whatever, so I went on to DeWitt Clinton, played football, and part of the pieces I'll tell you is on the football side we were undefeated, untied, and unscored upon.  And on the basketball side, one of our guys was a year ahead of me we played basketball, his name was Willie Worsley.  Willie Worsley went onto Texas Cris- Texas Western, Texas Western, Texas [Texas Western College of the University of Texas; University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas].  Well you know 'Glory Road.'  Willie Worsley is one of the players in 'Glory Road.'  I'm just letting you know, but Willie came out of our era and if you, some of the things in there Willie tells me is in fact, a lot of it's true.  But, he had a sense of direction of who he was.  So, I went to DeWitt Clinton High School.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Basil Paterson also went to DeWitt Clinton.
Speaker 2: That's right, oh yeah DeWitt Clinton, oh yeah no question they had a lot, it was, we say, the school, champions of a lot of sports.
Speaker 1: Who else was there when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, before me this, Pablo Robertson was just before me.  Barry Hankerson, he and I played football together, and we'll talk about Barry and I later.  We went to ri- rival colleges.  We played professionally against each other.  And of course Barry was Gladys Knight's first husband, all right.  Barry could, could, could pick up the ball and he could pass it for forty yards in either hand, left or right.  And so yeah there was Barry.  Pablo Robertson was one of the, the prolific dribblers.  Matter of fact he lived in this block with the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters] and so forth, and my principal was a guy named Walter Degnan who was, became one of the city's top educators, became eventually head of the principals union [American Federation of School Administrators] and so forth.  People still talk about him.
Speaker 1: What was his name again?
Speaker 2: Walter Degnan.  DeWitt Clinton had one of the most powerful alumni associations.  I think somebody who headed Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia], Pepsi [Pepsi-Cola; PepsiCo], you know.  Interesting thing about Clinton is--well, let's talk about Clinton, is that it, in terms of schools to take, to examination to get into, non-examination other than like Bronx High School of Science [The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, New York] and Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York]--had to take examinations, you, it was the highest recognized, highest ranked academically.  Strangely enough, I couldn't get into Stuyvesant either.  Maybe I was a dumb kid, but that's interesting just hold that comma, I was a dumb kid.  But anyway six, when I was at Clinton I did some of the things every other kid there.  I remember cutting geometry for two days.  I said, "Gee I done cut two days, I'm in trouble now."  I was playing handball.  And I should say the head of the football team was a guy named Doc Wiener [ph.], a legend in high school sports.  So, I cut, I said well I might as well make it three days, might as well make it four days, it was a week, I said oh I'm in trouble now, so you know my mom [Bennie Robeson Smith] had to come in.  And I hated geometry, hated this teacher.  Well anyway, I shouldn't hate it--well I did what I did.  The other thing about Clinton I wanna say before I, 'cause my grandfather passed away, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in November [sic.], my grandfather passed away three weeks later December the 1st.  My grandmother [Frances Cline Robeson] had passed away in '57 [1957] on December the 7th.
Story_ID: 475635
Speaker 1: December 7th, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, this one gives the point of reference and I remember being in the hospital.  Matter of fact on the week before we were supposed to play last game, Thanksgiving game against Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] and I was looking to beat Stuyvesant, but we couldn't play it.  It was cancelled out, big rivalry.  So, you remember I said I couldn't get into the High School of Music and Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art the Performing Arts, New York, New York], ironically I still sang in the Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York] glee club which was all men, played you know the sports I told you about and, oh there's another little piece of racism I should say.  They couldn't, an African American could not play on DeWitt Clinton's foot- baseball team.  There was no blacks in it, no one, and we knew why.  Ironically, there was a guy who was a running back with us, I can't, I think his name was Kurt Shibe [ph.] who also played baseball.  When--that was the same year that Ed Kranepool who was going to the high school Mon- Monroe High School [James Monroe High School, Bronx, New York] was the first one drafted out of high school to go play for Casey Stengel and the Mets [New York Mets].  He never played in minor league.  Ed Kranepool who played first base.  That's a little trivia question, too.  So anyway, I wasn't good enough to get into the High School of Music and Art, remember specializing in music and I was going for voice and art, but then I auditioned for the All City Chorus and in the All City Chorus I got in.  I couldn't get into the other school, I get All City, and the director of All City Chorus was a guy named Peter J. Wilhousky.  You always heard the classic, 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic,' 'Mine Eyes Have Seen' ['Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory'], he was the one, the arranger of that.  But I wasn't good enough to get into the other thing, interesting, we won't go there.  For whatever reason, I won't go there, so maybe that was good.
Story_ID: 475636
Speaker 1: So, '63 [1963] my [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] passed, a new minster was gonna come in here and my mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] thought it was best I go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, I went to Philadelphia and lived with my other grandparents.
Speaker 2: Why did she think it was best you go to Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: 'Cause, well we had lived in a parsonage all those years and she had to find a new place to live, it was December, it was January, you know getting out of the city.  I hadn't been,--(unclear) a bad boy a little bit, you know, so went on to Philadelphia.  Matter a fact around the corner from where my grandparents lived is where Jackie--where Roy Campanella had grown up and so forth.
Speaker 2: Roy Campanella is from New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: No, he's from Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Philadelphia okay.
Speaker 1: Philadelphia on Butler Street.  So, I went to Simon Gratz High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Ironically Simon Gratz was one of, the principal of Simon Gratz, a guy named Marcus Foster who, who went out to eventually to Oakland [California] as the superintendent changing the schools around he was assassinated and people in Philadelphia and Oakland still remember Marcus Foster.  But anyway, so I went to high school in Philadelphia, went to a school called Simon Gratz and I'm trying to think of his name who plays for Detroit [Detroit Lions] there that came, that was out in Seattle [Washington] that has a little streak in his hair, plays forward.  It will come to me.  Quite breezy youngster.  So, but it was the same school that in terms of football, I'm trying to remember his name because he followed Jim Brown in, in the, with the, with the Cleveland Browns as a fullback.  He had gone to Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], but anyway, I went to that school and graduated, finished number five out of five hundred more plus, this dumb kid, right, which was very interesting.  So again if I look back retrospectively there are some things that I contributed to me and there are some things I consider were very racist.
Speaker 2: Institutional.
Speaker 1: Yeah, institutional racism no question about that.
Story_ID: 475637
Speaker 1: So, that's how all that kind of tied in.  But, you asked me a question about [HistoryMaker] Basil Paterson.  I go back in Harlem [New York, New York] and then when you talk about Harlem politics when there was a guy named J. Raymond Jones, they called him the Silver Fox, kind of a lieutenant of Tammany Hall, but and a guy named Hulan Jack who was the first black borough president in Manhattan [New York] and Ruth Whitehead Whaley who was a member here, who's clerk of the old Board of Estimate [New York City Board of Estimate], which was really the most powerful entity in New York City [New York, New York].  But, I do remember those people and the Percys, the Basils were proteges of J. Raymond Jones, the Silver Fox.  If you ever get to talk to Percy [Percy Sutton] or Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] or any of those guys say, "Tell me about the Silver Fox," you know so Silver Fox, J. Raymond Jones. As a youngster I do remember the first black police chief, you know, and the deputy chief.  There were very few of them.  But, I can say also a thing about black police officers and black and youngsters, If you're out in the, in, in the, in the streets and not in school, they smack you upside the head and make you go to school.  Some people used to call them truant officers.  Even the, the police officers cared about you as a youngster, and I joke with some of them now who were there when I was a youngster and I kid them not I said, "If it hadn't been for you, you know, some of us just wouldn't have been."  I mean you know they really were concerned about us as individuals.  So, I'm saying it was, Harlem was the village from the, from the, those who were responsible for the protection, to those who were responsible for the spirituality and all in between, interconnected, interconnected--
Story_ID: 475638
Speaker 1: I didn't tell you about the days of going to the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] paying sixty-five cents and seeing two shows and seeing a B movie.  I was there when Stevie Wonder did his things, you know--
Speaker 2: Did you see the, I mean just thinking about Apollo and how, were you there for the brothers, the Hines, Hines and--
Speaker 1: Oh sure.
Speaker 2: --Hines and what is Hines, Hines, and Dad [Gregory Hines, HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr., and Maurice Hines, Sr.]?
Speaker 1: Well, well--
Speaker 2: Was that the same, about the same time or that came, they came later?
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think.  I can't remember them playing as much as, I think I might be, I'm trying to think age wise, we're about the same age.  Of course I do remember Moms Mabley.  I could tell you days, you know I do remember, Shepherd Lymon [ph.], Frank Lymon and The Teenagers [Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers], but I'm trying--I remember of course, I remember the original Miracles when Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] and his wife [Claudette Rogers Robinson] was in it, you know I mean those things, The Platters, The Flamingos, you know and go back and--(unclear)--.  I remember when you know James Brown came through--well when James Brown came through there I was kind of just coming out of high school [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York] and things like.  James Brown never left the Apollo target audience even to his death.  You can never remember James Brown doing a concert where people had to pay fifty dollars and eighty dollars.  James Brown didn't do that stuff, think about it.  He was always about the people.  So, no I do remember all those things, Pigmeat Mar, Markham [Pigmeat Markham], Peg Leg Bates.  Peg Leg Bates had, "Here come the judge, here come the judge courts in session, here comes the judge," [sic. 'Here Comes the Judge,' Pigmeat Martin] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Here Comes the Judge.'  Or was that Pigmeat Markham?
Speaker 1: Was it Pigmeat Markham?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well they both, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: --crazy, crazy.
Story_ID: 475639
Speaker 1: Peg Leg Bates had a country club up in the Catskills [Catskills Mountains], the only black club up there, you know a little resort (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the name of club?
Speaker 1: Called Peg Leg Bates Resorts [sic. Peg Leg Bates Country Club; Mountain Valley Resort and Country Club, Kerhonkson, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, when was that?  I've never heard of anything about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was back in the '50s [1950s], yeah Peg Leg was big.  Yeah, it wasn't big.
Speaker 2: Where in the Catskills do you know?
Speaker 1: Off of route, between Route 17 [New York State Route 17] and 87 [Interstate 87 (I-87)] I've seen the location.  It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is the location still there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's no club there though.  It's like the New Jersey place called Lawnside which was all black or down in, when you went down to Atlantic City [New Jersey] on Kentucky Avenue where Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey] was or when you were in Wildwood, New Jersey, blacks couldn't change clothes on the beach.  People who had houses had showers in the backyards where you can come and leave your clothing and picnic tables and take yourself and walk to a certain section of the beach.  I remember those days.  But ironically at the same time now I am deputy grand master of Prince Hall Masons [Prince Hall Freemasonry], ten thousand strong in the State of New York, the third oldest black organization in New York and we own one thousand acres in the Catskills.
Speaker 2: That's right I know all about it--
Speaker 1: That's right Roscoe [ph.]--
Speaker 2: --because you're trying to develop it into like an Olympic stadium--
Speaker 1: How did you know that?
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: Who'd you talk to?
Speaker 2: --because I know all the politics of them--
Speaker 1: I'm the guy.
Speaker 2: Are you the guy?
Speaker 1: You and I gotta talk later on how you found out without.  I was at a meeting this morning about that.  But, I'm saying they bought it in '47 [1947], '49 [1949].  They could not buy it.  They had to have a white intermediary to be the, quote the purchaser, and of course like what would I know back then.  But, and I used to go up there for a little, but now we're trying to do what Peg Leg, some of what he did, but even on a more massive scale, but see we're not, we, we're standing on other's shoulders is what I'm saying, you know, and so, so that whole genre, so I'm old enough to have--didn't--I would love to have lived--you didn't ask me that question?  I would love to have lived in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s] that era.  There's something about that era.  You know I would love to--you know I've met Lena Horne many times and you know, but I would love to have been and I, I've been, I've sung here, right here when Duke [Duke Ellington] was here.  We did his concert and sang some music together.  I, I've been there with Count Basie.  I've been, been all, but I would love to have been there--and I've seen Ethel Waters.  I would love to--I remember sitting with Mahalia Jackson.  I would love to have been there when they were, right.  When they were, in that, so that, if I had an era that I would loved to have lived in--
Speaker 2: It would have been in that era.
Speaker 1: --it would been either that era or--
Speaker 2: Did your uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] introduce you to music?  Did you, did you live vicariously through him with entertainment, with acting and, and opera?
Speaker 1: Actually that was not my Walter Mitty. I think, I think being in this church and the legacy of music in the life of this, this congregation here probably was as greatly influenced in music as my uncle.  My uncle was, the influence was the, the, the, the, the, the fullness of your life.
Story_ID: 475640
Speaker 1: Athlete, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, exactly--
Speaker 1: --musician, painter, poet, yeah.
Speaker 2: --exactly, exactly.  You know I finished college, you know, with honors and I sang and played on the football team.
Speaker 1: Who was involved in getting you to college and helping you decide how you were gonna get there, what you were gonna major in?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know okay you know I was living with my [paternal] grandparents.  Ironically, I'd probably say my grandfather was, was, was the person who decided where I was gonna go to college more than anyone else.  I had family in California.  I thought about there.  I was turned down by Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  Remind me to tell you about that about that one, by Morgan State and the coach.  We'll talk about--that's another piece of trivia.  Livingstone College [Salisbury, North Carolina] is owned by the A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] church, founded by one of the great black educators of, of the 20th, 20, the 19th and 20th century named Joseph Charles Price.  He died as a young man.  He was the carver of Fredrick Douglass as an orator, and he and Fred Douglass were very close.  And Livingstone College is in Salisbury, North Carolina, and that's where I went to college.  Actually I filled out my application myself, myself and sent it in and went there on an academic scholarship.
Speaker 1: Not an athlete?
Speaker 2: Not an athlete.  I went there on an academic scholarship.  They didn't have much athletics.  Livingstone College and John C. Smith [sic. Johnson c. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], which was Biddle University, were the first two black colleges [HBCUs] to play intercollegiate football.  And on the lawn in front of the great administration building in, in Livingstone is a plaque that says where they played football.  So I mean so part of those pieces were together.  But, the interesting thing is that I wanted again to be a diplomat, and I, I'll tell you later what my Walter Mitty was in terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me also about Morgan, Morgan State.
Speaker 2: Well, that's why I was going to come back.  I, in those days freshmen, in the black college freshmen could play varsity football, so I played football.  I didn't--in high school I played football, baseball, track.  I was on the bowling team (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you got to play baseball in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] but not in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right,--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I lettered in all those sports and was in the choir and all that stuff, this little dumb kid that couldn't do anything.  So, anyway matter of fact after high school [Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] Morgan wanted to take this other--(unclear)--.  In high school and Morgan State was where Li- Willie Lanier had come out of you know, a bunch of other guys.  So, but they were in the same conference, the CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association], and this is 1965 height of Vietnam War right.  So, I went to Livingstone College with the mind of wanting to again go into the diplomatic service.  I changed my mind during the course of that and went into the B [business] school, but all during college I, I didn't play but one sport and, but I still sang in the choir and all those things and I played football for all--I finished college in three years.
Story_ID: 475641
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you graduated [from Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] in what year?
Speaker 2: Well actually I graduated in '69 [1969], but I finished the year before that in June, and my coach said to me, "Can you just come back for football season"?  I said, "But I've taken that, I don't need nothing, I'm finished."  I went back for, for three months, played football.  I had been, I had been, I had been captain two years on the football team.  I played what we called, we called, we had a weak, we had an unbalanced lineup, I played weak side tackle.  I played guard.  And I was at that time 6'4", 230 pounds, ran the 40 [40-yard dash] with equipment and, and, and, and 4.8 you know, fastest guy, lightening you know.  I had great speed, that's just in college.  In high school in New York [New York], I had played tight end.  In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I played, I played guard tackle.  So anyway I said, "Okay, I'll come back."  I had taken-I already had a double major in history and poli sci [political science] and a minor in English, in English lit.  So I said, "Okay what am I gonna take?  I'll take business law.  I'll take typing, insurance, I'll take accounting," little subjects.  Ironically when I took those there was an organization that just started called Consortium for Graduate Study in Business for Negroes [Consortium for Graduate Study in Management].  It had just started, corporations were funding it.  This is 1968, and the schools were Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California], Indiana U [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], Rochester [University of Rochester, Rochester, New York], and Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], and they offered me this full fellowship, two-thousand five hundred dollar stipend, books, housing, tuition fee, internship.  I said you know, and the strangest thing I was also drafted to play football for the Dallas Cowboys.  We'll talk about that how I had to take a, take a, an IQ test.  But, I was all CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] for two years running, All-Conference, both in terms of playing and academically and I'll never forget at the all, at the all CI, all CIAA and I was all American, small college, when I had to go shake Coach Banks' [Earl Banks] hand of Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] the same guy that wouldn't let me come to Morgan and we were, and we were beating his all American, we had an awesome team, and he said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Gregory Smith]."  I said, "Yes coach," you know, "I have no regrets, coach."  He said, "I wish you could have," I said, "I wish even after your freshman year I could have got you."  I said no 'cause I had a coach who believed in me, stuck by me.  I even said it--and I played in East-West Shrine Game and all those things.  So, that's why I said going back to Morgan, the same guy that wouldn't take me I came back to whoop him and I was All-Conference and All-American, All-Conference for two years and All-American one year and then you know all those other things.
Story_ID: 475642
Speaker 1: You were gonna talk about your Walter.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, my Walter Mitty goes a little further.  So, I went on, I wanted to go into the [U.S.] Foreign Service, and I turned around going into corporate arena, going up to Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you took one of those internships.
Speaker 2: I took--
Speaker 1: I mean you took the, the, consortium [Consortium for Graduate Study in Business for Negroes; Consortium for Graduate Study in Management] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You went to University of Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: That's right where I,--
Speaker 1: And was that in Madison?
Speaker 2: --where I, yeah Madison where I coached freshman football and I'll tell you my, I'll tell you my little story there.  There was this guy [Mike Webster] who came from upstate Lake Superior big strong young brother, young, actually he was Caucasian.  He was slow.  I said he was--
Speaker 1: Slow meaning?
Speaker 2: He was, He couldn't move fast.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said, "You wanna start, wanna become, you wanna play varsity football get a spot on the team?"  He couldn't play tackle.  He was just too slow.  I said let me teach you how to be a center.  I had centered at one point.  I taught him how to be a center.  Told him how to move left to right, how to pull.  In his junior, sophomore, junior, and senior year he started for the University of Wisconsin and went on to play for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was All-Pro every year he played.  He just passed away two years ago penniless, penniless, and he was All-Pro for the Steelers.  Even to this day, he called me, he did until he died, "Coach Smith [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Gregory Smith]."  And I'll let you think about who you think that center for the Pittsburgh Steelers was.  Yeah, you come back.
Speaker 1: Was it Harris [Franco Harris]?  No.
Speaker 2: No, he was there during, he was there during Harris.  Harris couldn't do anything, he was a center for Terry Bradshaw.  It will come to you, just think about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 475643
Speaker 1: But I'm saying that's--so when I went on and left, came out of there played a little you know before I went there you know and even the Dallas Cowboys was very racist at the time.  With all the talent they had, they could never win a Super Bowl.
Speaker 2: So you were drafted--
Speaker 1: Yeah drafted.
Speaker 2: --but you didn't go to them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played a little bit with them and yeah, matter a fact Calvin Hill and I were rookies together.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: O.J. [O.J. Simpson] was a rookie.  Matter of fact Calvin was the only first round draft choice that was not selected for the college All-Star game, but they finally went when O.J. conveniently got some kind of cold or sickness.  And what it was I think Lou Saban didn't wanted to take his franchise player and let him go to the All-Star Game and get hurt and never play again, so Calvin went.
Speaker 2: So you were drafted in '69 [1969] and you played for how many years with the Cowboys?
Speaker 1: I played there a couple of years and then--
Speaker 2: So, just tell me the highlights of that experience.
Speaker 1: No, no, no high--
Speaker 2: There are no highlights.
Speaker 1: Yeah there were highlights, couldn't get a room for us to live in. The team had to get it--this is Dallas '69 [1969], very racist, very racist.
Speaker 2: Even then.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  And there were some racist players on the Cowboys.  I won't say their names, but they are still living and--
Speaker 2: Let me think about who was back then.
Speaker 1: --some, and some came from--oh you haven't figured out who I was taking about yet?  Mike Webster is the center, okay.  I won't say who they are, but there were some players from the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  I won't tell you who they are, and even offen-, offensive line coach.  I won't tell you who he is either.  But, the Cowboys had some very--but one of them I think most Christian gentleman I'd ever met was Tom Landry, brilliant person.  So, I went on to--
Speaker 2: Was he, Tom was he kind to you?  Was he--
Speaker 1: Yes, gentlemen.
Speaker 2: Yeah okay.
Speaker 1: Well you know football is football.
Speaker 2: Football is football. So you leave that, I mean how do you leave (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, you know I made a decision, well you made a decision on where you gonna be in life, what happens after five years.  I mean football players at that time wasn't making twenty thousand dollars.  You gotta remember now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh okay, so it wasn't, it was, oh I, I didn't okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, I mean, the highest paid player on the Cowboys team was making maybe forty, um-hm; you know and, but what I'm saying, and a matter of fact Roger Staubach and I were roommates together.  He was a super rookie 'cause he had done his four years, then he came.  Sixty-nine [1969] was his first year, year of playing, Staubach.
Story_ID: 475644
Speaker 1: So, I decided to go, you know, finish my, my education.
Speaker 2: So you, then you, so then you go back to school [at University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  I still had my fellowship [through the Consortium for Graduate Study in Business for Negroes; Consortium for Graduate Study in Management].
Speaker 2: Okay so you were doing, you, so you go back to get the fellowship after you play for a couple of years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that's where I coached, that's where I coached.
Speaker 2: --and then you coach also, okay I gotcha now.
Speaker 1: And I majored in marketing and finance and minored in international business.
Speaker 2: But you'd, you, you gotten your undergrad or you--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah I had my undergrad, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, and in history [at Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Oh I, yeah well I forget to mention that I had, I had been accepted to, at the end of my junior year to go to American University [Washington, D.C.] for a master's [degree] program in international affairs that was designed to give you your undergraduate degree and your master's at the same time, although I had already finished all my undergraduate credits.  And from getting my master's in international affairs, I was going into the [U.S.] Foreign Service.  That probably had a lot to do, I think it may had something to do with my uncle or something wanting to know what the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: And even the state department [U.S. Department of State] was very racist in terms you can count the African Americans on the, on your hand that were in the Foreign Service, you know.  But, I chose to go the business route for whatever reason.  I think that, that I came out of there, went in the corporate arena to work for Harold Geneen and ITT [ITT Corporation, White Plains, New York] and a couple of other things.
Story_ID: 475645
Speaker 1: Just to go back to during your time at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --highlights, coaching.
Speaker 2: Well, well okay I normally did one thing.  We were there two days in-Marriott suite housing.  I think this was even before I went there or the summer I went there.  Maybe it, well I can't remember.  It was around that time, but just before we got there was when Otis Redding's plane went down in the lake [Lake Monona].  You remember that and that young singing group.  We were there two days, I had a young son, wife was an educator and--
Speaker 1: Did she teach in Wisconsin also?
Speaker 2: Yes, she taught there a year and--
Speaker 1: What did she teach?
Speaker 2: Business ed, busi- business at the time.  She is now superintendent of the schools in New York City [New York, New York], in Mount Vernon, New York.  The mathematics and research building was bombed right across from the B [business] school, and a graduate student working on their dissertation was the days of the Weatherman [Weather Underground Organization] and SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], a little bit before your time.
Speaker 1: I know the, the weatherman--
Speaker 2: And there were three hot beds, Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], Wisconsin, and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and I do remember being--
Speaker 1: At Wisconsin, go ahead.
Speaker 2: And I do remember studying down in the basement of the law school [University of Wisconsin Law School, Madison, Wisconsin]--
Speaker 1: There's a, there's a, a preacher or a white guy, a priest who was in Wisconsin at the time who led a couple of marches or something.
Speaker 2: Listen, I remember pepper gas.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I remembers guys looking like these old storm troopers that I used to see you know and I'll either see in a movie filmed in Alabama were these vehicles with all this iron grating over it walking up the hill and interesting about Wisconsin and I remember, I mean we're down two floors in the basement of the law building, but the pepper gas gets into the system.  The interesting-est thing is Wisconsin had one of the highest per capita incomes of students anywhere in the country.  A lot of money up there but the students--the students would pull up in their limousines and wear dungarees and hold, you know that looked like rags to the rest of us, you know.  Beautiful campus, you know, the whole I, the whole fraternity, sorority, so, so it wasn't poor kids protesting for the reason you know about Dow Chemical [Dow Chemical Company] and the--(unclear)--.  You know, you gotta remember this is still around the Vietnam [Vietnam War] time.  And--
Speaker 1: I think it was called Black Monday or Black Tuesday (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, several times I remember it now them marching up the hill you know and things like that.  Oh yeah I remember that very clearly and here there are, about eight of us in the business school, blacks.  There was--
Speaker 1: Who were the other students?
Speaker 2: There were, there were two black students in the medical school.  There were--
Speaker 1: Can you call any names?
Speaker 2: Oh boy let's see John Higginbottom [ph.], Robert Hughes [ph.], Lemont Jones [ph.].  I gotta think a little bit more.
Story_ID: 475646
Speaker 1: Any of them, and do you know what happened to any of them?
Speaker 2: I think you know all of us went on to, to professional careers or one thing another.  On the loss, on, I don't know what happened to the guys that were in--'cause it was so few of us.  I don't know what happened to the guys who were going to med school.  There was only two blacks in the medical school, and there was two in the law school [University of Wisconsin Law School, Madison, Wisconsin], three in the law school.  I don't know what happened to those guys.
Speaker 1: But, I mean at the time you were at Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] was a good time to, for I mean African Americans to be at least--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --starting in Corporate America because you had the start of Black Enterprise magazine.
Speaker 2: Well, we had a very strong black, you know, it was a time when, when Kwanzaa just started, Ron Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga] was new you know.  People were naming names after Nkrumah Kwame [Kwame Nkrumah] you know, you know those things.  But, it was a railroad track that ran through town.  You know where the black folk were, lived, who lived in Madison [Wisconsin], the capital on the other side of the railroad track.  It was very clear, very clear.  Not even the Native Americans had any, had any say so.
Speaker 1: What about you as a college, as, as a coach and a member of the faculty?
Speaker 2: I had no problem, I had no, I had no problem (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You could live anywhere you wanted to.
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't a member of the faculty.  I was a student you know like other graduate students.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you a student but you were a coach?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a graduate and I counseled black athletes too, but on, on, it was a little different on the field, on the field.  Now, remember when I came out of high, college there weren't gonna, there wasn't no black quarterbacks.  There wasn't no black centers.  Center and a quarter back, none.  Herb Adderley, Elijah Pitts who played for, played for the Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh Steelers], I mean for Packers [Green Bay Packers] were quarterbacks in college.  There wasn't no black quarterbacks.  One, the white players and the professionals weren't gonna take no orders from a black, and the white quarterbacks weren't gonna take the ball from a black center.  Think about it.  You tell me, you point to me a black center in professional football in 1969 or '68 [1968] or '67 [1967] or a black quarterback, defensive backs, split-ends, a couple of linemen, a linemen, huh.  That's a little sports trivia.  See if you find that.  I remember when Bear Bryant didn't want a black in Alabama [University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] 'til he got his head whooped and then the story that comes out somebody, even Joe Namath was saying, "Well no, he really was not that kind of way."  Bear Bryant in the '60s [1960s] said wasn't no niggers gonna play for him when I was I college right.  He was just like at the University of, of Kentucky [University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky] what's the, Adolph Rupp, and you saw 'Glory Road.'  Until Adolph Rupp got whooped by these niggers from the, from the hood, right, then he went out and started getting some.  Matter of fact, he got one or something.  You know he died before they really, he didn't want, there were no blacks on his team when Kentucky played basketball.
Story_ID: 475647
Speaker 1: We're gonna start with Walter Mitty.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I guess my Walter Mitty, and this is, let me say this, the reason I think in the '60s [1960s] why we were going into Corporate America was as I said, was so very few of us in Corporate America.  We all grew up on 'Leave It To Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best' kind of mentality to some extent, and desired to be, to, to have that access to the fiftieth floor of the corporate arena, and you know again that's, we went to the B school and matter of fact I'm one of the charter members of the Black MBAs [National Black MBA Association].  That's when it started when I was in Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].  So, we want to do that and because up to then the traditional jobs where you either was minister, you were an undertaker, or you were a teacher.  And the reason I wasn't going into ministry because even here at my home church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] the more they pushed me toward it, the more I went the other way, all right.  My uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] was also gonna, was gonna be a minister at one time, but, so I went opposite, corporate, and to try to get that opportunity I, you studied, you knew there was racism, but you figured these doors were opening up.  D. Parke Gibson had written a book called, 'The 30, The 35 Million Dollar Negro,' [sic. 'The $30 Billion Negro,' D. Parke Gibson] at the time with the classic early marketing text in terms of segmentation, that you can segment the black community, either the black market.  There is a black market.  Matter of fact my master's thesis I remember very clearly was 'The Ghetto as a Marketing Segment' [ph.] and I did advertising research on it using some models from David Ogilvy who later on I went to work for.
Speaker 1: I did as well.
Speaker 2: You did, well I'm gonna tell you about what to talk about in this context.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and David had come out with a whole series of pieces, you know, using long, using long copy and so forth, you know his own style, no reverse type, anyway and I took ads, this is '70 [1970], yeah '71 [1971], '72 [1972] and the same ad that appeared in Ebony that appeared in Life, the exact same layout, but different models.  Black models here, white models here, the same ad.  You could find those back in those days, and I did a whole perception analysis and so forth and did a regression, you know all those things.  So, and I defined there was, there was, there were clear definable characteristics of the black market in terms of buying patterns, where they spent their money, how you--so it was an identifiable marketing segment according to marketing principles.  So, that was my master's thesis.  And since you brought that up, I went to work for ITT [ITT Corporation, White Plains, New York], which was probably the premier company at the time working in the office of the president.  Then I wound up working for Oglivy and Mather [New York, New York], some people I talked to and I'm the guy that worked on the Shake 'n Bake, "Can I help?" campaign; that was me.  And went on to, later on work, I worked on regular Maxwell House with Cora, the Wicked Witch of the West, Margaret Hamilton.
Speaker 1: Well there are very few black people in advertising today.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Back then you may have been the only one.
Speaker 2: Well UniWorld [UniWorld Group, Inc.] was the first company signing them, back in those with [HistoryMaker] Byron Lewis.
Story_ID: 475648
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean I'm talking about at Ogilvy [Ogilvy and Mather, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: No, at Ogilvy there was a guy, there was one other brother who I've seen in passing.  There were nobody in the creative side.  A guy named Reba Corva [ph.] was the creative director, Theo [ph.] was, was semi-retired in his little French villa.  See if I can remember the team.  A guy named Jock, Jock Elliott was the chair.  I worked for a guy named Dick Roman [Kenneth Roman].  I don't know if you ever heard of these guys.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Bill Phillips [William E. Phillips].  All right now you're really testing my memory.  So, I first went in working on instant Maxwell, regular Maxwell House coffee with Margaret Hamilton who was a fascinating lady who I talked about the days of uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] doing, doing 'Othello' [William Shakespeare] with Uta Hagen and you know 'cause she was from the theater you know, Margaret Hamilton, the wicked, Wicked Witch of the West, beautiful lady.  And I worked on Shake 'n Bake and left there, went to work for Lever Brothers [Lever Brothers Company] where I introduced Aim toothpaste; I'm the product manager.  And the other little story about it I'll tell you, I then went to Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] and went to work for a guy who I'd worked for at ITT [ITT Corporation, White Plains, New York] named Michel Bergerac, who became president of, of Revlon, and I started a black line called Polished Ambers and [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks and I kind of convinced the reps to hire this black woman as a model.  At that time, Lauren Hutton was the only one that had an exclusive contract, and this black model who we positioned as coming out of the, the, the boughs of the fatherland was really a very middle, kind middleclass woman, a very fine family and a neck that was, that clothes hang on her like they hang on a hanger, and her name was Iman.  And she became the spokesman for Polished Ambers, had an exclusive contract.  We did a lot of stuff where, a lot of things all over.  I, if I could ever find the pictures that Gordon had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let me just ask you this before we move on.  Why was it important to portray her as a poor woman as opposed to, just because they didn't want a well to do black woman?
Speaker 2: Well, I think you know, I think it was part of the marketing speak, you know.
Speaker 1: All right, she comes up from her bootstraps.
Speaker 2: She comes out of you know this African, God is rising out of the phoenix, you know,--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --right, you know, they, well you know the whole nine yards, and she marries Spencer Haywood you know all that stuff.  So, that's how it all, that's part of that.
Story_ID: 475649
Speaker 1: One thing you brought up that I wanna go back to is you talked about your uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] doing 'Othello' [William Shakespeare] with Uta Hagen.  Did you ever see--
Speaker 2: At the (unclear), right.
Speaker 1: Did you ever him perform on stage?
Speaker 2: I never saw him do 'Othello,' no.
Speaker 1: Anything?  Did you, I mean outside of the church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] did you see him perform, yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well, oh sure, sure, I mean, well  perform, put it this way, I've heard him do pieces of--because in his--I've never seen him do 'Othello,' but I've heard him do excerpts.  I've seen him do excerpts from 'Othello' you know those things.  I wasn't, I don't know whether, I, I gotta ask my cousin when the last time he did 'Othello.'  He may have done it in the '50s [1950s], I don't know, but he would often do excerpts from it, you know those kinds of pieces.  I've heard him, I've heard him speak you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 475650
Speaker 1: Flash forward to your, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I wanna get back to my Walter Mitty.  So, all those things being what they were, get so caught up in the corporate arena.  What I really wanted to do and until this day I thought about and I've got, I got close to it because I have a very close friend named Don Shirley.  We're very close for years, and I've always wanted to go behind the scenes of the theater.  Wasn't supposed, it wasn't, I, I discovered because maybe I was in business school.  It was not on the stage where it was.  It wasn't enough of us behind the scenes, the producers and so forth, you know.  That's where the bulk--and to this day I know one brother who works for the Shubert company [Shubert Organization, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Well he's probably the only one.
Speaker 2: That's right.  He works for the, that's right.  If you look at his name, you wouldn't know he was African American, but he is very much African American.  Knows who he is, you know, but I'm saying that's where I wanted to be.  Joe Papp [Joseph Papp] wouldn't let any of us in there, you know and so forth, and I never thought about, I said, "Maybe I could," my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] is of course one of the charter members of the, of the Broadway Hall of Fame.  You go down you see his name.  I didn't, I never tried that.  I wasn't so much a Hollywood person, but I wanted to be and I was so proud to see the sister [Shonda Rhimes] who is in charge of 'Grey's Anatomy,' you know.  That was just awesome for me, 'cause she is the first.  And I, I admired for years a close friend who I met through my uncle and through my, and through my grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson], [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, and I was at Ossie's funeral.  I did his Masonic funeral.  Ossie when he did 'Purlie Victorious' ['Purlie'] you know he produced it.  You know I, I could never imagine why more of us wouldn't really, after Spike Lee started putting his own money in because he believed in what he was doing, would really, and I mean there's some other people, John Singleton, you know, but the big guns.  You know, none of us had enough money like Mel Gibson, but he believed in 'The Passion for Christ' [sic. 'The Passion of the Christ'].  And Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] tried to do it with 'Color Purple' ['The Color Purple'], but I think the reaction to the Tonys [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] was not so much reaction to, which she was right, to 'Color Purple' as it was reaction to Oprah.  Who do you think you are?  You gonna come and break this, this the old, old school, old guard.
Speaker 1: It's the old boys club.
Speaker 2: All right, who do you think you are, I mean you know.  You're gonna come in here pour all this money in promotion and so forth and think that you can, oh no, we'll fix you.  We'll make sure you don't get the Tonys.  Yeah, she knew it.  It's still not open to us.  So, I'm saying it still exist.  We still don't control.  We still don't control, and until we get that way, and that's why I admire the, the independence of Sidney Poitier and a [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte who were proteges of my uncle and who people you should interview who will tell you if it had not been for him and that Sidney Poitier was black listed for standing for what he believed in and so was, so was Harry.  Harry and my uncle, you know so were very close.
Story_ID: 475651
Speaker 1: Where were you when your uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] died?
Speaker 2: I was working for Revlon [Revlon, Inc.], working for Revlon.
Speaker 1: Now he died, broke pretty much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: No, that's not true.  Well that's the, that's what people were led to believe.
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't broke.  He wasn't deranged.  He wasn't you know, no, no, none of those things.  That's a lie.  Now, remember I mentioned to you that when he was sick overseas they were trying to give him some kind of shock treatment to sterile his mind.
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought that was Malcolm X you were talking about.
Speaker 2: No, no that was my uncle.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah we have documentation of that, and so he was not well when he returned and went into retirement.  Matter of fact his first public appearance was at Lorraine Hansberry's funeral.  He spoke there when he came back 'cause you know he knew her very well.
Speaker 1: How many languages did he speak?
Speaker 2: Oh my God and dialects probably two dozen, when you took the dialects.  I mean he spoke the romance languages.  He spoke Chinese, fluent Chinese, Russian, German.  He spoke several dialects, African.  Well let me tell you he, there's a story and you can look in the archives there's a BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] film and, like you're doing to me now, interviewing him and he is being interviewed by BBC.  You know he sings, "La, da, da, da, da, da, da."  The guy says, "Well that sounds like" I think, don't quote me for sure, but he said, "that's sounds like Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]" or something.  I forget or was it Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven].  He said, "Yeah that's right it sounds like it, but you know what it is, it's an African chant."  So, you know what he, he was saying that a lot of what you thought was original, it has been proven that some Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] was really written, was African and it has been proven that some of the things here of Van Gogh [Vincent Van Gogh] you've seen inside the pyramids, outside, was African--so, so he was saying that music was just like Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte] went and raped the culture of, of Africa.  I would say you should read a book by Cheikh Diop, 'Barbarism and Civilization' [sic. 'Civilization or Barbarism: An Authentic Anthropology,' Cheikh Anta Diop].  You know Diop is a, is a West African Sengalese historian, anthropologist, so, brilliant book.  I'll even let you borrow a copy if you don't have it.  But, I'm saying is that, so he were saying about the tombs and the music and so forth, he was, and that it was really taken from them and then, and displayed there, so, so what I'm saying is that, so he talks about that, but he so, he had a brilliant mind and so he was not the Paul Robeson of thirty years ago.  You gotta understand.
Speaker 1: I understand that.
Speaker 2: The, the magnificence of his intellect, so no he was not himself, all right.
Speaker 1: Did it come as a shock to you that he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, he was, but not only that but he was much older.
Speaker 1: Yeah of course.
Story_ID: 475652
Speaker 1: So, you're at Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] when he [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] passed away that means you'd left Ogilvy [Ogilvy and Mather, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean so you left Ogilvy to go to Revlon?
Speaker 2: There's been some time.  Yeah, I also served some time--you need to know this, as group project manager for Seagram's [Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc.].  I'll never forget how people say, "How could you work for Seagram's and be a part of the church?"  And Joseph Bronfman [sic. Joseph E. Seagram] who got their money the same way the Kennedys got theirs, all right you know through the prohibition and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now who is, say that name again.
Speaker 2: Bronfman.
Speaker 1: Bronfman.
Speaker 2: You ever heard of the Bronfman family?  Oh, prob--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Seagram's, Seagram's.
Speaker 2: Seagram's okay.
Speaker 1: Seagram's.  They're one of the companies I know who are not only wholesales, but they are, are, are (cough) distillers and importers, were very much involved in World Jewish Congress alliance and so forth, very much.  And when they were having the Ethiopian famine, excuse, me and National Council of Churches [National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA] wanted to get some executives to come manage some of the programs and Bronfman [Samuel Bronfman] made me on loan, went on loan to the National Council of Churches and I coordinated all the Ethiopian relief before in Africa and that got me into, back to where I really wanted when we talked about going in foreign service, but that got me involved in development and so forth.  And from there I went to work for Bush H [President George Herbert Walker Bush] and Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] running the [U.S.] African Development Foundation.
Speaker 2: So, but before you'd gone I mean that, that's pretty recent.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I mean in between there I did some more schooling, but that's how the whole education, you know, that's why, that's how I left Corporate America, then to turn, return back to Corporate America once I finished working for Bill Clinton.
Story_ID: 475653
Speaker 1: But, I want to talk about some of your achievements during your, your time in Corporate America because you took like one of those foundations, one of the funds and you managed a really large--
Speaker 2: Well, that was, the estate of council churches, the African Council of Churches of Christ [National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA] was represented I think twenty-one Protestant denominations.  I was responsible for all the African, specifically for the international disaster relief.  Whenever there was a disaster somewhere in the world outside the continental states, I was responsible for coordinating, raising the funds and coordinating the relief efforts from the Protestant church community, so that's probably, probably what you see there.
Speaker 1: So that was a private organization?
Speaker 2: NGO, non-governmental.  From there I also interacted with Oxfam [Oxfam America Inc.] out of the UN, UNDP, United Nations Development Programme.  I worked with the World Council Churches [World Council of Churches], the indigenous councils of churches in various countries throughout the world.
Speaker 1: So working for Seagram's [Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc.] actually got you to doing basically what you wanted to do.
Speaker 2: I was on loan and never went back.
Speaker 1: You were on loan and you never went back.
Speaker 2: Never went back.
Speaker 1: So, that you started as an African specialist or working in Ethiopia.
Speaker 2: No I was, no, yeah well I was a good manager, and I should say this I was representing my denomination on the governing board of the National Council of Churches, so I had a relationship.
Speaker 1: So, you were representing the A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Zion.  I was one of the persons--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I had a relationship with National Council of Churches and again the kind of person the Bronfmans were and how they ran their corporation.  So, I was on leave from them, you know, doing the work with the council and I never went back, never went back.
Story_ID: 475654
Speaker 1: So you also became involved--how did you get on the radar of, of George H [President George Herbert Walker Bush]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) How did that happen?  I was a political activist, too.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And by that, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I ran for mayor in Mount Vernon [New York], very much involved.  I can't remember.  I didn't, we didn't even talk about that side.  I came, grew up in Harlem [New York, New York] under Rockefeller [Nelson Rockefeller], Jacob Javits [Jacob K. Javits], Louis Lef- Louis Lef- Louis Lefkowitz [Louis J. Lefkowitz].
Speaker 1: Then you know Dr. Toote, [HistoryMaker] Gloria Toote?
Speaker 2: Sure, Gloria Toote and I are good friends.  I remember when she was, she was part of the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration.  I was a White House Fellow on the Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] administration, and what happened was we were all together and I was, of course I'm a little younger than her, and, but if you knew anything about New York politics and Nelson Rockefeller so that's, that was New York, you know Lindsay [John Lindsay] and so forth.  So I wasn't a Democratic no, but I called myself, I was a Rockefeller Republican and that's how all that got into it and so what happen--
Speaker 1: Who were the other Rockefeller Republicans that were black at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh gee, Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons], you mentioned Gloria Toote, Art Fletcher [HistoryMaker Arthur Fletcher] who, who, who, who, who developed the Pittsburgh Plan [sic. Philadelphia Plan], affirmative action, another brother just passed away. He when I left, he was the, he went over, he went to the administration, was the AID [United States Agency for International Development] representative for, ran the African bureau [Bureau of African Affairs].  I have to think about some other people as I think about him.  But, those are the ones that come, I mean that you would know.  I could name people that you, you would not know, but I'm saying those are the names that come right out, talk about that.  Now, I was younger than some of them.  I think, I think Rich and I--
Speaker 1: You were one of the youngest.
Speaker 2: I think Rich and I are about--I was an advance man for, for Nelson Rockefeller.  Of course I'm much younger than Gloria.
Speaker 1: You were a what?
Speaker 2: Advance man.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Advance person goes before the per-, the actual candidate or the elected officer comes and make sure everything is, is ready and tight, prepped, you know so when he comes in (makes sound) (gesture).
Story_ID: 475655
Speaker 1: What was he, what was your, how would you describe him as a person (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller] was here.  Matter fact I got a picture in my office he and I, and we did a major concert.
Speaker 1: How would you describe him as a person in relation to the black community?
Speaker 2: Great guy, I mean loved wonderful, I mean he put that state office building down there.  I never knew his father [John D. Rockefeller, Jr.], but I read stories about his father.  Was, was it his father, or his grandfather [John D. Rockefeller, Sr.].  Maybe is, maybe, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Was he around when they named the street [8th Avenue], Frederick Douglass Boulevard [New York, New York]?  Was he involved in that?
Speaker 2: Rockefeller was dead.
Speaker 1: Was that, okay.
Speaker 2: I think he was dead prior to that.
Speaker 1: But, he was involved in putting Adam Clayton Powell building, the state office building [Harlem State Office Building; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, he was, that was him.
Speaker 1: Okay that was him.
Speaker 2: That was him, that was him when he was governor.  You know he built that whole campus up there too.  Rockefeller was a good guy, you know, real good guy, nice guy, he and Happy.  His wife's name was Happy [Margaretta Fitler Murphy Rockefeller].  So, that part, I mean that's how, that, that's how that intro and--
Speaker 1: Well, just tell me one story about you and Dr. Toote [HistoryMaker Gloria Toote]. How did you know her?  How did your paths cross?
Speaker 2: Oh gee I can't remember exact.  We organized a New York State conference of black Republicans [Black Voters for Reagan/Bush in '84], and Gloria went on to work as the assistant secretary of HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], and I'm trying hit me, was Coleman [ph.] head of HUD then.  I can't think of who was head of HUD.  Well when I was there it was Sam Pierce [Samuel R. Pierce, Jr.].  I can't think of who it was okay, but anyway that's how I met her in Harlem [New York, New York], in Harlem, in Harlem.
Speaker 1: Were there many black Republicans in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.  They were just as comfortable with black Democrats as they were with each other.  But you gotta remember it was, Rock- when Rockefeller was governor--did Rockefeller follow Averell Harriman [W. Averell Harriman] I'm trying to think.  Yes, I think Hugh Carey followed Nelson Rockefeller.  No, no, no he didn't 'cause Rockefeller became, became vice president and the mayor, the lieutenant governor became, who was from Yonkers [New York].  It slips my mind who he is now, then I think it was Hugh Carey.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember who the mayor was at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Wagner [Robert F. Wagner, Jr.] was it?
Speaker 2: No, Wagner was before, let's see, Wagner was when I was, when I was in elementary and junior high school, Wagner.  I believe it--
Speaker 1: La Guardia [Fiorello H. La Guardia] was after him.
Speaker 2: La Guardia come on I'm not that age.  La Guardia was way before.
Speaker 1: He was before him, okay I'm going in the reverse then.  I should be going back this way.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, then it was probably Koch [Ed Koch] right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, Lindsay [John Lindsay], Lindsay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Abe Beame [Abraham Beame].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Beame came after Lindsay, right.  Beame came after Lindsay, and I think Lindsay followed Wagner 'cause Lindsay had all the, all the reforms that you see with housing and so forth.  You know John Lindsay, he had been congressman.  Yeah that's right.  Then Abe Beame followed him and Koch followed, followed Abe Beame.
Speaker 1: How--
Speaker 2: 'Cause Abe Beame had been comptroller.
Speaker 1: How involved were you in local politics?
Speaker 2: Not much 'cause I was, you know, school, I was going go to school and everything,--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know and I think Rockefeller happened by mistake, the things I was doing for him.  I had a lot, 'cause he had a very close relationship even with the church.  What I did with Rockefeller I had just come out, you know, I was out of college or was I in college, I can't remember exactly.  So, but when I got involved in the organization I was really, I was in the workplace.
Story_ID: 475656
Speaker 1: Okay, so the last thing we'll talk about today.  I don't know where it fits in chronologically, but this is what we'll end with 'cause we have seven minutes, is running for mayor of Mount Vernon [New York], and what year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, seventy, maybe '76 [1976], I gotta, I gotta get a point in time and remember.  I moved to Mount Vernon in '72 [1972], '76 [1976].  It may have been '76 [1976], '77 [1977], something like that.
Speaker 1: Did you know Dr. George Branch [HistoryMaker Dr. George Clayton Branche, Jr.] in, in Mount Vernon?
Speaker 2: No, it doesn't hit me.
Speaker 1: Okay?  So in the seven, '76 [1976]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I ran, yeah I was the first--
Speaker 1: African American (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) African American in the State of New York to be nominated by a major party.  I had the Republican--
Speaker 1: And were you nominated as a Republican or Democrat?
Speaker 2: Republican and liberal.
Speaker 1: Republican and liberal.
Speaker 2: And liberalized.
Speaker 1: So you were on--
Speaker 2: Running against an incumbent.
Speaker 1: And who was he?
Speaker 2: Repub- and matter of fact his name was Tom, Tom Shaw.  The--Mount Vernon had been a Republican town.  Westchester [Westchester County, New York] was so you can imagine why it was.  And the, the mayor had when I moved there his name was August Petrillo had died and at the time the comptroller was Republican and then Shaw had run against, yeah he ran, he was already incumbent two terms then, I think.  And I ran, he beat me two to one, but I registered five thousand new voters, and he died six months later.  Matter a fact I was in the seminary when I ran.  I was a seminary student [at Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So we didn't even talk about, well we'll pick that up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think we'll pick that up--
Speaker 1: --that's what we'll pick with you--
Speaker 2: --and I did a whole piece on ethics and politics and then that's when I first, when I first met, yes I was in seminary when I first met Desmond Tutu, 'cause I was also in the seminary working for the National Council of Churches [National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA], and I met Desmond Tutu.  I say--
Speaker 1: Well his, yeah.
Speaker 2: --as a, as a person working in relief and Allan Boesak who was also a protege of Desmond Tutu and then took a course on religion and politics with Desmond Tutu at the seminary.  We'll talk about that.
Story_ID: 475657
Speaker 1: Would you mind giving us a little bit of history of the A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] church?
Speaker 2: The A.M.E. Zion church was officially organized in 1796 in, in New York City [New York, New York] out of the, the old Methodist Episcopal church, which is now called the United Methodist church.  Methodist was founded by John Wesley here in the United States.  And matter of fact we came out of the John Street Church [John Street United Methodist Church, New York, New York], which still exists on John Street located in the Wall Street area of New York.  If you go to visit the John Street Church now you'll see the balconies where the colored people had to stay, where they could not come down stairs and worship in a collective manner with their white brethren or sisters, where they could not enjoy the sacraments on the same Sunday.  So, in fact, we moved out of there out of a sense of not of frustration, a sense of segregation.  How could you believe in a faith practice of Christianity and be segregated on Sundays?  Along those same lines, it's ironic that it was in 1796 because at that time slavery still existed in New York State.  Matter of fact it wasn't, slavery did not, was not abolished until around 1820 to '25 [1825], something like that.  So, you would have these free coloreds decided to go out and start to role of a faith-based community in the sense that they still were Methodist.  In fact, that was the first, site of the first location on Church [Street] and Leonard Street, which is in the Wall Street area and you've heard most recently about the African Burial Ground.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's right around the corner from the African Burial Ground.  So, it stands to reason that most of the persons that are buried in the African Burial Ground that they were able to identify artifacts came from our faith-based community.  It's interesting to note that there was a young lady who was a member of our church she and her sister and her name was Isabella [Isabella Baumfree], and in service one day she changed her name to Sojourner Truth.  It's ironic that the Freedom Journal [sic. Freedom's Journal] published by John Russwurm [John Brown Russwurm] was the first magazine for, I'm gonna say African Americans because they didn't say it then, but for people of color in our basement and James Varick was one of the editors.  It's ironic that there was this slave who escaped from the South, stayed in our basement for about four, four to five weeks became a preacher at the A.M.E. Zion church, went on to Rochester, New York in the basement of one of our sister churches, Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church [Rochester, New York] published in North Star [The North Star], his name was Fred Douglass [Frederick Douglass].  Matter of fact here in our location the pulpit that Fred Douglass preached from is still here.  And it's ironic that Sojourner Truth on one end, member of our community, Fred Douglass on the other end, a member of our community, had one of the most interesting and, I wouldn't say intense, but wonderful discussions about women's suffrage.  And of course you remember Sojourner's famous response to Fred Douglass, "Ain't I a woman?"  Madam C.J. Walker, Paul Robeson, all members, but there are so many other things.  There were slaves that were escaping, fugitive slaves that would stay in our church like you hear about the immigration today, and the slave catchers would come into our service and we would take up an offering to pay for their freedom.
Story_ID: 475658
Speaker 1: So, as you talk about the Underground Railroad, as you talk about the movement of African American people for the struggle of freedom and justice, not just the A.M.E. Zion church, but Mother Zion [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] in particular, the mother church was very much involved in that.  As you look at the history of New York [New York] and as we move further north, we were in Central Park at a place called Seneca Village [New York, New York], which was one of the locations of people of color just off 87th Street in Central Park West.  In fact, we were the first entity that they instituted eminent domain against, came and desecrated our cemeteries, paid us undervalued for the property, and we're working on, we're working on a discussion in a paper that will explain that thoroughly, even more thoroughly than it was in the New-York Historical Society [New York, New York] slave exhibit about a year and a half ago.  We may ask for reparations, we may not.  We're gonna make sure the ground is, is understood that it's sacred ground because there're burials there.  But, as you go through the, the history of our ch- domination, now we're on five continents and over 2 million members.  When you talk about Washington, D.C. and the desegregation of Union Station, we were there.  You talk about NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Alexander Walters, one of the pastors of this church was one of the founders along with Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and Walter White with the Niagara Movement, which became the NAACP.  Stephen Gill Spottswood, one of our bishops was the chairman of the NAACP during those very critical years of the Civil Rights Movement.  When you go down to North Carolina and talk about, I mean excuse me, Alabama and talk about the Montgomery Boys Club--Boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott], you can't help but talk about Solomon Snowden Seay [Solomon Snowden Seay, Sr.] who, you know it really was not Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] it was about some of those old time preachers that were involved and young Martin was, was kind of a newcomer, fresh face, that they all could agree on.  But, you know we can talk about it over and over again.  So, we have been called through the years what we call now is Freedom Church [African Methodist Episcopal Zion conference].  We're the mother church of this denomination.  We have buried in our current building the first bishop, James Varick.  He is buried here, and we've been in our current locations since 1910.  So in fact, we are the oldest African American entity, Mother Zion is, in the State of New York, not just church, but entity.
Story_ID: 475659
Speaker 1: As a child, did you know that you would become the head of A.M.E. Zion?
Speaker 2: Mother A.M.E. Zion [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --would I become the pastor?  Furthest thing from my mind.  Furthest thing from my mind.
Speaker 1: So, initially well you were in business, how did your segue from business and your foreign--I know that you weren't a foreign diplomat, but you definitely engaged in--
Speaker 2: Yes and no I was, I was, yes I was in a diplomat service.  I wasn't a counselor officer, but we say the Lord works in mysteries ways--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that's probably the best way to say it.  I think the most important thing is that the question the destiny of where the Lord takes you.  He takes us all on different routes, different points in time in our life.  He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipotent, so he knows what he has for you.  You may not know, but he knows.  So wherever he takes you, that's where you're supposed to be, so I do believe my initial thrust out of undergraduate school [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] was to go into the [U.S.] Foreign Service.  Two things stopped me, one playing with the Dallas Cowboys.  Secondly, I had a full fellowship to the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] through which now it's called Consortium for Graduate Study in Business for blacks [Consortium for Graduate Study in Business for Negroes; Consortium for Graduate Study in Management] back then.  Now it's, it's, these are generic terms.  And at that time, you could probably count the people of African American descent on your hands in the top three, four business schools.
Story_ID: 475660
Speaker 1: Is there anyone at Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] with you that we might know or that we might, that we should know?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  There is a person not of, not of color that you, that you may not know, but one of the things I did in Wisconsin was the coach freshmen football.  It was a young man from up near Lake Superior sort of northern part who came in wanted to play, wanted to play a tackle.  He was very slow, very strong, very committed.  I trained him how to play center.  He left, played, he started with Wisconsin for four years, I mean three years on varsity, went on to the Pittsburgh Steelers and was a perennial All-Pro, just died two years ago.  His name was Mike Webster.  Those guys--I think I played pro-ball with Calvin Hill and some other guys, but at Wisconsin there are those who of us who went through the system and that was the time when the Weathermen [Weather Underground Organization], the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], were on the campus.  Matter of fact, we weren't there two days before they bombed the mathematics and research building where a graduate student was killed.  It was the height of the Vietnam War, so you know what was going on, and Wisconsin was a major research center.  So, but there were very few people of color in, in Madison, Wisconsin, very few, very few.  So, anyway, that stopped me and then from there I got kind of swapped up into the whole corporate culture, the kid from Harlem [New York, New York] going to college in the South, historically black college [HBCU].  You know going to work for Harold Geneen at ITT [ITT Corporation, White Plains, New York], which was the number one managed corporation in the world, you know.  I kind of think that they didn't take me for my color, but I think more so because of you know some academics and some other things.
Story_ID: 475661
Speaker 1: Eventually were you named by George H. Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] to head the [U.S.] African Development Foundation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And were you working in Corporate America when that happened and--
Speaker 2: Yes I was.  Ironically--
Speaker 1: --did you return to Corporate America?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well not, yes I did return.  Ironically I was on leave from Seagram's [Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc.] where I was a group project manager and I was handling the Ethiopian drought for the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA [NCC] raised over $200 million for the drought in Ethiopia.  I was in charge of international disaster response, and then from there when he was elected I was approached about coming to the fou- coming to Washington [D.C.].  This particular agency was only maybe eight years, nine years old at the time and it, and it was responsible for all the foreign aid from our country to indigenous, indigenous NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and PVOs [private voluntary organizations] and along with microenterprise.  When I went there, we had relationships in about ten countries.  When I left, it was twenty-five, twenty-six countries.  Helped supervise the elections in South Africa.  I've been to every country on the continent except for maybe three.
Speaker 1: Wow and what was, what was the--
Speaker 2: And I stayed through the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration.
Story_ID: 475662
Speaker 1: That was actually going to be my next question.  What was the most--you know, when people are hearing you discuss your work in Africa, why is it important to do diplomatic work in Africa?  Why is it important to provide people with the resources that they need to support their own infrastructures?
Speaker 2: One of thing--even going back I wasn't that much interested in government.  Government is government and you know how intertwined not the (unclear) of government, but the vastness and the bureaucracy of government, public service may not be always a place where you can deliver service.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Public doesn't necessarily--to me I think it's more so about the structure.  I mean even when I was there Vice President Gore [Al Gore] had this program of, of reach--limiting paper, trying to cut back on what it takes to get a job done or a program implemented or so.  You know all the cost efficiency.  You never do it because we created, we created what we did not want developing countries to have.  If you look at the net per capita numbers of persons in the public sector, and I'm talking about government municipal service compared to population, it's overwhelming.  But we say the same things to developing indigenous government economies we say to the Nubians or we say to the Ghanaians you got too many people working for a government and not people enough in private sector.  You have too much, you own too much busi-, too, you own too much of the economy.  We need to privatize more of that, you know things like that, they say to them, but they don't look at our own selves.  So, but this was an opportunity to make a difference.  That's why I chose [to work for the U.S. African Development Foundation] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how did you do that?  How did you get around some of that red tape that you recognize?
Speaker 2: Well because we had a different mandate than state department [U.S. Department of State].  Our mandate was not so much always dictated by foreign policy, but yes it was we still had to be respectful of, of our relationships.  We, we did not need approval from the ambassador to some of the things that we did, but we were trying to fund and develop indigenous entities to be self-sustaining.  It wasn't just giving money for a water project, but how could that project be self-sustaining on a microeconomic basis by which it can sustain life and create jobs within that community.  How can we do kinds of housing projects that will build infrastructure and create jobs and so forth?  How can we do sustainable development?  How can we do--develop organic energy sources, resources and things like that?
Story_ID: 475663
Speaker 1: And I think that, the next question you'll probably ask me is what I think is the greatest achievement, or my highlight [at the U.S. African Development Foundation].  I knew that was coming.  I, you know ironically it's--let me tell you two phenomenon, one phenomenon first that really came to amaze me, what I should have known.  It made me think back about who we are.  When during the elections, first elections in South Africa, what we noticed is that, I mean people were in lines I mean miles, old folk, young folk, I mean of age you know sitting, hot sun--
Speaker 2: To have an opportunity to vote (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To vote, vote.  People who had never voted in their lifetime.  I mean it's an awesome scene, an awesome experience.  Even myself even having experienced some of the periphery of the Civil Rights Movement.  This was just a moving experience.  But, then in talking with President Mandela [Nelson Mandela] and he and my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] corresponded for years, and that was a highlight because of their relationship and how he spoke out about his incarceration, my uncle did, when it first happened, that people expected that with the right to vote and equality, prosperity is immediate.  Education--the availability of education is immediate, that they go hand in hand. But they see there's still racism, both economic and ethnic racism, and even though that in fact they had the freedom of movement, the economy was still controlled by the old guard.  You know and see we think that because you vote you can be free, but that doesn't happen overnight.  So, that kind of opens up your eyes as to what, think--where we are now because some of our young people think it's instant, it's instant, and that's probably what I think now of the false bottom kind of perspective that certain industries, as music and, and basketball create for our young people a false bottom of security that you can have instant prosperity and wealth and notoriety by going into this new music genre or becoming a great basketball player.
Story_ID: 475664
Speaker 1: When you say false bottom can you just explain what that means (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because it has no, it has no, it has no substance, you know it has no substance, nothing--
Speaker 1: Um-hm. There's nothing really there to hold you.
Speaker 2: --really to hold it together that is superficial, artificial, and even to the extent that the right to vote is artificial and if the people are not together and have a mindset.  We have taken that for granted here in this country now we as a people.  It has become artificial and manipulative for people of color.  You know if you look at what is taking place even some of our leadership has taken its, our own people for granted and manipulated them the same way that the, the slave masters and the colonists have done and do.  See, we're still a colony, we're still colonized, but we don't, we sometimes, you know colo-, you know to be colonized don't have to be a white and a black, right you know what I'm saying, so, so what happens is we have a generation that has no freedom of mind, and you know if you don't have freedom of mind you're still slaved.  You, when you see our, our celebration outside on the poster you'll understand what I'm saying.  So, so we have that, they've taken this false sense of, of prosperity, which is not wealth.  Somebody said I think it was, what was the comedian [Chris Rock], I can't think of his name he said well you know, it will come to me in a minute, he said that, "Shaq is rich, but the guy who signs his check is wealthy."
Story_ID: 475665
Speaker 1: We were talking about your greatest achievement [at the U.S. African Development Foundation].
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, so anyway I, I mean I bring that all, I bring that full circle--
Speaker 1: And you describing these phenomena.
Speaker 2: --because I think it's all related.  Achievement sometimes, you look at personal achievement, sometimes achievement is open up your mind and understand who you are and where you are and where you're going.  You'll understand that more too when I get back to where we are now.  Meeting Dr. Mandela [Nelson Mandela]--the other thing was meeting Julius Nyerere.  I had meet--spent many hours with then retired President Nyerere of Tanzania.  He was one of the last charismatic leaders of, of course I met president of, of the Namibia, but he's do, he's do generation, but I'm saying Julius Nyerere came along with Kenyatta [Jomo Kenyatta], you know and, you know and, and, and to meet with him and talk about him and his idea of government and of people was awesome.  He too and my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson] were very close, and as a youngster when my uncle couldn't, couldn't, limited, limited movement they took his passport and you know I met a lot of his--I didn't know who they were, but I was in their presence and later on we talked about it.  So, that to me was a great highlight.  But, I could tell you about the projects and the things I did with UNESCO [United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture] and with UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] and things we did to alleviate hunger and so forth, but I think sometimes is that I, I never became a benevolent despot or a Connecticut Yankee.  You know I was very, I became more focused to who I am and what my task was to be.  So, it was a great part of my life, never will forget it.  I go back, I'm in Africa at least twice a year.  I'm supposed to go next month, but I think there's some things here that gonna prevent me from going, but I'll get over there.
Speaker 1: So, did you want to name a greatest achievement?
Speaker 2: Well, well, I think it's, no, I think it's a, I think it, if it's anything it's probably a cleansing of the mind.  I think that's--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --to me, that's, I mean I could give you material things, but I don't think that's, that's the important.  I think I accomplished much.  I think I set a precedent and articulate the mission, the vision, opened up a lot of doors and created a lot of opportunities and it happen to be at the time when, again when South Africa was gaining, when, yes South Africans, yeah real, real South Africans gained their independence, it was awesome, and to be there on the founding of the Namibia.  You know, I mean, it was just marvelous.
Story_ID: 475666
Speaker 1: So, how did you come away from that experience?  How long were you there [U.S. African Development Foundation], and did you go back into corporate work after you finished working
Speaker 2: Well, yes I did.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in Africa, I mean clearly you haven't finished working in Africa, but during that particular phase?
Speaker 2: Well, interesting--
Speaker 1: Did you come back and go back into business?
Speaker 2: --interesting--yes I did.  Politics is politics.  Inside the beltway it's 22, 20, 22 hours.  Your life is not yours.  By law, I think my executive assistant had to keep my diary every, write down every half an hour what I was doing or who was there.  You know higher up you go you know like the secretaries, cabinet office is like every 15 minutes, you know.  That's when you hear [U.S.] Congress petitioning and, "Wanna see your, your records and your minutes."  They know it's kept.  That's how they get that.  I think that it gets to a point where you wonder about the diminishing return on the bureaucratic side and the agendas, how they switch and so forth.  I, I was able to convince Jesse Helms to give us, to fund more money into this department, which was not an easy task.  I probably had some problems with the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] that you would not think about funding this agency to do work in Arica.  You know, we won't go into that on film, but I think that it was--you know after ten years I mean you just really get--and I had an opportunity, strangely enough, to go to somewhere that I turned down many years ago as a job and to go work in a telephone company, Bell Atlantic [Bell Atlantic Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], NYNEX [NYNEX Corporation]--I was a telephone brat.  Mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] worked there for forty years, single parent, you know those things.  When I came out of getting my M.B.A. [at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], they offered me a great job.  I said no, I'm going over here.  So here I come after all these years back to the telephone company, and after the first year or two was able to still trying to see where I wanted to be.  I'll tell you how it comes full circle.  I became responsible for the multi, multicultural business throughout the entire corporation, that's African American, Latin, Hispanic, Asian, Asian has many groups, Vietnamese and so forth, gay and lesbian, handicap, physically challenged and so forth, and I also had a small business in advertising and so forth.  So, I got in the position where I was able to again make a difference in how you market to these particular groups and be supportive of that market place.  At the same time I had to continue to demonstrate that this was a viable marketing opportunity.  Many years before that when I did my M.B.A. thesis it was called, 'The Ghetto as a Marketing Segment' [ph.] because business changed and it was a growing new, areas of opportunity.
Story_ID: 475667
Speaker 1: But I (unclear) worked for a guy who asked me to come, we became very good friends, he became president of the Retail Markets Group [of Verizon Communications, Inc.], went on to become president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  They didn't really understand him and what he was trying to do, create branding images for, take the NAACP to a level where it had not been or where it was and needed to go back in today's market.  That was [HistoryMaker] Bruce Gordon.  Ironically it shows you how deja vu is, Bruce grew up in Camden, New Jersey where my uncle had a barbershop and my uncle cut Bruce's hair.  Bruce is a couple years older than me, but we tend to find, find out that somewhere we might have crossed paths.  We talked about Jersey Joe Walcott that came out of Camden.  He was a heavy weight fighter in case you didn't know, but there was a lot of commonalities, again how God brings you circle, full circle.  So, I was able to make a difference and also to create new entrees because one of the things I was able to do is to help minority businesses, especially small businesses become, there are small fish but be a big fish in a big pond to the use of telecommunications and technology.  It was on, we were on the precipice at that time of broadband you know and things like that and showed them how to do their business, how they could be competitive, and so that was very helpful, very helpful.  Great times, great times.  Still active politically.  Went through several marriages, got the opportunity to get a parachute and jump out and--
Speaker 2: Where did you jump from?
Speaker 1: From, no I jumped out of, from, from, then became Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.] when I said golden parachute (laughter).
Speaker 2: I see, yeah.
Story_ID: 475668
Speaker 1: You started working for the governor.
Speaker 2: Working for the governor, I did some--
Speaker 1: Which governor and what were you doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pataki [George Pataki].  I did some licensing, some things with MTA [Metropolitan Transportation Authority], yeah, it wasn't much of anything.  And oh all this time, I didn't even tell you I was still involved in the church.
Speaker 1: Well I was gonna ask.
Speaker 2: I had been presiding elder in Washington, D.C. I had twenty-four churches under me in Washington.
Speaker 1: And what was your, could you just repeat that.  We missed your, your title.
Speaker 2: Presiding elder, presiding elder.  In an A.M.--in the, in the Methodist tradition you have a bishop, a presiding elder, then a pastor, then of course there are lower levels of ministry entry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a presiding elder, just between the bishop and the pastor, and I had supervision of twenty-four churches.
Speaker 1: So throughout your career you've been active in the church--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and it's my understanding that you've basically served on every position that's available.
Speaker 2: Except for a bishop.
Speaker 1: Except for bishop?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 475669
Speaker 1: So let's talk about how you became the head of the A.M.E. Zion, Mother A.M.E. Zion [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So take us back a little bit because we know that there are some things that happened beforehand.
Speaker 2: Excellent.  I grew up here.  I was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because my mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] was in Philadelphia at the time visiting and, but I grew up right here, raised.  I'm a guess you call a retread PK.  PK is a preacher's kid.  What I mean by retread.  In fact, my [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] was my fatherly influence, but kind of raised me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I'm a PK, you know, by that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's a PK, I think that's a fair assessment.
Speaker 2: That's kind of pretty close, right, and I lived in the parsonage right next door to the church.  So I grew up here, so this very room was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, this is right next door to where we are now--
Speaker 2: That's right, well--
Speaker 1: --because it's been here since 1910.
Speaker 2: Well actually we were on 136th Street in 1910, and in 1923 we built this building--
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: --and in 1973 we tore down the old building and built that community center.  The old church that we built, that we moved out of for worship became the community center, you know, in 1923.  Matter of fact the architect on this building it was one of only sixty certified architects of color in the country in 1921, '22 [1922], and so this--he, he was the one--this building is a marvelous structure in terms of how it's laid out.  But, this is the same room where a lot of things have happened, but, I grew up next door.  The parsonage is not, was torn down when we built that in '73 [1973] 'cause they needed more space, but grew there, matter of fact that's the same place where my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle] came to stay with us for a great length of time during his what do you call, what's the word for, he was, yes he was exiled because he couldn't move.
Speaker 1: Why don't you use the name of your uncle just for future watch, future viewers who might not have watched the tape from the beginning perhaps.
Speaker 2: Okay, Paul Robeson.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: And his, and his brother is Ben Robeson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was the pastor here.  And if you read his, my uncle's autobiography, 'Here I Stand' [Paul Robeson with Lloyd L. Brown] he speaks about that.  Matter of fact our fam--
Speaker 1: His father is your grandfather [sic. great-grandfather, William Drew Robeson]?
Speaker 2: That's right and--
Speaker 1: Who was the pastor of the church at the time when you were being raised?
Speaker 2: The pastor, he was pastor here for twenty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Fantastic.
Story_ID: 475670
Speaker 1: My mother [Bennie Robeson Smith] was three years old when he [Smith's maternal grandfather, Benjamin Congleton Robeson] came over here in 1934, '34 [1934] or '32 [1932] okay.  This, on this as a part of family our family on my grandfather's mother's side, my great-great-great-grandfather his name was Cyrus Bustill.  Cyrus Bustill was one of the persons who Prince Hall recruited to go and work in the Cont- to fight in the Continental Army.  Prince Hall is the founder of Prince Hall Masonry [Prince Hall Freemasonry], which is the oldest African American entity founded two years before the Declaration of Independence, of which I happen to be the deputy grand master for the State of New York.  But anyway, and Prince Hall convinced [President] George Washington to let colored--pre-coloreds at the time, fight in the army.  Continental Congress just after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, you know, a couple, several months later, said they didn't want any niggers, I will say it just like that, I know the N word is not good anymore, they didn't want them in the Continental Army, right this, but Prince Hall was the first one to make it happen.  So, my great-great-grandfather became a cook, nothing new in the [U.S.] Armed Forces until Truman [President Harry S. Truman], right.  They were cooks, they cleaned for us and did nothing else.  Ironically my great-grandfather, Cyrus Bustill, he and Richard Allen and Absalom Jones, Richard Allen was the founder of the A.M.E. Church out of Mother Bethel [Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in seventeen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: --seventeen eighty-seven [1787] in Philadelphia.  Absalom Jones was the first Episcopalian priest, and remember John Wesley was always Episcopalian, although he was the founder of Methodism.  First African American Episcopalian.  They founded the first Prince Hall lodge [African Lodge No. 1].  But anyway I'm saying that's one side of the family.  The other side of the family on my grandfather's father's side [Smith's maternal great-grandfather, William Drew Robeson], my uncle's father of course, comes out of Robeson County in North Carolina where my great-grandfather was a slave, and we traced our lineage back to, to Nigeria.  So, that's how kind of we come, that's how we are from where we are.
Story_ID: 475671
Speaker 1: So, I was raised here--
Speaker 2: On 136th Street in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right and I say that not to be pretentious because both my [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] and my uncle [Smith's maternal great uncle, Paul Robeson], and we had some like eight or nine thousand members [at Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York].  This is in the '50s [1950s].  You know I'm coming up in the '60s [1960s] when he passed away in '63 [1963], so some people say they were the first mega church is not true.  We won't go there.  They had that all the time, and our sanctuary one in which--(unclear)--completed holds three-thousand people.  But, so anyway we were taught to be independent and be who we are and not to rely on our family heritage.  Be proud of it, but don't be circumspective of it.  But anyway, so I raised, was raised with him.  The only thing that we had our youth church was largest as most, most churches and this as, as kind of a frame of reference, I could go out in the back yard and come into my grandfather's office, which you've seen, same spot that I'm sitting in is where he sat.  The door over there was the door to the backyard.  So, I mean all those things you see, and our youth church is downstairs, and I used to come up through this corridor, go through the door that you see outside my office, youth church is about forty-five minutes, and go sit in the pulpit next to my grandfather.  Did that for years.  I guess maybe I was ten or eleven when I stopped.  And the only thing I remember is there was an usher at the door told me I couldn't do it.  And when they told me I couldn't do it, I never went back until I was a mature adult and did my trial sermon, which was many, many years ago.  I was thirty years old when I did that.  So, it shows you what, how individuals and people can have impressions on children.  And I think that as in any PK's [preacher's kid] life, members always say, "We know where you gonna be.  You know what you're gonna be," and the more they went, they pushed me this way, I went that way, and I, I could sit here without hesitation, mental reservation, or secret evasion of mind in me whatsoever that whatever young folk did I did and most of it we did together.  I'm still living to tell about it.  I got friends who didn't survive the holocaust, all right so and, and there were people along the way that kind of smacked me in the head.  For one thing, I was gonna go, I was going to, they were gonna send me to a black college [HBCU].  You know I wanted to go to Southern Cal [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] you know, play football (laughter).
Speaker 2: Your granddaddy said no.
Speaker 1: Well, actually he had just passed, but it didn't matter whether he had just passed, it was a done deal.
Story_ID: 475672
Speaker 1: So what was your first office in the church?
Speaker 2: First office as an adult?  Hm. the person who followed my, well the person who followed my [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson] stayed about three months and was elected to bishop.  The next person it was George McMurray [George W. McMurray] who came out of Birmingham [Alabama] during that time who may have been my, what we call father in ministry.  I was on the, came back out of grad school, well I had been on the board of the center [James L. Varick Community Center, New York, New York], help build that.  Got out of grad school, I think I was a steward.  I was a steward.  Yeah I was a steward because I wasn't twenty-one then, but I had become preacher's steward when I was twenty-one.  Preacher's steward, a steward in the Methodist church is like a deacon in the Baptist church, and at twenty-one I was the preacher's steward and chairman of the steward board.  How that happened and why George McMurray did that, it happened.  I still, I was involved in the lay council, but that's what I call real significant, probably the first thing and then I got a demotion, although people think it was a promotion.  I went on the trustee board and did a lot of things there and so forth.
Speaker 1: So let's fast forward to you becoming head of the church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then I became a--well, what I'm saying, no, no, but--
Speaker 1: Tell us just a little bit--
Speaker 2: --you gotta understand something else--
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: --because during these, that period between twenty-one and thirty when I was twenty-six I was, I was working for Ogilvy and Mather [New York, New York].  You remember the Shake 'n Bake commercials, "Can I help?" Well I did all of that campaign.  I did Margaret Hamilton and Maxwell House coffee, Wicked Witch of the West, 'Wizard of Oz' ['The Wizard of Oz'], we did corporate--but I'm saying, so I had this communication and marketing background.  There's a position in the church called public affairs, public relations, and they said, "We want you," you know, my bishop, my pastor convinced me to run for it.  Twenty-six year old, had all this family, just knew everybody, knew me more than I knew them, and I'm gonna run for a position that requires people from all over the world to come to a delegated assembly every four years.  They vote on these eleven people to hold administrative jobs in the life of the church, and of course they vote on bishop.  So, I beat an incumbent who has been there twenty-six years or more who was my fraternity brother, I'm a Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  You probably could tell that already (laughter). That being, so I'm saying I think that has, that has an important point in life that kept me directly, that catapulted me out of the local church, local church kept me connected, but that kind of cemented it because on, I kept that position all the time during my corporate life.  You did not have to be a preacher in order to have that position, but in the midst of that, you know, I did go into ministry, but I still kept that position.  Even when I was, first went to working for Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] I still had this, I transformed that department into a larger more, you know, corporate entity and I was able to multitask because of my corporate, so that, all those things coming together kind of brought me to where I am.
Story_ID: 475673
Speaker 1: So, when did you attend seminary?
Speaker 2: When did I attend seminary?  What 1980, '79 [1979], '80 [1980] yeah, yeah something like that.
Speaker 1: And how did you decide to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, when you're called, when the Lord calls you the first time to preach to an ordained ministry, because I believe you can do ministry without being ordained.  Ordained ministry gives you the credentials or the license to do things that people who are not ordained cannot do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cannot do.
Speaker 2: So that--so when the Lord called me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In just a smattering of what's, what responsibilities you can take on once you've been ordained that are not available to someone who is not ordained.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, I think you can--see as a lay person I think you can always bring people to Christ--
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: --in those things, but you cannot--
Speaker 1: I'm just wondering about the formalities.
Speaker 2: Well the formality is that you cannot take them into the formal church unless you're ordained. We know you can't marry, you can't bury the dead, you know those kinds of things.  Or you can consecrate the, the sacraments for communion, you know those things.  You cannot preach, but you can give discourses, you see.  You cannot give the benediction, you know.  So, I always say when you people or people I wanna be, or they say why do you wanna be, you can do anything you wanna do, that you claim you wanna do, you could do without becoming an ordained preacher.  And every ordained minister or ministry is not necessarily pastoral.  That's the other piece that we get caught up in.  So, doing that and plus it was a good time because I think that even if God hadn't called me, I probably still would have gone there because of the school that I went to and the people I worked and studied under--I went to Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York], one of the lead top seminaries in the country.
Story_ID: 475674
Speaker 1: One of my, one who was to become, two people, one person who has become one of my best friends and mentors James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone].  He was, he was A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], and under James, under Jim you know I studied you know systematic and he was, he was--I'd read--being that I was a history undergrad and poli sci [political science] I read black theology and black power, you know that he had written.  I had already read Albert Cleage [Albert B. Cleage, Jr.] many years ago, 'The Black Messiah' so I had my own afro-centric positioning in terms of theology and I was so captivated.  Ironically I'm not a non- I, I don't like fiction.  I like, I read non-fiction and I'm a history guy, and so I wanted to go anyway.  And there was another guy named Jim Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.] who I started preaching under who will be here in October, became a very close friend of mine, and another friend of mine who was a history, who knew the black church well, very, just, Jim was just this, this was probably like---C. Eric Lincoln when you talk about the black church and being involved in the church and understanding people and the, and the, the ethos and trying to--(unclear)--who we are and why we are, just fascinated by it.  So, I would have, I think I would have gone anyway, but it proved to be one of the highlights of my life studying with these guys and continuing with them.  I think it was somewhere between them and when I came out of school I don't know how that kind of hit me because of my financial background and everything else I said gee maybe I was getting a little soft, I don't know what it was.
Story_ID: 475675
Speaker 1: I think I may have said to you my, my Walter Mitty was to go back and be the president of historically black college [HBCU].  I was trying to get back to where I came from, 'cause I felt there was a need for that and that was before I went to work for the president and that's why I went, that's why I went and got my Ed.D. thinking that's what I wanted to do and then I later on went back to a program that was being run by the late Dr. Samuel DeWitt Proctor.  And Sam had been in the Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] administration.  He had been president of the A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].  He was then, he followed Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] as the pastor of Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] and there was Doctorate of Ministry program is when they were in the early stages, probably Doctorate of Ministry program then was probably maybe about eight or nine years old in the country.  I had an opportunity then to go back, it was a small group of us--
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: Oh gee now you, I'm getting old, can't--
Speaker 2: Give us just a zone.  Is it the late '80s [1980s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty-six [1986], yeah '86 [1986] something like that.
Speaker 2: Late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I had to think about the date because Cornel, Cornel West, excuse me, who I, we had great, who was at Union [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] when I went there, that's another reason.  And at that time, Cornel had just published his book pros-, book, 'Prophesy of Deliverance' [sic. 'Prophesy Deliverance!'] and we were, and then his 'Prophetic Fragments' [Cornel West] and stuff came out as a result of his lectures and stuff with us.  But anyway, Cornel became, always was and has remained a very good friend, to go back and do something very special to look at the, the black chu- the black church in the new emerging 21st century and my committee, it was made up of Cornel who was straight out of Howard, I mean out of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], excuse me, Jeremiah Wright [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] who had finished the program at Trinity [Trinity United Church of Christ, Chicago, Illinois], quite known scholar and theologian, and Molefi Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] who is chair of the history department, African American studies department at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And if I have any part of my education beside one or two classes in undergrad and some with Jim [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], the two years, two and a half years with those three guys and a couple other colleagues of mine that were studying under them was probably the most fascinating and exciting time because you're on afrocentricity, you have Cornel's position, and you have Molefi's position.  Now here these guys go through a colloquy--and we engage in it.  And I was not a womanist theologian.  I mean you know I just, you know, I say feminist, my colleagues and my, my, my sister colleagues say womanist, you know but we got a chance--I got introduced to some very interesting-and I had, you know gone to school with some very good theologians, but some others who have written something.  There's one that says I ask for, I search for intimacy and what was her name?  You know I must be tired.  She was the first sister, and the first person I know female who had a Ph.D. in biblical studies and was teaching at, at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee].  It will come to me in a minute.  But I'm saying Cornel and Molefi and, and Jeremiah kind of opened the doors, and we just had great time doing theology, engaging discourse.  I read, at that time we, I reread Du Bois' 'Souls of Black Folk' ['The Souls of Black Folk,' W.E.B. Du Bois].  The veil for me meant something a little different now than it did for me thirty years ago.  Richard Wright 'Invisible Man' [sic. 'Invisible Man,' Ralph Ellison] meant something different than I read many years ago, you know, things like that, and we just had a great time.  And this hap, clarified and quantifies things a little better, so it was one of my best times in my educational experience.
Speaker 2: It sounds like it was good training for that opening of the mind.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it was good.
Speaker 2: Trajectory that you're on.
Speaker 1: You know sometimes you take classes, takes classes, but there's something that just kind of, you know--
Speaker 2: Fires it up.
Speaker 1: --once in a life time you know.  And we had, there were eight of us that were fairly good theologians, that could engage in discussion with each other, but not hurting each other.
Speaker 2: Right, which is very important (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Does that make sense? As a political science, you know so--
Story_ID: 475676
Speaker 1: --I did that along these same lines a lot of things were happening.  And you asked me how I got, how we got back here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So was A.M.E.--
Speaker 1: A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion].
Speaker 2: --Zion your, the, were you, when you became head of A.M.E. Zion was that the first--
Speaker 1: No when I became the pastor of Mother Zion [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: When you became the pastor of Mother Zion, was that the first church that you had been pastor of?
Speaker 1: Oh no, oh no I had been, I--at the end of my, no I think it was my, end of my second year in seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] there was a church in White Plains [New York], pastor had become very sick, a good friend of my [maternal] grandfather [Benjamin Congleton Robeson], and the bishop asked me would I go there and help them.  I said okay, and I'm still corporate, still doing other things, you know, and I got there, I'll never forget around September, first Sunday in September he preached that Sunday and never preached again.  So, I wound up pastoring that church for--I was the unofficial pastor for two years, three years and stayed there for seven or eight, and flock was about thirty-five, forty, roof leaking, worshiping down in the cafeteria, no sanctuary and so forth, so and so.  Built a new edifice, had more than six hundred members, I had five choirs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you built from--
Speaker 1: --I had a ten, yeah I had $10 million.
Speaker 2: Let's wait, let's just, let's just be specific there.  You built the church from, in White Plains from thirty-five to six hundred and some odd numbers.
Speaker 1: Six hundred and some odd members.
Speaker 2: Plus you're securing their structure and--
Speaker 1: Five, five, five choirs, five choirs a whole new church.
Speaker 2: Five choirs (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, had a, getting ready to do a little $10 million family life center with housing and school and so forth and the bishop, the new bishop at that time and we won't get into that discussion on camera, decided to, that I should go somewhere else, which was the situation that I inherited at Mt. Hope [Mt. Hope A.M.E. Zion Church, White Plains, New York].
Speaker 2: Mt. Hope.
Speaker 1: It was the same kind of situation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I thought it would be best for me to stay in Washington [D.C.] rather than go to that new situation.
Speaker 2: So, you're leading a church in White Plains and what's that church called before you go to Mt. Hope?
Speaker 1: Barry Avenue A.M.E. Zion Church [Mamaroneck, New York].
Speaker 2: Barry Avenue A.M.E. Zion and in--
Speaker 1: That's where he sent me to.  He sent me from Mt. Hope.  The bishop has the power--
Speaker 2: Got it, you were at Mt. Hope, he sent you to, I'm gonna get the name right.
Speaker 1: Barry Avenue A.M.E. Zion Church in large amount where the--
Speaker 2: And so you segued--
Speaker 1: --youngest, where they had about twelve, thirteen members and the youngest was like sixty-eight.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you decided to return to Washington [D.C.] at that point?
Speaker 1: I stayed in Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's right and ironically and I became presiding elder.
Speaker 2: Of the?
Speaker 1: The Washington--of all the A.M.E. Zion churches in metropolitan Washington I was responsible for.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what were you doing in Washington at that time?
Speaker 1: Working for, working for Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] at that time.
Speaker 2: And when you were at Mt Hope A.M.E.--
Speaker 1: Zion (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Zion you were commuting from Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: The same thing.  I only missed two funerals in my tenure there.  One in which I couldn't get back to, I think I was in Mozambique.
Story_ID: 475677
Speaker 1: And your work in D--in Washington, D.C. is that with the National Council of the A.M.E. Churches [sic. National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA]?
Speaker 2: No, this was with, no I'm saying when I was commuting?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I was president of--
Speaker 1: No, no, no once you were transferred to another church that you chose not to--
Speaker 2: No, no, I was, no, no, no when I was transferred to that church, I, I, I gave the bishop his appointment back and said I was, I was still with A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion], but our church is there, different conference and the bishop in that area asked me to be the presiding elder of that, of all those churches, so I was responsible for all those churches.  At the same time, I was working for the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  So, it was really easy, I mean I had an apartment ten minutes from, ten minutes from my office, and all my churches were in Washington.
Speaker 1: Right there.
Speaker 2: So, I wasn't getting paid, I was just doing it.
Speaker 1: And are you still working as the head of the [U.S.] African Development Foundation for President Clinton?
Speaker 2: Oh no I left, I left these, I left after the first term of, of President Clinton.  Matter fact, he and I remain friends.  He was here last year where we did a piece for CNN, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, the question remains how did you then become pastor of the A.M.E. Zion, Mother A.M.E. Zion [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church] here in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well we are an Episcopalian form of governance where there is a bishop and in our faith base as in the Methodist, all Methodist churches, the bishop appoints the pastors.  Bishops are assigned by--
Speaker 1: Would you just repeat that hierarchy again?  It's bishop--
Speaker 2: It's bishop, presiding elder.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: Actually it's bishop, general officer, presiding elder, pastor and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: General officers have authority over functionable departments, finance, pension, you know.  Those are administration positions.  They don't hold any pastoral responsibilities and you don't have to necessarily be an ordained minister.  They are administrative people.  So, but the bishop is elected by a delegated body.  You have to be a certain age and so forth and so forth, and you can, you are a bishop for, until you reach the age of seventy-two, mandatory retirement.  But, every four years this governing body has the authority to move your, move you from one responsibility, one area of responsibility to another area.  We take the world and divide it into twelve areas.  Each bishop is responsible for twelve areas.  Those twelve areas, which are called Episcopal districts are divided into contiguous geographical areas called annual conferences, and this Episcopal district which is called the Northeast there happen to be four annual conferences are disbursed geographically contiguous churches.  Within those annual conferences, this one is a New York annual conference, which happens to be the mother conference because of mother church, is then divided into sub groups called Presiding Elder Districts of, of groups of churches.  A bishop in his Episcopal area may have more than two hundred churches.  Our annual conference here has seventy churches.  The Presiding Elder District, which we're in right now has twenty-four of the seventy churches.  So, I had all those churches in Washington, D.C. as a presiding elder.  And so, so when the new bishop came into this conference three years ago he had, after he had been here a year, he called me and asked me with permission of the bishop who was serving under, would I consider coming back home and becoming a pastor here.  It's a historic inner city church with all the kinds of problems and complexities that most large inner city churches have versus the, and it was main, from a mainline denomination.  Mostly you see this growth in quote, unquote megachurches are churches that sit on the precipice have access, easy to park, you now, all the other kind of things which somewhat are false bottoms, but they do bring the people and from that, (making sounds).  G.E Patterson [Gilbert E. Patterson] said some months ago long before he passed that one of the things that he thought that he made a mistake in, you know Bishop Patterson out of the Church of God in Christ who just passed away a couple of weeks ago, a couple of months ago, said that one of the things he did wrong in Methodist was to build a new sanctuary.  He was growing so fast that he built his new sanctuary and became, had so many members that he lost track of being a pastor, and he always had a pastor's heart.  You can go so big exponentially, I don't care how many, how big your staff is, it's the relationship you have with the members and their family that is the most important thing.  And I enjoyed pastoring at Mt. Hope [Mt. Hope A.M.E. Zion Church, White Plains, New York].  I enjoyed pastoring, so anyway coming back home I had a home here too.  You know I was commuting back and forth, so that's how I got back.
Story_ID: 475678
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, tell us about--can you please tell us about your appointment as pastor of the Mother A.M.E. Zion Church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church] here in Harlem [New York, New York]?  You were called by your bishop and asked with permission of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was pa- I was appointed to as, matter of fact I'm just completing my second year as the pastor here under appoint--
Speaker 1: And what year is it now?
Speaker 2: Is, is, this is, this is 2007--
Speaker 1: Fantastic.
Speaker 2: --my second year, my se, I'm in my, into my third year now here at this historical church.
Speaker 1: And what has being a pastor here been like?  What have you done?  What have you not done?
Speaker 2: Awesome.  Ma- long day, short nights.  But, you know there's, there's a scripture that says, "To much is given, much is required" [Luke 12:48].  I think when I saying, alluded earlier about large inner city congregations on buildings--
Speaker 1: Yes please.
Speaker 2: --of today versus the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] and the, the, the, the change of the communities, the refacing, the, what's the word, the, not recidivism, what they've done with the housing stock, and you know things are happening whereas large churches, inner city churches were all neighborhood churches more than anything else.  Church is not your neighborhood church anymore.  For whatever reason, there has been a new, new genre of, of, of churches and so what has happened is trying, you turn, you trying to turn a battleship around in the middle of a stream.  There's several books.  Everybody is writing a book about something, you know how to turn around churches, how to do, you know, everybody has an idea of how to do it.  The only way to do is by pastoring.  So, this church had experienced some, some decline precipitously, and some other issues and sometimes those issues effect exponentially fiscal plans and some other things.  So, I had been given the task to, and that's why I said we started earlier about deja vu, coming full circle, because if you think about it Jesus was an awesome leader.  He, he made brick without straw, he could organize people, he could manage crowds, he'd get people to work, he could run his business, all right think about it.  Jesus was about, about efficiency and there's this, out of Romans 12:11 said, "Do not be slothful in business, be good in well doing."  So, there's also the business side of the church instruction you know I mean people must come on Sunday morning for a worship experience, but there's another thing about the relevancy of the work.  Ironically, Jesus was never accepted in Nazareth [Israel].  Most of the work he did and acceptance was outside it where he was from because of all, all the infighting and so forth.  But, what happens here is you have transform and not lose the ethos and make it more relevant, but make it conscious of the needs of the community without selling your soul.  You know, so it's that plus getting people to return back to their roots, celebrating the past, but charting the future.  We can't just rest on who we were and are, but we need to say where we're gonna be.  When I came two years ago, our vision and our theme was the difference is God.  If you think about it, everything we do is the difference is God, and now as we move forward the next two years it's gonna be is, the future is now.  The future is now.  So, God has always been the difference, but he's placed at this point in time.  The future is now, not tomorrow, but now.  So, along those same lines we instituted a major capital program of about $8 million, five year program.  We have created a, several new corporations.  I mean first of all I should say this, first of all we had, had to make sure that people came on Sunday for a worship experience.
Story_ID: 475679
Speaker 1: And was--
Speaker 2: A worship experience.
Speaker 1: --attendance down [at Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, attendance was down.  All the large, all, all these incidences--.  And some churches grew in attendance because by default on some issues in other churches.  This choir when I sang years ago was the choir that premiered Duke Ellington's sacred music piece, one of, we have one of the finest instruments in the City of New York [New York].  If you had to pick ten organs in New York City, ours will be one of them.  There's not another African American church that has an organ like ours.  If you don't, if you discount Riverside [Riverside Church, New York, New York] as being African American, I mean you know.  I don't mean that literally, but you understand what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: So, but so we have, and we do have the largest auditorium in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Did you say three thousand people could fit into your--
Speaker 2: It will seat three thousand people yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And it has great acoustics.  And you name they have sung it over the years--(unclear)--, but anyway, so I mean people have to come and have a worship experience.  So, there were things there that had to be done.  Things that what I did that were right.  There's some mistakes that I made.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, it varies, it varies, it varies from the order of service to the quality of the presentations, the music and so forth and things like that.  The integration of the worship experience.  So that--
Speaker 1: And how do you pull someone who hasn't been, who hasn't attended church in a number of years who lives right in the neighborhood who perhaps used to attend?  How do you get that person, how do you get that person's attention even to get them back?
Speaker 2: Well, and sometimes it's word of mouth, testimony is the best thing.  People see a change.  People hear a change.  One of the things that I try not to do I don't want people to think I was the change.  I didn't wanna be the, the, the, the change, not me.  I wanted them to know the church is, is, is, is, is retrenching along that which God has given its charge to do.  Sometimes the pi, the preacher becomes the church.
Speaker 1: And how did you make that change?
Speaker 2: Oh I just didn't, I just didn't let it happen.  I mean when I came back home, I mean you gotta remember I was still very much involved in Harlem in New York, I mean I told you I was deputy grand master of an organization [Prince Hall Freemasonry, State of New York] of ten thousand members and I'll be the head of it next year.  I mean I knew every politician you know, and I worked for the caucus.  I knew my way around, I mean, I was still in the community, so that wasn't, so they, people knew me, knew I, knew I had grown up here some, you know some, most of them did.  But, I did not want me to become the center, the point of attention.  I didn't allow them to even have a welcome reception for me.  You know those kind of thing, welcome him and do something, I didn't do that.  I haven't had a some of these other guys call, pastor's reception.  I don't want that.  It's not about me.  It's about the church.  I don't want to become the focal point, so I refused to let that happen, and I brought the same kind of commitment and ethic that I had even as a corporate person.  Every position I had corporately was with one, was with a corporate, a company that was number one in its field and was in fact probably one of the Fortune 50s, not 500, but Fortune 50s.  From ITT [ITT Corporation, White Plains, New York] to Revlon [Revlon, Inc.], to Ogilvy and Mather [New York, New York] to Seagram's [Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc.].  All of them were the number one in their field.  Even when I went to Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.].  You know they were the best.  And so there was a style of management, and along the same time I had this strong not for profit experience.  And then what was sticking out here, which doesn't happen often, is that I had all the government experience, you know, political experience, you know involved in understanding, you know, national government.  And so I think all the things came, come, came to bear in a, in a corporate sense on trying to establish or reinforce the vision of this, of this, of this faith-based community of who they are and where they need to go.
Story_ID: 475680
Speaker 1: But, again I, I started to tell you with that in mind and them understanding why we're here, next step was to try to once we got the worship experience is what do we do, 'cause the experience is not just the hour and forty-five minutes once a week--
Speaker 2: Sunday.
Speaker 1: --it's the other things and we are for example creating a whole new exhibition in gallery center downstairs, which will be digitally driven.  Matter of fact, we have one of only three entities, two entities beside the foundation that have the master, have a master of my uncle's [Smith's maternal great uncle], all of his, everything about him has been digitized and codified from film to music to writings to newspaper articles.  If you called up 'Othello,' Robeson [Paul Robeson], or 'Othello,' Vietnam, you can get the actual speech, you get writings, you get news clips.  All of this has been digitized, and we're gonna take that plus other historical pieces.  People can come and study and we can have forums.  We can video conferencing.  You know, I don't know if you saw the slavery exhibit in New-York Historical Society [New York, New York].  We're gonna have kiosk where we run every six months a different, all our original materials will be in the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], but this is tech, technology.  Some things you'll be able to download and take with you, some you can't for all the reasons that you can think of, you know.  The other thing--
Speaker 2: And what is the Schomburg in relation to this church [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Half a block away.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Half a block away.  And the other thing is I've created a senior citizen's program called WASA, Wisdom Cove for Seasoned Adults [ph.].  We've expanded our, our pre-K [pre-kindergarten] program.  We're also creating the community development corporation.  I'm getting ready to add seven new stories to the building next door.  But, the most important thing is I don't know how it came to me, but I should have understood, understood this most, and I would say without hesitation, and I'd like for somebody to defy me on this statement, most churches that are built and I know more about black churches being built than I do about white churches, most pastors raise money to build a church and create a mortgage.  Some know how to raise enough cash to walk in, or family life savings and pay for it cash.  One thing we don't do, I'm doing it differently, I am going to have, I'm gonna be like St. Bart's [St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York, New York], and St. John's [John Street United Methodist Church, New York, New York], avenue churches, 5th Avenue.  I'm creating this endowment starting off with a million dollar endowment that can only be used for capital improvements in the church, cannot be used for salaries all right and only 50 percent of the yield can be used.  And of course that's all through stewardship if I'm planning on giving.  That's a five year plan, which I think we could probably do it in two and a half years.  So, this endowment is going to be sitting over here, restricted endowment all right.  I'm gonna do what Riverside [Riverside Church, New York, New York] did, what Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller] did for Riverside, which gave Reverend Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.] the latitude to do a lot of things with people Riverside didn't like, but he didn't have to worry about raising the money.  He just did what God directed him to do, right, well and if you don't like, take that in your hat right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, and the structure of his church is well preserved.
Speaker 1: Am I right, you know what I'm saying, you know, but I'm saying, but the old folk didn't like him having alter call.  I mean there are things, you know, but he didn't have to worry about, not that you should worry about appeasing people when God directs you, but I'm saying you still gotta be mindful of this temple that you've been given charge of and the ministry of this temple because it's a living, breathing organism, so it has to have the ways and means to do it.  So, you create that and they have several endowments over there and that's what we're gonna create here.  So, I'm gonna have this endowment.  I'm not gonna spend a million dollars over here, four million over here and be in debt.  I'm in debt now, but I'm saying is that I wanna show the folk this is something that we should do as an, as a respective entity.  I'm not like some of my colleagues do it the other way first, so that's my vision.
Story_ID: 475681
Speaker 1: Do we get to ask about you being deputy grand master of--
Speaker 2: You can ask whatever you like.
Speaker 1: Okay can you tell us a little bit about how you came to be in that position and what that organization does?
Speaker 2: All right, well Prince Hall Masonry [Prince Hall Freemasonry] was founded two years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence by some people say Barbadian.  Most people agree he was from the Caribbean.  You know they can't find a birth certificate.  A guy named Prince Hall who came to England, came, came to Boston [Massachusetts] please and requested from what we called the Grand Lodge in England a request to start a Masonic body here.  What do Masonries believe?  Masonry is not what people believe is some secretive organization that's cultic and so forth.  Masonry is based upon scriptures.  Masonry, basic masonry is based upon the Old Testament scriptures.  It's speculative, if not operative.  It is rules and means by which you should live your life and govern your actions accordingly; that's all it is.  If in fact something happens to you, you know your brother is obligated, will be because he is a brother, to help you.  That's basically what it is.  And if you can't believe in what it means to live your life on the level, which is (unclear)--, you know it's almost like when Jesus talked in proverbs, it's symbolic.  What does a square mean?  What does living or what is a level.  When you know builders use level.  Yeah, but we all know what levels mean.  We always want to live to be equal to each other.  When you come into a Masonic room I don't care if you're president of the United States, all you need is that white apron, you are just a brother.  You're no longer president of the United States, see my point.  So you do the work in community, so anyway and I mentioned to your earlier about Prince Hall and so forth.  New York State was the third, what we called grand body started by Prince Hall near Boston, Massachusetts--was first, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was second.  There was another one in Rhode Island, which now is, the original one has dissipated, but some are there.  So we were actually the third statewide.  And, and in Masonry, I mean you name it over the years it's been a who's who with Thurgood Marshall all those, you know, and New York State will organize it.  Actually Prince Hall Masonry in New York State is the third august, oldest African American entity.  We being first [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: I was about to say so yeah--
Speaker 2: --Abyssinian is second --
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Baptist Church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York], and we're third.  Boyer Lodge [New York, New York] was the first lodge founded in 1812, and it was named after General Jean-Pierre Boyer who was the general of the army for Toussaint L'Ouverture.  You know about Toussaint and Haiti and what he did to Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte] and so forth, and the interesting thing is here you have free black men in 1812 in New York State, where slavery still existed.  It was not, it was not outlawed now.  If more than two or three blacks stayed on the corner without a white person present you'd get put in jail.  And they organized this Masonic body, and of course over the years the whites tried to say they were illegitimate and so forth.  And there have been court cases.  Today we have mutual recognition and so forth.
Story_ID: 475682
Speaker 1: How did I get into Masonry?  I did not know my [maternal] great-grandfather [William Drew Robeson] was a Mason.  I didn't know that my great-grandfather, my grandfather, excuse me, on my father's side was a Mason.  I, I knew that my other grandfather, was, so anyway.  So, my grandfather here was a Mason, and he was a member, that's the way I am, you know, he was a mason and he was a member of Boyer Lodge [New York, New York], Benjamin Congleton Robeson, the oldest lodge.  Actually Boyer Lodge is the oldest continuous lodge in Freemasonry.  By the way as a sidebar, now Masonry has more than two, 2 million members, we're all over the world, Prince Hall Masonry.  He's been in the lodge called Boyer Lodge.  Boyer Lodge, lodges tended to be like the ancient crafts.  People of similar vocations seem to gravitate to each other.  Just so happen that Boyer Lodge where most of, a lot of ministers were.  Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] was a member of this lodge.  Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] was a member of this lodge.  My grandfather was a member of this lodge, this, this same one.  So, I went into Boyer Lodge in 1976.  In 1980, I was elected, the master is the head of that local lodge.  You know what I did all between 1980 I was all over the place.  Seven years ago, six years ago, I was elected to the number four spot in the line of succession state wide, and judiciously served about two years in each spot.  So next year, I was supposed to be the top this year, but because of my schedule I don't think, I just couldn't do it.  I decided to wait and so next year I will be there.  Ironically, the deja vu is that one of the bishops whose, who was, was over this area named James Walker Hood who became the first superintendent of colored education in North Carolina was the first grand master in North Carolina of Prince Hall.  The lodge in Prince Hall in North Carolina was chartered by the New York State--(unclear)--, and Bishop Hood had been the bishop over in this area at one time.  Another one of my, of my mentor who passed away name was Herbert Bell Shaw who was the one encouraged me to run for that world-wide office I told you about.  He was grand master in North Carolina at the time and matter of fact when he passed away I was also master of my own lodge, but so it all kind of interconnected.  So, that's why and it's a good-in-see, it's like any other traditional African American entities they have had its problems.  It's--young people want to see the relevancy, but one thing they're saying is there's something different about Masonry than it is about my fraternity.  Since you didn't ask me I'm gonna tell you.
Speaker 2: What's the difference between Masonry and--
Speaker 1: I'm an Omega, I'm an Omega Psi Phi, Que Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 2: Well you've already told us you were Omega.
Speaker 1: Did I say this?
Speaker 2: You did.
Speaker 1: I wanna emphasize that again.
Speaker 2: Please, are you a member of a fraternity and if so which one?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and ironically is of course the requisites to get into a college fraternity are far different than it is to get into Masonry.  To be in a college fraternity, you have to be, go to college, and they have, and in a lot of fraternities you have to have a certain grade point.  But to be a Ma, or you can do it in graduate school, but you have be a college graduate or in a college program.  To be a Mason, all you have to do is be recommended, all you have to do is believe in a supreme being, and that's it, and have good character.  So, you can have all the degrees in the world, you can be the prime minister of England, president, you can be the richest man in the world, but when you come in that door you're just another brother.
Story_ID: 475683
Speaker 1: And what kind of, I wanna say community service does the Prince Hall Masonry [Prince Hall Freemasonry] in New York provide (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my goodness, oh well we have one of the oldest, well right here in New York City [New York, New York] for example, we have one of the oldest continuous day care programs.  We've done senior citizens in housing.  We own one thousand acres in the Catskills [Catskill Mountains], the largest land over in the Catskills, which we have a camp for young boys and girls from the age of eight to fourteen, which is now in its fifty-second consecutive year.  We're getting ready to do a transition.  The camp now is I think is 125 campus--plus two week session for three sessions.  We, we're expanding the camp to make it a major sports facility, Olympics Village.  We'll take--(unclear)--24/7 major field house and so forth.  It's been an interesting battle on that with that community up there.  Because ironically when we bought that property in 1947, we had to use an intermediary 'cause you know they didn't want us to have it.  I have the article that says colored Masons buy property.  We are the largest single taxpayer of any, and in, in three counties up there.  Of course now we are non-for-profit.  We are doing some major economic development through our CDC [community development corporation] in some parts of the state up in Newburgh [New York] and up in Buffalo [New York].  We're getting ready to do a char- charter school.  I'm talking about New York City, but there are things going on throughout the state (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of course.
Story_ID: 475684
Speaker 1: You said next year you're gonna be moving up a rank in the--
Speaker 2: I'll be the grand master [for Prince Hall Freemasonry, State of New York].
Speaker 1: And do you have any special plans as grand master or?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna try to rest.  Of course I do.  You know my mind thinks every day about something.  One of the things I really want to do is to train the young men, give them the opportunity of experiences I've had and create a, a, a means by which they can, and a vehicle by which they can take our organization to different and new opportunities.  A part of that has to do is establishing certain kinds of protocol, doing things a little differently than non, non-traditional things, you know things, things outside the box.
Speaker 1: And you said young men, are you talking about young men who are already members or are you expanding to the, the local community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Both, both, both, both, both, both because in any organization, even in church, you can, you can reclaim, retain, right, and you can, and you can recruit.  If you recruit them, you gotta retain them.  But if they have, if you have a false bottom nothing will hold on to, they're gonna go somewhere else.  Then, if you wanna reclaim them, they gonna say why should they come back.  The same holds true with the church.  You gotta make your entity relevant, and know that relevancy may change based upon the geographical location.
Story_ID: 475685
Speaker 1: What kind of relevancy do you and the church and in the Masonry [Prince Hall Freemasonry] need to provide for young men let's say in Harlem [New York, New York] today?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we got to say to young men, be a man first of all.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Be a man is being responsible.  Be a man is having integrity.  Be a man is willing to be sacrificial and not being chauvinistic, but be the head.  You can be the head without being chauvinistic.  It's being responsible.  And you can be respectful and still have a good time.  All right and then you have to be giving.  Giving is that what you do now must have some relevancy on that which is yet to come.  They have forgot--we got a generation now that has no, no idea of the shoulders they stand on, you see, and every, being relevant doesn't mean following every African American leader that stands up and shouts you see.  You have to be able to dissect the message.
Speaker 1: With integration and without the immediacy of the Civil Rights Movement, how do you move young people into a knowledge of themselves number one, particularly in the historical perspective, and how do you maintain it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think again I mean I think what has happened what we talked about earlier, there have been some false bottom opportunities that young people think they wanna take a part of and that's gonna give them the keys to, to life, and that's where you gotta bring them back and say no, no, no, no, no that's not happening that way, you know.  Listen [HistoryMaker] Ophelia DeVore, I think Ophelia DeVore, I may have the wrong name, she was talking about gangster rap, she passed away now, I think it's Ophelia DeVore, and they were pushing against what these, what was being said.  It wasn't until Imus [Don Imus] said what he did with Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] that some of our main leader gonna say, "Now they're talking about what is being said."  No, you didn't say anything last year, you know.  You didn't say anything last year, so [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons come to Montgomery [Alabama], try to beat up Russell Simmons, well they come gonna give you a few bucks to your organization now you're gonna, you're gonna protest and walk down the street, huh.  The same network that you're appearing on owns the record companies.  Hey, you know, whereas years ago Leon Sullivan, the guys, we going, we're going for the jugular.  It's not about us, it's about, it's about the people.  So, I think that, that's important.  I think economic development is important, education.
Story_ID: 475686
Speaker 1: You mentioned, you, you, I started to respond to your comment about integration.  In many respects, integration was the worst thing that happened to us because we became lethargic in many ways, and I won't say lazy but lethargic, because in the de facto segregated climate of education we were educated.  You have more persons with terminal degrees of our descent who are graduates of historically black colleges [HBCUs] than anywhere.  But, however, the number of students is smaller in historically black colleges than all the other colleges, right.  If you took all the black students that are going to white colleges and all the black students that are in historically black college, you have more, and you would more than any aggregate in white colleges, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --big schools now especially right.  However, when it comes to the terminal degree--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --in the aggregate, not per capita, but in the aggregate more of those people are getting terminal degrees are from historically black colleges.
Story_ID: 475687
Speaker 1: So you were responding to us about integration and talking about the important statistic of graduate degrees coming out of HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] versus--
Speaker 2: Well, if you look at the black population and the predominantly white schools in the aggregate there are more black folk in those, in those systems versus historically black colleges.  But, if you look at aggregate of black persons getting terminal degrees, in the aggregate, more of them come from historically black colleges, which have fewer students, black students than the white colleges.
Speaker 1: And what are people getting at historical black colleges that, that is making that pop, is facilitating that?
Speaker 2: Well I think it is part of the, I think it's part of the ethos, it's part of the size of classes, it's part of the commitment of, the traditional commitment of, of the educators.  Now the historically black colleges are having problems with funding of course, you know, the Presbyterian and Episcopal church they used to give money to Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee] and other colleges.  Now, they don't wanna give it and you know and now the, the states wanna take the black colleges like in Alabama integrate it to the state system, you know all these things.  So, what is happening is then that teachers, professors who were committed, I'm not saying that some are not going to take the bigger lucrative instead of saying gonna be in the black colleges and a lot of them, you'd be surprised on how many, and I'm not trying to be racist, how many of the black colleges, you see how many faculty members are from, from overseas, I mean, and that's the truth of the matter.  But, I think there is a part in the ethos that you can be better than who you are or you can't make it.  You don't have to for instance go to Uni- to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], but you can go to Livingstone College [Salisbury, North Carolina] and get a good education and be as competitive as anybody else.
Story_ID: 475688
Speaker 1: I think that the, the other part has come is that there's not enough, and I'm going down to the primary and secondary schools--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --elementary and, and high schools and middle schools is that whereas when we came through there were three professions that you could go into either a preacher or teacher or undertaker, primarily as a graduate, and we had some of the, our black colleges [HBCUs] put out some of the best teachers, teachers education program.  We don't have enough of black folk now going into teaching.  We don't have enough, especially not black males, and if we had more of them into high schools, into our middle schools and you here right now there not enough black males in primary schools 'cause it's image, it's image, and it is also the kind of genre that an African American teacher brings versus another teacher, especially when you get into predominantly African American community you see and so what has happened is that we're getting more African Americans into administrative positions in primary and secondary systems, but not enough in to the actual teaching because where the teachers came from didn't necessarily come from the large white colleges.  The teachers in our school systems and now, all of a sudden our school systems were bad and part of the reason and some issues has been has nothing to do with so much for the system as it does with the, what's happening in the community.  I mean, there was a time when there was funding for after-school programs.  Those after-school programs were in the schools.  There were community centers and so forth and so forth.  I mean latchkey children is not a new issue.  It's been that way for a long, since I was a kid.  I was a latchkey kid, but we had alternative sources in the afternoon, programs over us, so don't tell me--
Speaker 2: Yeah we were.
Speaker 1: --you gonna spend billions of dollars to fight a war, but you won't spend billions of dollars to, to, to, to rejuvenate our communities.  I mean there's something, something wrong here.  I, I, I must be missing something, missing something.  But, again that goes back when we talked about South Africa voting and so forth, being lethargic, taking for, taking things for granted no matter who the leadership is, we're complacent.
Story_ID: 475689
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you about your being a part of African American leaders calling for a declaration to end AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in the black community.
Speaker 2: Oh, well a year ago April we had a special AIDS summit [The End of AIDS: A Global Summit with Bill Clinton] here that was aired on CNN, it was an hour program, the moderator was President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  We had the president of the World Health Organization [WHO] who happens to be a sister.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: I'm getting old now and can't think.  She came out of CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia].  We had Richard Gere.  We had the president of MTV [Music Television Company; MTV], president of Pfizer [Pfizer Inc.].  You know it's been--(unclear)--I'll give you the DVD if you ever want to look at it, and I think we gonna see in our lifetime that it can happen.  I'm convinced that--
Speaker 1: You think we're gonna see which, I'm just nitpicking for you to make that a complete sentence.
Speaker 2: Well, you know preachers don't talk in complete thoughts, but we try to let y'all take it to the next level (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fantastic.
Speaker 2: I think they'll be an ending, could be in fact an ending to AIDS.  It's just not a priority.  It only became a priority just as drugs became a priority when it hit an appropriate and particular group in our community, then it became a priority.  When it was in the hood, it wasn't a priority.  Now, but if you think about it, it has gotten to be even with the, I won't say the drugs, but they call it the cocktails and so forth that are taken and that if a youngster takes, and it has infected, you can still and they take this medication, you know that in fact it can help, yeah they can live a full life, but we in the states wanna a provide it at such a high cost and in indigenous countries, well you know, it's amazing.  I mean see it goes back to this whole industrialization, you know, the whole--this is not new.  This is repeating ourselves when the industrial society came along, you see.  And people--you as a, as a, as a political science you look back at, at points in our community, in our history and see they reinvent themselves, they reinvent themselves.  So, what I'm saying we could end it.  We could end it, and we could end it by prevention, minimize it.  We didn't end yellow fever, we prevented.  We didn't end polio [poliomyelitis] before we started preventing it.  We had shots, you know what I'm saying.  Cholera and diphtheria had to do with environment issues, right, so we did that to minimize it.  I mean to cure, prevent, you know came later.  Same thing you know smallpox, you know, but so what I'm saying is that if we were serious.  If we can transplant a heart and a kidney at the same time and a liver, and if can spend how many billions a day on war.  Have you heard [U.S.] Congress say that we're gonna set aside a billion dollars for, to finding a cure to AIDS, but they voted appropriation for what?
Speaker 1: War.
Speaker 2: It seems to me there's some priorities here.  But, what are we saying about.  Yes, we as black churches work with a balm in Gilead and so forth, but think about it those who are supposed to be our leaders, supposed to have access.  Certain personnel is the darling of MSNBC especially 'Hardball' ['Hardball with Chris Matthews'] Chris Mat- I won't say who he is, but he has long hair.  I don't see him out there calling for a billion dollars of aid for, for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].  I don't see Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] doing it.  Tell me what black leader, not that I don't think, I think Al Gore generated a lot of awareness this weekend and he created a lot of environmental issues.  I don't see any of our people.  When you have per capita, the highest propensity of HIV in our community, especially among black women, I don't hear them saying a word.  It seems something, something, there's something, there's something rotten in Denmark.  (Pause) Being still.  We let folks say this is our folk, this is our leadership.

Speaker 1: You spoke a little bit about the goals of Mother A.M.E. Zion [Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, New York, New York].  Can you tell us what you would like your leg, your long-term legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't want a legacy.  I mean some of that goes back to what I said before.  I don't me to be the legacy.  I want the church to be the legacy, and then a respondent to the scripture about setting the captives free, helping the blind to see, you know, and those kinds of things, that it was the church that did it.  It was Greg Smith [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Gregory Smith], but it was this faith-based community, the kind that continued to make a difference because they knew that the difference was God.
Speaker 1: Thank you for talking to us.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
