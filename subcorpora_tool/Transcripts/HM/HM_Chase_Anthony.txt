Story_ID: 620448
Speaker 1: Let's talk about, about your family.  And, let's start with your father.  Tell me his name, spell his name for me.  And, tell me where he was born and when he was born, if you know.
Speaker 2: Sure.  John Saunders Chase [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] is his name, J-O-H-N, S-A-U-N-D-E-R-S, Chase, C-H-A-S-E.  And, he was born in Annapolis, Maryland in 1925.  January 23, 1925.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your father.  How would you describe him?
Speaker 2: Incredible man.  Incredible.  Where to even start?  He (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: He did.  He did.  He, my father is probably the single biggest influence in my life.  He grew up in Annapolis, Maryland and he was the--he grew up poor, single-parent household.  Principally raised by his mother [Viola Hall Chase] and his grandmother [Laura Hall] and his aunt [Ethel Hall Brown].  He was--he went to public school.  Of course, segregated public schools in Annapolis.  And, and my sense is that a, you know, notwithstanding had a pretty happy childhood.  He grew up in the shadow of the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland].  And, my great uncle [Ulysses Brown] was employed there.  He was the maitre d' in the dining hall.  And, my father really admired that, midshipmen.  And, I remember going there as a child.  In fact, I first saw President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], first president I ever saw, at the Naval Academy when I was about six or seven.  And, anyway, my dad's upbringing was in a black neighborhood in the shadow of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.  He then went to Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], as it was called then, and studied architecture and graduated in about 1947.  He was--he then went off to the war [World War II, WWII] and served in the Pacific Theater, saw a fair amount of combat.  He went to the Philippines.  He was deployed there, in black regiment.  He like, all of those, what they call, what they call the Greatest Generation, the Lost Gener- whatever it is they called it.  And, he speaks a lot about those times, or he certainly used to.  And, he was done with that in about 1948 or '49 [1949].  And, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] contacted him and had him apply to the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] because it was heretofore segregated, to the graduate school of architecture.  And, he did, and he, as they expected, was rejected.  And, it filed a basis of a court case that was filed then in the late '40s [1940s].  And, Sweatt v. Painter [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950] was in--how the case was styled.  Went to the Fifth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit] and the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  And, in 1950 he was admitted to the University of Texas, the first black student.  Together with another black student who was admitted to the law school.  And it was there that he met my mom [Drucie Rucker Chase], in Austin [Texas].  So, I'm glad that that happened.  And, then I was born--well, my brother [John S. Chase, III] was, my older brother was born a couple years later, and I was born in 1955.
Story_ID: 620449
Speaker 1: Before we get to when you were born, tell me about your, your grandmother who raised, you said that your--who raised your father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase], your grandmother and her sister?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about them.
Speaker 2: Their names were Viola [Viola Hall Chase] and Ethel [Ethel Hall Brown], respectively; my grandmother and my great aunt.  And Ethel's husband, my great uncle, his name was Les [Ulysses Brown], Uncle Les.  I didn't know them very well 'cause I grew up here in Texas and we didn't travel back and forth that much.  But, you know, they were, you know, wonderful old people.  They always seem to be old people to me.  I remember them going to church all the time.  Seemed like they were in church all the time.  And, they were very nice, seemed like they cooked a lot.  And the thing I remember most, the thing I remember best about their home is on Clay Street in Annapolis, Maryland, was that it always had good smells coming out of it.  And, always seemed like people were eating and cooking and laughing and having a good time.
Speaker 1: Can you--how far back can you go in your ancestry on your father's side?  Is that as far back as you can go?
Speaker 2: That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, you know, there, there's a rumor that my father's father was from Baltimore [Maryland].  And--
Speaker 1: Do you know his name?
Speaker 2: I think his name was John [John S. Chase, Sr.].  But, no I don't.  I don't know his name.  There's also a rumor that, you know, he was a good mathematician.  I'm not sure if that meant he was a numbers runner (laughter), or that meant he was a math professor somewhere.  I just never quite got the full story on that.  But, apparently he was a bit of a rolling stone whatever he was.  And, my--he was not an active part of my father's life and certainly not in mine.  I never met him.
Story_ID: 620450
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your mother.  Tell me her name and where and when she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Drucie Raye Chase [Drucie Rucker Chase], D-R-U-C-I-E, Raye, R-A-Y-E, C-H-A-S-E.  She was born in Austin, Texas in 1932, August 4th.  She was one of six children.  And, my mother's family I know pretty well.  They are a pretty close knit bunch and, and they're pretty, you know, close to us here in Houston [Texas].  So, we stayed in pretty close touch with them.  In fact, my enduring childhood memories at Thanksgiving are at my grandmother's table in Austin.  And, classic, you know, preacher, you know, preacher down there at the end of the table.  And, you know, people coming in and out, lots of subplots going on, good food everywhere, kind of a classic Thanksgiving picture.  And, my grandmother was--her name was Beatrice, Beatrice Rucker.  My mother's maiden name was Rucker.  And my grandfather is John Rucker, and as the story goes my grandfather amassed some land in Central Texas, and lost it during the Depression [Great Depression].  He had some gravel pits as I understand, but operated some businesses in Central Texas.  Buda [Texas], Driftwood [Texas], Austin, that area.  And, and, then lost a lot of it during the Depression and moved to California and then came back.  I'm not exactly sure the details better than that.  But, he settled in, in Austin and I believe my grandmother was his second wife.  But, with her he had six kids, including my mom.
Speaker 1: And, do you know the names of your uncles and aunts?
Speaker 2: I do.  I do.  There is dear old Uncle George, who passed away a few years ago, but dear fellow.  George Rucker lived in El Cerrito, California for years and years.  Then there was Bernice Hammond [Bernice Rucker Hammond] who also passed away in probably about six or eight years ago.  My mother's oldest sister.  And, then, there was, I guess and then there was my mother.  And, then she has a younger sister and a younger brother.  The younger sister's name is Johnnie Bea [Johnnie Rucker VanDyke].  As I mentioned my grandfather's name was John and my grandmother's name was Beatrice.  So, I, you know, it seems like a failure in naming to me.  But, they did name her Johnnie Bea.  And then my mother's youngest brother Ernest [Ernest Rucker] who went by the name of Brother.  Again, not very creative but, yeah that's all.  And, the only one alive today, actually as I think about it, is Johnnie Bea.  And, I may have mentioned six brothers and sisters, but I guess there was five overall.
Story_ID: 620451
Speaker 1: Now, describe your mother [Drucie Rucker Chase] to me.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother, she's something.  My mother is--to describe my mother.  Wow, well, my mother is stream of consciousness.  She's strong.  She's beautiful.  She's a great cook.  She is where you go when you don't have anywhere else.  She is kind.  She sees things that other people doesn't--don't see.  She really is a wonderful person.
Speaker 1: Did she describe--did she tell you or share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: She has.  You know, I got the sense that my mom's growing up was not, not rough but spare.  I got the sense that it was relatively happy but that they didn't have very much.  It was very, it was rural compared to how we grow up today, or how I grew up.  I mean, she was, you know, she rode horses and there was lots of land and open spaces and, you know, she grew up in that sort of environment.  I also got the sense that, you know, of course, she and my dad [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] I guess grew up in times that were a lot--were segregated.  I mean, so, they were, and, you know, certainly my sense is, is that, you know, Texas was sort of a rough place to be in the early part of the 20th century if you were black and, you know, could, you know, and were aware.
Speaker 1: How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: She finished high school, Anderson High School [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].  And, then started college, Huston-Tillotson College [Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].  I'm not sure if she graduated or not.  Small black HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] based in Austin [Texas], not far from my grandmother's [Beatrice Rucker] house.  So, I think that would be about it.
Speaker 1: And, your grandparents, do you know how much education they had?
Speaker 2: I don't think they had any.  I don't think they had any formal education.
Speaker 1: What about on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Your grandmother [Viola Hall Chase]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I certainly don't think my grandmother had any formal education.  And, she was of course the only grandparent, paternal grandparent I knew.  My grandfather [John S. Chase, Sr.] as I mentioned, there's some allegation that he was good with math.  But, like I say, I, I really can't provide any (laughter), can't provide any more evidence of that.
Story_ID: 620452
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Drucie Rucker Chase] and fa- well, I mean, you told me where they met, but is there a story about how they met and got married?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There, actually there is.  You know, my dad [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] was, my dad, I get the sense of course that my, you know, that my dad was pretty well-known in Austin, Texas at the time.  Because, you know, he, he was the first black in the university, there was a lot of press in Austin because of it.  He couldn't live on campus, or until the segregation prevail at the time.  So, he lived in East Austin [Austin, Texas], which is where the black community lived and continues to live today in greatest concentration.  And, and, yeah, he went to a wedding one Sunday.  And apparently there, there was my mom and you know the rest is history, as they say.  I, you know, their courtship, they tell funny stories about it.  My grandfather [John Rucker] was a pretty stern fella.  And, best I remember, you know, he was always, you know, kind of quick with a switch and, you know, always, you know, kind of had a little bit of a frown on his face.  And, so, I can imagine he was fairly stern, and in terms of my mother.  My mother is very, physically a beautiful woman, and she really is.  And, so, I'm sure he had his hands full in, in dealing with suitors for my mom.  So, you know, so, the only stories I know really are really, you know, two and I don't know very much really those in detail.  But, one is about how they literally met for the first time which was at this wedding.  I don't know whose wedding it was, but--and, then I, I've often heard them talk about a football game that they each attended.  Apparently, you know, in, you know, not--my mother actually told my father she couldn't go to the game and she ended up at the game with somebody else, and you know, blah, blah, blah.  So, they tell that story, it's kind of funny to hear them talk about.  But, that's about all I know.
Speaker 1: What year did they get married?
Speaker 2: Well, now that's a good question.  I know they've been married over sixty years now.  So, I, you know, I'm trying to be like my grandfather [John S. Chase, Sr.] was supposed to been, and really do this math real quick.  I would guess around 1950, '51 [1951].  Yeah, 'cause my father started Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in 19--he enrolled in the fall of 1950, and my brother [John S. Chase, III] was born in '52 [1952].  So, I think that's pretty safe to say '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: And, they were living in Austin?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 620453
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, you talk about smells at your [maternal] grandmother's [Beatrice Rucker] house of the cooking.  But, it you could think back, if you think about another smell or you can--that one could be fine, a sight or a sound that takes you back to that time when you were a child, what would they be?
Speaker 2: Well, the first one that comes to mind is that, is the smell of fish frying actually.  Because often we would drive to Austin [Texas] on Friday evenings when my father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] be done with work and my mother [Drucie Rucker Chase] taught school and so you know, we were in school.  So, we'd get in the car on Friday evenings and we'd go to Austin for the weekend and stay with my grandmother.  And, and, when we would get in invariably, you know, it's a three hour drive from Houston [Texas] to Austin.  And, invariably, you know, it'd be nine or ten o'clock at night.  And my father really loves fried, well, I guess everybody in my family seems to love fried everything.  But, but, my father really loves fried fish, and he really loved the fried fish my grandmother made.  And, she would make it for him when, well for all of us really, but really I guess particularly for him when we'd show up.  So, that'd be the principal smell that I can think of.  The other thing that, you know, sort of as a sense that I can remember is that, is heat.  Because it was hot in my grandmother's house.  She didn't have air conditions.  And, of course, in Texas, you know, not having air conditioning particularly in the summer, you know, it didn't make any difference what time you got there, seemed like it was hot.  And, you know, it always seemed like she had a bead of sweat on her lip and that was just kind of fixed there and it was fixed on everybody's lip when you're in her house.
Speaker 1: What about sound?
Speaker 2: I guess, the sound I remember would be the rooster that would cock-a-doodle-doo in the morning.  'Cause we weren't that far out in the country, but far enough I guess where, where we'd hear a rooster.  And so, that would be the sound I remember.  One other sound I remember, my great-grandfather lived in the house, lived in my grandmother's house in Austin until he died.  His name, I don't, his last name was Aldridge [Ernest Aldridge].
Speaker 1: Now, grandfather, your great-grandfather on whose side?
Speaker 2: My mother.
Speaker 1: Mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother's grandfather lived in my grandmother's house until he died.  In fact, he only had one leg when I knew him.  And, we called him Hanpa [ph.].  I'm not sure why.  But, I remember he slept on the back porch.  It was an enclosed porch.  Remember there was no air conditioning so, you know, windows were always opened and, you know, drapes would blow in and out of the window.  And, I remember he kept a shotgun sitting beside his bed.  And, of course, he didn't move very well.  And, and, so, the one sound I remember is, is that once he saw something, I don't know a bird or something, and he picked up the shotgun and, and he shot right out win- right from the bed.  In which, I--scared me.
Speaker 1: What about a sight that you remember?
Speaker 2: First one that comes to mind is the state capitol of Texas [Texas State Capitol, Austin, Texas].  And, we--in my grandmother's house, grandmother and grandfather's house in Austin wasn't terribly far from the state capitol.  And, my grandfather took me there for the first time that I had been there, we walked in fact.  And I remember the capitol is really a majestic place in Texas.  I think it's true that the state capitol here--is the only larger one is the one in Washington [D.C.].  And, it really is pretty.  It's a Texas red granite.  It's just really pretty.  It's really magnificent.  And, so, my grandfather took me there.  I remember him showing it to me and pointing it out.  Probably my best memory of him; single memory of him, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, this is John Rucker--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --you're speaking about?
Story_ID: 620454
Speaker 1: You said the memory of your [maternal] grandfather [John Rucker], but what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) That's a good question.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  What comes to mind is, is frankly sitting out in front of the house that we lived in here in Houston [Texas] on the sidewalk with my brother [John S. Chase, III] pretty much doing nothing (laughter).  But that was a house that we lived in when I was born, and I don't have very many memories of that house.  But, I do have a couple, you know, I do have a couple.  And, yeah, and it was, you know, it was pretty, pretty stark.  I mean, I--you know, it was pretty stark, certainly relative to the way we seem to live today.
Speaker 1: But, what were those two memories?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember Christmas there.  I guess, like many kids, I remember Christmas.  And, I remember where the Christmas tree was and I remember the kitchen.  I remember there was a fire once in that house.  No one was hurt badly by it but it scared everybody, shook people up pretty badly.  And, my dad's office originally was downstairs in the house.  My dad [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] started his business, you know, he's the original entrepreneur, right.  So, he started his business, you know, and then, you know, I don't know, '55 [1955] something like that.  And he started downstairs of the house and, then he built an office in front of the house.  And, you know, sort of on from there, so.  And then the other memory of that house was, I remember my parents, you know, having folks over.  Seemed like they had a good time when I was kid.  But, they would have folks over and they'd play cards, and they'd drink and they'd talk loud, and seemed like they had a pretty good time to me.
Story_ID: 620455
Speaker 1: Speaking about your family and the house that you lived in.  Tell me, your father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase], you said he had an office.  So, his business starts to take off as an architect?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say take off (laughter).  It took, (laughter) it took some time.  It--I'd say that.  It did.  It did take off and in every, you know, every correct sense of the word.  I didn't have much perspective for that.  I did understand that life got better for us.  And it sort of seemed to on a pretty steady trajectory.  But, this would be--so, I was born in the 19--mid-'50s [1950s], 1955.  And our--so, my recollection is that my dad's, my dad had an office in the house when I was a small child, you know, less than five maybe.  And, then his business did better and he built an office in front of the house on the same piece of property.  So, it was kind of a crowded piece of property 'cause it wasn't that big.  But he built an office and he had been working as a teacher of drafting, architectural drafting at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  And, he began, he hung out a shingle and, and, you know, sold his services as an architect.  And, he had an interesting marketing strategy.  He would take us to--us, his family, his immediate family, to churches around the state on Sunday.  So, most of the black population of Texas lives in East Texas.  If you draw a line from Dallas [Texas] down to Houston [Texas], 95 percent of the black population lives east of that line.  And, so, we'd go all over East Texas on Sundays and go to different churches.  And, they kind of knew my dad because he had gotten that publicity going to the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and so they'd introduce our family and we'd all stand up, and we'd wear, you know, coat and tie, and it'd be hot in there too.  And, they, then they start a building fund and, you know, next thing you know.  So, my dad's original business model was designing churches.  And, I think he's still best known actually for designing these lovely churches all around East Texas.  And so, that's really how his business started, you know.  They weren't people outside the black community who, I think, were willing to hire a black architect during those days.  And, and, inside the black community there wasn't a lot of capital and so the really only real capital I guess was in the church.  And, so, churches were the places to go in order to get that kind of work.
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Drucie Rucker Chase] do for a living?
Speaker 2: She taught school.  She was a public school teacher, elementary school teacher for about thirty years in Houston.
Story_ID: 620456
Speaker 1: Tell me about the community in which you lived.  You said your father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] had a house built on a piece of property and he had the office.  Take me on a tour of the community--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Who lives in the community?  Maybe if you know your--remember some of your friends and what their parents' professions might have been.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, I lived in the house I described on that crowded piece of property until I was about seven.  And, then, my mom [Drucie Rucker Chase] and dad bought a vacant lot, walking distance from where this, we originally lived, but miles away in terms of kind of the character of the neighborhood.  And, we moved into the Riverside area [Riverside Terrace, Houston, Texas].  The upscale black professional area of town, still is today.  And, it was just the place to be.  I mean, it was--it had been formerly a Jewish neighborhood and it, it changed quickly, you know, when a few black folks moved in it changed dramatically and quickly.  And, they were very nice older homes and, and it was right near the, the campus at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas].  And, it was the home of the sort of black professional class, rising class in Houston [Texas].  And, it was at a time when Houston's black professional, or really black elites, if you will.  We're just starting to form and just come into kind of figure out who they were and they are.  And so, the community I lived in, I grew up in, and that's really what I think of this community and neighborhood I grew up in, was all-black.  It was, it was the, you know, my neighbors were doctors, and lawyers, and professors at Texas Southern.  The guy who lived across the street is the president at Texas Southern, James Pierce [sic. Joseph A. Pierce].  And, the guy who lived next door was a doctor named C.W. Thompson who was the first black person to run for city council in Houston that, you know, it was like that.  The guy who lived two doors down was Frank Melton, who's now the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi.  And, then, you know, the guy who lived right next to him, was a guy named Ken Bacon [Kenneth J. Bacon] whose father [HistoryMaker Dr. Robert J. Bacon, Sr.] was a urologist in--or is a urologist, I guess he didn't practice anymore.  But, Ken is on the board of Comcast [Comcast Corporation] and is number two or three guy at Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage Association] in Washington [D.C.], and went to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and Marshall Scholar at Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England], and blah, blah, blah.  So, it was, you know, it was that kind of neighborhood and, and, you know, everybody kind of, you know, everybody really believed.  I remember the elementary school I went to, Lockhart [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas], was all black.  But, everybody really thought we were the best school in the city.  And, in many ways, I think we kind of were.
Speaker 1: Why was that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was really close knit.  In fact, just this weekend I went to my sixth grade teacher's [Azalia Durall] ninety-fourth birthday, who still lives in that same neighborhood, on the same street I was just describing.  And, you know, it was, it was a close knit neighborhood.  It was--I always remember it as one of those sorts of neighborhoods where somebody else told you to stop, you know.  It's like where somebody else's mother would, you know, come out and say, "You're not supposed to do that."  People, it really was a village, I think, in a way that isn't true today.  But, then, it certain was, I mean, you know, everybody had license to, you know, whoop your butt, and you know, and did, you know.  So, it was very much of a--it was a very hopeful neighborhood.
Story_ID: 620457
Speaker 1: It was very politically engaged and active and I remember that one of the biggest things I remember growing up was when Muhammad Ali moved to Houston [Texas].  He didn't move here for very long, but it was a big thing when he did for the people who lived here.  And, here moved to our neighborhood, and he bought a house not very far away.  He actually tried to buy a house in River Oaks [Houston, Texas], the place where I live now which is sort of interesting, and he couldn't.  And, so, he bought a house in the--this neighborhood where we lived.  And whenever there'd be a sighting of him, it would cause pandemonium around the neighborhood.  And, there were often sightings of him actually.
Speaker 2: And, this was in the '50s [1950s] or the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Actually, this was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Sixties [1960s], '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: This would be mid-'60s [1960s] now.  This would be, yeah, mid to late '60s [1960s].  When he didn't step over the line for the draft that was here.  When he refused to go in the [U.S.] Army, to go to Vietnam that was here in Houston.  That was probably '66 [1966], '67 [1967], something like that.  And, anyway, he was, but he was just part of that deal.  And, the Civil Rights Movement was alive and well here.  I mean, it was important.
Story_ID: 620458
Speaker 1: Well, before we get to civil rights, let's go back to your elementary school.  You were telling me why you thought it was one of the better schools.  Was there a teacher, or a couple of teachers, besides the--what was the teacher who just turned ninety-four (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Miss Wilson.
Speaker 1: Miss Wilson.
Speaker 2: Azalia Wilson [Azalia Durall].
Speaker 1: And, tell me why she was an influence on your life.
Speaker 2: They all were.  I mean, you know, not the least of which, as I mentioned, my mother [Drucie Rucker Chase] was a teacher.  So, you know, there was, my mother, you know, as we knew all these people.  They all lived in the neighborhood, and they all really cared.
Speaker 1: Did you mother teach at Lockhart [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No.  She didn't.  She taught at another black elementary school, but, but not Lockhart.  Her principal, her principal's wife taught me in fourth grade.  So, it really was a close knit kind of group.  And, you know, all of 'em.  I mean, I, you know, I can recite the names of my teachers just as easily as I can recite, you know, a bank account number.  I mean, from elementary school, they were all just important.
Speaker 1: Do you wanna tell me who they were?
Speaker 2: Sure.  In first grade was Miss Rockermore [ph.]; second grade, Miss Yule [ph.]; third grade, Miss Aldridge [ph.]; fourth grade, Mrs. Johnson [Bessie Johnson], now she was the wife of W.L.D. Johnson [W.L.D. Johnson, Sr.], who's my mother's principal.  Fifth grade was Miss Anderson [ph.].  In sixth grade, the woman's whose birthday was this weekend was Miss Wilson.
Speaker 1: Now, in elementary school, what other activities besides school activity, or, you well, actually we didn't talk about your school activities.  What activities were you involved in in school?  And, so, the extracurricular activities?
Speaker 2: I was always pretty heavily involved.  I was involved in lots of things at school including student council.  I was president of the student council when I was in elementary school.  It was, my most vivid memory about that was that the president of the student council when I was in elementary school gave a welcome address at graduation.  And, our graduation speaker the year I graduated was Barbara Jordan, who was a state senator from my district at the time.  And, so, I gave a welcome speech and Miss Jordan was the principal speaker and of course, you know, she was a great speaker, you know, always.  And I remember she, good politician that she was, she promised after my welcome speech that she would give me a job one day.  Now, which I came back later, and asked her to make good on that promise a few years later, and she did actually.  And, so, I ended up working for her later.  But, so, the things I did in elementary school, the extra things were student council, and--what else did I do?

Speaker 1: Were you in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] or Cub Scouts?
Speaker 2: I was.  I was in the Boy Scouts.  I was an Eagle Scout.  We were, we had this incredible troop.  I understand it was the largest all-black troop in America.  That's what I understand.  I don't have empirical evidence to support that.  But, it certainly was the loudest if it wasn't the largest.  And, it was a big troop.  It was at least, I don't know, 150 boys and--maybe even more.  And, we were, our troop home was Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church [Houston, Texas] which was, which is an historic church here in town.  And, when they started this troop effort was about the same time.  I was one of the first scouts in that troop and, and that scout, that troop went, went on and produced a number of Eagle Scouts.  I mean, a lot.  Again, I don't know if it was the most black Eagles produced by any one troop, but I'm sure it's close.  It's--they've now built a scout house and you know, got a whole big deal going over there.  In fact, my nephew's in that troop today.  So, it's been there, for it survived for a long, long time.  And, there was a legendary scoutmaster at the time named C. Reger Hall, who was later murdered actually under some pretty, you know, dark circumstances.  I don't really know the details around it.  But, some years later he was murdered.  But, anyway, this troop was really a big part of the community and a big part of my life during that time.
Speaker 1: Who, do you remember who was your troop leader?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  C. Reger Hall was the leader.  And, he was the scoutmaster.  And, then there were, you know, there were other guys.  I remember a guy, assistant scoutmaster named Hoskins [Gerald Hoskins].  But, Hall was such an overwhelming personality that I kind of don't remember any of the other adults to tell you the truth.  There was him and kind of nobody else.  He was really something.  He was really something.  He was all about, you know, how to be a man.  And, he was a strict disciplinarian and, you know, (laughter) he was really something.
Speaker 1: What were some of the thing you had to accomplish to--'cause Eagle Scout is the highest ranking in scouts, right?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you had to accomplish to get to that rank?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you had to--in our troop, you know, there are set lists of requirements for Eagle Scout.  Earn twenty-one merit badges, and fifteen of which are designated fields, and go through the rankings, you know, you know, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star, Life, and then Eagle.  But, in our troop, you know, it really was sort of about leadership, you know.  There was a special emphasis on kind of reaching in there and, you know, you know, nurturing boys I think in a way.  And I remember we met outside.  We didn't meet inside, troop was too big to meet inside.  So, we met under these naked lightbulbs under some trees next to the church.  And, and, we'd go camping.  I love the camp.  We'd go off camping, all these guys, and it was, it was really something, it was really something.
Speaker 1: About how many members were in the troop?
Speaker 2: About 150 to 200--
Speaker 1: That is a--
Speaker 2: It's huge.
Speaker 1: That's very large.
Speaker 2: It's just huge.  It's just huge.  We'd go to camp and, you know, I mean, everybody didn't go but, you know, a lot of us went.  And, it be, you know, couple buses full of kids that would be doing this.  It was a special deal.  So, I did that until I was fourteen, yeah.
Story_ID: 620460
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: You know, I was a pretty good student.  I was a pretty good student.  I had my ups and downs as a student I think.  I was as good as I wanted to be.  And, sometimes I wanted to be good and sometimes I had other interests.  I was always curious.  So, I think my--I, it certainly seemed clear to me.  My teachers always appreciated me as a talented student, and always tried to get me to, you know, exhibit that talent.  And, and, sometimes I would and sometimes I'd get lazy on 'em and not do it.  Sometimes I'd be more interested in other stuff.  I was actively interested in, in, you know, sports and scouting and, you know, any host of number of other things that might be going on.  And so, sometimes books didn't rise to the height.  And, I say that, I mean, I always did well.  I didn't, you know, I always seem to do pretty well and I never really had trouble in school.  I mean, you know, no real academic trouble.  But, I, you know, I think I always could've done a little better.
Speaker 1: Did you have any dreams or aspirations of what you would become during that ti- during that period of elementary school [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: You know, yeah, I did.  I don't know that they were specific.  I can't say that I wanted to be this, or I didn't think I could be that.  But, I will say that I did think that the, that almost anything was possible.  I remember one of the things we used to do in my elementary school was, you know, down here in Houston [Texas], NASA's [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] a big deal, always has been, you know, Mission Control, "Houston, we got a problem," that whole deal.  It's always a big deal down here.  Astronauts train down here.  They lived here.  They live here today.  And when I was in elementary school when the Mercury program [Project Mercury] was on the way and Gemini and all of that, and doing a space shot was--everybody, you know, everybody, literally, everybody in school would gather around one black and white television and watch the thing lift off.  And, it was just a great big old deal.  And, I remember distinctly feeling like, you know, not only watch it take off but you watch it, you know, when it landed in the water, you know, you know, you sort of follow that whole deal.  And, it was just a great big old deal.  And, I remember thinking, you know, that'd be a great thing to be, is an astronaut.  I never, you know, pursued it.  But, I never thought that I couldn't pursue it.  So, so, no, I think it was, it really was a time full of hope for us.  I didn't feel like there were any limitations at all really.

Speaker 1: Did you go to a junior high school?
Speaker 2: I did; public junior high school here in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: What, what was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cullen Junior High School [Cullen Middle School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Cohen?
Speaker 2: C-U-L-L--C-U-L-L-E-N, Cullen.  And, yeah, sure did.
Speaker 1: Now, was this also a black school, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  All-black.  Thirty-five hundred students in three grades.  Big, black, and you know, it was a ru- it was an awakening for me because, you know, I'd been in that neighborhood that this elementary school [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas] was nestled right in the middle of through sixth grade.  And, then I went to this junior high school which was in a rougher neighborhood, you know, ill named.  Sunnyside [Houston, Texas], the neighborhood was.  And, it, you know, it was a new day.  It was bigger and rougher and it was the real deal.  And, I showed up there and, you know, that was just kind of a rude awakening for me.  I will say this, I mean, they were at least, that school was changing.  It had been predominately a white school until probably five years before I got there.  And, by the time I got there it was overwhelmingly black, but there was still some white students there.  And, lots of white teachers.  And, I'd never seen any of there, right.  I mean, I never seen any white students.  I never seen any white teachers until I got there.  And, and, that was a new experience for me.  I think they were the, that would qualify them as the first white people I met.  And, it was an interesting time to meet white people, all right.  I mean, it was, Houston was still pretty segregated then in, you know, that, you know, it was late '60s [1960s] and, you know, sort of '67 [1967] to '69 [1969] somewhere in there.  Then, and, so, you know, a lot was going on around the country.  The context at the time was, and specifically in Houston, a lot was going on racially.
Story_ID: 620462
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the things--were your parents involved in civil rights at all?
Speaker 2: They were.  They were, you know, they were certainly, you know, my father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] was always a leader in the community.  So, things would happen, you know, at our house, you know, they'd be lots of meetings.  I remember, you know, politicians would regularly come to our house and have--and, meet with people, have private meetings, sort of have off the record meetings and so forth.  I remember that happening a lot as a child.  You know, I can remember all sorts of, you know, people who came to our house for sort of political purposes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who any of them were?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Sure.  I can remember Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] coming to our house, and I can remember Mickey Leland having meetings with people from the white community who were not pleased with his, his recent actions.  I can remember Lloyd Bentsen, was almost sort of a fixture in a sense in our house.  He would come there and when he would campaign in the black community, he would almost always hold an event at our house when he was a congressman, and later when he was a senator.  I can remember, who else can I remember coming through our house?  Well, I can remember my father, at the time, meeting with people who were, you know, politicians to the day.  Like, John Connally was somebody who he met with a fair amount.  And, he and my mother [Drucie Rucker Chase] went to the LBJ Ranch [Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park] a couple times when Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was president.  And, so, they were always, you know, kind of in the mix.  I--
Speaker 1: Were they a part of a specific group?
Speaker 2: No.  Not formally.  But, you know, they were informal groups.  Like I guess there always have been, right, that seemed to wield influence and power.  And, there was one particular group that was, that included black people across the state.  There was, in addition to my dad, there was a guy named Ernest Sterling up in Tyler [Texas].  There was guy named Marvin Griffin [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Marvin Griffin] in Dallas [Texas], a minister of a big church up there.  There was a guy named M.J. Anderson in Austin [Texas].  And they, you know, would--and they were kind of a group.  And, you know, I know that a lot of things seem to happen or not happen, you know, based on, you know, kind of their weighing in on things or not.  I mean, are they, you know, Tyler owned a big bank up in Tyler.  I mean, Sterling owned a big bank up in Tyler.  An, Marvin Griffin was pastor of the biggest black church.  He was kind of the T.D. Jakes [HistoryMaker Bishop T.D. Jakes] of his time, back--up in Dallas.  And, his daughter is, was a U.S. attorney here, Gaynelle Griffin Jones, for a long time.  She's not now, but.  And then so, all these people were, were really prominent in Texas circles back then and really, you know, sort of had influence from behind the scenes.  But this is prior to the time when they were, this really, as we say, prior to the time when there were black elected officials in Texas.  It was just before there were black elected officials.  So, you know, Barbara Jordan was elected to the [U.S.] Congress.  She's the first black federally elected, you know--on the federal level, elected official from Texas since Reconstruction.  And her initial election would have been '72 [1972].  So, it was just before that time.
Story_ID: 620463
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your high school [Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Junior high school actually.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Cullen [Cullen Junior High School; Cullen Middle School, Houston, Texas], and you went from one environment to another.  Tell me more about what was going on in that junior high school.  Now, I assume that the kids came from different areas.
Speaker 2: They did.  I mean, generally, you know, they came from just a, the high, the junior high school is located in, it's about two or three miles away.  And so, and it was in a much more challenged area economically, and it was, and you know, not only that but the whole society was going through a real transition then.  So, not only--so this neighborhood was, and society was, and it was just a, it was a rough place to be.  I had not been, as I earlier described, my elementary school [Lockhart Elementary School, Houston, Texas] was really a sweet spot in life.  I mean, it was just a special little place where, you know, the kids were really, I think, sheltered from a lot of what was going on.  In a nice way.  And, then it was, it was, you know, it was prime time, when I got to junior high school.  It was kind of how the world seemed to, the rougher sort of the world really worked, the rougher side of the world.
Speaker 1: Did you have any challenges academically because of this, the school?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, not really.  I mean, in fact, academically it got easier in a sense.  Because all of a sudden I was competing against a lot of kids who really didn't care.  I mean, and, you know, I was into contexts where I really did feel like I was well prepared academically to take on those challenges.  And, then a lot of the teachers really embraced that.  'Cause I think a lot of teachers felt under siege too at that school.  And again, they were largely white and the kids were not.  And, you know, so, so, the kids who were academically inclined and basically weren't raising hell were kind of the kids that, that, that, you know, found favor with them.  So, I was certainly kind of more in that group.  But, I was kind of straddling the line a little bit 'cause, you know, I always, you know, you know, kind of didn't--I was a sports guy.  I mean, I was playing football and I was doing stuff and I was socially conscious, and--so, all at the time.  But, I wan- I was trying to make decent grades and stuff too.
Speaker 1: Well, how was it now having white teachers and white students?  What did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: I--just--
Speaker 1: Because you said you hadn't met any white people--
Speaker 2: I hadn't.  I hadn't.
Speaker 1: Before that time.
Speaker 2: No.  I re- I hadn't.
Speaker 1: What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was confusing a little bit.  It was confusion.  I just didn't quite understand, you know, the white people I saw portrayed on television were not quite the same as the people I saw at school I guess.  I mean, I, and I didn't really know.  I mean, they weren't very many white students at school at all, so.  And, I can't remember any that I knew, to tell you the truth.  So, it was that few.  I did know several white teachers.  But, you know, it was, it was just sort of confusing.  It was sort of confusing.  I did have the sense that my teachers were pretty well meaning though.  I mean, I didn't have the sense that they weren't.  But, there was some teachers--and, what was confusing I guess is there were some teachers at the school who, actually these were black teachers, who were extremely socially conscious.  A couple in particular who--and I just, you know, and they sort of had followings among the students and they sort of exhort to students I think to be more socially conscious.  And, there was a real, almost a separatist movement at the time.  And, there was a lot of conversation about, you know, sort of peaceful nonviolent versus, you know, in resistance versus violence.  And, it seemed to me, I mean, I guess really what the point of all this is, is that I was, I think I was just too young for that conversation, in a sense.  I mean, just not ready for it.  And, the fact that, you know, I confronted it, or at least you know, was confronted with it, when I got to this school, was just confusing to me 'cause I just kind of didn't know quite how to process it.
Story_ID: 620464
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to, I went to Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia.  Which, you know, talk about yet another completely different environment.  Episcopal High School in Virginia was established in 1839 as a school, a boarding school for, you know, elite white families of the South.  And, and, they had not had a black student prior to the year before I went there in 1969.  So, it was all white, all boarding, all southern.  And, so, it was really different.
Speaker 1: How were you recruited to go to that school?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there, there's a pretty good story there too.  I--the, when I was at this junior high school, Cullen [Cullen Junior High School; Cullen Middle School, Houston, Texas], I was asked to take a standardized test called the PSAT [Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test].  And, apparently scored pretty well on it.  And, as a result, there was a group that was actually led by Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], again.  When I was in the eighth grade, I got a call from a woman in North Carolina who suggested that they had been made aware of my test scores on this standardized test and that they were interested in my being part of this program to integrate elite prep schools--boarding schools.  And, I, well actually my counselor got this call and I was made aware of it.  And, they sent two people down to interview me.  And, one of 'em was Vernon Jordan.  And, as it turns out, the scholarship fund was started by a woman who was the principal heir to the Reynolds Tobacco [R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company] fortune in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  And, she--and Vernon Jordan was on their board of directors.  He was, you know, on the board of directors of Reynolds Tobacco.  RJR Nabisco [RJR Nabisco, Inc.], it came to be, but Reynolds Tobacco at the time, and she asked him to take a real role in this.  And he was of course head of the Urban League [National Urban League] at the time.  And, I, of course, had met him before.  As I mentioned, he'd been to our house and anyway, so, they came down and they interviewed me and they actually asked three or four boys in Houston [Texas] to be part of this program.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the program?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was called the Stouffer program [Anne C. Stouffer Foundation scholarships].  The Stouffer program.  And, so, there were these kids, about twenty of us from all around the country who--these black boys who went to integrate these southern prep schools.  And, each of us went to a different one.  And, they brought us all together, and it was actually, it's fascinating when I think back on it.  They brought us all together in the summer of 1969 or '68 [1968].  I think it was '69 [1969].  That summer when they brought of together at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina].  And, we all lived in House P at Duke University.  And, we took reading, writing, and arithmetic.  We were sort of to learn, you know, kind of what we should've learned up until then.  For six weeks we were at Duke.  And, then for the seventh week, we went to this woman's estate outside of Winston-Salem.  All I remember was everybody had a bedroom.  And, which was, you know, kind of amazing, right.  You had just--everybody had a bedroom.  And, Vernon was there and his first wife [Shirley Yarbrough Jordan] who had MS [multiple sclerosis], but she was on a cane then.  Anyway, and Howard, what's his name?  He was, he was black and he was the mayor of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  I cannot remember his name.  Howard Davis [sic. Howard N. Lee], maybe.  Anyway, there was another, in--it was, it was really something.  So, we spent--[HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was there, and we spent the week together and they had the, you know, meetings and so forth and talking about what our experience would be like.  And then we went off to all these different schools in the fall of that year.
Story_ID: 620465
Speaker 1: And so, I went to this environment which was completely different yet again 'cause, you know, just on a number of levels.  I mean, I'd never lived away from home.  I'd never, not lived, you know--I went to school with black people, and you know.  It was just totally foreign to me.  I never, you know, and I--now, by this time I had met some white people.  But, I certainly didn't, you know, live with 'em every day.  And, they weren't southern white people.  I mean, these were real white people (laughter).  I mean, they were, you know, in a--I mean, they just, you know, they talked different, they sounded different.  They, you know, it was--and these were people who were from a different, cut from a different bolt of cloth.  I mean, they were really of the Old South.  Lots of Confederate flags, lots of, you know, it's just, it was that kind of environment.  And that was tough.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Was it intimidating for you?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was intimidating.  It was, it was, you know, it's hard to understand.  It was confusing yet again.  I remember, you know, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in the spring of the year that I went.  So, I hadn't gotten there yet.
Speaker 2: That was in '68 [1968] then.
Speaker 1: Right.  I hadn't gotten there yet but, you know, I was--and I remember being told by the, by people that when it was announced that day that people clapped there, right, you know it was like--so, it was that kind of environment, right.  I mean, it was just a, anyway, so, you know, but it--I felt like, I'm gonna say, I mean, I felt like it was important what I was doing, you know.  Like my father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] many years before had gone into that sort of environment, but on a bigger scale.  I thought that, you know, it was important what I was doing.  But, it still, it was rough, you know, and it was rough being away from home, away from friends.
Speaker 2: So, how did you learn to cope?  What did you have to do to be able to deal with the teachers and the students?  Was there someone that you could look to for encouragement?  Was there a teacher or a counselor or anyone?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, in--I think we always have to remember that it, there are always ports in the storm.  I mean, as bad as it may seem, and it really did seem bad to me when I got there.  I mean, I, mostly though, not because of the racial animosity or the difficulties there.  That certainly was a factor.  But, it was just being homesick.  I mean, I jus- I hadn't been away from home like that, you know, not living with my family and my brother [John S. Chase, III], you know, just, just being.  And, when they put out--there were two black kids who started.  They both came out of this program.  So, me, and another guy name Jeff Melvin, we were the two guinea pigs.  And, they put us each in singles, right.  So, you know, 'cause they didn't wanna, I assume the thing it was, they didn't wanna offend anybody else's parents by putting us as roommate with them and, you know, I don't know.  So, anyway, we were in singles.  So, we were in solitary rooms, and it was just lonely.  I mean, and we were in different dorms too.  I mean, so, there was three dorms on campus, and he was in one, I was in another, and there was just, there was just--pretty lonely.  I didn't know anybody up there.  It was a long way from home.  It just was a tough, tough situation.  And, and, so, the first couple years of that were pretty, pretty rough.  But, you know, some wonderful things happened.  I went to my mailbox one day, this was, you know, well before email and all that kind of good stuff, and I had a letter in my mailbox from a woman who was the wife of a local Houston [Texas] congressman who knew I was at that school [Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia].  'Cause it was right outside of Washington, D.C., really.  It was in Alexandria, Virginia.  So, there was Barbara Bush.  And, and she was--she wrote me a letter to invite me over for dinner.  And, and I went.  You know, her husband [George Herbert Walker Bush] the congressman was out of town and her son [George Walker Bush], the would be president, wasn't there.  But, you know, I met Jeb [Jeb Bush] and, you know, I kind of had a good time, and you know, the food was better than what I was used to.  And, it was real nice of her to do it.  And, actually, you know, ever since that time, you know, she and her husband are really gentle people.  I mean, I really sort of always felt that they were, you know, they always sort of came from the right place on issues that mattered.  And, which is more than I can say about the son.  But, you know, I guess they didn't raise him as well as they should have.
Story_ID: 620466
Speaker 1: --That was a rough experience [at Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia].  Yeah, no question about it.  First two years of it were rough.  I didn't do very well.  I did pretty well my first year academically, didn't do very well my sophomore year.  And, you know, really had to, you know, that I should leave and so forth.  But, I kind of got it together--
Speaker 2: But, what kept you going?
Speaker 1: You know, I'd--that's a very good question.  I don't know, I always had the sense that it was important.  I mean, you know, I had the sense that I was doing this just for me.  I had the sense that it was just important.  That there were people doing real hard stuff everywhere.  That there were people who were, you know, literally, at that time, dying and you know sort of prostrating themselves for the cause, and were really doing really hard stuff.  And, you know, this wasn't that hard.  I mean, I never thought, you know, look, I was sitting up with a bunch of rich people, you know, in kind of in the middle of nowhere from my sort of vantage point.  And it was, you know, and actually, it was, you know, if you look at on an objective level, it was actually pretty nice.  I mean, you sure didn't want for anything.  You didn't, you know--so, it was, so I felt it was important.
Speaker 2: Did you get involved in any of the activities, sports, music?
Speaker 1: I did.  I did.  And, that was kind of the savior for me at the end of the day.  I mean, I sort of immersed myself in different things there; sports, and particularly football, and lacrosse, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lacrosse, had you played lacrosse--?
Speaker 1: Never.  Never played it before I got there.  And, but, you know, we actually came to love it.  And, you know, was very active in it there and in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and set a record at college.  I think it's still there.  For goals scored by midfielder, and I, you know, I really enjoyed it.  And, never really would know it but for going to this school, and so, yes, I really got into sports.  And, after I got through my sophomore year, which was really the nadir for that whole experience, I really kind of got it together.  And, I kind of knew that if I really wanted to go to a good college and, you know, I needed to, you know, do something more than I was doing, that's for sure.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you thinking about college at this--I mean, what college or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was.  I was.  I mean, I--you know, I was always--my parents [Drucie Rucker Chase and HistoryMaker John S. Chase] never, you know, college was never a question in our house, you know.  You know, where, was a question but not, not whether, all right.  So, college was always on the map, and, and it was just a question of where.  And, I always felt like, there was some point at which during this time that, that I became to set myself, my sights on, you know, kind of a really like, you know, an elite education.  The top drawer kind of deal.  And, I think what the, the turning point for me was, in some way the turning point--when I was, when I was at this high school [Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia] one of the kids who was there, his father was a congressman from Georgia.  And, his father really liked this school.  I don't know if his father went there or not.  But, because, you know, rich kid, ever--all, it was all boarding but he could see his kid a lot 'cause he was right there, right outside of Washington [D.C.].  And, so, I worked for this guy.  He was a twelve-term congressman from Athens, Georgia.  His name was Robert Stephens [Robert Grier Stephens, Jr.], and you know, he looked like Colonel Sanders, right?  I mean, he was just straight out of a deal, and I remember he introduced me to--he asked me the last day I worked for him, then again, I was, I don't know, tenth grade or something.  And, he asked me if I had, if there was anything I wanted him to do for me.   And, I told him, "Yeah," that I wanted him to introduce me to this new congressman from Atlanta [Georgia] named [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, who'd just been elected.  And, he said, "Sure."  And, we got up and we talked down to Andy Young's office, and he introduced me to Andy Young.  And, man, I tell you what, I was just, I was, I was excited 'cause, you know, it just, it was exciting for me to meet Young, Barbara Jordan was new in the deal then.  And, she was up, you know, and they were impeaching Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], and it was, it just felt like the world was changing right before my eyes and all of sudden there was really an opportunity to be part of something special.
Speaker 1: So, how did you decide what college you would go to?
Speaker 2: Well, I distinctly remember applying to thirteen.  And, I got into all of 'em.  I was lucky.  And, mostly Ivy League schools.  I also applied to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], and Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And you know, and I think I just went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] 'cause it felt like, sounded like it was the best one to go to.  I mean, I think that was pretty much as simple as it was.
Story_ID: 620468
Speaker 1: Before you go on to college, during the summers that you were at the Episcopal High School [Alexandria, Virginia], did you go home during the summer or did you work there in Virginia?
Speaker 2: I went home.  I went home.  There wasn't a, you know, the option to stay there.  And, if there was, I sure wouldn't've wanted to.  But, I went home.  And, I worked during the summers.  I, you know, in my work during those summers was, you know, manual, menial stuff.  I needed to make some money and my father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] believed that, you know, you know, hard day's work never hurt anybody and like that.  So, I worked construction principally during the summer in Texas.  I remember I worked as a dishwasher one summer as well at a pancake house.  But, you know, they were good jobs for me.  I mean, I--
Speaker 1: Did you work for your dad?
Speaker 2: No.  I, you know, I can remember having worked for my dad when I was even younger than that and nobody else would hire me.  But, now, by that time, you know, you could, you know, find somebody to hire you to do that kind of stuff.  And, so, no, I worked for these other folks.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your relationship with, with your siblings.  Tell me your brothers and sisters names.
Speaker 2: Sure.   I have an older brother and a younger sister.  My brother's name is John Saunders Chase [John S. Chase, III], J-O-H-N, S-A-U-N-D-E-R-S, Chase, C-H-A-S-E, same as my dad.  I believe he's the third.  But, remember my paternal grandfather [John S. Chase, Sr.] was bit of a rolling stone so we're not too sure of that third, that he uses behind his name, he's been hopeful.  And, my brother is a lawyer.  He went to Rice [Rice University, Houston, Texas] to college and to the University of Houston law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas].  He is a municipal judge here in town.  And, and he's good guy.  My sister, Saundria Renee Chase Gray [Saundria Chase Gray] is also a lawyer.  Saundria, her name is spelled S-A-U-N-D-R-I-A, Renee, R-E-N-E-E, Chase, C-H-A-S-E, Gray, G-R-A-Y.  She is married to a news anchor here at Channel 2 [KPRC-TV, Houston, Texas], the NBC News anchor.  He's been local anchor here for the last fifteen or so years.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Jerome Gray.  And, she is a lawyer with Shell.  She is--Shell Oil Company, and they have a couple kids.  And, she is seven years younger.  She went to Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts] to college.  And she went to the University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: And, so, when did you work for the congressman?  Was that during the--what time was that?
Speaker 2: I worked for Congresswoman Jordan [Barbara Jordan], when--oh, oh, you mean Congressman Stephens [Robert Grier Stephens, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: Stephens.
Speaker 2: I worked for Stephens when I was in high school during, there is an inter-session period in January between semesters and so it was like a two, three week period where I worked for him.
Story_ID: 620469
Speaker 1: --You decide that you want to go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Do you know what course of study you're going to pursue (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  No, no, I didn't know anybody at Harvard.  I didn't know anything about Harvard really other than that, you know, it had a good name.  I didn't really know where it was.  I mean, not really.  No.  I didn't know anything about it.  In fact, I think sometimes when I look back on it and if I knew today, if I knew then what I knew today, you know, I might really have done things, some things a little differently.  But, no, I didn't know anything about it.  I applied--I remember when I spoke to my father [HistoryMaker John S. Chase] after I got my acceptance letters, you know.  He made something, he made a comment something to the effect, and nobody in our family has gone to Harvard, so I think you ought to go there.  So, I think that probably had more to do with it than anything.  But, no, I really didn't know anything about it.
Speaker 1: Did the high school, Episcopal High School [Alexandria, Virginia] prepare you for experience at Harvard?
Speaker 2: It did in curious ways.  I mean, I--it did.  Actually, it was probably really good preparation because, you know, Harvard was yet another wholly different environment still.  But it certainly had real similarities with what I'd seen in prep school.  I mean, you know, prep school was a challenging, academic environment and, you know, socially it was about, you know, kind of elites.  And, you know, even though it was, you know, southern elites and there was kind of a special flavor to what was going on there, it kind of gave me a good, you know, it was a good warm up.  Which is really kind of what it was because, you know, they--you know, when I got to Harvard it really was, you know, big time elites.  I felt like academic and financial and social elites sorta all coming together in one spot.  And, you know, international elites really, you know.  I remember meeting people.  I remember, you know, when I was a freshman, and the prime minister [Zulfikar Ali Bhutto] of Pakistan was the father of the woman who was just assassinated, right.  And, he, his head was chopped off when I was a freshman, and Benazir [Benazir Bhutto], who was a classmate, was in college with me at the time, as well as her younger sisters, Sanam [Sanam Bhutto].  And I remember thinking, you know, "This really is a whole different crowd."
Story_ID: 620470
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about the difference between Episcopal [Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia] and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and the people that were there.  Now, was it easier for you at Harvard than from--at Episcopal as far as moving around and getting to know people?  Was it--you said it was a different crowd.  Tell me why is was different.  Who were some of the people and was it easier?
Speaker 2: I think it was easier for me.  I'm at, you know, the one, you know, Harvard has limitless resources.  And, but, the single--you know, I mean, just limitless resources.  You know, funds to study research opportunities, libraries, you know, et cetera, but the--clearly the most impressive part of the mix were the students.  And I was just--and the people I was exposed to, and, so, you know, I mean, just, you know, in my own class there were, Bill Gates was in my class, Steve Ballmer, Yo-Yo Ma.  I mean, I, you know, I just felt like--Jim Cramer, there was just, I just felt like I was surrounded by just a wealth of just extremely talented people all the time.  And, and, so, and I developed, you know, relationships there that are as strong today as they were then.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: Well, my best friend today is David Wilkins [HistoryMaker David B. Wilkins].  He's a--he was my roommate in college, and in law school, and he is a professor at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] now.  And, he clerked for Thurgood Marshall on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and clerked on the Second Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit].  And, his father [Julian Wilkins] went to Harvard Law School which was just something, you know, something unknown to me.  And, you know, and he's my best friend.  And, I'm godfather of his son and he of mine.  And, it's just, you know, just amazing.  And, you know, he is literally one of, you know, a hundred people that I just consider to be very, very close friends.  Julie [Julieanna Richardson], and just a zillion people who I became very close to and who I felt like, I felt like had become, you know, some of my best friends in life.
Story_ID: 620471
Speaker 1: So, your course of study, what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) my course of study.  My course of study was economics and government.  That was my official course of study.  And, that really reflect my inability to, you know, my inability to, to pick and choose.  Well, I think I got to college thinking, harboring some hope that I might become a doctor.  Because when I grew up, where I grew up in that wonderful neighborhood I grew up in as, as wonderful as the school teachers, and the lawyers and the, you know, teachers at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] were, the people who seem to run everything to me were the doctors.  You know, there were just this group of black doctors who seem to, you know, they drove all the nice cars, and they had a great time, and they seem to, you know, run everything to me.  And so, I had this, you know, harbored this hope of becoming a doctor for some time until I, you know, had a rude awakening with a chemistry course in high school [Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia].  And, so, and even when I got to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I thought that I still might take, you know, organic and inorganic chemistry, and go to medical school.  But, you know, something happened along the way.  I mean, when I was a freshman or a sophomore, it was either a course I took or, or a speaker I heard.  And the course would've been, of course, on American government.  That was--the professor for which was a woman historian named Doris Kearns [Doris Kearns Goodwin], who just mesmerized me.  Both her teaching style and the subject at hand, I found fascinating.  And, so, I really was turned on by that.  And, then the other thing was Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] came to our campus that year.  And, and I, you know, I was again mesmerized by--maybe he was Ture, maybe he had changed his name by this time.  But, in any case, I was mesmerized by his eloquence and what he had to say.  And, I began to think that, my, you know, my life should go on a different path.  And, really medicine was not, not, not really the right, right path for me.  That law and politics and--this is when I worked for Barbara Jordan.  When, it's between--it's right at my freshman year in college.  And, so, I began to think that and then after that I worked for Lloyd Bentsen half of my sophomore year, and so I began to think that the politics and law might be the better path.
Speaker 1: Now, so, what classes, what courses did you begin with?  Or, politics, was it economics and government that you pursued?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, I mean, I ended up taking economics and government courses.  But, the courses that made the biggest impression on me, the single, you know, the courses that made the biggest impression were this government, this American government course I took, Doris Kearns.  I also took a course on slavery from a professor named David Donald [David Herbert Donald].  Who--that just, I was just enraptured by.  I mean, I had, you know, he had made his name at Millsaps College in Mississippi [Jackson, Mississippi] as an American historian, as a slave historian.  And, he had tape, slave tapes, tape narratives from slaves that he played during the class.  And, I was just fascinated by this course and his depth of knowledge and the perspectives on slavery and black people and Africans during the 19th century.  And, anyway, it was a course that, that opened my eyes.  I remember taking another course there, another history course.  It was history of medicine.  A professor named Stanley Reiser [Stanley Joel Reiser].  It was of course offered at Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts], of all places.  I ended up taking some pretty bizarre courses actually.  I think it was more because, you know, I didn't, I like to get up early now but I didn't then.  And, I think these courses fit the schedule best.  I took a course in Japanese literature from a professor named Howard Hibbett, who was a leading authority in Japanese literature at the time.  You'd think it would be a Japanese guy, but it wasn't.
Story_ID: 620472
Speaker 1: I took this really eclectic group of--array of courses that I was fascinated with.  And, I had never felt like that the academy was a place for me to excel.  I never felt like, you know, books and things were really something until I really got a taste of some of that.  But, the way they teach books isn't like anybody else does books.  And, I really, really got into it.  So, so, as a consequence, I mean, I was really trying to party and have a good time when I was in college.  And, I really did have a good time while I was in college.
Speaker 2: So, social life got a lot better.
Speaker 1: Social life got a lot better.  And, there is one, there is one difference between high school [Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia] and college for me is that social life got a lot better.  It really did.  It really did.
Speaker 2: Were you were, you were involved with the radio station at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: I was.  I was.  I was--
Speaker 2: How so?
Speaker 1: Well, I was a (laughter), it was--when I was a freshman at Harvard I went to compete to join WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.], not WHUR, that's at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], WHRB [WHRB Radio, Cambridge, Massachusetts], which was Harvard's radio station.  And, I went to join the jazz department.  Because there was a guy who was a senior named Wylie Rollins who was the head of the jazz department.  And, this was course wouldn't, you know, music was on albums and they had a library of ten thousand jazz albums.  And, I remember thing of what was really the coolest thing about it was that you could get--there was two jazz clubs in Boston [Massachusetts].  One was called Paul's Mall [Boston, Massachusetts] and the other was called The Jazz Workshop [Boston, Massachusetts].  And, I went to listen to Charles Mingus one night, and you could go for free, if you were part of the jazz department at WHRB, you get a pass.  And, and, I went to listen Mingus play the bass, and I guess I was transformed.  I listened to Miles [Miles Davis] play the trumpet.  And, you know, life was different.  I really, I listened to those things and it just really had a big, big time impact on me.  And, so, I really got into this, into understanding more about jazz and the antecedents of jazz.  And, as a result, classical music because, you know, that really was a, is a cousin to it.  And so, I really began to learn a lot as a res--.  And, I had a radio station, radio station, I had a radio show at WHRB.  Now, after being there for a semester or so, maybe I was a sophomore then, together with David Wilkins [HistoryMaker David B. Wilkins] called 'Night Birds' [ph.].  And, so, he had twelve o'clock to three o'clock in the morning, we had this radio show.  And, man, it was really great.  It was great.  That was before digital.
Speaker 2: So, what other activities, or what else was going on, even in the country during this time?  'Cause you, you graduate in--
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973] to '77 [1977].  You know, it was a time that was, it was great for me.  I mean, I was, I was doing lots of stuff on campus.  I played football.  I was playing lacrosse.  I was a student director of the Institute of Politics at Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  It was before the Kennedy school of public policy was even started.  It was the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics, and of course, the president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had been assassinated for ten years by then.  But his widow [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] was the chairwoman of the institute and I got to meet her.  And, and participate in the Kennedy institute.  In fact, you know, a guy [Kenton W. Keith] who I met at the Kennedy institute when I was a freshman or a sophomore was a fellow at the institute I had dinner with just the other night, a week ago.  He was ambassador to Qatar, appointed by Bush 41 [President George Herbert Walker Bush], who the president later introduced me to because of that dinner I went to at this house, that he wasn't there for.  But, and, you know, anyway, it's interesting how networks work.  But yeah, it was full time for me.  This is '73 [1973] to '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Now, was your radio show your first taste of communications?
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much was.  It pretty much was.  I was, it's what sort of got me interested, and got me involved in the media, and, and I fell in love with it from there.
Speaker 2: Did you take any communication classes?
Speaker 1: No.  (Laughter) No.  I spent a lot time at the radio stations, thought I knew everything there was to know about it.  It's what kind of led me to, you know, I mean, my first entrepreneur adventure really was to buy a small radio station some years later.  And, it's really what--and, when I was in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I wrote a paper about how to by a radio station using tax credits and sort of creative financing.  But that's where it really started.
Story_ID: 620473
Speaker 1: So, you graduate and what happens next?
Speaker 2: I graduate from college in 1977 and I go straight to law school, Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and do a joint program at Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] and get a J.D. and an M.B.A. over the next four years, between '77 [1977] and '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: So, how did you come to decide, because you were doing American studies and economics and government, what made you decide to go to law school?
Speaker 2: I didn't wanna get a job (laughter), you know, didn't wanna get a real job.  I mean, that was really the truth, I mean, I, you know, I felt like, you know, the more intere- in a sense it was an affirmation of how good a time I was having.  Because I was having such a good time that I stayed there.  I mean, I was, you know, 'cause when I got to my senior year in college, you know, I applied to a few different law schools and I was pretty successful doing that.  You know, Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California], Berkeley [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], you know, here and there and, but, I stayed.  And, the reason I stayed probably more than any other things was because my roommate, David [HistoryMaker David B. Wilkins], applied to Harvard Law School and got in, and he was staying.  And so, that was probably the single biggest reason.  But, in a larger sense it was also because I really did have a network there that I felt I could rely on, and, and sort of grow with.  Also, came to have a substantial amount of respect for what, you know, the, the resources and the opportunities that Harvard could provide.  Sometimes I wonder in retrospect whether I should've, you know, gone to a different place, you know, just to get a different experience if nothing else.  But, but I didn't.
Story_ID: 620474
Speaker 1: Law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], business, M.B.A.  Did you have any idea what you would do after you graduated?
Speaker 2: No.  I had none.  You know, I didn't have any.  I didn't have any money.  So, I knew I wanted to make some money and I, but I didn't have any idea of what I wanted to do.  I will say this, my enduring memory of those years, my graduate school years, was being stupid.  I mean, my sense was that, I always wondered kind of how I got in in a sense.  Because I remember distinctly sitting in class and people would raise their hands and they'd get called on and they give these answers.  And, I think, how do you think of that?  I mean, I didn't think of that.  This was particularly was true in law school.  I mean, you know, felt it to a certain degree at Harvard Business [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  But, certainly in law school, I felt like, my gracious, these people are really smart and, and I really don't deserve to be here.  And, so, and that sort of reflected, you know, a lot about my experience during graduate school.  Which is to say that I felt like, I really didn't feel like I worked very hard while I was in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], or that I needed to.  I had a good time, I was doing extracurricular stuff, as I mentioned, sports, in student politics, this that and the other, radio station [WHRB Radio, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But, when I was in graduate school, I felt like I needed every ounce, every iota of brain power that I didn't have in order to, you know, kind of get through it.  Because I felt like I was really grouped with some smart people and I needed to step it up.
Speaker 1: Explain to me how this works.  You're going to the business school and to law school.  So, it's back and forth?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Tell me how that, that works.
Speaker 2: Well, here's the way it works.  In the first year, it's all the first year of law school.  In the second year, it's all the first year of business school.  And, then the third and the fourth year are mixtures, where you go back and forth to each school and take courses at each.  I--you know, I enjoyed it.  I mean, I actually really did enjoy it.  I felt like it was a real accomplishment to go to both.  And, I felt like each institution is, you know, prestigious in its own right.  And, really, you know, and plus, you know, I went to law school after college with the thought of kind of being a politician really, I think.  I mean, I didn't really wanna be a lawyer.  I never really had it sort of, you know, in me to be a lawyer.  I never really wanted to write contracts and litigate disputes and that kind of thing.  I was really going there because of politics, because of debate.  And I was really kind of saved by business school in a sense.  Because, I, you know, it wasn't until I got to business school I really realized that that's really what I wanted to do was business.  I mean, all this law stuff was just, you know, you know, I really, business is what ultimately captivated my attention.  And, and, I thought where I could be the most creative and really apply my skills in a way that, that would, would be the most out of 'em.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite course in business school?
Speaker 2: My favorite course, you know, I really didn't have one.  I mean, I tell you what I had, was favorite professors, you know.  So, my fav- the answer to that question then would be the courses that they taught, right.  And, I sorta think they could've taught anything.  And, it was really them.  There was one professor in particular named Michael Porter who taught competitive strategy who I just thought was, you know, I just, I just really enjoyed him.  But, you know, my favorite courses were actually in the law school interestingly enough.  I mean, I took a course on racism in American law from Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] that was really special.   I took a course, a torts course, was of course was taught by this guy named Duncan Kennedy, who I think still is one of the smartest people I'll ever meet.  I mean, I couldn't understand half of what he had to say but I could tell it was really smart (laughter), you know.  I mean, it's like that.  In--and then I took a course from, the civil procedure course from a fellow named David Shapiro [David L. Shapiro], who was in a wheelchair and had to hold his head up with his hands, but was brilliant.  I mean, he, he was just brilliant.   You know, just incredible.  In fact, I see Stephen Hawking the physicist sometimes, you know, and he reminds me of this guy because, you know, his life was as much about a triumph over his disability as it was about his brilliance.  But, you know, this guy was the same way.  But, those professors in law school were just something.  They were just, you know, they were like, you know, they were just like Icarus, their stars just shone really brightly.  Their brilliance was really something.
Story_ID: 620475
Speaker 1: So, business is really, now, what you think you're going to focus on?
Speaker 2: Well, it has been.  I mean, I, you know, when I graduated from law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and business school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] I went to work for an investment banking firm on Wall Street for, well, I went to work for two investment banking firms after graduating from business school.  And, that took up about eight or nine years.  And, then--
Speaker 1: What, okay, which banks?
Speaker 2: I worked for Rotan Mosle [Rotan Mosle, Inc., Houston, Texas], and Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about the first one.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Rotan Mosle is actually here in Houston [Texas].  And, I came back here--I married a woman named Debra Martin, who is now [HistoryMaker] Debra Martin Chase, who is a movie producer and sort of in her own right, I mean, of some note.  And, you know, that was pretty wonderful.  I mean, I think it was.  She might not (laughter), but I think it was.  And, you know, we were too young and kind of too silly to really, you know, make it work for a long period of time.  But, but, we were married for six or seven years, and she came to Houston with me.  We--she graduated from law school with me.
Speaker 1: This was in 1981?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-one [1981], exactly.  We both graduated from law school that year.  And, I graduated from business school as well and we came to Houston.  She got a job working for a law firm that she hated.  I got a job working for an investment banking firm.  I didn't hate it but, you know, I really wanted to be in business for myself.  And, all of this was kind of an angle to that.
Story_ID: 620476
Speaker 1: They were always an avenue towards, for me, once I got somewhere in graduate school or just out, I knew I wanted to be in business for myself.  And, and I knew it was, as I, yeah, I wrote about acquiring a radio station when I was in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].   So--
Speaker 2: Was that the only paper that you wrote?
Speaker 1: No.  It wasn't the only one.  But, it's the only one I remember (laughter).  It wasn't--it was the only one that was worth anything.  I remember writing a paper when I was in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] about Barbara Jordan.  I wrote it for [HistoryMaker] Martin Kilson, who's a government professor in college.  And, I got an A plus on the paper.  I don't think I ever got an A plus on anything at Harvard other than this paper which is why I remember it, so.
Speaker 2: So, in--from '81 [1981] until what year did you work for the investment banking firm [Rotan Mosle, Inc.] here in Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981] to '84 [1984].  And, then DLJ [Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette] from '84 [1984], in New York [New York], from '84 [1984] to '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: So, you left Houston and went to New York?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, tell me what was your position at Donaldson and--?
Speaker 1: I ultimately became a vice president.  I don't know what I start--I probably started as an associate.
Speaker 2: This is from '84 [1984] until--
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 2: Until '89 [1989].  But, so, tell me what experience did you gain?
Speaker 1: Well, it was a great experience.  I mean, I was, there I was working on, when--in Houston, it was a great job to work in an investment banking firm in Houston.  But, here primarily oil and gas, energy were the clients, companies, advising them on raising capital for their projects and structuring capital transactions.  I went to New York because I really wanted to work for communication companies and working in that industry.  And, that's what I was able to do at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette was focused exclusively on communications companies and in particularly on broadcasting companies.
Speaker 2: So, you stayed there until '89 [1989]?
Speaker 1: I did.  I stayed there until '89 [1989] and then I came back to Houston.  And, I came back with the idea of starting my own business.  I didn't have any money so I needed to get a job, and then have the money not to have a job.  So, I started to teach law.  I got a job.  You might wonder how I would get a job teaching law since I never practiced law.  I took the bar when I got out of school.  But, you know, I never practiced.  But, I'd done pretty well in law school notwithstanding all my fears while I was there.  And, so, the University of Houston law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas] hired me as an assistant professor teaching contracts and communications law.  And, and, I started teaching over there in 1990.  And, I really liked it.  I got tenure as a full professor in 1994.  And I'm still on their faculty today.  In fact, I taught two classes this morning.  Along the way, you know, I always wanted to start my business.  So, you know, being a law professor is a loophole in life.  I mean, it really is, you know, it kind of gives you an opportunity to, to do other stuff.  And, so, I started in 1990.  In 1992 I bought my first radio station [KGGR Radio, Dallas, Texas].  It's a small, day timer, AM in Dallas [Texas].  And black gospel, AM, and I loved it.  I thought I knew everything there was to know about radio stations from my experience at Harvard [WHRB Radio, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I didn't.  And, I quickly learned.  And, I also was running this business remotely.  I mean, Dallas, as you'll learn tomorrow, is a long way from Houston.  And, I, you know, but I learned a lot.  And, turned that station around after a couple of tough years.
Speaker 2: Now, one--let me ask you this.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: What did you learn about the difference, or what was some of the challenges for minorities as far as dire- you know, broadcasting, in--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Broadcasting?
Speaker 1: Well, there were lots of challenges, you know.  There were none in it.  There--not in ownership and there're none really in it anywhere else.  In front of the camera, behind the camera, in front of microphone, behind the microphone.  There's just nobody.  There're, you know, there're just none in it.  And, I--so, the challenges were everywhere.  I think the biggest challenge though was capital.  You know, there were, you know, radio stations were expensive.  And so, where do you go get the capital to do that?  That was probably the single biggest challenge.
Story_ID: 620477
Speaker 1: When you worked for Donaldson [Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, New York, New York], you advised large corporations--well tell me what is it that you, that you did there?
Speaker 2: I advised large companies on how to raise money for their capital structure, equity, debt, capital, how to properly capitalize their capital structure for projects that they were contemplating.  Acquisition, projects, et cetera.  And so, it was really about the business of raising money.
Speaker 1: And, who were some of the corporations?  Was Cablevision [Cablevision Systems Corporation] part of working with them as far as finances?
Speaker 2: Never Cablevision.  But, we did work with cable companies.  Time Warner [Time Warner Cable] we did.  We did a lot of work with Clear Channel Broadcasting [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.].  A lot of work with CBS.
Speaker 1: So, this kind of set the stage for you now to, when you said you bought your first radio station [KGGR Radio, Dallas, Texas] but yet financing was a challenge but then you continued to buy stations.  So, was this a stepping stone, learning how to do this?
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: Or, actually--well, talk to--speak to that.
Speaker 2: Sure.  I mean, you know, capital--radio stations at the time sold anywhere from half a million to $100 million each.  And so capital required to acquire a radio station was really important.  It was important to be able not only to raise the capital or to attract the capital necessary to make those acquisitions but, really to attract the right type of capital in the right amounts and at the right prices.  And, really to construct the capital structure that made sense going forward.  And it was though, it's those types of experience.  I mean, that's precisely what I did when I was in New York [New York], and it helped a lot when I went into business for myself.
Story_ID: 620478
Speaker 1: And the gospel station [KGGR Radio, Dallas, Texas], was there, was it the right price, is that why you purchased the gospel station first?
Speaker 2: Well, sort of.  I mean, it was a combination of things.  I mean, you know, it was opportunity, an opportunity to purchase the station at that time.  The station was actually owned by a fellow in Louisville, Kentucky who inherited the stations from his parents, who died suddenly in a car accident.  And, he inherited several stations, five or six.  One of which was in Dallas [Texas].  And he sort of didn't know what to do with it.  He didn't wanna run it.  And, I made him an offer and he accepted.
Speaker 1: And, what was his name?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm blanking on his name right now.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: So, tell me more about the gospel network.
Speaker 2: Well, I started off with one station in Dallas, Texas.  And, we eventually grew it across all of Texas, and Louisiana, and Mississippi.  One contiguous signal that broadcast gospel music, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  And, it was, it was really something to behold.  I mean, it really was faith in, in black consumers and markets, rural markets largely across the South and, and really faith that that could translate into a bible business model.  At that time, broadcasting, radio broadcasting to minority markets was highly fragmented.  And, really was, was R&B, and, and, and to the extent there was gospel.  It was ministers who would purchase time on Sundays to preach and ask for money.  And, it really wasn't a consolidated effort, a coordinated effort to organize gospel music into a recognizable and discrete format.  And, and, that's really what we did.  And, it really provided a platform for artist and music writers, and gospel practitioners across the spectrum I think to really show their creativity.  It also made some good money.  And, and, that's really what I was, you know, sort of one of the real motivating factors for me.  I mean, it was, part of it was to be creative and create something that hadn't been done before.  At the time, less than 2 percent of broadcast properties across the country were owned by African Americans, or Hispanics.  And so, this whole notion of buying radio stations was really pretty foreign.  But, we were able to get it done.  And, I think the principal impediment we had to cross was having a viable business model, one that made sense.  And the only way to make sense was to make money.  And we were able to do that.  I mean, it had some, some pretty trying times in the beginning but we were able to, you know, really put a lot of the doubts to rest by actually putting it all together in the end.  And, then, we, we basically took that same formula and began to buy.  We gained creditability in the market from that experience.  And, we began to buy, you know, traditional format stations.  And, larger stations, larger FM stations in major markets, including Houston [Texas].  And we were able to buy those and bring our business practices to those stations and have them either make money where they hadn't made money before, or make more money where, where--than they had before.  So, it all worked out pretty good.  And, then, that--we took the bundle of stations and sold them really into sales to, to Clear Channel [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.].  We sold a group of stations to Clear Channel.  And we also sold another group of stations, interestingly enough, to the Catholic church.

Speaker 1: Herb Wilkins [HistoryMaker Herbert P. Wilkins, Sr.], do you know--?
Speaker 2: I do.  Syncom [Syncom Venture Partners] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Syncom.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Who doesn't know Herb?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Herb's a legend.  You know, he's a legend in this business.  I mean, Herb is one of the, one of the only people, really, of color whose name regularly comes up when you talk about capital in this space.  And, Herb's been there a long time.  He's been, you know, doing venture capital and supporting black communication entrepreneurs for a long, long time.  You know, I, you know, while Herb and I never did business together, he certainly gave me wise advice a lot.
Speaker 1: Can you think of one thing that sticks in your mind that might have, you know--?
Speaker 2: About Herb (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--no, advice that he might have given you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  I--you know, I tell you, I tell you what (laughter), I tell you what, what comes to my mind about Herb and sort of, you know, maybe even make, make more sense in this HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] context.  It's just how small this world really is.  Now, you know, you know, Herb and I were sort of in the same business, which is not a black man's business.  And, we were kind of in the same end of it.  Which was sort of ownership and finance, which is really not a black man's business, for a long time.  But, Herb and I didn't meet each other because of that.  We met each other because Herb dated a cousin of mine in Washington [D.C.], who--some time ago I mentioned a fellow named M.J. Anderson who was part of this sort of informal group of older black men who kind of met with, you know, Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and John Connally and made decisions about things.  And, one of those--and, M.J. Anderson's daughter was the woman that is a cousin of mine and who actually dated Herb, and who introduced me to Herb.  And, when I was first, you know, sort of thinking about going off on my own in the radio business, it was Herb who really gave me insight into who was, who I could do business with, who was trustworthy, who wasn't.  Invaluable advice.

Speaker 1: While you are operating these broadcast stations, you're still teaching.  Are you still teaching?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was until, you know, you know, my story is, is--I imagine everyone thinks their story is a little unique, but mine seems so to me.  I mean, I bought the first station [KGGR Radio, Dallas, Texas] in '92 [1992].  And, then between '92 [1992] and '97 [1997] bought about a dozen more.  During that same period, you know, I was, you know, a real communications entrepreneur, so somewhere about '95 [1995] I got involved in an auction to buy Spectrum [Spectrum Cellular Corporation, Dallas, Texas] from the federal government of which to offer cell phone service.  And a business that I sold to Qualcomm in 1998.  That business actually became Cricket phone [Cricket Wireless LLC] today which is, is--and, so, I went on, and so I was on the board of directors for Cricket until about a year ago, for the last ten or twelve years.  And, then around '97 [1997] or so, I started a call center company that end up doing customer service principally for AT&T [AT&T Inc.], and that I sold to AT&T in December of last year.  So, really, the businesses that I was involved in were three.  There were the broadcasting, the radio broadcasting business.  I owned one television station during that time, but it really wasn't significant in the, in the mix.  And, then I owned a, started really, a cell phone service provider which is Cricket phone today.  And, then I started this customer service business, which, which we just sold to AT&T.  So, it really was the combination of those three business over the last fifteen years that I've spent the majority of my time prosecuting.  And, and I did start, I was teaching full-time when I first bought that first radio station.  Along around '94 [1994] I got tenure at the law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas].  And, really, when I got tenured, I went to the dean and sugg- and thought that, you know, I had a few employees then and I had travel to do and other things that were, were occupying my time, and so I asked for a leave.  And, I went on leave really until, until this semester.  I sold, as I mentioned, I sold that last company to AT&T December, two or three months ago.  And so, I went back to teach with tenure in 1994.
Speaker 1: So, in 1994, okay, well, let's go to '95 [1995], you publish an article, 'Race, Culture and Contract Law' ['Race, Culture, and Contract Law: From the Cottonfield to the Courtroom,' Anthony R. Chase]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you talk to me about that?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Sure.  I published an article in the University of Connecticut Law Review [Connecticut Law Review] called, 'Race, Culture and Contract Law.'  It really was about--contract law has always fascinated me, and I in part, and history it fascinated me as I sort of describing some of my courses that I particularly enjoyed in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And, one of the things that was always of great interest was, now, how bargains are made.  And, the fact that, at least during slavery, people were the subject of bargains, or property and traded back and forth.  And so, understanding that dynamic was important to me.  And, I also had an interest in understanding the dynamic of people who were different at the bargaining table.  So, you know, and whether or not it made a difference if you were a woman bargaining for, you know, your car to be fixed or whether you were bargaining, you're a black person bargaining to buy a radio station.  Or, you know, whether those things made a tangible difference in the negotiation dynamic at the bargaining table.  And, I, and you know, I think, you know, I think there's evidence and indication that in fact they do.  And how you account for that and counteract that has always been of, not only sort of scholarly and academic interest, but practical interest as well.
Story_ID: 620481
Speaker 1: --In 1996 legislation was passed around industry consolidation.  Talk to be about what that meant for you and your companies.
Speaker 2: It meant, free at last, free at last, for me.  I mean, I, you know, sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, I guess.  I went into the radio broadcasting business with the idea that I really knew how to run a radio station.   Based principally upon my experience in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And, the true to the matter is that I really didn't.  I mean, the truth of the matter is that, I mean, I, you know, I feel like I'm just as capable as the next guy certain.  But, I wasn't nearly as prepared in terms of subjective knowledge as, as I thought I was.  And, and, I kind of got my head handed to me the first year or so when I was operating the station [KGGR Radio, Dallas, Texas].  It was a valuable experience.  But, certainly nothing meant more to my net worth than the change in the law in '96 [1996].  And, while I was, I felt confident as a radio station operator, the value of every radio station in the United States tripled or quadrupled on the day this legislation was passed.  Because all of a sudden the Clear Channels [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.] of the world, CBS Radios of the world, Infinity [Infinity Broadcasting Corporation], Cumulus [Cumulus Media], they could own a hundred stations and not just six as they were limited to at the time.  And, so, the value of those properties went up dramatically.  And, I just happened to be holding 'em.  And, I didn't, you know, I'll love to tell you I knew it was coming and I'll love to tell you that it's the reason I bought 'em in the first place.  But, sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.
Speaker 1: Did you know, or do you know, Bill Kennard [William E. Kennard]?
Speaker 2: I do.  I do, very well.  Very well.  It was such an interesting time when I was a member of the regulator community, the Federal Communications Commission [FCC].  But, to your question, did I know Bill Kennard?  Yes, absolutely.  In fact, my dad [HistoryMaker John S. Chase], as you know, is an architect.  Bill's dad [Robert A. Kennard] is an architect.  And, Bill's dad and my dad were the co-founders in the National Organization of Minority Architects, probably forty years ago.  And, Bill grew up in Los Angeles [California].  I grew up in Houston [Texas].  But our families were good friends because our fathers were good friends and contemporaries.  And, so, we actually even went on a vacation together when we were in elementary school.  And Bill's sister, Lydia [Lydia Kennard], was in my law school class at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so, I've known Bill and Lydia for a long, and their parents for a long, long time.  When Bill became chairman of the FC- and Bill was general counsel to the National Association of Broadcasters before he was chairman of the FCC.  So, Bill's been, you know, you know, helpful, and a mentor and somebody I've looked up to for a long, long time.  And, certainly when he became chairman of the FCC, that was a big deal.  That was just a big damn deal.  And, I'll never forget it.  In fact, much of my success really in the communications space attributes to that, flows from that, from his nomination and confirmation.  Because it was only after that that many of the opportunities that arose for me really the real opportunities the big ones began to come along.  You know, opportunities with AT&T [AT&T Inc.], opportunities that people understood that I, you know, had a relationship with Bill.  And, not that, you know, that afforded me any, any opportunities than anybody else didn't have.  But, this was sort of a way that other people had done business in the past and all of a sudden, you know, here, here it was I knew, I knew the guy, and I knew the man.  And, it was, it was nice.  It was nice.  And, so, I remember I visited Bill often when he was chairman.  I visited him often when he was chairman.  In fact, I went--he's now, he works at Carlyle [The Carlyle Group] in Washington [D.C.] and he's doing a great job there.  And, I went to see him not too long ago, just--not six months ago.  He's a great guy.  And it was a wonderful thing when he was chairman of the FCC.
Story_ID: 620482
Speaker 1: So, you said, opportunities and great deals came your way like the AT&T [AT&T Inc.] deal.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What, what else?  Well, describe what did that mean to you, AT&T deal?  Describe that to me.
Speaker 2: You know, it was incredible.  I mean, you know, it was just incredible.  I was--I think it's fair to say that my company was the premier, certainly minority vendor.  But, maybe even vendor in a way.  Vendor, partner to AT&T for ten years.  You know, I talk to the chairman of AT&T once a month probably for ten years.  You know, we were on just, you know, a whole host of topics, you know, political, and business, and legal.  And, we were really in their fraternity of, of close associates.  And it really made a huge difference.  It made a huge difference in the opportunities that were made available to us; the capital that was made available to us; the types of employees that we had the opportunity to hire; the types of facilities that we operated from; the types of opportunities that we had the opportunity to look at.  It was nothing short of incredible.
Speaker 1: And, ChaseCom [ChaseCom L.P.; ChaseSource], is that the company that you're talking about?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, that was formed in, or founded in 1998?
Speaker 2: Yeah, technically December of '97 [1997].  But, yes, it was, it was founded in December of '97 [1997], and sold to AT&T in a cash transaction in December of 2007.  So--
Speaker 1: For how much?
Speaker 2: Exactly ten years.  A lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: A lot.  We did pretty good on that one.
Speaker 1: Now, the time that you, you had a twenty-year contract to sell, SBC Telecom [SBC Telecom, Inc.] equipment?
Speaker 2: Well, you really have done your homework.  Yeah.  We had, we had, what happened was, was that back in December of 2007, Southwestern Bell Corporation invested $20 million in ChaseCom really to help us, to give us, to provide us the resources to become their number one customer service partner.  And, and we did.  And, Southwestern Bell turned into SBC [SBC Communications, Inc.] and SBC bought AT&T, and the smallest Regional Bell Operating Company became the biggest telecommunication company in the world over the next ten years, and we happened to grow right along with 'em.  And, they became the largest telecommunications company in the world largely by acquisition and by being opportunistic, and we were, you know, right there through all of that growing right along with them and it was great.
Speaker 1: But, ChaseCom was unique.  How was it unique?
Speaker 2: At the end of the day we were unique because we were the only company who could process an order in the AT&T system that was not owned by AT&T.  And that gave us a tremendous leg up because we were not unionized and they were.  And, so, we could process an order cheaper than they could.  And, it was a wonderful thing.
Speaker 1: And, you specialize in several languages.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yep.  We did all the customer, mostly customer service work for all of their California, and Nevada operations as well as their Ameritech [Ameritech Corporation; AT&T Teleholdings, Inc.] Midwest operations, and as a result we, we not only did business in English but in Spanish, as well as several Asian dialects.
Story_ID: 620483
Speaker 1: Now, in '98 [1998], you co-found the Telecommunications Opportunity Institute [sic. Telecom Opportunity Institute, Houston, Texas] with (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: That was, that was, that was great.  I mean, Telecommunications Opportunity Institute was an effort to provide technical literacy training to at risk and poor communities.  And, it really was the brain child of myself and, Bill Kennard [William E. Kennard] and, Ed Whitacre [Edward Whitacre, Jr.] the chairman of AT&T [AT&T Inc.].  And, and, we provided this training, this technical literacy training, free of charge, to over ten thousand people, during that time frame, in English,  Spanish, Vietnamese, and Chinese.  And, it was--we developed a proprietary curricula and provided that curriculum to those recipients in language free of charge.  It was great.
Speaker 1: And, how long did this last?
Speaker 2: About eight years.  I think we ended that in 2006.
Speaker 1: And, this was in the Houston [Texas] community?  In the school dist--?
Speaker 2: We did it in Houston, we did it in Houston, Dallas [Texas], San Antonio [Texas], Austin [Texas], and Rio Grande Valley [Texas].  We did it on an Indian [Native American] reservation in Livingston, Texas.  We did it in Los Angeles [California] in the L.A. Unified School District [Los Angeles Unified School District].  It was really, you know, we were sort of really going there for a while.  And, we hired, we had a, you know, a whole paid staff that administered this programming.  And, the woman who's now--you know, Bill Kennard's big deal was bridging the digital divide.  And, that's what we were trying to help him do and through kind of a public, private partnership.  All the funds we used were privately generated.  They were profits from ChaseCom [ChaseCom L.P.; ChaseSource], or donations from foundations, or AT&T, or whomever it might be, wherever we had to go to get the money.  But, it was all private money and, and we were, you know, we had a, we had a really good run at it.  And, now the woman who's executive director, we call it TTOI, the acronym for that, is now the head of digital inclusion for the City of Houston.  And, she's doing a great job trying to bring these same sorts of skills and services to the people of Houston for the mayor.

Speaker 1: In 1999, you become director of Cornell Companies, Inc. [Houston, Texas].  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In Cornell Companies, I guess that's right.  I mean, I've been on their board of directors now almost ten years.  Cornell specializes in the privatize corrections business.  They have--operate about several hundred facilities across the United States, and, you know, it's a business where essentially the government looks to outsource everything these days.  And, one of the thing they looked to outsource is the corrections business and Cornell looks to provide that service.
Speaker 1: And, this is the same year you write another article, 'Telecommunications Law in the United States' [Anthony R. Chase], Comparative Law Yearbook of International Business.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was--I did.  I was, you know, trying to keep my finger in the law pie, and keep my skills up.  And, so, and I always enjoyed writing, so, I did.  I wrote that article about telecom law and of course the law was changing rapidly then.  And, there was a lot of opportunity to explain that, particularly in the international context, 'cause U.S. telecom laws have been markedly different from other laws worldwide for a long time, still are I think.
Speaker 1: Now, you become in 2000, the executive and CEO of Chase Radio Partners.  How is that different from ChaseCom [ChaseCom L.P.; ChaseSource]?  What does this company do different from ChaseCom?
Speaker 2: Chase Radio Partners was really my last ownership of radio stations.  And, a couple of radio stations that I bought in 2000 that I la- I sold later, a few years later.  I, you know, that legal entity I owned them through Chase Radio Partners.  But, it was really just a couple of stations.  Pretty small relative to what I'd done before.
Speaker 1: I see.  And, you're still, still teaching because I see now you teach entrepreneurial classes.
Speaker 2: I do.  I do.  I teach entrepreneurship to M.B.A. and law students.  This course is jointly offered at the University of Houston law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas] and the University of Houston Bauer College of Business [C.T. Bauer College of Business, Houston, Texas] in their M.B.A. program.  I enjoy that course.
Story_ID: 620485
Speaker 1: You were talking about the entrepreneurial class and how you enjoy teaching the class.
Speaker 2: The entrepreneurship class is a wonderful class.  I enjoy it a lot because entrepreneurship is the key for upward mobility for so many of us who, who don't have, who don't have the opportunity otherwise.
Speaker 1: And, you said that you teach this class through the M.B.A school?
Speaker 2: I teach it, through--offered, it's offered in both the law school at the University of Houston [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas] and the Bauer College of Business [C.T. Bauer College of Business, Houston, Texas] in their M.B.A. program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I have M.B.A. students and law students in the same class.
Speaker 1: Now, in 2007, tell me, well, tell me about the Federal Reserve board (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: Of governors.
Speaker 2: I have been a member of the Federal Reserve System now for a few years.  I was originally asked to serve on the Federal Reserve bank board of Houston [Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Houston Branch], and take Jeff Skilling's [Jeffrey Skilling] place.  Jeff Skilling was an Enron [Enron Corporation] bad guy who was, who stepped down from the Federal Reserve board.  And, I took this place on the Federal Reserve board of Houston [Texas] a few years ago.  And, then after serving a couple years there, Houston is part of the Dallas district, the 11th District, which is headquartered in Dallas [Texas].  I was asked to move up to the Dallas board.  And then I became vice chairman of the Dallas board of the Federal Reserve last year.  And I've enjoyed it very much.  It's an interesting time to be part of the Federal Reserve System.
Speaker 1: So, you are also part of the Council on Foreign Relations?
Speaker 2: I'm a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.  Have been for about, I don't know, a better part of ten years.
Speaker 1: What are you responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or, you role there?
Speaker 2: Really not much.  I mean, I don't, you know, it's sort of an honorific.  I mean, I was asked to join the Council on Foreign Relations about seven or eight years ago and I accepted.  And, I listen to foreign policy discussions and interesting people talk about interesting foreign policy issues.  But, really that's about it.

Speaker 2: I did.  I married a wonderful woman named Dina [Dina Alsowayel Chase].  And, Dina is a college professor.  She teaches at Rice [Rice University, Houston, Texas] and the University of Houston [Houston, Texas].  She specializes in history, particularly Middle Eastern and history of the Middle East.  And, she is, she's really special.
Speaker 1: And, children?
Speaker 2: We adopted a boy, who is four now.  And he is, as you can imagine, he's something else.  He really is.  He was an abandoned child and we adopted him when, you know, they think he was a couple days old, and now he's four and a half.  And, he's a blessing.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Jordan [Jordan Chase].
Speaker 1: And, he's the only child that you have?
Speaker 2: Yep.

Speaker 1: I want you to think back over your life.  Is there anything, and you alluded to this earlier, that you would change?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No.  No, there's nothing I'd change.  And, it would, I, you know, somebody should reach out and slap my hand.  I guess if I, again, I'd talk about, you know, it'll just be around the edges.  I mean, I, tell you what comes to mind.  I mean, it's certainly not a change.  What comes to mind is, is really is my parents [Drucie Rucker Chase and HistoryMaker John S. Chase] because, if they're one thing, I feel like that the reason I wouldn't change anything is because, you know, I've had every advantage there ever was.  I really have.  I mean, I've had the best education.  I've had--I really have.  I mean, there's really no excuse for me not to do well, none.  But, the biggest single advantage I've had, of all the great advantages I've had, is my parents.  You know, could've been, you know, couldn't had sort of better parents, loving, set of parents who had great values and kind of were willing to, you know, put up with me and my, you know, stuff or--forever.  And, always willing to, to love me no matter what.  And, that's probably the greatest advantage I've ever had, I would guess.
Speaker 1: Is there something that you have not done that you want to do?
Speaker 2: Well, where do I start?  I mean, sure.  There's lots.  You know, there's lots, you know, climb Kilimanjaro [Mount Kilimanjaro], you know.  I mean, there's lots of things that I haven't done that I would love to do.  There really are.  And, and, I, you know, I'm not done.  So, I, I expect, you know, this is, the interesting part of now for me is, is really, you know, kind of to understand the next chapter, you know, and really to kind of focus on the next chapter.  Don't know what it'll be.  I'm excited about it though.  I'm in a different place now, I think, than I've been ever.  I wanna do something different than I've done, of a character different.  You know, I've built companies and I formed capital.  And, I think, you know, in that score, you know, it's sort of hard to get out of that head, you know.  It's always, you know, about making money, and then making more money and then, you know, I think it's hard to kind of get out of that.  But, you know, you know, you really do have enough money after a while.  I think, you know, then it becomes to have a fulfilling life.  Hopefully, it becomes about something else.  And that's really the kind of phase where I hope I'm in now, is to figure out what that something else is.  And how to find fulfillment out of that.  And, I'm not sure what it is yet, you know.  I'm sure it's there.  When I sold my company on December 21st of last year, Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], who's a good friend of mine, seems to have started to take off in this presidential campaign.  And, I have been consumed with that.  The Texas primary was last week, and though we didn't win it, I think we will win it ultimately.  And so, you know, I feel like really that I haven't had a day off until, you know, kind of a couple days ago.  And so, now is the time really to sit back and take stock and really plan, you know, out this next chapter.  And that's really what I plan to do.

Speaker 1: Speaking about Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], was he or Michelle [Michelle Obama] in law school when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, because Barack like almost everybody else these days is younger than me.  Barack's forty-six, I'm fifty-two and so, he was a little bit after me.  But, my, remember my best friend, David Wilkins [HistoryMaker David B. Wilkins] is a professor at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And, he has been a professor since Barack was there.  And, so, when Barack was there, he was responsible for introducing me.  And David taught Michelle and taught Barack, and David and Ann Marie [Ann Marie Wilkins] introduced me to them, and, so, here we are.
Speaker 1: Is also the governor of Massachusetts--?
Speaker 2: Deval [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick].
Speaker 1: Deval.  When he--
Speaker 2: Deval was in my college.  We were in the same dorm in college, and we were in law school together.  So, yeah, it's a small world.  But, then going back to that whole point about the people up there.  I mean, it just, you know, it seems like those sort of people are just everywhere.

Speaker 1: --I know you have lots of years left, but what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Too early to write it.  I mean, I, too early to write it.  I--whatever it's gonna be, I hope it's not written yet.  I mean, you know, I hope we're still on the little stuff, you know, and getting to the main event.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It does seem to me that a life well lived, though, means more than what I've done.
Speaker 1: So, how do you wanna be remembered then?
Speaker 2: A life well lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it just, it seems to me it means more than what I've done.  I think you have to, I think you have to impact lives, more lives, more meaningfully.  And, I think I've impacted a lot of lives, some lives meaningfully.  But, not enough yet.  And, so, I mean, we'll see.  We'll see.  To be told.

Speaker 1: Because this interview will be available for many generations, what message would you wanna send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: I guess, I must urge, you know, well, I guess what I wanna say is compassion.  And, the reason I say that is because I don't think we're very compassionate, you know.  We, you know, the larger we, that Western society has been infused with this notion of individualism for a long time, you know.  Everybody--each individual working in their best, you know, and, you know, working for their greater self-interest.  It sort of benefits all in the collective in a way that, that it's good for society.  And, I don't think that's really always true.  And so, a lot things suffer along the way.  Whether it's Mother Earth, or whether it's family, and community, and I think individualism is great for some things.  But, I think for some other things, it's not.  And, and, I think we have to pay attention to those things a little bit better in the future than perhaps we have in the past.  So, there is a message that I have to future generations it's that they be better stewards perhaps than their forefathers have been, their foremothers.  That's what I'd say.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not spoken about that you would like to say?
Speaker 2: I couldn't imagine what that would be.
Speaker 1: Well, I wanna thank you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Thank you so much for being gracious with your time, and telling your story.  We appreciate it.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
