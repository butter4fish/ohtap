Speaker 1: Now, sir, before we get into depth, there are five 'People' magazine-ish type questions we always ask.  They're kind of lightweight questions and they just take a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Short answer.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And the first question is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Food.  Oh he didn't hear that, period.  No, I, I like just ordinary food, vegetables.  And I like the general food that most Americans like to eat, you know.  I like baked food, fried  food, things like that.  Of course, I like desserts and all like that, you know.  You know name it and I'll claim it usually cause I'm not hard to please when it comes to food.  If it's cooked correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay, now sir, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite what?
Speaker 1: Color.
Speaker 2: Favorite color, color.  Well, it all depends on what the article is, the item is, you know, but usually, when it comes to suits, I like a dark suit, either a brown or blue or one of those colors see.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I have that, now.  Summer, when it's warm.  The part that's warm, not the part that's cool.  I like summertime.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, it come along about that time, summertime.  I like, that's when I like to go on a vacation, yeah.
Speaker 1: But do you have a favorite place to go?
Speaker 2: Well, my favorite places I don't get to go too much and unless I'm working and I couldn't call it much of a vacation.  We go warm states, you know, in the United States.  And then sometimes  I go to Europe, places, like, you know, places like that.  One of the states, my, my favorite state, you know, if it's summertime, I like to go is, Hawaii because it seems to put its mark on me for some reason.  And I like to play with those guys that play music over there, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Hawaiian song, sing them in Hawaiian.  I like to sing foreign songs in Spanish, German, Italian, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A saying?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, at certain times I do and it's only two letters in it.  For very special occasions, "Thank you" or some special gift somebody gave me or a favor they had done.
Speaker 1: It's two words?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 2532
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let me ask you about your, your family origin, you know, your family tree.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: Well, most of it's been traced, it's by word of mouth, you know what I'm talking about 'cause I would like, well, lotta more of my family.  Black people they used to load them up on slave ships and things, brought them to this country, you know what I mean.  And so you wasn't considered people as a matter of fact any way, you know what I mean.  They sold you like they did cattle.  And if you had a beautiful female in the family and if the master was a bachelor or something, well, that was his personal property.  You see what I'm talking about.  Just like old Thomas Jefferson, you've heard of him, I'm sure, your third president.  His name, he's got his blood strewn all the way across the country, see 'cause he, he likes those to bed with  those black -- they didn't call them ladies, they called them wenches, you know, things like that.  And that Jefferson is spread all over the state and many states in the United States.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know, I mean how far can you trace your family back, I mean after they got here, you know?
Speaker 2: You mean got to Massachusetts?
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean, how far can you trace your, your family back?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, most of my family, I mean I can trace them all over Tennessee.  That's where they had to, growing corn and stuff like that, you know, for the masters and mistresses and things like that.  Mistresses raised their kids, many of them raised their kids as if they were their own kids cause nobody hardly want to mistreat a kid, you know.  And so my a--see, see that's the sad part, dilemma of the slave caught himself in was two sides, you don't know about.  The male origin of him and what he did and so forth and so on.  And then his wife, a female said it's--and many times he was not even, didn't have the privilege to choose his own wife because if his master was male, of course, if he liked the looks of the woman, and he was looking commercially, you know.  You know, he would pick her himself, you know this is your husband here, so and so and, you know.  And if they had any offspring, they have a special auction and sell them into slavery, right back, see?
Story_ID: 2533
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories about slavery that come down through your family that have been passed along by word-of-mouth?
Speaker 2: Well, not--you know, most of the time I wasn't listening to most of them.  But maybe I was stupid for not, you know, because in my, on my father's side, most of the slaves were mulattoes.  He was light as you or even lighter, see, my Dad was.  And on my mother's [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] side and also on my daddy's [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] side too, it was a whole lot of that old Tomahawk man in there, Indian, plenty of Cherokee Indian, Choctaw, you know, and that kind, Cherokee, and all that.  And so they tried to keep it as quiet as possible 'cause you'd be surprised to know what a little spark can grow up into a big flame, you know.  And, and a lot of good lives would be ruined, you see.  But one thing, on my dad's side, part of my people, you know, from slavery on up were entertainers, you know, dancers, musicians.  And so the old masters had these slaves, well, he would let them, he was always giving a big, we call it a blowout, see what I mean.  Cakewalks [dance] and things.  And so he'd give those and the males would play, you know, the music.  And they just take the entertainment thing on down.  And mostly in the entertainment world, you know, that where mine come from.
Story_ID: 2534
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you remember your grandparents?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Do you remember your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, somewhat.  Some of them I remember.  I remember my grandmother because she didn't hardly head the slave list.  See, but she, she had-- although she did have some Indian blood in her, but she, she had more, she was more Afro-American than she was Native American, see.  But on my father's [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] side, he was another [President] Thomas Jefferson.  Jefferson got his blood spread all the United States and I guess parts of Canada and any other place, you know.  See?  And so they had slaves and just raised them from the slave blocks.  Jefferson's name is all over this country, Thomas Jefferson.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your - can, can you remember the name of your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  On my father's side, my paternal grandparents were Armstrong.  They were Scotch-Irish and it came on down on my mother's to Indian and so forth and so on, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chippewa, the whole league of nations.  A bunch of them, you know.  A lot of black people, you know get angry when they think about that institution of slavery which was very ugly.  See?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Even you know now just like I was telling somebody the other day, you know, and it speak of whiskey, home brew, you know, wine and things like that.  But heck, [Jesus] Christ made some of the best tasting wine that they ever put on the market.  I don't think they put it on the market, but his mother's [Mary] people were having a what we call a shindig or blowout.  And so his mother knew that he possessed some very extraordinary abilities and things.  And so before the party fell through, she came to him and said, "Son, we're running out of wine."  And he said, "Come on take me to man that's giving the party."  And so she took him to the man that was giving the party.  And he told him, "Now fill up all the water jugs and things, bring them and fill them up with good spring water."  And so which, according to the book, that old Bible, that's what was hap- that's what they did.  They filled them up and then the people praised that old wine, I mean the new wine much better than the old wine.
Speaker 1: So he turned them into water--he turned the water--.
Speaker 2: He turned the water just into wine.
Speaker 1: How did he do it?
Speaker 2: Um?
Speaker 1: How did he do that?
Speaker 2: How did he do it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did they say he did it?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  If I knew I'd, I would never hit another lick at work.  I'd have wine factory on the corner, every corner in the state.  But a whole lot of these things they never tell you the real key to it, you know.
Story_ID: 2535
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, now can you tell the names of your, your grandparents on your mother's [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] side?
Speaker 2: Oh, well--.
Speaker 1: You talked about the Armstrongs and then what about your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, that was, both of them was about equal.  My mother was a Milam.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: M-I-L-A-M.  And they originated down there in middle Tennessee, around Dayton, Tennessee.  And this--you heard about the [John] Scopes trial, didn't you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but let, let's--we're going to get to that, but I've got some questions to ask you about your parents first.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But we'll get to it.  Okay?
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But I wanted to ask you about your parents first.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: This is how, how we set everything up so, you know, but can you give me the name of your father [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] and his, his full name.  And do you his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I know his place of birth, I, I don't even remember exactly the date, but he was, he was born into slavery, put it that way.
Speaker 1: Your, your, your father?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father and my mother.  They were soon freed because I used to hear him say he was freed after the surrender, after Grant, you know and everything.  And, you know, [President] Ulysses S.  Grant.  And--.
Speaker 1: So your father was, was, was a older man when he had you?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause he would have been--if, if he was freed after slavery was over back in 1863 [1865].
Speaker 2: Was he a child when they, when he was freed from slavery or what?
Speaker 1: Not exactly a child.  He was a young man.  Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And not only that he had a big mixed up family, see.  His mother was black and Cherokee Indian and had, let me see, sixteen children.  Let me see, yeah, had sixteen children.  And everybody--it was fashionable to have a big family, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, what was your father's name?  What was his full name?
Speaker 1: Well, his full name was like mine, was Armstrong.  His name was Thomas, and he, as he got to be about middle-aged, he started into the ministry.
Speaker 2: His name was Thomas Armstrong?
Speaker 1: Thomas Franklin Armstrong.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes sir.
Story_ID: 2536
Speaker 1: Now, now, what was he like and what did he do?  Now, you can tell me about what--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) What my dad [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, what he was like, what kind of person he was and--oh, yeah, well, well, it wasn't long 'til he started preaching that Christian gospel, you know.  And so he, he, for a while he worked at labor at blast furnace making pig iron they call it, you ever heard of pig iron?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It's real simple iron, real supple.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he helped his, his foreman, superintendent, hold his job because he knew more about it, actually than the man did.  I know the man used to come to him and say, "Tom, this cupola is stopping up.  We can't make the cast."  First, I didn't know what the heck a cast was.  "What the hell is a cast?" you know.  He says, "The cupola, we can't make the cast."  And that  made the old man's chest stick out.  He said, "Well, I'll tell you what to do.  And in the first place what you come to me for.  That's your job.  I'm not supposed to know anything much."  So he said, "Yeah, but," he said, "Well, but Tom you know you know more about this stuff than I do."  He said, "I'll tell you what to do then.  Go bring me three or four sticks of dynamite."  "What you're going to do with dynamite?"  He said, "You don't know any other way to get the iron out of that thing that's about to swell up and burst open and explode, kill everybody around here."  "No, I don't know."  "Well get the dynamite."  And the other black workers around there, ex-slaves and things, that made them feel pretty proud, you know,  That was unusual, black man or a white man even talk to his foreman or superintendent like that.  And guess, guess what the old man did?  The man gave him the dynamite.  He was just, just he had a few sticks of wood in his hand.  He climbed up on the outside of this cupola, this big structure.  The cooker they called it, you know.  And when he got up, they already had a little iron ladder you know, that goes up there.  And right near the top was an opening, sometimes on the side before you got to the top.  He got up there, man, and he'd throw a stick in it.  At the time, he could hear the dynamite "Swoop!" like that, you know.  Next thing you know, that iron would shoot out from the bottom or wherever the side that was open and opening.  And, and guess what he would tell him, when he got back down.  "Come on down now."  He said "Wait a minute," take out one of his old, big pocketbooks, you know, and great big old five dollar bill maybe, whatever it was.  And so he might give him two of them.  It all depends or three of them.  Now, say, "Go on home and go fishing."  My dad felt mighty good over that.  He would go on home and my mom [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] would, sometime would say, "Tom, what you doing home so early?"  "Don't ask so many questions. Here."  Throw on the big, big five dollar bill with [President Abraham] Lincoln's picture on it and stuff.  "Now, go fix me something to eat."  And it was his time to crow again.
Story_ID: 2537
Speaker 1: Now then--but he became a minister, a preacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he, he did.  Had a brother, I had an aunt.  My dad's [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] youngest sister, Clara, became a preacher.  Yeah.  But I'd just for the hell of it, you know, when they wouldn't be looking, I'd grab the Bible and run under the bed or behind the door or something, started reading in it, didn't forget a thing I, I read cause I was doing it for spite in the first place.  And so Mama [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] used to, she loved that Bible.  "Son read me something."  I said, "Read you what?"  "The Bible, what do you think?"  "Okay, I'll read it."  She'd name book, chapter and verse to me sometimes.  "Read me John 3:16."  "Mama, don't you get tired of listening to that?"  Well, I had it by heart anyway, you know.  "John 3:16, God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life."  Mom, and Mama was so happy.  "Ooh, my goodness."  And for awhile I got to the place I saw I know how to commit to heart and everything like that.
Speaker 1: Now, now, tell me, your father was a musician too, well, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah he--all of his brothers were musicians.
Speaker 1: What, what did he play?
Speaker 2: Anything with strings on it on it.  But his main instrument was that little old thing you see over there with the stripes down it.  That little old mandolin, lute-shaped mandolin, they used to call it 'tater bug.'  And he could play it too.  And so I picked it up after him and started playing that.  And then I, I loved it, you know, when I started.
Speaker 1: Now, did--is it true that he, that he thought at a certain point, it was an instrument of the devil and didn't want to play it anymore?
Speaker 2: That's what, that's what those jealous, jive preachers, you know.  Well, I'm not trying to talk against a preacher.  Mama would, she was so religious, you know, until she just thought well, you just had to read the scripture and that was enough.  That religion should be just as simple and it quit being straight-laced.  But after we got to going out--I taught my brothers to play and we brought back some 'chips for your hips.' (laughs)
Speaker 1: Some money.
Speaker 2: Don't you see.  I know we, my dad--I remember I was pretty good size, and my dad left La Follette and went to this little twenty-eight mile town from there called Jellico, Tennessee.  You ever heard of it?
Speaker 1: Well, that's where this great Metropolitan Opera singer lived, Grace Moore.  And things around his house, home and all  La Follette [Tennessee] had closed down.  So he got to waiting a table in  Jellico.  And then he told his boss, said, "Why don't you let me bring my boys up here."  "What can they do?"  He said, "A little bit of everything musically."  "Well, then you bring them, Uncle Tom, you bring them up here."  Old man bring them up there, man, and we start wailing and sailing.  We played, we played all kinds of classic music, you know, and stuff.  And all that stuff, man.
Speaker 2: You play classical music too?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.  You, you ever see a dog that eat glass?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Well then it's food.  He's not a fool.  He gonna, he'll eat anything to keep from starving.  Yeah, we played classic songs and popular songs and all that, yeah.
Story_ID: 2538
Speaker 1: Now, I want to ask you about your musical training at some point, but I, I wanted you to talk about your parents some.  And, you know, you talked about your father [Thomas Franklin Armstrong], can you give us  your mother's name, full name and her date of birth, if you can or if you remember?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Daisy.  See she was practically an orphan because her mother only had two children, her brother and her, that's all.  And, of course, my mother loved the church.  She spent most of her time, when she wasn't feeding and looking after us little hell-raisers, in, in the church, you know, and all like that.  And then her name was Daisy [Ann] Milam and her place of birth was Clarksville.  I know you've heard of Clarksville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And she was very religious.  She joined the choir, singing in the choir and all like that.  But of all of the members of the family, she was the only one that didn't play a string  instrument or some kind of instrument.
Speaker 1: But she could sing at least?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: But she could sing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, she had a soprano voice that made the place (unclear) loft.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 2539
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: We're going to pick up from your mother [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong].  So you said everybody in the family played an instrument except your mother, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, she, she, she could play too.  She played the harmonica, but she didn't play regular because she was, had a high soprano voice and so she read all--she sang and led all the choral parts, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, now--.
Speaker 1: And my dad even, he played and sang bass.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, how many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 1: Did I have?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There were nine of us.  Six boys and three girls.
Speaker 2: Can you name them for us and tell us where you fall in the line, in, in order?
Speaker 1: Well, see I led the group.
Speaker 2: You're the oldest?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: You're, you're the oldest?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm not the oldest, but--they, they, they were--before I ever went out and played anything, my oldest brother--first my dad and mother, my oldest brother and sister and on down the line, see.  And after they kind of hung their things up, well, then here I come along with that middle troupe singing and playing, you know, played fiddle and mandolin, guitar and all that stuff.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  Now, where were you in the, in the, in the, in your brothers and sisters.  I mean which, which order were you in--?
Speaker 1: You mean where--.
Speaker 2: Can, can you name your brothers and sisters and tell us where you fall in the, in the group?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can do that.  I'll never forget them.  When we was small, when I say, you know like eight, nine, ten and stuff like that, well, we lived, we worked for La Follette.  I didn't, but my dad [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] worked for La Follette Coal and Iron Company in La Follette, Tennessee, fourteen miles from Cumberland Gap.  And that used to be an old drunkard song, (singing) "Come little gal if you don't care care, I'll set my jimmy john right down here; if it ain't there when I get back, there's gonna be hell on Cumberland  Gap."  And he was gonna raise the hell, you see.  And then, later on my dad started, you know, playing his old mandolin and my oldest sister played the guitar and so forth and so on.
Speaker 2: Now, can you name them for us though, could you please?
Speaker 1: Name what?
Speaker 2: Name your brothers and sisters in the order of their birth for us?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can do that.  I think I could do that.
Speaker 2: Okay, please, if you would.
Speaker 1: The oldest one, well, of course, you know, mother and father.  They led the family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They went out and played for and celebrated his white boss man because it wasn't no such thing as a black foreman working around those steel mills or blast furnace and things in La Follette, see.  And then after my sisters and my, my oldest brother left home and he, he used to sing tenor in the, in the group with my mother, father and two sisters.
Story_ID: 2540
Speaker 1: I just wondered, could you name them for us?  Could you name your brothers and sisters for us, starting with the oldest?  Could you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can name them.  I'll never forget them.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you're not going to, right.
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't be that rude.  The oldest one in the group was Ed Armstrong.  He's the only one that didn't play an instrument, you know, like a guitar or mandolin or something, but he could sing some mighty nice tenor.  And now the one that played for the background of the whole group was my, one next to him, which is my sister, Ella.  She played guitar and sang alto.  And my next sister, Clara, she sang.  You know, and then came Robbie who was the baby girl.  She sang.  Oh, they sang mighty good cause I regretted it, you know, I wished I could go where they go and get all that good pocket chivalry, you know, and stuff like that.  But then they did that for a while and then after they quit, you know, they got married, the girls did, all three of them got married.  They left us little old no good boys back at home.  And we got to playing, you know, put a little more life into the group.  And we played and sang and for a hotel, but we played a little more up-to-date stuff, you see what I'm talking about.  And shoot, played the music, read the music, wrote the music and song.  I think we might have a piece of paper while ago that had--.
Speaker 1: Sure, we, yeah, there's something.  Yeah, we, we got some papers with the, with the information.  Now, were you the youngest or the oldest or were you in the middle or what?
Speaker 2: I was the middle of the family.  Especially, musically.  I'm in the middle they were--see, there were eleven in the whole family.  My brother, oldest brother, he was head of the group.  He had a choir so to speak and my oldest sister next to him.  And she could, and, but my oldest brother, he couldn't play an instrument, but sister could, Ella.  She played and then here come Clara, she sang.  She played and sang.  Then a baby sister, who was older than I was, Robbie, she, she played and everything.  And then I fell in there see and started playing, and serenading and what not.  But then I got on to more modern, you know, well, I got to singing with my little group, not singing so much as playing the fiddle and mandolin, guitar.  Jazz, you know, that's the way I got in there.  And then when I left home, well, you know, once you leave home that, that takes something away.
Speaker 1: Now, now you had two little brothers too, right?  Two brothers younger than you?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: You have two brothers younger than you, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, um-hmm, I have three.
Speaker 1: Three of them, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they, and they played too, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Where's-- (unclear)?  I don't know where she got the picture, but she got pictures around here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's got the picture.
Speaker 2: Well, it won't be the last time you'll be around.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 2: And she'll show you him.  He stood back to look like his, had an elbow back of his leg, you know.  F.L. [Francis Lee], the baby.  And L.C.  [Lee Crockett], F.L., Roland, Tommie.
Story_ID: 2541
Speaker 1: Now sir, can you, can you kind of reflect back on any of when you were a little, a little kid in Tennessee and tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of, of your neighborhood or around your house or the town that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, this old prejudice is a ugly monster, you see what I mean.  Well, now, my brothers, well, when my sisters and mother [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] and dad [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] would go around serenading the white boss people and so forth and so on, well, I was staying at home keeping company with the cat and the rats and stuff like that, see.  And so a little later on I learned how to play and, of course, they, my oldest sister got married and my oldest brother, he got married.  State helped them get married because they, the long arm of the police department and all like that.  Of course, you know, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: Finally, he left home and everybody and wasn't nobody, wasn't nobody home but we youngsters.  So we played and--.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have regular lessons?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Did you have like regular lessons every day?  Would your father teach you something new every day or?
Speaker 2: Oh, he didn't have time to teach us.  He worked at the blast furnace and, time he got through grabbing that hot pig iron and stuff and he got home and fall into the doggone black-eyed peas and corn pone and stuff or--. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Well, how did you, how were you able to learn how to play so--?
Speaker 2: Well, I just made up my mind I wanted to play and then started.  I stuck my nose in the book.  It had the right writing in it.  And, of course, my dad was right there to show me which way was right and which was wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any other musicians around the neighborhood that--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there were.  Man, they were all--they was like flies everywhere, you know.
Speaker 1: But we don't know.  That's why we're asking.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well a lot of them were ex-slaves and all like that, see.  And so I started the young group around there, La Follette, Tennessee and started playing and so I got to the place that, shoot, you could put some ink on a cat's foot and make some lines and things and hell, stick it up on top of anything.  I'd play that.  Shoot I got so--.
Speaker 1: So you can read music too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't just learning how to play by ear, you learned how to read music, and--.
Speaker 2: No, that ear is a wonderful thing.  If you don't have a good ear, I don't care, you're not going to make a good musician.  'Cause it's I--one of the worse feelings I had was to be playing with a fool playing G.  And G is one sharp and half the time the fool be playing in A flat which is a tone over.  See what I mean, but, oh, I'm, music comes from in here.  If you want it, you'll get it.  I'm telling you.

Speaker 1: Now, you learned how to play and sing songs, foreign songs, songs from other countries too, right, when you were little.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I wanted, I played, see we had racial laws that, that depicted that blacks and whites and so forth couldn't play together.  I don't mean play music or anything else, you couldn't play with any little kids.  You know, when it started growing up and everything, they put the sights on you, especially, now, a black girl and a little white girl, played together just like they were sisters.  I know our mothers who would take our little sisters and things on the job with them.  See what I'm talking about.  Well, she, she was a cook, the housekeeper, pot boiler and everything.  And so, of course, I mean, you know, school would be out or what not.  I had all the food I--more than I wanted, you know.  Yes, sir.  We could, which we didn't get ordinarily.  If we, my dad [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] had to buy it, he couldn't--he didn't make enough money to buy that choice stuff that, that they eat in the white homes and things, see.  And Mama [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] raised to the point where she was a head cook at the biggest hotel in La Follette, Tennessee.  Adro Hotel.
Speaker 1: What was the name again?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: What was the name again?
Speaker 2: Adro.  A-D-R-O.  It was named after two of the richest guys in the city.  Adams and Rogers.  And my mother--and they said,  "Well, Daisy," that was my mother.  She was the head cook.  Says, "There's no need of leaving those--" see they got out of school before--I mean we did, you know what I'm talking about.  Says - and my sisters had married off and all that stuff and so she said, "It's no need of those kids staying there by themselves.  And you got to be down here cooking and what not."  Said,  "Just, just bring them on down here and fix, let them eat," and even at lunch time we went fast as taxicabs, nearly running to get down to that hotel.  And I was glad it was that way.  Have all kinds of good food we never were used to eating, you know.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, now tell me again about Grace Moore.  Now, Grace Moore was an, was an opera singer?
Speaker 2: And the what?
Speaker 1: Grace Moore.
Speaker 2: What about her?
Speaker 1: She was known as the Tennessee Nightingale, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was a songstress.  She could sing, that's right.
Speaker 1: Now, this was a black woman or a white woman?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No, she was a white woman.
Speaker 1: Okay, in, and your father--.
Speaker 2: She lived in Jellico, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't come in contact with Grace Moore until after my dad [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] lost his job at the blast furnace.  And so he, Jellico was only twenty-eight miles from there, and he'd go up there and stay all week, see what I mean, come home on the weekend.  And he'd go up there and work at the Grand Morgan Hotel and he would, he liked to have something to brag on.  "Miss Moore, you ought to hear my bunch sing and play."  She were only a guest, one of their main customers.  They were well-to-do people.  "Well, why don't you bring your boys by here."  And that's when little kids you know, nine, ten years old, started wearing long pants.  See.  And suspenders.  My dad wouldn't dare let us wear a belt.  And so he'd be up there, waiting tables and we'd be up there messing around, you know, until--.
Speaker 1: You playing your--.
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: --playing your instruments?
Speaker 2: Oh well, not necessarily, but he would tell them about he had some kids could play music.  "Well, why don't you bring them up and let us hear them."  And so my brother, the baby had long pants with suspenders.  That's when they started wearing them, you know.  'Baby Ray' and the 'Cunning Kitty Cats' [reading primer] and all that stuff in their little school books, you know.  And so, he wore suspenders.  And what they would do, well, at supper time, my dad be waiting the table and everything and a lot of those guests were what we call traveling salesmen, drummers and things, you know.  And he was so cute, F.L. [Francis] was, playing his little banjolele and stuff.  Then the women would catch him around the bottom of his pants.  Of course, he was wearing long pants then.  And tie or either put a belt or something or necktie around there and tie it.  And either put a pin in there or something.  And then they'd come and pull his pants out at the middle, 'cause my dad wasn't letting him wear a belt.  And just dump nickels, dimes, quarters.  And I wouldn't even let him go to the bathroom without me.  That money wouldn't be going  down--he wasn't gonna flush any of that down the commode. (laughs)
Speaker 1: So they put the money in his pants?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: They put the money in his pants?
Speaker 2: He'd come out--they'd say, "Look at him," like he was a little monkey, you know.  "Oh, isn't he cute.  Come here son."  He knew he was going to get some goodies.  He went trotting over there with his little bow legs.  And they'd pull his pants out and handfuls, you know, sometimes they just take the hat and go around, take up collection.  And then pull this out and dump it down in his pants and they'd tie them at the bottoms.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So to catch the money?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: To catch the money.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And when, when my dad would come home or whatever, money would come home with him and us, you know what I mean.  And I'd--when after I had to go to the bathroom--I wouldn't let him go by himself.  I'd check on him.  "They gave me this money."  "I ain't give you a damn thing.  This is money we going to take home, help pay on some bills and whatever." (laughs)  Sure enough.

Speaker 1: Now, was it at this hotel that you learned how to sing in different languages?
Speaker 2: Was it, was it what?
Speaker 1: Did you learn how to sing in languages at this hotel?
Speaker 2: Nah, I learned before we ever started playing.  But I know there were foreigners coming and going from all other the world, you know.  And that's how we got by this guy skipping in Chicago [Illinois].  We go over on the North side.
Speaker 1: Now, I don't want to get too far ahead now.

I had the same, when I went to Nashville, Tennessee State College, I had the same col-, play mother, as Roland Hayes had.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what's a play mother?
Speaker 2: You see a guy on the campus ground that you like, you just like a buddy, you know.  And sometimes some of the women, older teachers, some of would be--would just adopt you, so to speak, help you with your lessons and things like that if you need any help.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, that's like a play mother, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Play sister.
Speaker 1: Now, that happens in the South a lot, but you don't hear about it in the North that much.
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, I've never heard it since I've been here.
Story_ID: 2545
Speaker 1: Right, so, now you went to La Follette High School [La Follette, Tennessee], that was like for grade school and high school, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  The only difference it was, it was what we black people call a Jim Crow.  You couldn't go to the white high school, see.  But that was the only difference.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--you know, what, what other things did you do in high school other than--I know you're an artist too, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I, I--in the Art Department, they, they'd want special posters made and stuff.  Well I could paint like lightning so to speak, you know what I mean.  And so I would paint posters and different things.  And they liked that, see.  Not only did they like it, it saved them money, see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know one time they got--the faculty had a little dispute with the Art Department and the, and President Hale, you know, W. J. Hale came down to the--where I was, you know, administration building, and he said, "Come here, boy."  I say--.  Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] used to do all the illustrating and stuff. " You can draw so and so, can't you."  "Oh, yes, sir."  "Well, you draw this for me and bring it up to the office."  From then on that was the end of Fisk University, see.  So I drew  (unclear) I never did - they never did have Fisk illustrate anything anymore after that.
Speaker 1: Now, now, in high school when you were--now, did you graduate from high school?  You graduated from high school, right?
Speaker 2: (nods head for yes).
Speaker 1: And what, what year was it?

Speaker 1: Okay, as well as Art.
Speaker 2: Did more work than I did learning.  I learned while I was working.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What kind of work did you, did they have you doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I was illustrating posters and things.  See those little posters I make on the back of the wall there.
Speaker 1: Well, I can if I turn around, but nobody else is going to be able to see it
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously).  All right.  All right, you know.

Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, now, what do you remember about that again?
Speaker 2: Well, all I can remember is that I know I was born there.  And they had some pretty broad disputes, you know, about, you know, when you disputed the Bible, the Christians jumped up and hollered and went on about it, you know, "You disputing the Bible.  The Bible's--every word in that Bible is true and I believe every one of them," you know. (laughs)  Of course, all I wanted was to take my little old three brothers and, and myself, get on through there and play some good fast Jazz or Blues or something, get some money, you know, some chips on my hip.  And I didn't have much trouble doing that.
Story_ID: 2548
Speaker 1: Now, just one thing about growing up now.  You, you grew up in an area which was, people would characterize as the Bible Belt.  A lot of--.
Speaker 2: That was a prop to lean on.
Speaker 1: Right, and, but, but you surprisingly, not--you don't seem very impressed with it, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, I've seen, you know, if you go around and preach a certain doctrine, and you break the law that you're preaching more than anybody else, how you going to impress me?  See what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: You're saying that a lot of the preachers that you encountered were--.
Speaker 2: Oh, man, biggest whoremasters you ever heard of, some of them.  I was just thinking another guy in, in history.  He was a big whoremaster.  He spreaded his seed all over the country.  You know who he was?
Speaker 1: Who's that?
Speaker 2: Your third President.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we, you talked about him earlier.
Speaker 2: Good old, Tom Jefferson.
Speaker 1: Right.  Did you know anybody related to him?
Speaker 2: Not personally I didn't, but I've been to a lot of territory.  I know where--he was through there.  He left his track.
Story_ID: 2549
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but you didn't--now, did you have to go to church a lot when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: When I was, when I was in sch- a kid?
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you were a little boy, did you have to go to church a lot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to church.  If I didn't go to church, I better go bring a piece of it home.  Or so to speak.  That's how tight my people were.
Speaker 1: Did you have to play music in the church too?
Speaker 2: Well, now that's where the conflict came.  I was born and raised so to speak in the African, that big A up there.  AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion church, see.  And, of course, they, they let that go by.  You know what I'm talking about, 'cause we--you, you read the same scripture and everything that the Baptist, and other, you know, Christian nationalities read.  And so but they still had some old-fashioned laws they adhered to.  I know my mother [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] she was a staunch Christian right there in La Follette [Tennessee].  First, see I was raised in the Zion Methodist Church, but after a while Mama didn't go so much for that end of it, see.  So then they started, fell back on an old standby, you know.  Of course, she liked to shout and go on.  And it wasn't a night hardly that she didn't make me read something out the Bible.  "Son, read me such and such a chapter out of the Bible."  I say, "What chapter you want me to read."  "Read from St. John the Revelator."  Why well--well most of the time I didn't even pick up the Bible.  That's how well I had it down.  I would just pick up a 'Street and Smith's Wild West [Weekly]' or--. (laughs)  Yeah, Mama be sitting there before the fire, it was about this time of the year, you know, head nodding.  And I'd starting reading, you know, out of my crooked mind.  "John the Revelator had a--he showed me," you know, I, I, I'd make it long as I could cause I didn't want to be standing up there.  I'd be combing her hair, you know.  Sometimes the comb get caught up in some of her tight braids and things.  "And he showed me a pure river of water of life."  Mama would be sleep.  "Clear as crystal proceeding out of the son of God and of the lamb."  "And then I'd see a mist was there, the tree of life which about twelve manner of fruit yielded a fruit every month."  Mama be, about along then she start dozing off.  She didn't know what I said, and where I got it from.  It didn't make her any difference, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, would you make up some of it or did you?
Speaker 2: No, I, what I said that I'd read so much, I knew it by heart.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, she, she--talking about the angel that was--showed St. John, you know, the Holy City.  See, and then Mama [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong], she done gone on into snoozeville.  And after a while she done got so tired and sleepy and hungry and old Tom [Franklin] Armstrong, my daddy, then, if some or some pots wasn't rattling with the right kind of sound, somebody had to go.  I'd gone back up under the house.  It was under pins, you know, and get behind a trunk chimney jamb and go on to sleep or something.  When I wake up, sometimes supper would be over.  And that's right.  Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 2550
Speaker 1: Now, now you were at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in the late 1920s or 1928, '29 [1929], I guess?
Speaker 2: (nods head for yes).
Speaker 1: In 1929, now, you started playing with other musicians other than your brothers at a certain--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You knew  [John Adam] 'Sleepy John' Estes, right?
Speaker 2: Sleepy John Estes?  Yeah, I knew and John Bridgeport.
Speaker 1: Can, can you name some of the people you played with, some of the other people you played with around that time, around that time, around the early '20 [1920], the late '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then I left from there and went on and played with some guys in Hawaii 'cause I was over there when they did the [Pearl Harbor] bombing, you know.
Speaker 1: No, well, we--I don't want to jump that far yet 'cause we're still in 1929 now.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.  I know.
Story_ID: 2551
Speaker 1: Tell us about [John Adam] 'Sleepy John' Estes.  What, what was he like to, to work with?
Speaker 2: Well, he was, he was a good musician.  You know, he played, he played the keyboard.  He was a good man at his trade.  That's all it is to that.  See and then there were several other guys around there that--we organize a band, you know what I mean.  And we started playing the modern music and everything.
Speaker 1: Now, you played with [James] 'Yank' Rachell and Sleepy John Estes?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did that not long ago, Yank Rachell.  Oh, John, I mean Yank Rachell, he, plays strings.  He the one that wanted to play more strings.  But, and then there was another guy played around campus [at Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], John Bridgeport.  We called him Sleepy.  But he could pick, as we used to call it, he could pick a piano now.
Speaker 1: Now, why did they call Sleepy John Estes 'Sleepy' and why'd they call the other guy 'Sleepy?'  I mean (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I don't know.  I guess they must have fall, fell asleep a lot when they ought to been awake.  But they didn't bother me 'cause I was getting mine and what not.  And Pearl Gore, I was thinking about this other woman, who had the same play mother, I mean she was my play mother was Martha Brown, a older lady, you know, and we got along fine and everything like that.  But you see Tennessee State and Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] were old rivals from way back.  See?  Martha Brown, I had the same mother that, I mean she was my play mother and she was this other, this, this lady.  Pearl Gore, I don't whether you ever heard of them or not.  Pearl Winthrow [ph.] Gore.  Yes, Lordy.

Speaker 2: It was a quartet.
Speaker 1: Quartet, okay.
Speaker 2: Well that, well that happened in Knoxville [Tennessee], see.  We was playing on station WROX [radio station in Clarksdale, Mississippi] and KNOX [radio station in Knoxville, Tennessee], see.  But now our main station down in Tennessee was in Nashville.  WSM, and we played there.
Speaker 1: So, you were playing on the radio live?
Speaker 2: Oh, I played quite a bit around Knoxville on the radio.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people don't understand that now because nobody--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: -- plays live on the radio anymore.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: But in those days, you actually played in the studio, right?
Speaker 2: Guys would be, I know we had friends, barber friends, you know.  And it be advertised all up and down Vine Street that we were going to play at WROL [radio station in Knoxville, Tennessee] or KNOX or something like that.  And the guys be standing in the door waiting until we got back up on Vine Street to our favorite hangout.  Lumberjack Barbershop, and it was better known as Gene's Barbershop.  But we enjoyed it, you know.  We didn't know if we was making the right kind of money or what, but we enjoyed it, you know.
Speaker 1: So you, were you still a student when you were playing on the radio?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Were you still a student when you were playing on the radio?
Speaker 2: On the radio?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, well, that's when I finally cut loose at that time.
Story_ID: 2553
Speaker 1: Now, why did you stop going to school?
Speaker 2: Down there, in, in Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you were at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Why did you stop?
Speaker 2: Well, look, when, when there's people tell you, try to tell you how to do what you can do, and you know you can do it better, why you have to--you know the way young people are.  Why you want to listen to that?
Speaker 1: For instance, would they, well, would they try to tell you how to play your instrument or to--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, "Why should you play that old funny kind of stuff or why don't you play this song?"  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Even some of the songs we wrote and I know she had some down in, in that book over there, you know.  But there's always somebody who wants to get in on the wagon or on the stage.  So if you don't join them, they become your enemies.  See?  Then way later around the corner, you might run into them again.  See?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long did you stay in Nashville?  Did you stay there a long time or after you started--did, did you--when you formed the group with [Carl] Martin and [Ted] Bogan--was it--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's when I left.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  You said, you said it was a quartet?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who, who was the fourth person?  It was Martin, Bogan, you and--.
Speaker 2: I led the group.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and who was number four, though?
Speaker 2: Number four was Martin.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I'm trying to--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No it wasn't, no it wasn't, it was Bill Ballinger.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ballinger.  Okay, it's Martin, Bogan, Ballinger and Armstrong.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ballinger played bass.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you all--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And it's a funny thing, he never sang bass.  Funny.  'Cause I didn't hear him sang any bass, but he could play that bass fiddle.
Speaker 1: So you went on tour, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --to different places?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 2554
Speaker 1: What was that like, being on the road?
Speaker 2: It was lots of place, fun and everything.  And we got a lot of gigs, you know, play for house parties and things.  I know in Chicago [Illinois], we went scouting around, what we call 'skiffling', go to a place, you know, where they have a club, maybe German, Italian or whatever.  Time we got up to the door, they'd, "Ah, we don't want to hear no Blues or (unclear).  Why don't you learn how to play some good, nice healthy Italian music," he'd say.  And I'd hunch my old buddy, [Carl] Martin or Bill Ballinger or [Ted] Bogan, or whoever was with me.  And maybe the guy standing with this fellow run the place, "Ah, John, let them come on in and play.  They can't play nothing no how."  And when we started playing and singing, they enjoyed it immensely, you know.  We go  singing the stuff, some of the songs they had forgotten.  Sang German songs, Italian songs, Spanish songs.
Speaker 1: So did--now, now how did you learn all these songs?
Speaker 2: Oh, just, just got interested and learned them.  I know when I was a kid back in La Follette [Tennessee], I would, little old kids along in my age ago, nine, ten years old, well, there was a whole Italian colony in La Follette, see.  And so I'd tell the guys, I'd say, "Hey," little black boys, you know, one and two little white kids, you know.  They had racial laws, but they didn't pay us kids much attention, just a bunch of little old kids, black and white down the street playing.  I say, "Hey, boy," my sweet tooth would hit me, you know.  "You want some good Italian cookies?"  "I want some."  "Well, what, how much of that want do you have in your hand or pocket?"  "And, what you got?"  "I got a nickel."  "I got seven cents," or so forth and so on.  "Give me that," and I'd go in this Italian bakery, Giuseppe Lobatini [phonetic], you know.  "And, what do you want, what you guys want?"  They wouldn't go in.  They'd stand on the outside.  I said, "I see some of the real choice cookies," you know.  I'd point out the cookies.  And then they'd see these little black faces pressed up against glass.  Guy had a big heart, and he'd brush the pennies and things back to me and go back in the back.  We didn't have plastic bags then, you know, like we got now.  They'd fill and they'd get one of those old big yellow or brown paper sacks, that's what we call them.  That guy'd go back there and it be just a ton of like of broken cookies.  And he'd just fill the bag up to the rim, and I'd have it, almost staggering out there with it.  And he even brushed the pennies back sometime, "Now, see you next week or some other time," you know.  And that was it.  It went on and on and on.  And a lot of guys in Chicago, when we go and play for Italian place, guy look out there, "What you guys want to come in here for?"  "We're going to play some music."  "Don't nobody want to know that blue music and stuff and all, you know."  Shoot, it didn't make no difference.  We get back in there started playing and singing, next thing you know, they forgot that we were black.  We started playing songs in Italian, German songs or whatever.  That's when Italy and Germany were good friends, you know, old [Benito] Mussolini [Fascist dictator of Italy], I know you've heard of him.
Story_ID: 2555
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Now, you came to Chicago [Illinois] in and you all got here for the World's Fair [Century of Progress], right, 1933?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, what was that like, did you get a chance to play at the Fair?
Speaker 2: Say what.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to play at the Fair, play music at the Fair?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we played at the Fair and everything.  It was unusual.  We didn't have too much competition from, none from the blacks at all.  No, man, shoot.  Guy said, "Where you going on Blue Monday or Tuesday?"  "We're going on and play at the Italian section."  Un-unh.  I'm not gonna run.  I don't feel like running.  I say, "Well, play something worthwhile, then you won't have to run." Sure enough we go over there and start playing, (unclear), but they go back and get a run off or knock off (laughs), whatever.
Speaker 1: So what, you guys would just play around the fairgrounds or what, when you went to the Fair, what would you do?
Speaker 2: Well, if it wasn't a--we played around, you know, certain parts of the fairgrounds where we knew different nationalities would be.  We'd go and play, and it tickled them, you know, even though, no doubt, we made a lot of mistakes and everything, but that was all right.
Speaker 1: So you had a pretty good act, I guess then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, (unclear) pretty thing had here.
Speaker 1: So you could, you had a very versatile group.  You could play the Blues, you could play Jazz, go to the white community, the various ethnic communities and play music.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, how many languages do you speak personally?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a language is a thing you got to use, don't use it right, it's not gonna come out right all the time.  But I know we could play about six or seven different languages and with these, you know, songs.
Story_ID: 2556
Speaker 1: Could you sing us a song in Italian, just a little bit of one right now?
Speaker 2: In Italian?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Trying to think one of my special songs.  One of our songs that we used to sing in Italian (singing 'O Sole Mio').  You know that song?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to sing that.  We used to sing that, we'd sing.  Oh, we had a bunch of good--but we had them down, you know.  We didn't have any niches or flaws in them.  And I found out one of the main things that--what's the song over--you may not even have a good a sounding voice as the one guy, but if you put expression in it, you know what I'm talking about, you, you got it made, yeah.  'Cause I know we around singing songs in German, Italian, Hungarian, Sw-.  We even swing on Skoning.  You ever heard of that? Es Skoning [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Estonia?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Estonia?
Speaker 2: Skoning.
Speaker 1: Skoning, no, no.
Speaker 2: That's Swedish.  (Singing in Swedish), you know.  Oh, we had it down.  We got some chips on our hips that one.
Speaker 1: That was amazing I guess for people.
Speaker 2: And, you know, we'd go certain places, "Hey man, you want to go skiffling tonight?"  "No, I don't want go on to no Fair singing no songs for nothing."  I said, "You sing the right thing, you get the right chips to go on your hips."  Sure enough, we'd be lucky and always came out with something in our pockets.  Nice.
Story_ID: 2557
Speaker 1: Now, you were in Chicago [Illinois] from, were you in Chicago until you went out to Pearl Harbor [Hawaii] or what?
Speaker 2: Well, I had played in Chicago.  That was my old stomping ground.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you, but you traveled around all over the place.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, all over just about.
Story_ID: 2558
Speaker 1: Sir, now, we were talking about travel before we, you and your group came to Chicago [Illinois] in '33 [1933] and you, you toured around Chicago.  And you went other places too, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where'd you go?
Speaker 2: Well, we went down in Hawaiian Islands and went on down South America, Chile, Santiago, Chile, and Sao Paulo, Brazil, oh, bunch of places.  I would have to think of some of them.
Speaker 1: Gee, that must have been exciting, you know, to do.
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: That must have been really been exciting, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, I enjoyed it.  But I found out what animosity a lot of us Americans have stood up in a lot of those countries.  Time you got inside Brazil good, they're, "American, go home.  We don't want you here."  You know, "What the hell is this?"
Speaker 1: Did they say that to you?
Speaker 2: They didn't just point me out, but I was--there was a group of us, you see.  And we're walking like a bunch of gypsies, you know.  And they were just on the sideline.  We're on the streets, you know, and they blocked the streets, you know, down there, "Hey, Americans, go home."  And my son's eyes got big around as a, dogged if I know what, looked like they was going to swell up and pop out of his head.  I said, "Tommie," I said, "they not going to hurt nobody yet.  It's not near supper time."  I said,  "Just wait a little while and they get the pots wa-, boiling and everything then, I know you wouldn't make much of a meal anyway." (laughs)  And I think he believed that crap.  His eyes got just a round as apples, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, who did you tell this to?
Speaker 2: My son.
Speaker 1: Oh, your son.  Now, now--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah he was with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you, you didn't tell us you had a son at this--now, what, what period are you talking about here?
Speaker 2: You said --.
Speaker 1: I was talking about the '30s [1930s], and--.
Speaker 2: No, it was later than that, later than that, see.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Up in the '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 2559
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't want to get you that far yet because we're still in the '30s [1930s] in Chicago [Illinois] and then so what--did you all travel much in the '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we didn't use the same route.  We traveled all through, in the '30s [1930s] we traveled all through West Virginia, Virginia and places like that, you know.  Guy said, "Where you going?"  "I'm going to West by God, Virginia, that's where I'm going.  Where you think I'm going?"  You know, West Virginia and all through the coal fields, places like that, you know, talking about that.  Then later on, we went over in the Pacific, over to Pearl Harbor [Hawaii], you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you get--now, you, you were working in, in Pearl Harbor, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--.
Speaker 1: Doing something other than playing music, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what were you doing and tell me the circumstances?
Speaker 2: I was working in the, in the plants over there, you know.  And I'm trying to think of--at one point, I was doing spot welding.
Speaker 1: Was it some kind of Civil Service job with the--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, that's exactly.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And so you weren't in the Navy, but you were, you were assigned to, to work--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, the Navy had it's big eye on us (laughs), see what I'm talking about.  And I was there when this black guy got to be internationally famous as a hero.  You don't know who he was?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.  I think you're talking about Dorien Miller.
Speaker 2: That's the man, Dorien Miller.
Story_ID: 2560
Speaker 1: Tell us about what, what happened, that week, that day--'cause you were there when it was bombed.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were, you were at Pearl Harbor, when the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But, what happened that day?  Tell us what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, just like it's--I feel the same atmosphere right here, right now.  You know what I'm talking about.  So, see this country, you know, they don't let know just really what's happening 'til lightning struck, thunder roared real loud, you see.  But when the doggone thing was about to happen, I didn't, I didn't know it, you know what I'm talking about.  It was, somebody told me, one of my old buddies from Cincinnati [Ohio], "Hey, Armstrong, Uncle Sam got some new planes."  Oh, I felt awful good, new planes, you know.  And Japan was the latest, least place in the world on my mind.  And you could look, look out the door out there in Hickam field and see the little old kids bounce a ball, throw it up higher than the plane was flying.  And these black planes had a big round, orange-colored ball on it.  He said, "Look Uncle Sam using a new kind of plane."  A guy said, "You think it's new, you better be getting you a hole to run in, see.  Those are Japanese planes."  Zeeks, they call them.  Zero.  And he said, "While you got," he said, "When you got time, you better go get you a hole you can run in."  And that made me feel awful sober. (laughs)  Wasn't long till I had removed my presence from that particular spot, don't you see.  And I had a little old buddy, one of my main buddies out of Cincinnati and his name was Glover.  He said, "Armstrong, I  thought you had more sense than that."  I said, "Than what?"  "Stand up there talking your life away with some fool who don't even know where he is."  And he said, "You won't know where you are pretty soon if you just keep standing in the way, a wide open target."  And I took my hips out of sight, see what I mean.  And got that old welding gun up under that big shed, you know, great big long, shed.  And we did spot welding, you know.  You have a welding gun, you know, I don't know whether you ever saw one or not.  And, but anyway I was mighty glad to get back home.
Speaker 1: So did you--so you, you basically ran for cover when--.
Speaker 2: I don't mean get back to the United States.  I mean, you know, just to get off, out of that real danger zone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't ever let anybody tell you there's glory in war.  Glory is if you get in and get out and stay out, that's where the glory is, stay out.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, so on that, you know, you were there when they bombed the whole (unclear)
Speaker 2: (nods head for yes).
Speaker 1: So did you all have to go try to clean up after the, after the bombing or anything?
Speaker 2: Have to do what?
Speaker 1: Did you have to, any part of trying to repair the damage of the--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was, yeah, there was always something to build back up.  (Sneeze)  Excuse me, doggone something, I don't know what the heck this is.  I don't know what I'm allergic to or something, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you stay in, in Hawaii?
Speaker 2: Oh, just about two years.
Speaker 1: Did you come back about 1943 or so?
Speaker 2: '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Forty-two.
Speaker 2: Right after they bombed it.
Story_ID: 2561
Speaker 1: So what did you do when you got back?
Speaker 2: Ran like a rabbit, got out of sight and stayed out of sight.  You know, the guys be coming in, Marines, you know, would be on already landing and everything.  And they'd holler, call you a draft dodger and everything.  Well, you're doing pretty good if you're alive, man.  War, there's no glory in war.  Get out and stay out, see, 'cause they got people trained to do just what supposed to be done, protecting the nation and everything.  That's all.
Speaker 1: So, so where did you live when you got back?
Speaker 2: Where did I live?
Speaker 1: Yes, when you came back?
Speaker 2: In this country?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, I lived in Sparta, in middle Tennessee, toward Nashville [Tennessee], halfway between, between Clar-, you ever heard of Clarksville, Tennessee?  Yeah, down below them and going on down toward Murfreesboro [Tennessee].  But Sparta's a pretty nice little town.
Speaker 1: So, well, what did you--did you just play music down there or?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, I played music around there, and then it was a guy owned the Oldham Theater, built me a studio in the basement of that theater.  And I drew everybody's picture that ever showed on that screen around there nearly.  And so then I messed around and got married.
Story_ID: 2562
Speaker 1: Now, you got married in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: In Sparta?
Speaker 2: Sparta.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--.
Speaker 2: Well, that's where I was living when I got married.  I got married a few miles from there, Cookeville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: How did you meet her?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I, like I said, I played music around there.  It was always something going on.  And she was graduating from high school, see.  So, a hungry cat don't, a cat don't turn down a good piece of meat, you see.  And so (laughs).  Then there was a guy, well, as a matter of fact, my brother, L.C. [Lee Crockett Armstrong] played the horn--he was always into something, you know what I mean, had a quick temper and all that.  And so I went on back after I came from Hawaii, I went on back to La Follette [Tennessee] where my mother [Daisy Milam Armstrong] and dad [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] were living.  And there too, before I went to Sparta, there was a phone call there for my brother.  This guy, Steven Roberts, he was a teacher at Wallace Smith High School [Sparta, Tennessee], you know.  And he wanted L.C., my brother, come down and play bass in his band.  He had a pretty good size, a nice little band.  And so my brother, off, up his old tricks, always into something, and so he, he had to go stand before the Board of Justice, you know what I mean.  And so Steve called home while home, on the telephone in La Follette from Sparta.  And my dad was back in there lying on the bed reading his old paper, 'Grit' [newspaper] or one of those crazy things.  He said, "Son"--and, and this guy who was a teacher at Wallace Smith High School, his father and my father had been friends for years and years and years.  Doc Roberts' son, so forth.  So my dad didn't want to disappoint Steve, and he said, "Son, can't you play?  You can play bass in a band, can't you?"  "I play any instrument that's got strings on it."  "Well, why don't you just go head on and, and, you know, and, and play in your brother's place." 'Cause they weren't gonna let him out of jail (unclear), you know they not gonna to do that.  So sure enough, I went on down, caught the bus and went on down to Sparta.  Steve didn't even know who I was.  He, he called me Lee, L.C. stands for Lee Crockett, see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He said, "Hey," and he's (unclear) just running and grinning right in front of the bus station.  And he said, "Lee [Crockett Armstrong], oh, how you doing?"  A whole lot of lightweight talk, you know, and I told him.  He said, "All right, let's put your stuff, put your bass on top of the car here and everything," and he strapped it on.  So I went over there and stayed there--they gave me a room up at his brother-in-law's house who was also a musician that played in the band.  Cornelius Moffett.  He played trumpet.  And so I didn't pay much attention to it.  We jelled just like that.  And so we started a nice little band going, clucking and clicking and going on.  And so I stayed there one year, and it felt kind of good.  And stayed another and the next thing you know I was part of a work thing, you know, played around the Oldham Theater [Sparta,Tennessee] and different places.  And we went up to Cookeville, McMinnville [Tennessee], Crossville [Tennessee].  We played all over, you know, and made some nice little pocket change, you know what I mean.  And next thing, one of the young graduates there who was graduating that year got kind of pregnant, I think they call it, you know.  And, and the handle kind of fit me so that they put it on me.  Next thing you know, well, we were hooked up, married, see.
Speaker 1: Tell me now, is this the mother [Celestine Crook Armstrong] of your son?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Is this the mother of your son you were talking about before?
Speaker 2: Was she the mother of my son?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your son's name is Thomas?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Your son's name is Thomas?
Speaker 2: Tommie Lee.
Story_ID: 2563
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you soon you went to Detroit [Michigan], right?  Did you, you know--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  I lived down, but the--they lived in Sparta [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Oh, so you, you went to Detroit by yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened?  Why, how--why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I don't mean Detroit, they went to La Follette [Tennessee] (unclear) was in La Follette then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And matter of fact, I had decided to go back to Chicago [Illinois] the next day.  But it turned out like it did, different and that was it.  And the people, I got so I liked the people around--they were nice people.  And one of the guy who was head of that Oldham Company, you know, that ran that theater there, he built me a studio in the basement.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this in Sparta, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, that, that (unclear) yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was trying to get you to Detroit, man, how, I was asking you how did you end up going to Detroit and did you take your family with you to, to Detroit or what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, see it's at that time I--this girl, my ex-wife [Celestine Crook Armstrong] who is, she got pregnant, you know, and everything.  And her daddy was--ran a little serve-all, you know, where it cooks the hamburgers.  For a nickel or dime, you could get as good a tasting a hamburger as you could get anywhere else for whatever you paid.  And so we finally, by the time we got married, well then it was about time he [Tommie Lee Armstrong] was born.  See?  And then after he got up a little size, he learned how to play.  I taught him.  He played in the band and there was another guy there named Crockett Officer.  And, and his daddy was a bandmaster for Ringling Brothers [circus].  He was a black man, well, he is.  And so he told me, "Stay here and work," says,  "There's no need of leaving here."  "What you wanna go for?"  He welcomed me with open arms, and I just stayed there.
Speaker 1: So you stayed in Sparta, you say?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Okay, how, how long did you stay in Sparta before you left?
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed in Sparta just about until I met her [Barbara Ward Armstrong] almost.  I stayed in there 'til Tommie Lee got big enough to play the bass fiddle, that's my son.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 2564
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm missing something here.  Let's--cause I know you, you went to Detroit [Michigan] and you worked at Chrysler [automobile factory] for thirty years, I guess, right and 'til retire, right?  Did you, didn't you retire from Chrysler in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I was trying to figure out how you got to Detroit.  We, we still haven't got that story yet.  How did you get to Detroit and why?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, I went to Detroit, let me see, I went to Chicago [Illinois].  And got--we formed a group around there, see what I mean.  Four Keys.  And I met some of my old guys I used to play with years ago.  And then we--my wife's [Celestine Crook Armstrong] cousin ran one of the biggest undertaker shops in Chicago.  And, of course, everybody around Chicago that's black, especially knew him.  His name was Charles Crook.  I don't know whether you ever heard of him or not.  Charles Crook.  But anyway I had enough of that.  And so I came on back, finally came on back to La Follette [Tennessee], you know.  And my wife's cousin was the largest undertaker in Chicago.  You might have heard of him, Charles Crook.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is this Chicago or Detroit, we're talking about?
Speaker 2: No, I'm talking about Chicago now.  Chicago was where I went then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about what year is this.  What year was this that you went?  Was this before you went to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Um?
Speaker 1: Was this before you went to Detroit?
Speaker 2: You said something about, I didn't--.
Speaker 1: I said, sir, is this, were you in Chicago before you went to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  We played all over Chicago.  We even recorded in Chicago.  Of course, Charles Crook, my wife's first cousin had the biggest undertaker shop in Chicago, bar none.  More Negroes are buried because more of them die faster than any other race over there.  Um-hmm.  But anyway--head out, I had to.
Story_ID: 2565
Speaker 1: So, well, what about Detroit [Michigan]?  Tell me about Detroit.
Speaker 2: Oh, Detroit.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, Detroit, see I got married there.  My [ex-] wife [Celestine Crook Armstrong] was finishing high school in Sparta [Tennessee].  And I happened to be the illustrator for the Oldham Theater [Sparta, Tennessee], the Cumberland Amusement Company.  They built me a studio, you remember I told you a while ago?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And so it wasn't long 'til when I took an urge to leave, you know.  I got on the road again, started playing here and there, different places and so forth and so on.  That's how I met Barbara [Ward Armstrong] by playing.  (Unclear)--yeah, um-hmm.  Okay.  But that traveling stuff will get you, man.  It gets some people.  It takes me getting enough of it, I'm telling you.  And then a while you, you want to go back to it, you see what I'm talking about.  See her cousin was the largest undertaker there in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Charles Crook.  Undertaker.  I don't know whether he lived up to his name or not, but he had cousin I know didn't live up to anybody's name when it come to putting stuff in his pockets, you know, didn't belong.
Speaker 1: Now, you said, your wife had, had a cousin who committed suicide or something?  You had a picture of it you drew of a cousin or something of your first wife's that committed suicide?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  I mean to see who it was.  I know it was a suicide in there somewhere.
Story_ID: 2566
Speaker 1: So, sir, can, can you tell us what's the best thing about being a musician?
Speaker 2: What's the best thing about doing what?
Speaker 1: Being a musician.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know what the best thing is, it strikes different people differently, see.  Usually musicians are usually welcomed, you know, in most places they go.  I know that for sure.  We used to be just walking along on the weekend in West Virginia, Huntington, West Virginia, you know, or Charleston [West Virginia].  And somebody be giving one of those cut-throat house-rent parties, you know.  "Hey, fellows come in here, come in here, come in here, play a little bit."  "Okay," and go and play.  And then if it happens in the black end of town maybe see.  And then on another occasion, in maybe a place like Chicago [Illinois] or somewhere, they say, "Hey, you (clear) fellas come on in here and play some music."  And somebody guy smart alec, "Ah, we don't want to hear that stuff."  "Who want to hear some?"  "We don't know nothing about no Blues."  And we surprised them, you know.  We started singing 'Krakow Viacaw' (ph.) stuff like that, you know, some Polish songs, things like that, you know, Slavic.  Or German songs and just for the heck of it, my old buddy, Ted [Bogan], played the guitar.  He had a heck of a English accent, let alone German.  He'd start singing songs in German and some of them guys, they'd be around him like flies.  "My goodness, who ever saw a black Deutschmann before."  And man, we'd maybe play a year or so there, yeah.  Shoot he could sing songs like 'Auch du lieber Augustin.'  You know, and around Christmas, we, we're doing all the German Christmas songs.  You know what the main they want us to sing?
Speaker 1: No, sir, which one?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Which one?  I don't know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: 'O Tannenbaum.'  You know what that means don't you?
Speaker 1: Something about a tree.
Speaker 2: 'O, Christmas Tree.'  (in German) "Wie treu sind deine Blätter."  And the guy come around, "Mein Gott, whoever saw a black Deutschmann before?"  Well, it's not so wonderful--well, it's wonderful because many times, you know, black people don't care to learn foreign songs, you see.  And we started singing it in German and Spanish songs, you know.
Story_ID: 2567
Speaker 1: So what do you think about today's black music?  What do you think about some of the modern music, today's music, 2003?
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean that they sing today?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, it seem to be pretty well received.  And not only do they sing, they dance with the singing, you know, what I'm talking about.  It all depends on when you make people feel or see what you see and feel.  That's what counts, see.  And if you can get the audience to shouting and, and going along with feeling what you--'cause human emotions are contagious.  'Cause I used to stop by a funeral and my, even my little son [Tommie Lee Armstrong] at the time would be standing there and tears running down his cheeks.  He didn't even know the kid that they were having a funeral for.  But he was there and he was part of it.  Satisfied and went on home.  And his mother [Celestine Crook Armstrong] said, "Tommie, what you, what were you standing there crying so for?"  "Oh, Ma dear, you don't understand."  And I real right, realized right then, I didn't understand and she didn't either.  Human emotions are contagious.  You may not even know the language, you know what I mean, but you go over there and start listening and going on.  But I remember was one of the funniest things this old ex-slave, John Moore, in La Follette, Tennessee was preaching, and he, he was very illiterate.  I don't think he could even read his name - you put it in box car letters.  And he was preaching, you know, about Samson in the lions' den.  I don't know whether you ever heard that sermon or not, but I'm sure you heard somebody preach about Samson at one time or another.  He had on a split-tail coat.  "Samson killed the lion," Bam!  Hobnail shoes stomped the floor, popped his coattail.  Old sister and brother, "I know it.  It, it, it's in the book cause I seen (with emphasis) it in there." (laughs)  That's all they could do was see it cause they couldn't read and write, you know.  And then there was old brother sitting way over by himself, you know, pretty literate guy, and this old preacher, you know, popped his coattail and stomped his foot.  He said, "Samson took the jawbone--you know the book say Samson took the jawbone of an ass."  "Samson took the jawbone of a horse's ass and killed 10,000 Philistines."  Well, one old brother, well, everybody were given leave two by two, three by three.  And he, he was very much insulted, but he too lazy and evil to get on up and go on home.  So after the old preacher was winding up his sermon, he said, "Brother, say, you act like you don't agree with the sermon.  What's the matter with you?  You didn't seem well pleased with it."  "No," he stood up and, "Let me tell you one thing.  You better get your stuff down better than that.  Who ever heard of a horse having a jawbone in his ass?"  And man, that, that did it.  I don't think that guy ever came to that church again.  Yes, snapped his coattail and slapped his hand, "Samson took the jawbone of a horse's ass."  "Jawbone--whoever heard of a horse having a jawbone in his ass?" (laughs)  You'd be surprised, you'd be surprised.

Speaker 1: Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns about the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, what I think is you got to have a goal.  You don't just go down to a railroad station, buy a ticket, you know.  You got to know - want to know where you're going or something about the place, you know, something like that.  Or if you're going on a vacation, even if something that attracts you some kind of way.  You guy want to go to Florida, for instance or to Hawaii.  There's something about the landscape or what not attracts you.  And you try to go and see if it's what they said it was.  But oftentimes, we just get things by hearsay.  See?  But it's so many things in the world even yet (unclear) that really set you off.  You just know it, that's right.
Speaker 1: Now, sir, what at the present time now, I mean, you're, you've been performing for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  What do you consider is your legacy?
Speaker 2: What do I consider what?
Speaker 1: Is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I hadn't given it too much thought.  But there's one thing about it, if someone can hold your attention--they got to get it first, and starts talking or preaching about something, next thing you know, you get interested in it and you say, "Wait a minute, that guy knows what he's talking about.  I think I'll go in next Sunday or next when it is, you know, hear him talk some more."  Next thing, you're a disciple.  You might even join his church or whatever his society or something.  That's the way that is.  Because human emotions are contagious.  That's all it is to that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now is it - is there anything in life that you've done that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: If I think it was better than what I got now, or had, yeah, sure.  But you see usually now, if you want something worthwhile, you got to give something worthwhile, see.  That's the way that go.  It's like friendship.  If you want to be a friend to a person, if you want a friend, then that goes for a woman or a man, you've got to reach out yourself, see.  Next thing you know, say, "I, I thought he or she was a snob.  Well, they're kind of nice people." (laughs)  That'll bring you right together, see.  But you got to bring something, if you want to get something.  I used to hear guys talk about, "You, you just be here when I come back.  I'll fix you.  You just be here."  "Well, I'll be here old dude, but remember you got to bring ass if you want to get ass," see what I'm talking about.  So this is a complex world.  I don't care what you say.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have favorite musicians, the people that, that play, that have played in the past or playing now that are your favorites?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, a lot of them in the past, a lot of Blues singers when people didn't think so much of the Blues.  Guys like Leroy Carr, Scrapper Blackman, Bessie Smith, Ida Cox, Ma Rainey, Blue Card.  I, I knew a lot of them personally, see.  And they were good people I mean in my book.  See?  And first thing you saw you had so much in common, you'd go around where they're performing.  And sometimes, "Ah, come on up on dude, join in, bring your acts, come on over."  You know, next thing you know a whole congregation would be right in there, melded together.  But see oftentimes when we think a thing is just like it should be cause we like it, it may not be that way.  Try it sometimes, you'd be surprised.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, you've been married [to Barbara Ward Armstrong] for about twenty years now, right?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: You've been married for about twenty years and there's even been a film made of your life, your married life, you know, over the past twenty years.  Now, you got married when you in your seventies, right?  So you want to tell us about that?
Speaker 2: And married more than what?
Speaker 1: No, no, can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: About when I was what?
Speaker 1: About your marriage?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, yeah, I been - all of them weren't happy.  That's for sure.  But when I found out, use a little common sense, I just--.  Sometimes I'd sit down and talk with the woman, you know, and then she had more common sense than I had.  "I'll see you later."  Let's try something else, you try somebody else.  I'd try somebody else.  See, and I found out it would maybe work.  And maybe it wouldn't work, you find out you fare worse than you did being with the person.  But it's something living with somebody else.  I don't care how much in love you think you are, you'll find it out.  It's easy to find out, see.  But I know one thing I learned about that marriage and, and stuff, it, it--learn to keep your own counsel.  Don't having to go to the right people and get it, you know what I mean.  And some people are jealous and do not want to see you get along.  Do anything to break you up.  Just like a old guy I know, first marriage.  He kept telling me, "Man, that chick's no good, she ain't no good, you know."  Come to find out, he wanted her worse than the other guy that was biting me in the back. (laughs)  Really.  So that happens, you see.  Because the trouble with most of us, we expect more from the partner we want than we're willing to give or able to give.  That's the sad part, you see.  Yeah.  And then years and years ago, when my daddy came along and everything, it was certain rules you had laid down for your wife or spouse, you see what I'm talking about, which maybe then she was unable to live up to them.  The next thing you know, you're broken up and you try it on another person and then the next you know, you come home they done packed up and gone.  "Gosh, she done went!" (laughs)
Story_ID: 2570
Speaker 1: "Which way did she went?  She went with the wind."  So we just have to use common sense and sometimes common sense doesn't work all the time cause common sense can be cheap in a way, but it can be expensive in other ways see.  You just have to try and see.  It's not that easy.  I'm telling you.  And those old people, my mother [Daisy Ann Milam Armstrong] and daddy [Thomas Franklin Armstrong] they, they had to have something that kept them together.  I guess that's the reason they had so many blame kids, you know.  Shoot, and it was an honor for them as well as a pleasure to have a lot of kids, you know.  And people didn't mind helping each other.  I've known a many night my dad and mother would jump up.  "Mama wha-?"  "You young-uns stay right where you are in your bed and I better not catch your head sticking out the door, or I'm gone it crack it wide open like a coconut."  "We got to go over to Sister so and so's and help them.  They got trouble."  "And I mean you better not be off this yard, off the premises."  And we had sense enough to stay there.  They come back, things were in pretty good shape.  But just 'cause we think it should be a certain way, it's not necessarily so.  And sometimes people say they're your friends, you'll find out when you summarize what you got, they're not as good a friend as you thought they were 'cause your friend not going to tell you things on someone you care for that makes you happy and everything.  Unh-uh, they're not gone do that.  But then some people--and they're not gonna run until they stick their dips in your business.  "You don't know that."  "Man, I see, I bet you I know something you don't know."  "I say you may know a lot."  "I bet you don't know where your old man was today or your old lady was."  "No, man."  And if you show any interest, that's when you're getting ready to have trouble at home.  I know what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1: Now, you had a chance to go back to La Follette, Tennessee for a big reunion a few years ago, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: To do what, now?
Speaker 1: I said, what was that like, the reunion at La Follette, Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Well, they even got together and wanted--they even wanted to name a street after me, right there at the main black street in La Follette, 7th Street.  They wanted to name it after me.  And I don't know, I don't know what was on my mind at the time, but anyway I know I made myself scarce. (laughs)  And maybe I did the right thing.  I don't know.  But they say, old [Benjamin] Franklin said, "The taste of the pudding is the proof thereof."  And that may not always be true, you know what I'm talking about.
Story_ID: 2572
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Be what?
Speaker 1: Remembered.
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't like for people to think of me as a ragtag, cut-throat or anything like that.  I would like to think if I'd treated you as a friend or as a good neighborhood, that you'd return the favor and so forth and so on.  That's right.  That's the way I'd see it.  Because what works for one person may not work for the other.  And they may not accept it the same way, see.  But it's funny old world, big old world, full of joy and a whole lot of sorrow.  Don't believe it, just get out there a little while, you'll see.

Speaker 2: Some serious preaching there.
Speaker 1: He makes fun of preachers a lot, you know.
Speaker 2: I'm just telling it like it is.  You didn't have to spray any, you know, insect powder.  All those that didn't take a bath would be sitting to one side of the church and those on the other.  And then the old preacher started popping his coattail and get the atmosphere stirred and it was horrible.

Speaker 2: He never would use his whole name.  You know what his whole name was, his first name?
Speaker 1: Un-unh.
Speaker 2: Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Tennessee?
Speaker 2: And, and he changed it to Tim.
Speaker 1: I'm glad he did.
Speaker 2: And they said, "Why did you change your name to Tim?"  He said, "Who in the hell want to be named after a state you can't even go in a restaurant and get a sandwich."  There he is right there.
Speaker 1: Makes sense.
Speaker 2: The Jim Crow stuff.
Speaker 1: My father had a brother named James and my last name is Crowe, and he had a brother named James who they called Bud.

Speaker 1: That one's a peculiar one because it's nothing like anything he's ever done.  It doesn't look like--the reference we can't figure out, at eleven years old, where that came from.
Speaker 2: Where do you think it came from?
Speaker 1: No, but I mean it's just curious drawing.
Speaker 2: Everybody has his opinion of what art is.  If they had the right one, they could draw, correctly.
Speaker 1: Boy that--your camera's amazing--.
Speaker 2: My what?
Speaker 1: The accuracy of it, I said, that's an amazing camera.  That's what Lea has, the same kind of camera.

Speaker 2: That's by R. [Robert] Crumb [illustrator].
Speaker 1: That's a scary - I don't like that one.
Speaker 2: Well, everybody doesn't the same things.

Speaker 2: A lot of us don't like it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's stereotypical.
Speaker 1: I see what you're saying.  Well, that was Crumb.
Speaker 2: Playing him as a ruey [roué], and he's not--,
Speaker 1: That's the way they see it.
Speaker 2: Not that kind of man at all.  I never did like that.
Speaker 1: Well--.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: If everyone liked the same things, you wouldn't have to put but one dish on the table.

Speaker 1: No, don't remember.

Speaker 1: That's the promo poster for the premiere of the documentary film, 'Sweet Old Song.'  That's anywhere from 2000 to 2001 or 2 [2002] cause there are several photos on that.  You know, the film was worked on for that period of time.  That, the photo of our heads together was part of the beginning of the project.  I'd say around late, year 2000 and the one with him playing the fiddle might have been a year later.
