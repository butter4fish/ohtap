Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Okay, Eleanor--you have that there on your paper.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, but you have to spell it for us on--
Speaker 2: E-L-E-A-N-O-R, and then my mother's name, Vaughn, V-A-U-G-H-N, that her maiden name and that was my middle name, Green was the family name.  Of course my grandfather, paternal grandfather, he was the only one of his family who was a Green.  All of his cousins, brothers and all of our cousins, they came from Blackstone, Virginia, my grandfather did and his--when he first came to this area, he was Greenhill which (unclear).  However, when he was working for the railroad, the railroad man said that name was too long for, for him.  And so, so Green, that would be your name.  And so that's why we are Green, but yet all of our cousins and all over are named Greenhill, G-R-E-E-N.  Some people would like to put an E on the end of that, but no. The Hill was removed and left us Green.
Speaker 1: So this railroad man was his boss, is that it?
Speaker 2: He had a job.  He was a barrel maker for one of the rail--now how that's related to the railroad activity, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  However, I was young when he died, but I remember, yeah, and all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So that was my name before I married the first time.
Speaker 1: Well that's interesting to think that someone's boss could just change their name.
Speaker 2: Well it's nothing official.  No--I mean birth certificate or anything like that.  I mean he and my grandmother got married in Blackstone before they left to come to Norfolk together. They went to the church and they--the pastor prayed over and their family was there with them at the church and maybe some friends.  And then afterwards they jumped over a broom and no papers.  So in fact, the--his boss also told him this, that the marriage that you people have when you come out, when you come from the--he called it a country--when you come from the country has no validity at all.  You go down to Norfolk and get papers for the marriage.  Or if you don't have papers, anything happen to you, you can't get the money that goes along with the death of the railroad worker.
Speaker 1: Oh, the pension, yeah.
Speaker 2: You have to have some papers.  Well we jumped the broom together.  That's not papers.  So they had had children and all but my aunt showed me that 1914 was their official marriage or the last two of them, my aunt and her--and her brother who was next to her who was just above her in age.  Those are the only two who were born from what they call a legal situation and all.  So, so that's the name.  So we--that was my name, Eleanor Vaughn Green before I married.  Then when I married Edward Dawley, I started using Vaughn and started Eleanor Green Dawley.
Speaker 1: Okay, D-A-W-L-E-Y?
Speaker 2: D-A-W-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.  Okay, and ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My place of birth is Norfolk, Virginia and the date is August 10, 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And ma'am, what is your occupation or what was your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired mathematics professor.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Today's date is February, got to make sure I get it right--February the 5th, I believe isn't it?  February the 7th.  Well I'm retired, so forgive me.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay, February the 7th, 19--2012.
Speaker 1: All right, Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
Story_ID: 20694
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up and the first one is, they just require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: [Laughter], all right, well a favorite food, well not really.  I--people call me a healthy eater.  I--now fruits and vegetables are what I mostly consume.  And as long as I see fruits and vegetables are available, they are the food that I like.  But I cannot think of any one in particular that I prefer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you a vegetarian?
Speaker 2: No, sometimes--now I do not eat pork and beef.  But then again it's not a dogmatic thing.  I have been in occasions that I have gone on bus trips to places when I'm--if I'm--I've been deprived of food long enough and pork is available, I'll eat it.  I don't buy it but I will--sometimes situations arrive when you eat what is available.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: A favorite color?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I find that I do have to buy something I--when I go into the store I find that our best--to tell the person specially--when I say I have to, sometimes it's a particular occasion I'm going to.  Maybe I'm going to a class reunion up at Howard [Howard University] and at the luncheon we try to look our best because we have to be well dressed because well, especially when you get to the fiftieth reunion and beyond because I mean your face and thing is only so much you could do with that.  Time is showing but you do want to look like you're not having a hard time.  So I usually find it--approach it this way. Someone will come up and ask can I help you?  And I will tell them what I'm looking for and the occasion.  And I'll find the clerk will decide what I'm going to wear.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I find the time of the year that I like is the beginning of spring when we put down the plants and the thing and then the things you have put up the year before, those perennial type plants, they're beginning to come up and all of that and then you appreciate that.  And you're deciding what you're going to put down this year to join them and that's the time, the spring.  The weather is--you might have had some cold days coming in and all like that and even you know in this area, you even occasionally have snow and all that type of situation.  But once the end of March and that point, after April fool's day, we know we will not see any snow or anything like that.  And so I find that a joyous and beautiful time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.  I do not have a favorite place to go.  I used to like going to any place that had a beach but once you have had three children and your age has gotten on the other side of fifty, you don't think that you should go around in a bathing suit on a beach.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing I will often say, all is well that ends well.
Story_ID: 20695
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and then your father's side of the family so we can keep them straight.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother was Lillian Louise Vaughn before she married.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: V-A-U-G-H-N.
Speaker 1: B--oh Vaughn, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1901, in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well we know nothing at all.  My grandmother never told us exactly any details of my mother's father.  Now the one thing, now on my mother's side I know we--I can go back to my, actually as far as--I don't have anything written but I know about my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Oh, do you know your great-grandmother's name on your mother's side?

Speaker 1: Okay.  So she did mostly like farm work or what?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well she continued--she did not come to Virginia.  She lived in Hertford County, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that Hertford County--do you know how to spell that?
Speaker 2: H-E-R-T-F-O-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother's family you can trace them back to Hertford County, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And that's, you know where that's near?  Is that near--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the cities are Winton, Ahoskie and things of that sort.  And my grandmother, Gussie, her daughter, she was born on, all I know was the--I don't know the name of the township, all they know it was on the, it was located on the road between Ahoskie and Winton, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you know why they came to Norfolk, why that's--why your grandmother came to Norfolk?
Speaker 2: Well when she was a young, very young girl she came to Norfolk because she had to work for a family, a white family.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, all right.
Speaker 2: That's where my mother was born in Norfolk.
Speaker 1: Now what did your mother tell you about growing up in Norfolk?
Speaker 2: Well what did--well she said she attended the public schools there and--[Laughter].
Speaker 1: You got a good story you're trying not to tell me aren't you? [Laughter].
Speaker 2: And I--they weren't--there wasn't a lot of money around and things of that sort.  But she liked to move with good company and a good (unclear).  No see there are, there's certain things that sometime your mother would say to you.  My mother was very fair complexion and she felt that is one reason people were nice to her and she was accepted in some circles.  All she had to do was behave herself and show that she was a lady.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So her color was like a passport to--as long as she you know acted like she belonged?  Was that what you--?
Speaker 2: Yes and then--yes.  And then too, the government workers were considered the desired husbands, those who had passed the postal examination and working as a postal (unclear).
Story_ID: 20696
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother ever--did she finish school here in Norfolk?
Speaker 2: Well she went, well now she went to what they call in Rock Castle, Virginia to a Catholic school.  My family is Roman Catholic.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: My father was, he was A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].

Speaker 2: In St. Francis De Sales, that's where she (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  So what was your mother like as a young person?  Did she--what did she like to do?
Speaker 2: Well she was very easy to get along with and all.  And people seemed to like her a lot and things of that sort, you know.  And she was able to--I mean we don't talk like they used to talk.
Story_ID: 20697
Speaker 1: --I mean it seems like if I (unclear).  Well anyway the--she (unclear) she came out of school.  She sometimes used to work in what they call service you know those jobs and all.  And she had moved in good company and she was able to get a good husband you know.  He was a--his family was dark but they were good people and they had more education than her family and all.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was a good provider for the--see we don't--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.

Story_ID: 20698
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let me go to your father's side and we'll get them together.  So can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?

Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: January 15th, 1898.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Norfolk, oaky.  Now what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well we spent more time with his side of the family there, you know.  They--he was one of five children.  And my father didn't go to college, he went to the Navy after--they didn't have a high school, public high school in Norfolk and he finished grade--he was in there for two years and he was notified that he had passed the postal examination.
Story_ID: 20699
Speaker 1: Now let me get this straight.  Now it--just by a simple calculation, I'm not much of a mathematician but was your father in the [U.S.] Navy during World War I?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did he have any stories he shared about that?
Speaker 2: Well he went in--he did not go to foreign countries but he went in foreign waters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also where one story he have to tell, he once met a, found a mess shipmate there.  What happened there, he thought that maybe that was the most frightening experience that he had in there was not--had nothing to do with the war.  What happened there is one of the off--they waited on the officers.  They were mess attendants.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that the black sailors were--all worked in the--as cooks, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the sailors, I mean the blacks and the Filipinos, that's what they were all on mess duty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All--and the Filipinos.  And so well anyway, one of the officers came back there looking for one of them around and so he accused one of--he was talking to one, looking for this mess attendant and he accused him of something and the mess attendant said that's not so, I didn't do it.  You're a lie.  And so he called the white officer a lie and white officer smacked him.  And so the guy said to him--I mean then the mess attendant said you saw it didn't you?  You saw him hit me first.  And he grabbed the guy, threw him and--threw him to the floor and jumped on him and gave him a smacking and was getting ready--but they all pulled him off.  And so he was afraid that he--they were going to get dishonorable discharges, all those who was involved but they never heard anymore from the incident.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But yet the guy had thrown the white officer to the thing, but they didn't do anything to them.
Speaker 1: Now the man who threw the white officer down was your father?
Speaker 2: Not my father.
Speaker 1: Not your father but somebody else?
Speaker 2: His friend.
Speaker 1: His friend, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But all of them are frightened.
Speaker 1: All right. All right.
Speaker 2: All of them are frightened about it.  That's what--they immediately pulled him off.  The guy didn't get--the officer didn't get a whipping, he only got one or two--
Speaker 1: Smacks.
Speaker 2: [Laughter].  Yeah, eventually about twenty years late--no, well maybe more than that, the man was in the off--he was in the area and he was inquiring did anybody know a man named George Green that worked for the post--that used to work at the post office?  And somebody was in the drug store where he inquired.  They said he still is and he (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was the man that got in the incident?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Came back to see your father?
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was his favorite one, somebody doing that, hitting a white man and not nothing was done about it.
Speaker 1: Well that was a serious matter in those days.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Scary matter and not just because it's the Navy but because of the racial implications too, right?
Speaker 2: I suppose so, but he was--
Speaker 1: Yes.  That was an era where there was a lot of lynching going on and a lot of horrible things happening.  So--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 20700
Speaker 1: Now did your father--now is there a story about where his side of the family is from?  Did they--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Blackstone, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Blackstone, Virginia okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then as I said cree--Greenhill was his father.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather's name was Greenhill right, but he was made to change--
Speaker 2: No my grandfather was Green.
Speaker 1: Right, cause he had to change his name.  Is that the one that had to change--?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your grandfather's first name?
Speaker 2: Walter.
Speaker 1: Walter.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And he started off as a Greenhill but then changed it to Green?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When he came to Norfolk it was changed and when he got married officially, a legal marriage as they say.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now why did--was it because he was working for the railroad that he came to--or that he came to Norfolk, your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Well I think somebody from there was saying they were doing some hiring.  Blackstone is not very far from here and so they're doing some hiring and so that's why he came to Norfolk.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is your father or grandfather?
Speaker 2: Grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father and mother were both born in Norfolk.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright.
Story_ID: 20701
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so your father didn't--but he was, after the war he got a job with the post office?
Speaker 2: Yes, he passed the exam while he was in the service so soon as he came out of the--they waited--soon as he came out of--applied to come out, I think he had signed up for two years or three year assignment in the enlistment.
Speaker 1: Now what did your father do for the post office?
Speaker 2: He was a letter carrier.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that was a--being a letter carrier was a coveted job in those days, was it not?
Speaker 2: That's right, uh-huh.  The pay was the same as they paid the white carriers.  It was equal pay and so for the colored fellows who could pass the exam, it was a good thing.
Speaker 1: And it included benefits too, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 20702
Speaker 1: All right.  Now here's the question, how did your parents meet?  Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, not really because at that time, even when I was growing up, blacks all lived in the same side of town and so they always knew each other.  If you didn't know, maybe somebody in the family maybe been in the same age bracket.  My father was only four or five years older than my mother anyway and so there's no when they met, they just always knew each other (unclear) and all.
Story_ID: 20703
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a name for the black side of town in Norfolk?
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: I mean in those days, was there a name for it?
Speaker 2: Well now there were certain sections, Huntsville and Lynwood, but now my father and his mother, they did buy a house in the, a section there, what is that, Washington Heights.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father and his mother bought that house.  That's the house in which I was born.
Story_ID: 20704
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, okay, now when you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and their looks and their dispositions who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well people say, used to say I look more like my father heard them say, I--or my grandmother, my mother's mama used to say thank god you're not that dark, but you certainly look like him.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  Well color was a big you know issue in the community in those days I take it in that you know that people were talking like that.  So you say your father was very dark, your mother was very light?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And people thought it was better to be light than to be dark because of the way you're treated and--?
Speaker 2: Well the men with the steady jobs for the most part, they prefer a light skinned woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any idea, I mean do you have any idea as to why?
Speaker 2: [Laughter].  Why?  Well I don't think I can--it's when--well I don't know.  When they're having children--well they--well some of them used to say they're thinking of the children.  That was the excuse they would say.
Story_ID: 20705
Speaker 1: So your parents--so there's no story about how they met and got together?
Speaker 2: Well no.  But actually like I say they always knew each other.  Norfolk was not a big city at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I guess I implied from what you're saying that your mother wanted a man with a good job, good paying job?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then her mother used to tell her it is no--I mean her mother used to say, keep yourself clean.  Don't do this and don't lay--um-um, what you know and definitely not--cause you can get a husband.  There's no point in being the same color as the white man without making some use of it.  Nobody's going to pay you cause you're light.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what she--
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well--
Speaker 2: And my grandmother was the one who used to talk that stuff more so than my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I think I've--that's a generation that really pushed that kind of thinking.  You're right.  You're right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You're right.  So now, so your mother and your father got together.  They got--when did they get married?
Speaker 2: In Norfolk.
Speaker 1: I mean, and when?
Speaker 2: They got married in 1923.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they married in 1923?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now do you have like brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: It was six of us.
Speaker 1: And can you name them and tell us where you fall in the order?
Speaker 2: Okay.  George Herbert Green, Jr., was the first.  I was number two.  Number three was Barbara Ann, number four was Walter Howard Green, and number five was Lillian Louise Green and number six was Mary Agnes Green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all grew up together--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --in the same household?  And did any of your grandparents live with you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well when I was--no, we lived in--up until the time I was about four years old we lived--three years old, three years old, we lived in the house that my grand--my father and his mother had purchased.  It was a great big house in Washington Heights section of Norfolk.  They had it built and all like that.  And in fact on the table there is a--it's over a hundred years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother used to work as a char lady at one of the banks and all that after they had the house.  The furniture was given to them.  There's a bookcase out right there by the door, that was--came from the--was given to them.
Speaker 1: And the--
Speaker 2: And those--
Speaker 1: Now we can't show it on camera now but you're referring to a dining room table, a very nice wooden dining room set--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --in the dining room.  So--
Speaker 2: So it has leaves to go in it to extend it and all like that.
Speaker 1: It's over a hundred years old.  It looks good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well see the--well it was given to her by some--I don't know whether it was one of the lawyers at the bank or one of the banker, where a white man--for the house.  He was getting new furniture and she was--had the new one and all like that.  It appears to be quite, that furniture is quite heavy but it's not hard to move it.  Just pull it out and all that because it has, it's all on rollers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They put them on rollers then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it's very nice.
Speaker 2: And that side board there, all the carving and things in it came from there too.
Story_ID: 20706
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: And earlier childhood memory.
Speaker 1: Earliest.
Speaker 2: Earliest one.
Speaker 1: What's the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: The earliest thing being--I remember was when my grandmother had to--had gotten in some trouble, she and another woman.  Howard Green was a man that liked the ladies.  I don't know exactly because some time he would stay away for a long while.  And anyway so the lady had said my grandmother had pushed her around and then another one of the neighbors coming in there knocking at the door, door, door.  Hannie (sp.), that was my grandmother's name, you have to go to court.  I, I'll go testify and tell the judge that she pushed you first over there.  I remember my grandma going there and all the--but they didn't lock her up but we were all wondering whether she would be back or not.  So she came around and so, anyway so when she came back she said no he wouldn't lock me up.  No, he said uh-uh, you married to him and right--and so if somebody hit you over your husband, you have a right to beat them up.  Those were her words (unclear).  Of course she said that's what the judge told her.  And so I remember that.  That was all the neighbors and all were in the house to see what had happened and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They, did they stay married?
Speaker 2: Yeah, until he died of diabetes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: The thing about it, if a person has a job you know even though he doesn't bring all of it home.  But occasionally you sometime have to go out and try to encourage him not to have all them in, but it can't be done.
Speaker 1: So you think they stayed together for practical reasons, she needed the--
Speaker 2: Well she couldn't do any better.
Story_ID: 20707
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we always ask this question and I know you--well you lived with your--you lived in Washington--
Speaker 2: Heights section.
Speaker 1: --Heights section in the beginning and then the family moved right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did you move to?
Speaker 2: My father had a house built on the--in a section called Boulevard Terrace.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On Virginia Beach Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Is that still in Norfolk?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you tell us what were some of the sights and be mindful that this is 2012, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And so give us some of the differences and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Now some of the sights that we were growing up, let's see.  I was just trying to--well the--there was an ocean breeze breach in the warm weather we would go to (unclear) there and also--and churches played--the building itself, those church building played a lot of--around and programs were--plays and all were being performed by church members.  If people you knew were acting in them and things of that sort we would go to see them and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: So you had quite a few plays in church?
Speaker 2: Yeah the members of the congregation and things of that sort are performing in the churches and all.
Speaker 1: Well that's kind of unique in a sense cause (unclear).
Speaker 2: And then in the Catholic--now that's one thing my father said he wasn't going to send us--he didn't send us to Catholic school.  But we went for instructions and they would have programs and we would be--go there for several things like that.
Speaker 1: Did your mother continue to be a Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes, and all of us were Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father was an A.M.E., right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So would he come to the Catholic's church?
Speaker 2: Well if you were being confirmed or receiving your first communion or things of that sort he would come.  And they were of course, they were married by a priest and of course even today in a--for the church to approve it, you have to say any children born of the marriage will be Catholic and all, and taking instructions there.  But he--I remember later, after my children were receiving communion and things when he was around at Christ the King Church on Tidewater Drive, he came and my middle son was receiving communion and all and walking around there.  And his partner there was a white girl.  Now then my father said, oh the Catholic's, you know they're not bad at all.  They really take the--they really do some good things.  Oh my son they were just walking in together.  They weren't holding hands--you go around from the class, around like that.  (Unclear) but those things were nice.
Speaker 1: What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Around--let's see what did we do?  Well the circus used to come to town.  Of course we would do that.  And then of course we had sports there, some good baseball teams and things like that.  I think most of us saw Satchel Paige [Leroy Robert Satchel Paige, American baseball player] play before ya'll saw him in the big cities, who lived in those big cities and all.  Okay--
Speaker 1: Was there a baseball team here in the Tidewater area?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it called?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  Let's see what it was.
Speaker 1: It was a Negro baseball team?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had one in there.  Then I know the football team was the Brown Bombers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we would attend those and things of that sort.  Now I don't remember any--oh yes, there's one guy that I--we all--he wasn't on the Browns--now this was a baseball team.  There was a fellow named Satchel Paige that used to play here against the team that we were, and all like that and he went on to become a famous player there and all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Story_ID: 20708
Speaker 1: Now what did you like to do when you were growing up?  Did--?
Speaker 2: Well I left here more or less.  I finished high school when I was 15.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get you out of high school yet now.
Speaker 2: Oh, (unclear).
Speaker 1: What did you like to do when you were a little kid?
Speaker 2: Oh when I was a little kid?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well we played something called hopscotch and dodge ball when I was small there.  And then too I liked--we used to make a little money.  We'd go to the--now before there was a field in (unclear) probably like before World War II really got into it.  You--the government bought property there where they were going to build the housing and so they had--it was a strawberry field located there and they bought the property I guess maybe a couple of years before they actually began building.  And we could go there, pick strawberries and we would sell them, go around and sell them to people.  And you see whatever we got for them was profit because just (unclear) we didn't have to pay for.
Speaker 1: They just grew wild, right?
Speaker 2: Well it had been actually a field cultivated by farmers.  But when the government bought property they no longer had the field there.  I mean it was abandoned.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: It belonged to the U.S. government and they didn't--until they were ready to put the housing up for the people they didn't care what the neighbors, people who lived near it did I don't suppose.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we'd pick them and all.  So that's what, I mean that--so and again that was in the spring time when they--when the strawberries come there about the first thing that get ripe there and we could sell them.  All you had to do was do one, have one quarter container because you put them in your big pan at home and then you use the quart to measure out to the people and they would bring a, pack up a pan and give us three cents or a nickel or what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we enjoyed doing that.
Story_ID: 20709
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your school, your first school?
Speaker 2: Douglas Park.
Speaker 1: Okay, Douglas Park, named after Fredrick Douglas?
Speaker 2: I suppose so but it was just Douglas Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Douglas Park Elementary School.  And now did you like school?
Speaker 2: Very much, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did you have any--?
Speaker 2: Well one thing, see I wasn't good at athletics or dancing and things of that sort but I was able to do well in school.  I was able to do that.  That was about the only thing I could excel in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you one of the best students?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you have an aspiration of what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not really because now my aunt, my father's youngest sister was a teacher and that's what it seemed to be that when you finished school, when people come out of Virginia State [Virginia State University], that's what they would do, teach school.  But I really didn't think about that as I moved on.  I enjoyed the school itself.  I think one, that's one reason why I did well in mathematics was because I liked doing that.  And when I'd get problems that I couldn't solve, I didn't mind giving it the time to work on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I liked spending the time.  And so often people will quickly say, I can't do that one.  That's hard.  Well see until some time if you spend enough time on it, you can do it there.  Sometime it might appear that you're a little bit strange.  But I think most people really when they find out there's something that they can do a little better than the others, they like that the best.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you have a favorite teacher at Douglas Park?
Speaker 2: Not really.  They would--I was skipped quite--it was a small school.  It didn't have but four rooms but we had what we had called first high and first low.  So when I got to--which meant I was in the first grade just half a year and then I went to the second grade around by the--see, really then if a person could read that was the main focus there.  You sometimes would be moved along according to your reading ability there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So if I was in first low, that meant I was learning how to read, right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah you had just started school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: The first high you would know how to read some I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah some could and some you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you didn't have a favorite teacher but were you a favorite of the teachers?  Your teachers--?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  No, I don't--
Speaker 1: You weren't the teachers' pet?
Speaker 2: Um-um, I don't--no.  At times my behavior wasn't no better than any of the others.
Speaker 1: So what kind of things would you do to get in trouble?
Speaker 2: I--talking.  Whenever I would finish--and those of us who had finished an assignment, we did not have--we weren't--earned--well we had nothing to do so sometimes we would--the teacher would fuss around--and then she would tell you, okay now I don't want to have to speak to you again.  And then if she had to speak to you again, come up and you had to hold your hand out and let her hit it (unclear) strap.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you all have a radio growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 20710
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your family keep up with you know world events and the news and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the favorite program was on Sunday, Jack Benny [born Benjamin Kubelsky, American comedian, actor, radio personality].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know--well see when you were coming up I think there was television around competing with that.
Speaker 1: The Jack Benny Show was your favorite, why--?
Speaker 2: That was I think--well I don't know whether if you had more than one station.  I don't know whatever the adults listened to.  See, it's not like it is now when everybody has their own equipment.
Speaker 1: Yeah it has come to that hasn't it?  Everybody seems to have, you know they watch whatever they want.
Speaker 2: That's right, everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, now did you go to a middle school or was it--?
Speaker 2: No, I, when I left there I went--I guess, I don't know whether Dunbar had the lower grades or not.  Then I went to Paul Laurence Dunbar.
Speaker 1: And Dunbar was a, was that a middle school or a junior high school?
Speaker 2: No, see Douglas Park just had four rooms.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: And so when you left there--
Speaker 1: So you were, when you left--
Speaker 2: When you got to about the fourth or fifth grade you went to Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Oh I see.
Speaker 2: So I went to a school called Laura Titus [Laura E. Titus Elementary School, Norfolk, Virginia] and--
Speaker 1: So you went--when you left Douglas Park you went to Paul Laurence Dunbar?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any favorite teachers there?
Speaker 2: Now there was a lady named Davidson, she was a very interesting person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How so?
Speaker 2: Well the thing about it, she could tell us stories when she went into the store what the man said to her and things of that.  And then she introduced people to us that we had never heard of, Mark Twain and things of that sort and everything.  And I don't--well sometime when you have a person who is interested in those things themselves, it seems to make you more interested in it whereas some people they might mention the same thing and all, but see she had actually read those stories and different things of that sort and know things to look for.  And she would tell us, when you get to that part where that word is and you see dam, just read over that quickly.  She would say those things to us so that would give us a clue to be looking.  We'd be looking for those things and all.  Some teachers are more interested than others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now what was life like in town?  Did you, I mean did you--on your side of town it was all black, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Pretty much.  Okay.  Now did you have occasion to go downtown with your parents or anything?
Speaker 2: Well yes.  Well now when you go downtown the--we call the exclusive ones where some other people might have relatives working in those stores not as clerks you know but cleaning the store and things of that sort.  But now we were--there was--we--the stores that we used mostly were, that black folks used was the Sears & Roebuck and a Urshaw's (ph.), that was owned by a local white man and I don't know whether Penny's [JC Penny's] had come up then or not, later on.  But see we could not try on clothes or anything like that.  If you see a hat you like in those stores, so a lot of times we didn't actually go to the downtown where the people were dressed up shopping because you don't want to get a pretty hat and bring it home and find it doesn't fit right, it comes down to your eyes and things.  So a lot of the merchants, we used stores like Urshaw's and things of that sort which were not located in really downtownish looking section.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 20711
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now in high school you went to Booker T. Washington, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: I really went to--I spent a half a year there in junior high.  Dunbar had the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And most people, seventh grade was considered junior high and some of the other schools that didn't go any further than sixth they would start a first grade at some school in the city and go six years and then seventh they go to junior, seventh and eighth out there.  But then they had--that was a very crowded one, the junior high school at Booker T. Washington, that side because well they came from all the different school, and you hadn't had the drop out--people don't--didn't seldom drop out of school in the seventh and eighth grade age wise.  So they had a test that they would give you when you got to the eighth low so--if an--then depending upon how many they needed to get rid--to go on to what we call the high school side, that was ninth grade.  They would often--or they would take I believe, I don't know sometime it would be 30, the one who scored the 30 high score or sometime it would more depending upon how much space was needed on the junior high.  So then they had junior high and high school in the same building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at Booker T. Washington, now did you go--so you finished seventh grade at Dunbar and then went to Booker T.--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --in eighth grade?  Okay.  So what was that like?  Now that's the--that was the biggest black high school in Norfolk, right?
Speaker 2: That was the only black high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And--
Speaker 2: See, that was another reason people knew each other because--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was the principal?
Speaker 2: Winston Douglas was his name.
Speaker 1: Winston Douglas, okay.  And do you remember what his background was?
Speaker 2: Well now I don't know where he grew up.  He had a brother that was a lawyer up in New Jersey but I don't know where Winston Douglas grew up.  But he came there from St. Paul [St. Paul's College].
Speaker 1: From St. Paul, Minnesota?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Oh, St. Paul College.
Speaker 2: --college, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Here in Virginia.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: The Episcopal college, St. Paul?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was there.
Speaker 1: All right, now I understand.
Speaker 2: He was a football coach there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: Well I liked math when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now was it unusual for a girl to like math in those days?
Speaker 2: Well I was the best math student though there around so I don't--yes it was because now I stop and think there when--then when World War II started coming on they had courses like pre-flight mathematics and all the--some of the fellows were going to some of those schools and all.  And most of those classes I was the only female there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah cause I think that the school system kind of pitches math to boys and they don't really encourage girls.
Speaker 2: I don't know though.  The lady who taught it, Serelda James was a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She taught it.  I was trying to see now--yeah but most of the math teachers, Johnson was a man and--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Ms. James' name?  Serelda?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, S-E-R-E-L-D-A.
Speaker 1: Oaky.  She was the math teacher in Booker T. Washington then?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her sister Julia taught French.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the father delivered, the doc--was the one who delivered me when I was a baby.
Speaker 1: Okay, so her father was a doctor?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20712
Speaker 1: So Serelda James was your math instructor in school and did you like the other courses too?  Now your favorite was math.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you take any foreign languages or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I took Spanish in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what was your social life like in high school?  Did you all have parties and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --were you very social or were you, you know bookworm or what?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Well I was--yeah I was, in high school we had a nice social life and we had social clubs in high school and things of that sort.  And having an older brother in high school too also was an avenue because if you go to, going to a party, well we walked to--we could walk to the places where we were going.  But see I had somebody to walk along with and all that type of thing (unclear).  And so you find that too, until I, cause I noticed a difference.  Once my brother went--he finished a half a year of high school, a half a year ahead of me.  He finished in January.  I didn't graduate till June of the same year, 1945.  And he was seventeen, but he didn't turn eighteen until later.  And the Army had something called the ASTP, Army Specialized Training Program where they would take the seventeen year olders and send them to Howard [Howard University] and Rutgers [Rutgers University], some went to Howard, some went to Rutgers I guess, and then they got that training.  So when my brother was in that program and so then when I didn't have him to go around with there it made, it certainly made a lot of difference in traveling.  If you're coming home after dark back there, they always think it's good to have a male presence coming around rather than a bunch of young girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you all have a prom and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had all those type of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what clubs were you a member of in high school?
Speaker 2: It was a group called the Iotas.  There were two groups.  There was one called the Taus and one called the Iotas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you all do, like plan--what kind of things did you do?
Speaker 2: Let's see, what did they do beside meet?  Let's see, we did--yeah they would sometime plan affairs and all and you had to pay--first we started out everything was a dime.  But when people started--when that war started to coming on and people had them jobs working in the Navy yard and all like that, then you had to pay a quarter for to go to those things.  And they would--we'd plan activities and you have a band and all, you get enough quarters left and you can--for to have a band come play there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of music was poplar?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I really, I cannot think of what the music was called.  I was trying to think of some of the people who--people like--the kind of music that was put out by--of course they weren't present at any of our events, like, people like Etta Fitzgerald [Ella Jane Fitzgerald, American jazz and song vocalist, "Queen of Jazz"] and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is like big band music, sort of--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --swing music?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And the kind of stuff Ella Fitzgerald liked.
Story_ID: 20713
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you were valedictorian of the class right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And well how did you feel when you were graduating?  And did you know where you were going to college when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well anyway it was all settled there.  Well I had that one Pepsi Cola competitive thing when they gave that for the state.  They gave, the Pepsi Cola company would give two tuition paid scholarships, plus $25.00 a month to each state.  If the state had two systems they give one to the white system and one to the black system and all.  So in Virginia I had won--Howard University had more Pepsi Cola scholars than any other school in the country, but--where I went.  But now see, Howard University gave a competitive scholarship and all but it was supposed--designed for tuition.  So I wrote a letter to them and told them that I received a Pepsi Cola scholarship paying the tuition.  Could you put the tuition money on my room and board?  And they said--they wrote me a letter and said they didn't see why that couldn't be done there.  So I went to--so it was decided then that I was going to go to Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're saying you had like two scholarships to Howard--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see--
Speaker 1: --basically one for tuition and one--then you used the Pepsi one for room and board?
Speaker 2: No, the Pepsi one I couldn't--that was a tuition thing plus $25.00 a month.  They paid your full tuition plus--and as long as the school was satisfied with you, they were satisfied.  Then the Howard University scholarship was supposed to have been a tuition--the test said they were giving for tuition, but I--for the state.  But I came out the highest there.  See, I would be taking these tests but it would be maybe a month or six weeks after the test was given before I find out how you come out.  And so then that's when I asked them so then I decided on Howard because they said I could use that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have a--now why did you choose Howard?  Was your--?
Speaker 2: Because it didn't cost anything for me to go there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But I just wondered you know you could have chose Hampton [Hampton University] or Norfolk State [Norfolk State University] or some other (unclear).
Speaker 2: But I mean the thing is still I would have to pay room and board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Howard said since I had won that, but I had that covered.  They would put that on there if I came there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, well so you start at Howard in what year, 1945?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is the end of the war, big year.
Speaker 2: That's right, it ended--that's right, just before--right after I finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did, do you remember the end of the war or what the war meant to black people here in this area?  I mean how did people feel about the war?
Speaker 2: Well we had fellows from the area, in fact Booker T., former Booker T. students who were killed, Dory Miller (ph.), when the Japanese dropped the bomb in Pearl Harbor so we started right off aware of the situation.  And then work was so available because during the defense plants and things of that sort.  And see the largest base here is in this area, Building 143 on the Naval Base ground was the largest base, was the largest building I think that existed (unclear).  So they--everybody, anybody who wanted to could work as much as you want.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because of the war and all the men being in the war, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, because now the band leader, James Clark, he also works at the post office at night.  Had a band and taught a course in biology at Booker T., and so I mean a lot of people had two full time jobs and that type of thing there.  We didn't have a lot of casualties from this area but we did have some.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you were saying that a lot of the people that were at Pearl Harbor were from this area?
Speaker 2: Well no, I mean we had two people I know, Dory Miller and I can't think of the name of the other at this time.
Speaker 1: Okay, but Dory Miller was a big hero at Pearl Harbor right, who--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --came up out of the kitchen and shot down planes?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right. Okay, so you're at Howard and now the, another thing that's going on is that the--a lot of the soldiers are coming back and going to school too right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So Howard is full of these young soldiers that just came back.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And so you know it was a good time to be a female student at Howard?
Speaker 2: That's what, yeah the women fuss about there.  We had--that's right, all the time, you, very plenty, plenty men around.  It was really, really a good time to be there because you didn't have--when you're having your, when your dormitory have their house parties and all, finally somebody to invite.  Didn't matter if the first person you asked had been invited.  Well second one chance is that you would ask hadn't been and all to those type things and everybody taking women to their, the fraternity had those things.  Now there was one group there called the Alphas, they used to have those, once a year they would have those big name bands come there.  There were these great band leaders there and so most--so it really was a lot of things jumping around there.
Story_ID: 20714
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now at, okay at Howard you--now you became a member of Delta Sigma Theta, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you do that right away or did you wait a while?
Speaker 2: No I pledged my freshman year.  They invited me to pledge so I pledged.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then, but actually it was in--I wasn't made until the fall of the quarter of my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Now was it a, was pledging a sorority about the same then as it is today or you say--you see any difference?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know and everything really.  I do think now certain things don't count there.  But the fact that actually though, Howard--now that was a place, people would say it was color struck but if you had your papers in order, I was a Pepsi Cola scholar and all that type of thing, they would really ignore the fact that you weren't a high yellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was like a, it was a high yellow culture, so it was color struck you say?
Speaker 2: Well the president there was a black man but he looked like a white man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is, we're talking about Dr. Mordecai Johnson, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I mean that's what I'm saying, everybody there, understand there was a man running the house who was there before I got there, Kelly Miller [African American mathematician, sociologist, essayist, newspaper columnist and author].  But I mean if you look around at--and so at Mordecai's house, all those what we call good looking people living there, I mean they--he didn't have any--I look at it, some of his children look like they were white.  His wife though, she did, she looked (unclear) but see, she had the hair that she didn't have--didn't give her any trouble and all like that, but her skin had a little tinge of brown in it.  But she, well after all she was a black woman.
Speaker 1: Now is there any truth to this paper bag business at--in those days in school?  Did they ever subject anyone to a paper bag test for entry into--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --any kind of social event?
Speaker 2: Well I think now sometimes the fellows used to do that.  But there was, well if you go back to the origin of it around, now that's the reason the--there were some of the founders of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity were still at Howard, a teach--one of my teachers was one of the founders of it.  It was a--when they found it there was because now the first fraternity to come on there was the Alpha fraternity which was organized up at Cornell University, okay.  But now the, here the founders up at Cornell weren't all yellow fellows.  But when they came down to Howard, they were all, when they got the Beta chapter which is at Howard.  Alpha chapter of the Alpha Phi is up at Cornell.  Then they organized, Howard was the first school that they took in.  They had the--but they tell me it was all light fellows and that is why some of the teachers there who were founders of it along with the, and they became members of Omega Psi Phi was because of that type of thing.  And they didn't--and then too Clark was (unclear), he was at Howard, the band leader which he--they did actually go by there--uh-uh.  What--I mean ya'll, if you had that--I mean they could be very insulting.  Who brought the coal in and all that kind of stuff.  I mean that's what the, you know the people tell me who were actually there and all.
Speaker 1: So they were kind of reflecting the same kind of racism that white society had on black people in general on the campus that's supposed to be--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --all African American.  So--
Speaker 2: That's true.  I mean I really didn't think--and then too I noticed though in, even in the Deltas for a girl, look like she was white she was welcome, very welcome.  I mean some of them I mean pledging but weren't able to stay there long enough to be made.  They didn't care.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know why that meant a lot.  But then too a lot of our fellows though, those--and think if they were studying medicine, they are not supposed to date someone, no matter what complexion they were, they weren't supposed to date dark girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could--
Speaker 1: Now were--now we, I've heard this before but I've heard a lot of people deny it too.  So when you were at Howard was there a difference between the Deltas and the AKAs in terms of the color of the members?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean you would find some very fair ones in both of them.  You would really find some there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think though both--if you had foreign locks and look like white, you could join, you--it was up to you to join whatever pressure people at your home had told you to go, it was no problem.  I don't know--
Speaker 1: But if you were--
Speaker 2: Now you were there, they didn't--was no color problem.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: You weren't to Howard didn't you?
Speaker 1: No I didn't.
Speaker 2: Oh you went to West Virginia, that's right you went to West Virginia.
Speaker 1: No, I actually went to Wright State in Dayton.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Dayton, Ohio later, you know, but yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it, yeah I mean the thing is during (unclear) white is right.  That's the way they was doing in my time around just like I told you with my mother.  Her mamma told her, said Lillian, your hair is not hard to comb and I don't care who your daddy is, you don't have to take anything.  And see, now my mother never told me that, but my grandmother used to say, yeah I told Lillian, you know that she didn't have to do that and all that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I appreciate you telling us I mean that's the history of it.  That's, you know--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And then--
Speaker 1: That's the way it used to be.
Speaker 2: --the brothers, cause they--my mother did not ever forgive her stepfather though because she lived that--she felt like he should have--when he married her mother he should have adopted her.  And her name should have been Smith rather than Vaughn.
Story_ID: 20715
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said your grandmother never discussed who the father of your mother was?  She never--
Speaker 2: Well my mother might have known too, probably somebody in the family that they used to work around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I remember when my brother Walter had a hard time finding, hadn't found a job during the summer he was home, she would--having a full grown person there and they're not working, I mean he was home from college and all.  He went to North Carolina, he was a basketball player.  And so she said, so anyway she said come here, take this note, it was a mattress factory there.  Had him take this note down there and she addressed it to somebody, signed it Lillian Vaughn Green and he took that note there, he did not work, and gave it to somebody and they hired him on the spot.  So she might have known stuff that she didn't want to discuss with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know my history on that side.
Story_ID: 20716
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting.  So, well just moving forward here, now when you got to Howard, you had like a couple of really good math professors while you were there.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And one was a--
Speaker 2: Blackwell, Cox.
Speaker 1: David [Harold] Blackwell and Elbert [Frank] Cox.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now Dr. Elbert Cox, was he the first black Ph.D. in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That's right, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: He went--I--Cornell.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So he's--here's the nation's first black Ph.D. in math.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And then there's David Blackwell.  Was he a Ph.D., as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He did a lot of work in statistics too.  Now I don't whether statistics, is statistics seen up in his field.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now how did they influence you?
Speaker 2: Well when you see people, especially like black folk, who are well thought of nationally and things of that sort but they were friendly you know and all.  They--we hung around them.  And we saw the, how interesting--when you see people interested in a field themselves, they're doing things and they encourage you if you're trying to do things, I think that has a lot of influence on a young person and you can see that this thing is interesting.  You see a lot of times people say that if people have a mathematical ability, but I don't know any mathematician who has spent a lot of time on that and it's because often you will, might encounter things that are not particularly clear to you.  But if you--but you want to make it clear and you spend the time rather than say I don't understand that.  But see the other person will say that but reason some people we say can't do mathematics cause they're not willing to give it the--put the time in.  I mean that is the thing.  And I think it's a matter of time and if you like that type of reasoning.  In the newspaper now they have this puzzle, the Sudoku puzzle that gets harder and harder each day. Now I mean you sit down and figure one and you don't want that to beat you.  But some people they may act like it's below them or something and I think that's the reason some people can't do math cause they won't do math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you think that rather than being a fact that they don't have the aptitude or, the aptitude more has to do with the will to persevere through the problem?
Speaker 2: Well here's the thing about it though, see, you got to be a person who want to not let the thing beat it when you get a hard one, and willing to put the time in.  But see some people are not that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you start at Howard, did you consider yourself a mathematics major at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And were there many women involved in math at Howard too?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of you know (unclear), um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't unusual for a woman to be a mathematician at Howard?
Speaker 2: Um-um.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I mean that was one day I didn't find out till very, very late that Dr. Haynes who taught at Howard, we had a mixed faculty there.  I didn't find out, we always said Marjorie--my age getting me--down at, lady down at Durham was the first black woman.  And I was taught by a lady at Howard.  Then later on a fellow down in North--teaching (unclear) told me, you were taught by the first black woman but we didn't know she was black, Dr. Haynes.  I don't know what her first name was.
Speaker 1: At Howard, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I--we didn't know she was--I didn't know she was--I guess maybe the other teachers there knew she was black.  She was a Washington lady, a Catholic lady.  She had a Ph.D. from a Catholic University.  I knew Dr. Haynes had a Ph.--but we didn't know she was a black woman.  She never told us she was black.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay.
Speaker 2: But of course some people who look that way, you could tell they were black by the company they kept.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But there were some I guess it was just impossible to tell by looking at them, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  You see if someone you saw in a class, you just couldn't tell.  See I was there during, I mean that was a strong thing in judging people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mary Church Terrell.
Story_ID: 20717
Speaker 1: Mary Church Terrell, was she there when you were?
Speaker 2: No, but she was very prominent in Washington in having these marches and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Right.  So did you participate in any of the political activities in D.C. when you were at Howard?
Speaker 2: Um-um, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But we knew who, you know we would hear about the people.
Speaker 1: Did she speak on campus when you'd have--you would have like convocation right, at Howard?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh when you--but she has come to the dormitory and spoken to groups and all.  We had a lot of prominent women.
Speaker 1: Who else came besides Mary Church Terrell?
Speaker 2: You ever heard of Nannie Helen Burroughs [African American educator, orator, religious leader and business woman]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nannie Burroughs, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They were all contemporaries.
Speaker 1: Did you ever heard of Ms. Bethune?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact I have a, I still have a pyramid book and they have, at the time after Howard's chapter of Deltas was organized when I was there, in the book they had the then honorary Deltas.  And Mary Church Terrell, Mary Bethune [Mary Jane McLeod Bethune, American educator and civil rights activist] and Nannie Burroughs, all three of those names are there.
Speaker 1: Was Anna Julia Cooper [Anna Julia Haywood Cooper, author, educator and speaker] still around then?
Speaker 2: Let me see now, I--she wasn't an honorary Delta.  I don't know whether she was a contemporary of those people or not (unclear).
Speaker 1: I think--she may have been.  She may have passed before then, I don't know.  I mean I know she was around the first part of the century but I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Nannie Burroughs, she didn't die till 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now let's see.  Anybody else that--I mean did Dr. DuBois [William Edward Burghardt, "W.E.B." DuBois] come to speak on campus or--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember hearing him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--I think he had gone to Africa.  He was still over here though (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah so this is '45 [1945] to '49 [1949]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --I think that's right, when you were there, right?  Okay.  And well did anything big happen at Howard when you were there that you remember that you could--or is there a good story about some incident?
Speaker 2: Not really there.  There were good speakers there when I was there.  Langston Hughes, oh he was a good poet.  He used to come on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the biggest thing that--now let me see.  I was trying to think I mean, was it Bunche [Ralph Johnson Bunche], when he died, you saw all the big shots.
Speaker 1: Oh, Ralph Bunche, right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Dr. Ralph Bunche, right.  Did--was Dr. Charles Drew [Charles Richard Drew, American physician, surgeon, medical researcher] still there?  Was--?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's when he--he died while I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That might have been Drew's thing when you saw all those people.
Speaker 1: But did you have any--besides your math professors, were there any other favorite teachers at Howard that you remember?
Speaker 2: Okay.  There was a Dr. Eagleson [Halson V. Eagleson] (unclear) in physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lawrence Rob--Dr. Robinson [Lawrence B. Robinson].  Robinson was a graduate of Virginia Union [University] for his undergrad work.  I don't know where he did his grad work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20718
Speaker 1: So we were just talking about, I was asking you off camera about Howard Thurman and you said you knew about him but you didn't really go to--
Speaker 2: I wasn't a regular attendant of chapel there, no, um-um.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No the big day at chapel there, in fact I didn't go there on those days.  When the president, and Mordecai Johnson was over there but you had to get there early to get a seat they tell me.
Speaker 1: Now what was your impression of Dr. Mordecai Johnson?
Speaker 2: Well I found him to be a very impressive man and all that and he would speak his mind.  Now there was a physical-Ed lady who--Maryrose Allen, and her husband taught in the medical school.  And so anyway the man thought that Mordecai had eyes for his wife, Maryrose Allen and all that kind of stuff.  And so he tried to say something but Mordecai Johnson, they tell me that publicly he made the statement, listen I don't want--don't you dare say anything like that to me and if I hear of you saying anything--the man of course, you know she and Mordecai got along nicely together.  But he says don't ask me any quest--anything.  If I hear of you saying it to anybody else, if I hear it, I'm gonna fire both of you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean he was such a strong mind, forceful person, I mean.  He was the president of the university and he would--had the university at heart and he would run it for what was best for the university is whatever he said.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he wasn't going to answer any questions from nobody about any kind of relationship.  What he say, here, I'm a man that's not far from sixty years old and you (unclear) [laughter].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he handled everything real quick and to--with a dispatch you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: We all liked--everybody liked him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20719
Speaker 1: Now okay so when you were getting towards the end at Howard, what did you--did you plan to teach math or--?
Speaker 2: Well actually no.  Well I stayed, they asked me to--they gave me a fellowship to stay there and get a Masters.  So since I, you know when things are given to you, you stay there.  So I stayed there another year and in 1950 I got a Masters.  And then I, I had taken education courses when I was an undergrad so I did teach in high school for a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: No, in Norfolk.
Speaker 1: In Norfolk, so you came back after 19--?
Speaker 2: At Booker T., um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --50, 50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '50, [1950], fall of '50, [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay, came back okay, and taught.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, well explain, kind of tell us like what was the, I guess what aspect of math you were really focused on and why?
Speaker 2: Well actually I was in what is known as algebraic structures.  Now I--well I guess now I've taken courses in different areas and I seemed to get be best in that field too.  And there was one field which was (unclear) field called topology.  But now I found the concepts varied such that I never really got the feel that you should have if you're going into that area of that.  So I was doing that.  And now, and also it wasn't a field that it was a touch down.  It's not hard but, to understand but it seemed to be just number crunching almost when you get it, until you get above it was statistics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's what threw that off.  So that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, okay but did you see yourself then as a teacher of these things or did you see yourself in a research situation?
Speaker 2: Well the thing is, at the time when I went back, see I worked for several years before I went back to school and I think in edu--choose a field--well actually now I did work for the government.  Well when I worked for the government it was for just a short while.  It was in 1950 right after the census was taken.  I worked at the census bureau.  But actually it was just routine work that I was doing.  And I think I actually--the government pay I understand would have been better if I had stayed with it.  But actually working on a government job, sitting at a desk crunching numbers and marking marks seemed like to me would be a boring--seemed rather boring.  You meet interesting people there and during lunch hour you have interesting lunches, but the eight hour part on a government job, you find yourself looking--after about, after 3 o'clock, you're looking at your watch every, every few minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's nothing wrong, nobody's mistreating you or anything.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's the kind of job--so you were working for the census and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it was just routine more.
Speaker 1: --you're just counting, it's routine count--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --adding figures and counting and double checking figures.
Speaker 2: Counting and all see, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you were doing, were you doing any statistical work you know as well with the census bureau?
Speaker 2: Well some of, we were yeah marking off and--marking off how many forms and this and that type thing.  Then I got sent to the--in Suitland, Maryland where the--what it is a group of us would pass, those of us who had on our transcripts, Spanish.  So I went over there, they didn't have--they had a lot of people from Puerto Rico in that section and a group in there and I was mostly correcting the census, some of them that had been done wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For example, we would look around in there, in a household, two legally married people and three children, they're all the same--they, they're the legal children of a black man and the mother's white and the children would be listed as white.  But we would change that and put down, put a N there, for the word Negro for black, and around, doing that type of thing.  I mean it was nothing wrong with the work it's just that it's work--what I was doing, anybody could have been trained to do that, when I say anybody I really mean anybody if they can read around.  And you really didn't have to have a deep knowledge of Spanish.  I mean you could tell them that Negro is the word for black, Blanco is for white and if there, if either one of them is Negro, put all the children Negro.  And then you count the number that they, you know the numbers and put them in the property category.  They had categories that you do there.
Story_ID: 20720
Speaker 1: Now did you know William S. Claytor, I mean William W. Claytor [William Waldron Schifrin Claytor, African-American mathematician and educator]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Bill Claytor they called him.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, at Howard?  Was he at Howard?
Speaker 2: He was a topologist as they call--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was he very influential with--?
Speaker 2: Now he was very down to earth.  His father was a dentist there in Washington there, very handsome man.  And sometimes he would get off at--sometime he would get off and get personal about it like, yeah everybody thought that (unclear) was--Bill Claytor was a--married a handsome woman.  Huh, I married a woman that got some sense.  She makes more money than I do, and all like that though.  He was a very interesting very interesting person but he became an alcoholic later in life, yeah.  But he was a very down to earth, pleasant guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a--he taught at West Virginia State I mean too.
Speaker 2: Oh he did?
Speaker 1: He taught Catherine Johnson, a woman we interviewed yesterday who was a mathematician with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: He was one of her teachers.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh that's where he came from, West Virginia when he came here?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a graduate of Howard undergrad work.  He did his un--grad work at Michigan [University of Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What about Jeremiah [Chappelle] Certaine?
Speaker 2: Certaine, uh-huh.  Yeah, well he directed my Masters thesis.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Here from Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: What was the title of your thesis?
Speaker 2: Okay, I--what was the title there?  I got to stop and think.
Speaker 1: That's okay if you don't remember it but what was it about?
Speaker 2: It was in abstract algebra though.  It was--oh, rings with minimum conditions, that's what it was with minimum conditions, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jeremiah Certaine.  Now did she--had he taught the Johnson lady?
Speaker 1: No, he didn't not as far as I know he didn't, just Claytor.  You both had him in common and--yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean I was thinking about Certaine, Jeremiah.
Speaker 1: No he didn't teach her.  He didn't teach her, no just Claytor.  So anyway so working for the government wasn't very exciting huh?  You didn't--?
Speaker 2: Well I understand it can be but I was never given any--never turned me on.  So, and Mr. Douglas told my father he needed somebody so then I come to and then that way--
Speaker 1: So you came back to Hampton?
Speaker 2: No I came to--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I went to Booker T.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Norfolk.
Speaker 2: And I taught there until I had my--then I got married and had--and when I had my first child--
Story_ID: 20721
Speaker 1: Now you married Edward Dawley, Jr.--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and he was a lawyer right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He finished Lincoln University undergrad and did his law work out of University of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now had he come out of law school when you all got married?
Speaker 2: Well we got married his senior year in law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So did you meet him in Norfolk?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  His father worked at the post office too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now in--so you get married and you begin to have children right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And now he was involved with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  And did that draw you into the civil rights movement too?
Speaker 2: Well (unclear) there.  I mean I had nothing against it.  But now remember I was--okay, but maybe with CORE, I started working at Hampton, then I taught--then he had me down there and he volunteered me for the schools to tutor those children, (unclear) and there and the math (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, now well let's slow down, now.
Story_ID: 20722
Speaker 1: Let's not go too fast.  Now you had started, once you had your children you started teaching in Hampton right?
Speaker 2: That's right in my second--
Speaker 1: And then your husband was involved in the Norfolk 17 case then you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: In 1957.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually Thurgood Marshall was the man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was like well working with--he was locally working with--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he and Joe Jordan.
Speaker 1: Okay, Joseph Jordan, okay.  And all right, the Norfolk 17 were 17 students that were chosen to integrate public schools here, right--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --in Virginia.  And can you give us some background about that and how--you know can you just tell us from your point, in your own words what that was about?
Speaker 2: Well the 17?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Norfolk 17?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well what it is too, now Andrew, I have a book of his right over there and Andrew--
Speaker 1: That's Andrew Heidelberg, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but a lots of them had applied for to go to the school, about 300.  But he said now if you notice though how he picked, how they picked them.  All right, now his name was Heidelberg and then how different ones had different things.  Then, okay Gonzalez was another one that was picked for the fellows.  They didn't pick anybody named Jones, but they had a lot of them, but some Joneses had applied and all, just wanted to see who had the temperament there.  So when you show up and of course Patricia Turner, her name was an ordinary one.  But then there was another Pat there, Godbolt, was one of them.  But now if you're gonna take 17 students you wouldn't have had that number with these names.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what you're saying--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --is that the school board, the school authorities were trying to not select the 300 black students that had applied but they made some mistakes because the names didn't matter?
Speaker 2: No they didn't make any--no, uh-huh they didn't make any names but he was thought that there wouldn't be so bad seeing those were the ones eligible to go to the school.  People can maybe understand why a Godbolt is eligible to go to the school.  They may think of her as being mixed with something else--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --beside two black parents.  Or maybe Heidelberg, he might be mixed with something besides two black parents.  That's what, that is the you know impression that he was speaking--the school board might would say--see they couldn't just say there wasn't a single black person in the city that could pass, that could do the work white people--an ordinary white person in a public school would do, just an ordinary one so they wanted, so they you now tried to find some around and all.  So-but now however in doing that now I was a very busy person.  I had two small children, three young children at that time and boys and I had a full time job working at Hampton and I taught two courses at night at Norfolk State [Norfolk State University].  It was the division of--then around.  So I didn't have time.  My time was all accounted for, for to do much with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you were asked--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Your husband asked you to try to help tutor the--some of the students that were going to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well what it is, they didn't have anybody in math so he told them that I--they didn't--since I had to go by Furr (ph.) to get to Hampton, they arranged my classes to be Tuesdays, Thursday and Saturday.  I spent a full day there but they did not give me classes on three days so I just went to them three days.  And so he asked me you know he told me that he told them that I was available and all.  So I, you know I went along there and everything and doing that.  And so I guess in, yeah as a CORE, as a member of the, yeah the CORE, anything that they said do you tend to go along with it back there and all but I was pretty busy there.  So he worked with them and that was an interesting article appeared in the paper.  He was a republican at that time.  Most people were democrats so they had the republican convention up in our--I sent a clipping to my son up there in Delaware.  When they were having their convention, he applied at the hotel in Richmond where they, where the convention was headquartered and when he got there they said--they apologized and said all the rooms, whatever they said.  But he said but I came here to the convention.  The convention's in the morning.  I can't drive back to Norfolk and get back here till the morning there.  And then they said well that's the best they do.  So the article in the paper said he started undressing there to prepare--there was a couch in the lounge for there.  He said well I guess I'll lie down there over here.  He took his shirt off and had his you know undershirt sleeves there and then they found a room for him.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay.
Speaker 2: In the hotel in Richmond, segregated one but the newspaper wrote that up around.
Speaker 1: So this was a time period when a lot of the segregation was being challenged and a lot of the barriers were falling down?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah he didn't challenge it or anything.  He said, I mean he had his things where they had taken it so he had nowhere else to stay.  He said he didn't have any relatives in Richmond and he was going--the sofa out there would be do for--will have to do for that night.  Maybe somebody would leave in the morning and he could go up there and wash off.
Story_ID: 20723
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and I have a note that Rosa Parks moved here in '57 [1957] right after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh in Hampton?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was working there.  Moran (ph.) was the president of Hampton at that time and he was in--she was working in Chicago, one of them cities and then they sent for her, they asked her to come work there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's right after the Montgomery Bus Boycott?
Speaker 2: Not right afterwards but she would--had taken a job and I think it was Chicago.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but it was about, it was within a year afterwards.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So he invited her there.
Speaker 1: Did you know her?  Did you meet her?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Did you meet her?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, she was in charge--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean did you have any, did you have a--did you become friends with her or did you just (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.  Well I knew her and I think she might have known me.  But see, sometimes I mean people like Rosa Parks, when they come on a--everybody knows them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you ask them, you know what I'm saying?  And then if, when you're talking to her around that--about that--most of us will tell her our names, I'm Eleanor Jones, you know.  I'm so glad to see.  Oh yes, so and so, and see she'd be talking to you so she may refer to my name.  And so you get the idea but I guess that was the way with everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But people who were really active like Rosa Parks and all, every--all of us knew them.
Story_ID: 20724
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now it says on our outline that you became the vice chair of CORE but I asked you earlier about it and you said you don't remember that, right?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I didn't do any duties or anything there.  I didn't have (unclear), um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So your name might have been the vice chair but you really weren't functioning as a--as the chair?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh, no decision making or attending all the meetings.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, okay.  So basically your involvement was around tutoring the students--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --from the, of the Norfolk 17?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  Now did you participate in any of the civil rights demonstrations or anything up here in the area during that time?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Went around--well, I'm trying to think.  There was some time when people would come there.  I tell you what we did do it was when we took some poor people in the house.  Used to have those marches, what were they?  Was that CORE?  Martin Luther King had those poor people.
Speaker 1: Oh the Poor Peoples' Campaign?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know when they come up here around there so we had some poor people in the house.
Speaker 1: That was like in '67 [1967] I think, yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: When he was doing that, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah that was a long time afterwards, the poor people there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Cause I was married to Everett Jones when the poor people came.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 20725
Speaker 1: So at some point then you and the attorney broke up, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Was it just--?
Speaker 2: Well what it was, when he was in high school, he and Emma Wicks were sweethearts.  But he--and so when they graduated, she went to Hampton, he went to Lincoln.  And while he was in Lincoln, he got called into the Navy and during that time while she was in the navy, she married a fellow at Hampton (unclear) and all.  But she would come back to, sometimes her mother and all her relatives lived here.  I was at a summer institute one time when she was back here and I don't know exactly cause he never gave me any details about how they got back together.  He never gave me any details before we left when I would ask him about it.  In fact he resent talking about it, that's nothing to talk about around children, he felt.  (Unclear) I guess he felt it was none of my business so I really don't know exactly.  He and Emma got back together so they went out to California together.  He left me and the children and he went out there and we were divorced and she divorced her husband out there and all and they got married.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: They're still out there is Oswego, California.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you remarried too right?  You married Mr. Jones?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remarried Mr. (Unclear) while there.  Of course see, then I went to Syracuse.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in the interim--
Speaker 2: After we broke up, I went to Syracuse and I was there for four years.
Speaker 1: Now how did you get that opportunity?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well the thing is, to get promoted there at Hampton I would have to have a Ph.D.  Or either they said--you know.  So they encouraged me to go there and they gave me half pay if I--for the first year there and then while I was there I applied for something from the National Science Foundation.  But within my last two years I was a teacher, I taught a couple of classes up there (unclear) you know to feed the children.  And of course we had state aid here see.  See, one thing with the state aid, separate but equal doctrine.
Speaker 1: Now that was still going on then?
Speaker 2: I used it.  And see if--now the thing is I was very fortunate.  If they find a--if anybody, if they would take you, if they, somebody outside of the state would take it, they would pay your tuition then and your fare there.
Speaker 1: Okay, let me just get this straight for those who are watching.  So the state of Virginia would pay your tuition to go to graduate school or some other state (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Separate but equal doctrine they called it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they did not want black students to go to graduate school at the University of Virginia?
Speaker 2: We could not go.
Speaker 1: Couldn't go, okay.  So, but--
Speaker 2: We could not go.
Speaker 1: But because they had to provide an equal opportunity for you they would pay your way to go to Syracuse?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, or any other place that would take us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20726
Speaker 1: All right.  So that's--all right so that's what--well how did you like the Syracuse University and did you have any special teachers or mentors there that guided you through your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a follow named Hemmingsen who gave me a lot of good advice there.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: H-E-M-M-I-N-G-S-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, there was a, one in Philip Church and Jim Reid, those three were my three people.  Jim Reid, my dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay, James Dolan Reid right, I see that.
Speaker 2: James Reid, yeah that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, James Reid.  Okay, and Phillip Church you said?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was E-R-I-K, it's Danish.
Speaker 1: This is Dr. Erik, you say, E-R-I-K?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, now what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Oh it's a long time.  It's (unclear) there about it--I really, I have the book there.  It was in abstract algebra though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean is there any--now I haven't interviewed very many mathematicians so I don't want to slip past something that's going to be important to a mathematician when they look at this interview cause they'll be mad at me and they'll say well he didn't ask her about--you know.  So can you tell us what you think a mathematician will want to know about your dissertation?
Speaker 2: Well I don't think--well this, when you tell them this in the field of abstract algebra--see, let me see, it's right down here if I can maybe--
Speaker 1: Well you can, well we can't (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, well I was going to say I can show you the title of it.  And it, see it's one that--it's not meaningful to persons if they're not in that field.
Speaker 1: Well I'm--okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying.  Was it--about then it's a (unclear) in dealing with--see everything there is abstract.  It's nothing concrete.  What is it going to be used for?  It's nothing there.  It's only twelve pages and I mean people in other areas give out books.  We have a lot of stuff there.
Speaker 1: So when you get a Ph.D. in mathematics, what you really do is you demonstrate you can solve a problem or is that what it's--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, usually--well see what it is too--
Speaker 1: Or that you understand the--?
Speaker 2: --well whoever decides to work with.  Now the first guy that I was with was supposed to have been in what they call common (unclear) given a chance of this and that, and all.  But anyway so when I took my qualifying exam where you examine the value of that afterwards and so he started giving me things to do.  But he immediately dropped me as a candidate.  He said that my background in there was weaker than--he thought I had more courses, I knew more about--he thought I knew more about it than I did at first when he took me.  But he said, since you read German, Tim Reid will take you on.  So he, I mean he didn't--we didn't go--we didn't stay together no six months or something you know.  He immediately saw that his field was not for me.  He said it will take you--you will have to stay here longer because you are not prepared for this.  I was not prepared is what he told me and so I went to Jim Reid and Jim Reid, a lot of things he was working in were in, he was--get it done were in German and I could read German.  I passed, at least I passed--you had to do a language requirement, French--German.  I studied German at Howard, four As each course.  And so I took the German exam and passed it that's why they said I could read German.
Story_ID: 20727
Speaker 1: All right.  Now I was trying to get you to explain the nature of your dissertation.  Now you--
Speaker 2: Well, okay.  Well I was going to say that--well it starts off in the first one saying all the groups considered (unclear) abelian.  Now what do we mean by abelian?  That's one, that's a concept that you know some operations in arithmetic are abelian.  For example, if you multiply, if--well abstractive, you say if AB is equal to BA, in other words what operations?  If you multiply 2 x 3, you get the same thing if you multiply 3 x 2, that's in abelian operation.  Addition is one.  But on the other hand, subtraction is not in abelian operation because for example, if you take, if you have $3.00 and spend $2.00, you're left with $1.00.  But on the other hand, if you have $2.00, and spend $3.00, you're in the hole.  So that's not in abelian operation.  But it so happens that the groups that I always deal with in the operations, that is involved, they are abelian which you can go both ways and get the same result when you do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's what your dissertation was about?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, dealing with abelian groups and elements and that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so when you finished your Ph.D., now were you the first black woman to get a Ph.D. in mathematics in Syracuse?
Speaker 2: Yes, so they say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So I guess we have to believe it.
Speaker 2: That's why they, yeah they put a picture in the paper saying I paved the way for those who have come after me.
Story_ID: 20728
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  Now, during those days all we knew about in terms of Syracuse were the football players like Jim Brown and Ernie Davis and those kind of people going to Syracuse.
Speaker 2: Dave Bing.
Speaker 1: Dave Bing was at Syracuse, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he played basketball though.
Speaker 1: While you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My son was his paper boy.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, good.  Yes, all right.  Yeah he's the mayor of Detroit now.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right?  Okay.  Anybody else who was there at the time that--?
Speaker 2: A football player, what was his name?  I can't think of one.  There was a football player?
Speaker 1: Floyd Little?
Speaker 2: That's exactly who it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know my football.  I don't know much math but I know foot--
Speaker 2: That's exactly, Floyd Little, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, JB and I graduated here at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you look back at that experience that was a, you consider that a good experience at Syracuse?
Speaker 2: Oh yes and, the coldest place I've ever seen.  But they say actually there's no place that gets more snow than Syracuse (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you finished your Ph.D., it was--this is in 1962 or--?
Speaker 2: No, I started in '62 [1962] and finished in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there for four years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And your children were there with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so when you finished, you came back to Hampton?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well I--well see the first year I was there they paid me half salary and of course so I, it was the understanding that I would come back to them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And when you were saying abelian, you mean abelian you mean, A-B-E-L-I-A-N, abelian, right?
Speaker 2: Correct, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 20729
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so back at Hampton, so what happened at Hampton when you got back?  Did you--did your pay increase?  Did you--were you promoted?
Speaker 2: Yes I was.  I was promoted then and I got a much--I got an increase in salary, yeah.  But Norfolk State [Norfolk State University] and Tuskegee [Tuskegee University], both of them seemed to be very interested in my services more so than Hampton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so then with the offer from Norfolk State was a very good offer, very good offer.  However, some time when you go into an apartment though with a good offer, some people seem to get the idea that they don't like the idea of a newcomer coming in there with a good offer.  But it, if the--(unclear) of it there were eleven people in there and I went in there as the highest paid person in the department.  And so--now the head of the department did not mind but it was just some of the others I mean since we were all doing the same thing.
Speaker 1: Who was the head of the department when you went over to Norfolk State?
Speaker 2: Clyde McDaniel was around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was he Ph.D. too?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were the--were you the first Ph.D. of the department?
Speaker 2: Well they had a person there with a doctorate in science education was in there.  But I was the only one there--I might not have been the first one cause they had a fellow who had been at Howard who had worked there with one but he was there just a short time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then too you see, you must remember during the times, at that time the faculty did not have white people and black people in Virginia could not go to schools to get a Ph.D. in mathematics there.  So it was a, some time it was due, just due to the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--okay.  Now did you enjoy teaching math?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any students that you are proud to have been the mentor of during your time there?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, even right--even--when I was, a short time I taught in high school I had a student, he's dead now, Charlie Yates.  He was the first black to be admitted to Virginia Tech and went--later on he went and got degrees and everything and he returned to Tech as a teacher there.  I enjoy--when you find students who are interested in your field and all you become friend--actually ya'll become friends always there.  But you find, and then at Norfolk State, then you find some people who are doing well and going off to do well.
Story_ID: 20730
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '69 [1969] you--a paper was published by you called 4 + 4 + 4--
Speaker 2: Four to X plus--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  Four to the--
Speaker 2: --X plus 4 to the Y plus 4 to the Z equal a square.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was published in the 'American Mathematical Monthly'.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  The solution um-hmm, you had to find under what circumstances that could happen.  What is the value of X, Y and Z must be--what relation they must have with each other in order for that to, sum to be a square.  By a square number like 4 square, 2 x 2, 3 x 3, yeah square.  So we want to find out the possibility.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When I solved that problem, it happens that I wasn't working.  I was on leave that time.  I was expecting, I had gotten another husband and then turned out even though I was past forty, things worked out so that I had another child.  And I wasn't working, I was waiting, when I got to be about six months I was--students knew I was taking leave.  They could see.  But I was sitting around the house then doing that.  That's when I published that while I was expecting my child.  See if you do those things for relaxation, if you enjoy math, it's not a--relaxation.  That's one thing about it, that's a subject you can enjoy a long, for a long time.  Of course most of us would rather be football players and do something that we can't enjoy as long, but our efforts are more rewarding.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this paper was really the solution to a problem basically, right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Okay.  Now can you maybe in layman's terms explain the process of solving the problem?  Is that too much to ask?
Speaker 1: Well actually now here's what I'm saying is, you're given the problem.  You just know the statement of the problem.  Now when you're going to do that, when you don't know how to solve it because all you're doing--are given is the problem.  So you start trying different things and see whether it works out or what it has to be or looking around.  But as to--then once you have done so, you show how you arrive at the problem, put down your step by step and then you could see that.  But given another problem, you might have to approach it a different way.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you're given a guide.  Now sometimes she would say given a guide to solving a problem.  Now some time I'll say we--I might give a person a guide (unclear) but you don't get a solution and then it might not work.  So (unclear) lived next door to a gentleman who could fix--your car won't start.  Well he can't tell you exactly what to do.  He might tell you, say try this.  And it might still not start.  And the same thing is with a problem, we can only tell you how to do it after we have done it, when it's a new problem there.  They publish the problem in the journal is because it's new, not a--that is a standard like say if you have something like 3X plus 1 equals 10.  There are step by step ways you would find out the value of X and you can give it.  But the problems that are published in the 'American Mathematical Monthly' are those which no standard way, I mean your final way--and everybody uses standard methods, but you have to find out what it is.
Story_ID: 20731
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about the National Association of Mathematicians.
Speaker 2: Okay, well now the National Association of Mathematicians, now I have been the, held office in the National Association of Mathematicians.
Speaker 1: You were, yeah you were the state representative--
Speaker 2: Virginia.
Speaker 1: --for Virginia, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Now well the National Association of Mathematicians, it started with people who were employed at institutions, minority institutions.
Speaker 1: In black colleges?
Speaker 2: Yeah, black colleges um-hmm, right.
Speaker 1: Or in high schools too or just colleges?
Speaker 2: Well it's open to anybody who wants to pay what was it, $35, $30, whatever the fee is.  You don't even have to be necessarily a mathematician.  I mean anybody who went to join, there's no standards except paying your dues.  But it's--we start there and we would held--hold a meeting when the American Mathematical Society have their meetings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cause usually they were three or four day affairs and all and we would--yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is a black caucus of that meeting or so?
Speaker 2: Well not really because see now some of the schools which--where the student body is black will have white teachers and they would join too and bring them.  And some of them have been very beautiful and brought a lot of--and very valuable to it.  And then you have some people like, oh I can't think of this young fellow's name.  All of us knew him and liked him there.  But in an early age he got a Ph.D. when he was about fifteen, twelve.
Speaker 1: Was this Frank James or--
Speaker 2: Not Frank.
Speaker 1: --Theodore Sykes?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was it Theodore Sykes or Frank James?
Speaker 2: No, (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, cause they gave us a list of different people that have been president and--but I'm not sure.  Well--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but anyway, we can deal with several of them.  Then a lot of us who now you think down at Morehead--Morehouse rather, I said Morehead--Morehouse, they, all of their professors belonged there, the women, the whites and the blacks, etc., there and every--then actually we, at Norfolk State we started to getting black professors.  I mean white professors there and all that type of thing.  And so they usually, most of them would be in there and we discussed the problems and the different things like that.  It was particularly useful in getting scholarships for good students to go to the majority institutions cause usually any student that we would recommend, they would--and if the student didn't have funds of their own, you get to meet the people who can find funds for them to get there and all.  And that's still in existence that association.
Speaker 1: In National Association of Mathematicians?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it dates back to 1969, I read?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Story_ID: 20732
Speaker 1: So you became the state, you were the state representative for it and it says here in '76 [1976] also you were the co-director of the National Science Foundation Women in Science Career Workshop Grant.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now what was that about?
Speaker 2: All right.  Now schools, now sometimes schools are interested in building up departments and getting students.  Now I found a very useful way was to bring students from high school on your campus and show them some of the things.  And I tried to get some of the students to want to come there.  But now to have those--what I did, the first person, woman to get a Ph.D. in mathematics was by the name of Sonia Kovalevsky [Kovalevskaya], where--she was in Russia.  But right now, so we could--so the people who would grant the money for you to have a Sonia Kovalevsky day would--dealt with other institutions.  So now that was one reason too we find that you get to meet them and if you were on committees with them and they respect you and you apply for money, they give you money.  Well that helps you at your school when you have finance, you bring 300 people on from the buses, from the--on the campus and you're able to feed them and have the bus pick them up but you have gotten the money--but they have given you enough what we call a grant.  Now while I was at Norfolk State, I had six of them right, from--they hadn't had anyone--see, now that's something too they don't notice.  People who are active in the field will do things that the others don't do.  It's more to it than just teaching your classes.  I would write for the grants, I would get the money.  I never had anyone saying we don't have money for you.  And they gave me (unclear).  So we have them, they come up on the campus.  And then some of them, I'm not going to say they were the brightest one necessarily, but some of the students you--they all women, would decide to come to the school and all.  And then you get some of them and talk to them, some of the others who live nearby maybe in the (unclear) section of Norfolk or something like that could commute there and they think they could be quite happy there.  So we start to getting students from other schools and all that can go there.  They were very useful tool for recruiting.  We say we want to gain their interest in mathematics, but really it's aimed at recruiting.  And I think the school at which we worked, they reward you even though the student may not come in your field.  But if you bring in a lot of students from a certain high school and they go, they come to the school and pay their fees, I don't think it, I think they still will credit you with being a good person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were also, now you served on the committee for improving mathematics remediation efforts in college of the, Committee of the Mathematics Association of America.  You were a member of the Mathematics Association of America as well?
Speaker 2: Board of Governors.
Speaker 1: Board of Governors.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Virginia--I represented the State of Virginia there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They picked them.
Speaker 1: So did--now did you get--when did you get involved in the Association for Women in Mathematics?
Speaker 2: Right after I got my Ph.D. there and during there, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is that an offshoot of the American Mathematical Society or is it--?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  It's not really but what it is, you belong to all of those.  Now the American Mathematical Society, remember in grad school the departments sponsored all of us in the society, paid our dues for us and we invited them to join.  But I think it's very important that you belong to them.  You can serve your school better if you have contacts outside of your school.  Now, like now if a state did not have, do graduate work in mathematics, but if you got contacts there you can use sometime and you really have a good, have a student that won't embarrass you, you can get funds for them to attend there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '91 [1991] you wrote an article called 'A Minority Woman's Viewpoint and Winning Women into Mathematics,' published by the Mathematics Association of America, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what was the gist of that basically?
Speaker 2: Well I talk--one reason why they--now see, I was just trying to see what the focus of that article really was.  Well I said on why people go into mathematics and all.  But I mention the fact that too, most of the students that I got though were male and then of course I mentioned that, the fellow Charlie Yates, which I said something about earlier to you there.  He was one of my favorite students when high--when I was a high school teacher there.  And I do think that's one thing too, a lot of people do not encourage people to go in mathematics.  I find minority people don't.  Now, and I don't know about the other group if not--they encourage them or not.  Which I think of course now I can see the reason why though because you figure if you would spend that much time in school you supposed to go to medical school.  You're not supposed--I mean really they figure.  But sometimes if mathematics is somehow better.  I think being happy and enjoying what you are doing although you might not can pay as much for your car or your suit that the person did there, but you enjoy doing what you're doing and driving a lesser car to do that job can be just as rewarding in certain respects because you spend so many hours a day working.  And if you're not--and if it's drudgery, you have to spend much more time to amuse yourself when you're not working and all.  So that's what I think if you let people see the joy of doing mathematics, some of them will decide to make it a lifetime thing.  And then too if there are some of them now that say a man like Blackwell, he will probably get income very close to what a lousy doctor's position might get.  See, when people and schools have him come speak, well they give him I don't know what kind of fees that they are, what kind of fees they give people.  I was at the stage, I never got to that fee stage.  They give me a plaque when I go [laughter] speak to them now.  But some of the people you know well they get nice fees I understand.
Story_ID: 20733
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you retired in 2003 from Norfolk State [Norfolk State University] as Professor Emeritus.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And well when you look back, how many Ph.D.s did you advise?  Did you advise many people that went on to get their Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Oh, to go in--well now I wasn't, see now advisor, I didn't direct any thesis there, but (unclear).  Now the very first one was a graduate of Hampton, Gerline Dodd.  She went to Syracuse.  Then while she was there she had the same dissertation advisor in the same field.  She was from Suffolk, Virginia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and all.  When she went back to Hampton to work for a while, she worked for several years there and then under the (unclear) when that--then she left and went in industry which--and was quite well paid.  I haven't heard from her in the last five years.  I don't know whether--she's still in the land of the living because I mean she has relatives over in Suffolk and--but I haven't heard from her.  I don't know whether she's retired yet or not.
Speaker 1: So any others you know of that went on to get their Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Let's see now.  Now Charlie Yates, he got a Ph.D. at--he got one but now I don't know whether it was there.  And let's see--no, well I didn't--I don't know of any at Norfolk State who have completed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One thing about a lot of the students at Norfolk State want to go to work when they graduate around and you sort of enter--once a person gets a good job, they see no reason to go back to school.  I mean once they stop doing mathematics as we say.  But really those are about the only two I can think of right now.
Story_ID: 20734
Speaker 1: All right.  So when you look back over your career as a teacher at Norfolk State and at Hampton, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I think it has shown that black people can do mathematics.  Of course now you had--see a lot of people think of going up in a black environment.  When I say black people see now (unclear), they don't know what kind of environment Blackwell--Blackwell died six months ago.  But anyway they don't know whether or not he--I mean he was a black man that looked like a black man around.  They don't know so I mean actually, naturally when they finish and start working, the people that they work with are not black people.  So sometimes people think that they grew up in one, I mean I don't know whether or not they did or not.  But I think the main thing, I am definitely a black person, lived in a black community, went to black schools, couldn't go to around.  And I think it shows that if you are interested in it, it's--that's not a hindrance or doing that.  And then sometimes they would say your teachers, well you don't have (unclear).  But the thing is, it's nothing to stop you from opening the book and seeing whether this book (unclear) rather than waiting for your teacher to tell you what's in it and all.  I think sometime people are looking for excuses.  When I have pointed out when I sometime talk to groups that it is no excuse for you not having an interest in mathematics if that's what you're inclined to do and would like to do.  And I think that has--would probably be the best thing that I have contributed to it there.  Because when I--they said now of course now my father, he liked to do--he used to fill taxes out for people and things of that sort.  He had never been to college.  Well and then he--when I was a very young person, he was friendly with a lot of people who were in math because he did not--public school teacher said he had not, never--he didn't understand algebra, he went out to night school.  Didn't have to pay but $2.00 to go out there and took algebra courses and things of that sort.  Then, so after he retired, he could tutor people in doing that which was something that he didn't charge.  Some of them would give him, some of the parents if he'd take their child and go over and explain it to them.  But he was not an educated man at all, but yet he--and their parents would be professional people in the neighborhood, would send them there for my father to tutor.  Well he learned his by going to night school up around, about it.  He wanted to know what it was all about.  Well I think a lot of times you need people around who will show people what opportunities are there if that's what you want to do rather than looking for an--rather than giving an excuse and complaining the rest of their life.
Story_ID: 20735
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well I am perhaps a little bit different there.  I think we shouldn't--we should look for opportunity and not whom to blame.  See what opportunities are around us and not who we can say is at fault when we don't gain.  Now I think so often we sit down, we get together and don't want to discuss and we want to talk about who is at fault for that.  But, well of course you can't change other people, especially if they're grown.  And so what you want to do I think the main thing we should get them to do to see what opportunities they can pick around and stop blaming other people around (unclear).  But we see so many people seem to think that they're deprived there because they see, read in the paper about money that so many--that other people have.  But I think though it would be just as hard almost for a white man to get the money that Romney has (unclear) a person like me to get it.  I mean I really think--so those things don't come easy to get that.  But they often, I hear people say, look at there.  There, all right his father was rich and he comes out and get money on his own.  But because you can't do that, it's not--whole lot of people can't do that and I think so often I think we as black people think whatever we can't do is because we are black.  But basically I think the time has come so different from what it was when I was growing up that you can do anything almost a person--anybody, anything anybody else can do.  Your chances of succeeding in it are just as great.
Story_ID: 20736
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, again is there anything that you would do differently if you could, any major thing?
Speaker 2: Oh yes I would, one thing about--yes.  The--an outcome of the unsuccessful life of my middle child.  He wanted to study mathematics.  His stepfather was saying uh-uh, you should go into medicine.  So he was admitted to a two year program at Northwestern University and then the next year he went into medicine.  And then oh, I hate to say this, towards the end--after the end of the two years, he hated I mean going around doing things like that.  And so I got a call one night that they found him dead.  He had shot himself.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: In his room.  And that's, I mean that's a terrible thing.  I wish we would have told him, study math--I mean he was always interested in science projects in high school and all that kind of stuff.  He liked to talk about me, reading my books and all.  That was his interest.  But other people stepped forward and maybe some of my people too, wanted--said no, uh-uh, medicine is the field.  And after he got that, but I mean he had no particular interest in that thing.  And I certainly would have, if I'd had the opportunity would see somebody, see one of my grandchildren wanted to study and they want to put them in some field because it has more glamour or prestige or whatever that prestige means around, I would definitely tell them if that's what they want to do and are satisfied to live off the remuneration you can get from working in mathematics, leave them alone.
Story_ID: 20737
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about your family.  Now I know you and Mr. Jones were divorced in the '80s [1980s] right and then--but you have children and--
Speaker 2: By both marriages.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Now--well, Mr. Jones, he started courting me when I came back from Syracuse with my Ph.D.  He had been married before (unclear).  I knew him sort of.  He was a year ahead of me at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  He was in the school of pharmacy.  He was a pharmacist here and all.  And then he started--well actually we didn't have a lot of differences but (unclear) moved out here.  But he stopped working and (unclear).  So then, well see as you say, money is the root of all evil and I think that's a root of a lot of divorces.  And so then a lot of accounts we had as joint accounts.  And I start--I opened my own account since I was working.  He got--fell in love with duplicate bridge.  Now to get exactly how he thought of it, he had promised some woman out in Chicago [Illinois] he would be her partner at the tournament in California.  Well he was working at the hospital and he had taken a new job, he had gone out--he was in business for himself when I married him and then he'd gone--there was a company called Peoples around here that hired him as a pharmacist and all and they pay, get paid pretty good.  And so Peoples--what it is, the lady that worked the (unclear) she had had a vasectomy and the other fellow had three pharmacists, because see they're open long hours from about maybe 8:00 in the morning to 9:00 at night so they needed three to cover that.  And then the fellow had a heart attack and died before they got him to the hospital.  All right, so he was--they was short.  When he went to work for him, he told him he always took August off, the first two weeks in August off to go to the bridge tournament he said, so he was going to take a leave without pay.  And so then the man said well I can't let you, anybody take any leave without pay because I'm short so I'll hire some more people.  So then he said that he was a man of his word.  He promised the lady that he would play and he would not want to forsake his word so he resigned the job.  And then when he came back he didn't bother to look for another one.  Well now one of his friends say--said that he thought I could afford it [laughter] around.  He said it doesn't hurt because I mean the only thing that would do, he said you notice now he hadn't worked for a while.  So--but he was satisfied with my just making remarks.  But when I put my money that I received in a separate account, we didn't get along anymore and all that.  So he said mean things to her and then I said--I mean said to me.  He said listen, I don't like you any better than you like me.  The only reason I stay with you is so when my son gets twenty one, he won't blow his brains out by being brought up with some idiot like you.  So I say, I said now--so I started thinking and I felt bad when he told me that and it hurt my feelings so I decided to leave him.  So that was--so I moved out and all and so he--when--without working couldn't keep up the house.  But he got another wife after that though, has a sister, a twin sister.  He had had three nice wives.  He (unclear) married one of the vice presidents down at Spellman College after I left him and so we started getting along, not as, in a relationship or anything but you know we're getting along and talk--he introduced me to his wife.  She was a nice lady and all.  But it's just a matter, I mean just a matter I didn't want him.  I didn't care.  I was glad he had a nice one because when my son would go down to visit him between breaks and all, he would--his wife was nice you know to him and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was nice.  I just couldn't--I just didn't want to live with him that's all.  I mean I really can't--I just didn't--I thought he was mean and didn't work at all and I'll be--and so I, and I survived without living with him.
Story_ID: 20738
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your children, you got children right that are grown?
Speaker 2: I didn't have but one child by--
Speaker 1: You got one child now?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  See, I was past forty.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah, I mean all together.  I'm not talking about just with him but all together you have like, how many children?
Speaker 2: It was three. The middle one--
Speaker 1: It was three, but now there are two right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then and now there are two.
Story_ID: 20739
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well if I take the last one--
Speaker 1: Is there anything?
Speaker 2: Um-um.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any hobbies or anything that you like that I haven't talked about?
Speaker 2: Well what it is, I find my hobbies are, think I say what other--things that I do for relax, I find well you see once you get past--well what is it, the two things, line that they do, the line dancing and the card playing.  The thing is, but I'm not--I went out there for the limelight, was taking instructions and all of that but that's just, I'm not talented that way.  I mean I don't know, I don't understand why because I mean some of the people are old as I am or maybe even a year or two spotting me.  But--and all and are--they're not the most brilliant people in the world but they--I don't--
Speaker 1: They can dance.  [Laughter].
Speaker 2: I mean they can--I just don't understand it but I just cannot get those kind of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I just can't get it.  But I will play cards and all and I don't mind but I can out walk anybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You seem to be in pretty good shape.  You move around here pretty fast.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew well in--see I don't, short distances like say if I'm gonna just need a few things from the grocery store, I don't mind walking a mile or so to get that.  I don't drive my car to get those kind of things and small things like that.  I don't have any problem there.  That's what I said, it's nothing particularly wrong with me.  My pressure is (unclear) but I cannot do those interest--things.  I don't know what--my feet don't seem to cooperate with that.  But I, I'm a good card player though too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You don't count the cards do you?
Speaker 2: But--and also around, but I've done other things too while I was working.  I've sold real estate and I've also since I've retired, I fixed people--I was working for a taxi--I mean a taxes company called Jackson Hewitt and all like that.  And those are the kind of things that I can do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't have any kind of--reason when I sold--I put one of my little plaques on the wall of course now in real estate I didn't excel in it, but one month I was the salesman of the month and they would always give a plaque to us.  So I keep that up.  I sold it for seven years but it was only one month for that, that I did better than anybody else.  And that actually was through my husband that I happened to do that.  He would say he wanted to go in real estate but he wanted me to--both of us to take the course.  So both of us took the course, both of us took the exam afterwards for the states, the state examination and both of us passed the state examination.  But you have to--if you haven't passed the broker's exam you have to hang your, you have to work for a broker but he never, but he wouldn't do it.  He just liked to play cards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And talk mean to me when I started putting my money in a different bank.
Story_ID: 20740
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well I would like to be remembered as a good person and all like that.  And most people though do think I'm a good person.  My children and my grandchildren say they love me and you think--of course now my grandson goes to Delaware State and I'm paying his tuition there.  His father is an associate professor at American University, my oldest boy there, a French teacher in Washington, D.C.[District of Columbia] there.  But they don't know how to manage their money and everything.  But--so I didn't want him borrowing money.  He started out making loans, student loans so I told him I would, you know I'd pay that for him there and everything.  And so he told me he loved me and all.  But--and my youngest son has a two year old (unclear).  So he has a baby sitter for nothing.  I keep him quite often but, so I would like to be remembered that way.  But I never--and I tried to--I'm on the Board of the Catholic Charities for Eastern Virginia, helping the people there.  I do work for charity work there and I am generous in my donations there.  I find in real estate there is a--if you're willing to work you can--and you got a job so you don't have to manipulate putting money to hold something for being paid and all like that for interest charge, you can do quite well.  And the whole time that I was working said whatever I made I did not use it to live off.  I would put it down there cause for example one fellow I had sold a townhouse to them to a couple.  Then after all the, after he got the townhouse paid down and all and advanced in their jobs, they thought they should get a more expensive house and all.  And so he wanted me to sell the townhouse for him and look for another place.  So we quickly found another place that would be suitable to their increased wages and all that type of thing.  And, but I couldn't get rid of that townhouse.  So what I did, I looked at it this way, I said well with the commission if I don't sell it, I get off it, I can buy it myself, pay on it and then it wasn't enough to pay for the whole townhouse but then I rented it out and I got more rent on it than the payment was.  In fact I still have that place going.  And I find that brings in extra income and I was with a realtor then.  And then he told me I couldn't handle it myself because that would be a conflict of interest if I'm out hustling for myself with it being my broker.  So I had to go through the company.  So I find I have a source of income from there, from property that I don't have to do anything.
Speaker 1: So you'd like to be remembered as a resourceful person who's trying to do the best she can do?
Speaker 2: Best I can with what I have to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 20741
Speaker 1: Go ahead and tell us about who's in this photograph?
Speaker 2: That's my grandmother, Gussie, G-U-S-S-I-E Smith.  That picture was taken during the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay, next one.
Speaker 2: Okay, that is my mother and father George and Lillian Green observing, at the observance of their Fiftieth anniversary of being, of marriage.  That was taken in 1973.
Speaker 1: Next up.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It says December of 1976, is that true?
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear) um-hmm.  That's my mother, father and my siblings.  And okay, my brother, I have two brothers there and both of their wives and their children are there on the picture and I have a--three sisters.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you tell us where these people are?
Speaker 1: Okay, well some of them let's see are still around and then--
Speaker 2: Maybe start maybe from the left side of the picture in the back row--
Speaker 1: Yeah you can go left to right.
Speaker 2: --and work your way across.
Speaker 1: Go this way and come back around this way.
Speaker 2: Okay.  On this end is--
Speaker 1: On the top or bottom?
Speaker 2: At the top.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is my sister Lillian, she lives, right now she's in an assisted living home in Maryland.  She spent the last few years working as a chemist in Washington, D.C.  Beside her is her husband William Childers.  He died a couple of years ago.  He was a chemist in Washington, D.C.  Then the third one is, that's a nephew, Tommy, wait a minute I'm trying to see whether it's Tommy or his father, they look so much alike.  That's his father.  That's my brother in law, not the son, my brother in law, George Bess.  That's another sister's husband.  She's sitting below.  Then there is standing there tall is, that's oh yeah, my brother Walter right in the middle there, Walter Green.  And next to him is my brother George Green.  George has the more prominent mustache.  Walter is still living and George is dead.  He died at age 51.  He was the oldest of us.  He had a kidney problem.  And that is a former brother in law next to George, Milton Cooper.  He lives in Dover, Delaware.  He was married to my baby sister's--all right.  And on the end whose face is partially shaded, you can't much see it, is a wife of my older brother.  Her name is Elnora Green there.  She--now we'll get on this side.  That's my sister in law Alvita Green.  She's the wife of Walter and she's holder her oldest child at that time, Alvita.  Next to them is my sister Barbara. She looks like me.  And next to Barbara is my father, George Green, Sr.  He is holding my nephew Walter, Jr.  And next to them is--my father is dead and next to them is my mother next to him.  My mother is dead also there.  She's on the--has the polka dot, I mean has the dotted dress there.  All right, now then there's a little boy there, that is a nephew of mine, Bess, Tommy Bess and then there's Eleanor, myself there and going upward is my sister, my baby sister, Mary Agnes all right.  Mary Agnes is dead now.  She died of lung cancer.  She was a smoker.  She smoked cigarettes, okay.  And she's holding my niece who's now--Darlene.  Darlene is, now teaches in the Virginia Beach system.  Okay, now let's look at the children.  On the front row, that's my middle son Herbert.  Herbert's dead.  Next to Herbert is my older son, that's Edward Armsted Dawley, Jr., um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Wow, that was tough.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tough.  Have a great memory here.  (Unclear) lined up that much of my family (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We have on there, on the left hand, the fellow on the left hand is a guy named William Brown.  Now that picture that, was taken in let me see, I'm trying to see.  I guess in the early '70s [1970s], in the '70s [1970s] there.  He is no kin.  I, sometime I would use him as an escort after I--yeah, that's' right, after I left my husband.  Then I'm there in the green dress, Eleanor and then the fellow behind is my brother Walter.  And the lady in white is my sister in law, Walter's wife, Alvita Green.  And in the back is, of them is, well that's Alvita's--now that's Alvita in red also but that's my niece.  Sister in law in white and red is Alvita in the red.  And the behind her, the fellow behind her is her husband there.  She was Alvita--she's divorced from him now.  I can't think of his name.  And next to--oh, and the fellow on the end is a fellow who was in the math department at Norfolk State, Charles Johnson.  I used, also used him some time as an escort, had two of my escorts today.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now that picture was taken, let's see when the lady in the middle graduated from high school there.  And that would be, let's see about, yeah ten years ago.  That would be, that was about 2002 I'd say.  I'm there in the, Eleanor is in the white, my sister Barbara is standing next to me and the high school graduate, Stephanie Green is in the middle, my baby sister, Mary Agnes Green who's dead with the red shirt on and my brother Walter Green beside her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) that's--is--that's my picture there.  I was at a, what they call a Links Convention there.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: About 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Is that your professional picture?
Speaker 2: Okay yes.  Yeah that was taken, I was young then.  Didn't see any gray.  That must have been about twenty years ago.  That would be the, that was taken during the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Uh-huh, yes with that Links stuff, I got it right.  That's Eleanor, that's my--got the names all there, Green Dawley Jones.  I was the treasurer of the women's organization called the Links there of the Eastern area of the organization.  Oh, now that's a very recent picture there.  It's Eleanor with the, on the left side, myself and oh yes that was at a, where was--that was taken in December of 2011.  I'm in the middle and that fellow is in Norfolk.  He's a retired full colonel of the U--full colonel.  He's from the--he wasn't part of the class, he just went along with me.  And then other girl was one of my high school classmates, Shirley Holloway.  And that picture was taken at a Links convention.  They're giving me those flowers and all.  I'm outgoing officer of the Eastern area there and that's my sister Barbara standing beside me, Barbara Bess. [BRIEF PAUSE]
Speaker 1: Oh and that's the same convention, Link convention there.  I was explaining to them, to the members of the other groups how to prepare a budget and also the best ways of itemizing and using the effects of the--a lot of the people there they do not know how to properly prepare a budget according to the standards of the organization, the workshop.  Now that would be during the, that was during the '80s [1980s] also.  That's at an advance placement workshop at the University of, what is it Clemson University there in South Carolina.
Speaker 2: That's in 1993.
Speaker 1: 1993?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Yeah, I was grading those advanced placement exams.  Oh yes that, now that's a picture of Lucille Lowes (sp.) and myself.  I don't know what year that was.  We were taking our names off for gifts of that tree to give to deprived children. [BRIEF PAUSE]
Speaker 2: Okay, and that's me and my sister again.  I think we--there was one like that, similar to that.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Did I put a year on the back of there?
Speaker 1: On this one?
Speaker 2: No, the one--that one, the small one.  I think--
Speaker 1: I don't see--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.  That would be taken, yeah I was a young lady then and that was about during the '70s [1970s], that's Eleanor.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Oh that's a fellow I--that's Dr. James Edward Newbie.  He's dead now.  He was the fellow that took me to the high school prom.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  His father taught out there at Booker T. there.  And that gentleman I'm with there became Governor of Virginia later.  That's Mark Warner.  In fact he, that was the first announcement he made at that meeting there was that he would be running for governor.  I was receiving an award for increasing minorities in high tech fields.
