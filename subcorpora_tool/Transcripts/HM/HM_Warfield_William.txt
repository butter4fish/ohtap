Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: Your favorite song?
Speaker 2: My favorite what?
Speaker 1: Song.
Speaker 2: I, have a, really I don't have a favorite.

Speaker 2: Depends on the mood I'm in.
Speaker 1: Okay. Your favorite scent.

Speaker 1: Scent.  Smell, scent.
Speaker 2: Cinnamon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite season?
Speaker 2: --let me think about it.  Fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about your favorite memory?
Speaker 2: There are so many they run into each other.
Speaker 1: In your book,  and I'd like to start, but in your book, you, you, you described your life as a charmed life and I wanted to ask you.  I wanted to ask you what, what you, what would you say about that.  Why do you feel all this charm?
Story_ID: 14810
Speaker 1: Why do you feel this is charmed?
Speaker 2: I think I used the word "charmed" [in his book, 'William Warfield: My Music and My Life', 1991], meaning, not meaning for the, the, the in the sense, in the sense of beautiful or anything like that, but meaning in the sense of mystic and, "charmed" in that sense.  Because as I look back over my life, there are many, so many things have happened in my life that, seemed that were, were, were predestined almost or, or, or happened in a way in which and, it was a mystery why it all, all took place.  And, several incidents having to do with things that happened to me and things that preceded it and things that happened afterwards, and was all like it was all connected in some way.  That's what I meant by "charmed" and not "charm" in the sense of beautiful, but sort of mystic and predestined and things like that.

Speaker 1: Mr. Warfield, you, were born in [West Helena] Arkansas then raised in Rochester [New York] and you talk a lot about, you know, the South, influence of the South in your family. And I would like you just to talk about growing, you know, your growing up in your household.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I was, although I was born in Arkansas and raised in Rochester, New York, I was raised in the Southern heritage, if you want to call it--Southern tradition.  And, my father [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] was Baptist minister and he--we moved to Rochester because he could educated himself.  He was not educated, and he wanted to educate himself for the ministry.  And so my recollections of Rochester, is, is, where I feel that I was raised and that's what I know.  I didn't know anything, I don't have no memories whatsoever of, of Arkansas and I didn't get back to Arkansas until after--later--early in my career when I went back for the first time. And during the course of my life, there were several members of the family including an uncle whom my father had found in Arkansas. Who he also brought to Rochester who he also--whom he also brought to Rochester, but we were, but our--my raising was a Southern raising in the tradition of food.  For instance, we subscribed to two newspapers that was the 'Chicago [Illinois] Defender' the 'Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] Courier' which were black newspapers.  We were totally aware of the things that were going on in the South--the lynchings, and the, the schools, the universities, and I remember when, people came--black people came through the South who were well-known like Madame [Mary McLeod] Bethune, came through.  My father would take us to hear her speak and things like that.  So although I was raised in the North in a neighborhood that was quite, mixed.  We lived right next door to Italian people and around the corner were Jewish people, down two blocks was a Polish neighborhood, and my, my high school was totally mixed.  We called it the 'Melting pot of the city' just about because of the Jews, blacks, Italians, Polish, Ukrainian, you name it.  We all were at [George] Washington High School [Rochester, New York].  So my, my recollection of being raised was quite with all types of people around me--races around me. And my father being a minister also being--believing in, in, in the equality of people, and the brotherhood of people. I mean, that's how I was raised in--that kind of an atmosphere.
Story_ID: 14812
Speaker 1: [We never] wanted for food or anything like that, but we, we, for instance, at Easter time, we knew were gonna have a suit or something for Easter for especially for the Easter morning service and things like that.  And, maybe once a year, some shoes or something--were needed things, but, but we were, we were definitely not, not well-to-do.
Speaker 2: And, and this growing up in the, in the environment you did in Rochester [New York]--in a mixed environment.  Was that, you know, a lot of people would perceive those things not ever happening.  You know that, that people always lived in sort of  segregated environments.  And I just want you--what, what do you think that early raising--I mean, everyone I assume was poor in the neighborhood.  I assume that.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I assume it was a poor neighborhood.  As a matter of fact it was a neighborhood where (pauses), people were--not one, one, one family wasn't any better off than the other one.  We all got along and I lived right next door to a railroad track, (laughs) and all that sort of thing.  But I wasn't aware of the fact growing up that were poor, in, in, in that sense.  I knew that I just couldn't get anything I wanted, but I just thought everybody was like that.  Nobody got everything they wanted, and if I did when I was a teenager--I used to go out and do, do work and especially the summer and, and the, and the in, in, in the factory or things like that to make a little extra money so that I could buy things.  And, I had roller skates even a bike at one time, but it was all things in which I worked to get money for to do and, I never felt that I was under privileged in any way as a youngster growing up. And that's probably because of the love that the family and the, the, we were lived in a neighborhood where everybody helped everybody else and what, what--and it didn't matter what color we were.
Story_ID: 14813
Speaker 1: I did not know about segregation myself--to feel it until I got older, and started to travel in the South and was aware that there was places that I couldn't go to even in the early part of my career before the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision on, non-segreg--desegrega--desegregated the country.  I would be taken, for instance, if I was going to a college, I would be housed at the president's home or, or in the--on the campus, and things like that when I was in the South and never was taken to a hotel.  Or if I, even during the period of time before the, the, the railroad stations and the trains were desegregated.  If I were--would, I would always go like, Pullman [railroad car] because then I had a place to sleep and things like that.  And I was generally met at the car and taken around the white and black things and the fountains that said 'black' and 'white' and all of that, in the early part of my days.  But I was totally aware of it.  And one of the occasions that had, that had happened to me that I was aware of it when I, I  came into Atlanta [Georgia] at the airport and my accompanist who was my teacher and coach, Dr. Otto Herz and I, we wanted to have lunch before we took another plane.  And, we, they put us in a corner and, all of a sudden, I realized they were erecting, they were erecting screens around us because at that little point where we were they weren't--back in those days, you couldn't--they had to segregate us because by law you couldn't eat in the same place.  And I remember seeing them, my first reaction was--just I, it was hilarious.  I just, got, got--I said, "What are they doing?" (laughs) You know, it was just so--I couldn't believe, you know, that anybody would go to that trouble to just, to segregate somebody else because I had not had segregation as, as--in the North.  And as you can see raised in the neighborhood I was, we didn't, I didn't feel segregation itself.  And by the time as I said, I got into my career earlier before things were desegregated, I was more or less protected from, having to confirm ourselves, shall we say.  So I cannot say that I actually in the South had to go to a black waiting room or had to drink from a black fountain or 'for colored' I think they was, they was called and they--weren't called 'black'.  It was a bad word we, I came up. (laughs)  Somebody called you black, that was paramount to fighting, you know.  And then we've, of course, you know, as a race, we've gone through dropping all that nonsense and we went through the "Black is beautiful" thing and, I don't know how many different things we been called since 'Negro', and 'Afro-American', 'African-American', 'Colored'.  And, in fact, "Are you colored?"  I would say, "Yeah.  What are you?"  "I'm, I'm green tomorrow."  You know, it's something--it's just be such a, such a mixture of what we, eventually come to use to say, "I'm black," and be proud of it.
Story_ID: 14814
Speaker 1: You come from a close family, but I wanted you to discuss your relationship with your father [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.].
Speaker 2: My relationship with my father, at first, was one of, it always has been respect, and always, love. But, it was like, the, the fear almost.  I didn't, didn't, I didn't dare do certain things and it wasn't, but I, I don't remember ever having any bad feelings towards, towards him for it.  I just that Daddy said it, I better not do it, and it was just one of those things.  Daddy said this, Daddy said that--I better do it. It was only later in my life that a relationship--it was let's say, let's say completely disciplined and, for instance, I never questioned.  If he said, "You don't do this," I never questioned it.  It was--I remember I'd, I'd said something to--oh, yes, I came in one day and said to my father something and he answered me.  And I said, "Really?"  I said, and he said, "Do you think I'm lying?"  And I just remember, "Oh my God."  I said, "Daddy, I don't say things like that."  I really--and I that, it was really just a reflex action, but it was that kind of a thing.  Later on, my father also, as, as we grew, we older ones in the family used to marvel at the difference that my father had become by the time my youngest brother was born.  And brother was eleven years in between and we used to look at him at, at him and Tat--'Tat' we called him, Thaddeus is his name.  And his, his relationship with Tat was almost completely--it was soft, it was very, very--Tat could wind my dad around his finger and we wouldn't have dare even try (laughs)--you know, one of the older ones, you know.  Over and above that and, when we--when I got to be a teenager there developed a real, marvelous warmth between my dad and I.  And I think one of the reasons was, that he relinquished a lot of the discipline thing that he had, and I recognized in him a lot of the greatness that he was a person. He was a man who, without education, decided to come to Rochester, New York, and he worked as a garbage collector--we call it the Sanitation Department now, and he would get up early in the morning and do his, and they did that kind of a job because he wanted to educate himself.  And he would get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and would go out and do these routes collecting garbage, come in and have some food, and study his books and pastored a church on Sunday and raised five boys.  And raised us in a way in which we all, all of my brothers, I'm proud to say, and, and, and their children have a tremendous sense of responsibility, civic duty, love, and religion--and respect for the human race.  And that, that I began to see in my dad when I was a teenager and related to it, and he responded.
Story_ID: 14815
Speaker 1: What was expected of you as the oldest of the five?
Speaker 2: Of the oldest of the five, I was delegated--and it was very, very funny now that I think about it--I was allowed to discipline the brothers [Murphy, Vern and Thaddeus Warfield] underneath me, but not the next brother.  The next one to me, no.  If anyone--when they were away and I was in charge, if anyone did something wrong, I could spank them, you know, but not the one next to me.  And I've thought about that later (laughs) and I said, "What a wise decision, you know."  Because, I mean, there might have been a little jealousy or it might have been unfairness, his being the next one.  Who knows?  We were three years apart, but, but my mother [Bertha McCamery Warfield] said, "Go out, you make them children mind, Bill, you know," and I would, you know.  But, they--she would--my dad [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] and mother never gave me carte blanch with the brother next to me.  "You leave Robert [E. Warfield, Jr.] alone, just report him to us." (laughs) You know, it was one of those kind of things.  And, and as a result of that, I mean, right now, most of my brothers look on me as sort of like a second dad, yeah.
Story_ID: 14816
Speaker 1: My mother [Bertha McCamery Warfield] was a typical, wonderful, sweet, pastor's wife.  And was grateful, whatever, you would--she, she lived to please her husband and her family and her children and all of that.  She didn't have any career in mind and she was a tremendous cook, tremendous comforter. I mean, she would discipline but we could get away with things with my mother.  I remember once, my young third brother had done something and she did--was going to--she had a switch and she was going to whip him.  And he could not--she couldn't catch--he would get under the kitchen table.  She'd go around to the other side and he'd be at the other side.  She said, "Well, I'm gonna get you for this."  And sure at night we, we all slept--we had beds in this big room.  And one night, we were all sleep, and I heard a howl and we all woke up and my mother had come and tied my brother, Murphy [Warfield], to the bedpost with his hands and hit him and he jumped and tried to run and she had him pinned down.  And she gave him good spanking.  We sat there (laughs) and howled because he was screaming--she wasn't hurting him.  But, but he couldn't--she, she and he never said--but my father [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] was different.  My father used to say, "Alright--," he says, "--give me your hand."  And he would take my hand and he would take his belt off.  He says, "I'm going to give you five licks for this thing that you've done."  And that would be the extent of it.  And he would--and, and it--they would hurt, but not to the extent to anything that could  be called abuse.  And it, it, the fact that we had to wait--he would say, "I'm not going to punish you now because I'm angry.  But I'm going to give you five licks of my belt when I am calm."  And that waiting period (laughs) was more punishment, believe me.  And he always got around to doing it.
Story_ID: 14817
Speaker 1: I remember once, I was provoking Mother [Bertha McCamery Warfield]--she was in the kitchen, she had this pot in her hand--an aluminum pot, and I said something that did--sassy, and turned around and the next thing I knew, I felt this pot right on my backside--POW! (laughs) My dad [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] would never have done something like that.  Mother, "What did you say!?"  "Nothing, Mama, nothing," (laughs) And I'll never forget that.  She just reacted at the moment to, to things where my father was very methodical about it.
Story_ID: 14818
Speaker 1: None of your brothers--did they pursue a career in music (unclear)?
Speaker 2: All of them were very musical, but none of them actually pursued a career, per se, in music.  They were my, my brother next to me, Robert [E. Warfield, Jr.], went to the Eastman School [of Music, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York] and he was, he, he was a bass horn.  And he also when he was in the [U.S.] Army, he was a warrant officer and conducted the band.  And then after he got out, every, every Memorial Day, he paraded with the, with the, the Army Band down the streets in Rochester, directing them.  He was a warrant officer in the Army, but he, he and then he and the brother next--my youngest brother, played piano and were organists--was the music--minister of music at various churches.  My younger brother was a minister of music at one of the churches in Rochester which he's retired from--And then my youngest brother [Thaddeus 'Tat' Warfield] kept on the tradition that I started being the minister's son and playing for services and he was at--played all the services--he just recently retired from the Mt. Vernon [Missionary] Baptist Church which was my father's [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] last church.  Just recently I went up there for the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Mt. Vernon Baptist Church in Rochester, New York and I sang.  And my brother who is a Minister of Music there, also played and whatnot.  But their main professions, they both were into--my, my brother next to me went into Xerox Corporation when he was, when it just first started in Rochester.  He became an executive there.  And my youngest brother was with DuPont [Company], and the brother in between [Vern Warfield] was with another big company there as a computer analyzer and things like that.  But they all had music as an avocation.
Story_ID: 14819
Speaker 1: What do you think your brothers would say about you?  How would they describe you?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a documentary made of me, by WILL [TV Channel 12] down in [Urbana] Champaign, Ilinois a few years ago, and they interviewed several of my brothers--all of my brothers [Robert Jr., Murphy, Vern and Thaddeus Warfield], as a matter of fact.  And they, they, sort of, had a pretty good analyzation of me.  They, they, had a tremendous amount of admiration for, for the music that I did, and--but--and coming from a standpoint of understanding music themselves, not so much from just being my brother, they'd said, "We always thought--" one of my brothers said, "I always was very, very amazed at Bill's talent and how he handled it."  You know, and he--then he would say something about the way I made music, but he was saying it from the standpoint of being a musician himself, not from my brother.  And, and one of--my youngest brother [Thaddeus] made a remark that he always thought he could depend on me for anything, and that I was like the Rock of Gibraltar and things like that.  And so that's the kind of relationship I had, and still have with my brothers.  There's only one of us that passed away [Murphy] and he passed away when he was about thirty-five years old, and I began sort of the father to his family.  So all of those nieces and nephews that were his children are sort of like children of my own now or were since he passed away.
Story_ID: 14820
Speaker 1: You were talking about music--that you've never lost your sense of awe and reverence for the universe of music.
Speaker 2: Oh, the universality, yeah, yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: And you said it paralyzed religion in its scope and depth.  And I--you know, in talking about your career and also looking at the role of music has played.  I mean, it was, it was your gift, it's been your avocation.  And, and I'm just wondering how you would des-, how would you describe music and the role it's played in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, if you asked me to describe what role music has played in my life.  I would have to tell you that it is my life.  It is not a role, it's my life--music is my life.  And, to me, I am what I am because of music. I remember when I wrote my book--my autobiography which Alton Miller was the, was the really the, the one the did all the footwork for it.  I'd told him, I said, they said we'll make--'William Warfield: My Life and My Music'.  I said, "No, no, it has to be 'William Warfield: My Music and My Life' [1991].  Music came first if you notice and that's the title of my book, okay.  Because I felt that--about my music I felt that same thing that my father [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] felt about the ministry.  He said he had a calling to the ministry.  And many people who are as ministers say that they've had a calling by God to do that.  I felt the same way about music.  That, that was my calling and if I did not do that, if I did not fulfill that, I will miss the purpose for which I am here on Earth.  And, so, anything that I could do to prepare myself, to make sure I was giving the best of it, I did having to do with music.  And it rewarded me because of that.  And so far as the universality of it is concerned, I, I think that, that it is the cosmos  and it is there and if you're connected up with it, you're connected up with what you--what you are as a person--what your id is.
Story_ID: 14821
Speaker 1: I was talking with Leontyne [Price] one day, just recently.  She said, "Bill--," she says, "--you know what?  We are closest to God when we are performing and doing our music.  We can't get any closer to God than that."  And I agreed with her.  And, that, that, that's why I felt--and then I feel that there is a connection in the universe from the beginning of the time 'til now.  And the music, whatever it is, is a great connection.  As a matter of fact, on my Town Hall [concert venue, New York, New York] debut in 1950, I had a little thing at a conductus for that was out of the mass that was done by the organist of the Notre Dame Cathedral [Paris, France] and it was--thing about Jesus on the cross speaking to how he felt about mankind and his ingratitude for his having died for him.  And I programmed that--it was an a cappella thing--alongside a spiritual.  And to give you an example, this, this was an, an--(sings in Latin, then in English)--"I am a poor pilgrim of sorrow.  I'm tossed in this wide world alone."  Isn't that amazing?  And one was in the thirteenth century and this, this just got out after the 1800s as a spiritual.
Story_ID: 14822
Speaker 1: Can you describe the, the connection that you feel?
Speaker 2: With an audience?  Oh, I feel an audience the minute I walk on stage.  There's a connection and I believe that, that connection is what I ride on, in communicating once I start singing.  And it doesn't mean that I have to look at anybody particular in the audience.  It's  that I'm aware that they're there, and they become--they all become a part of what I'm thinking, what I'm singing, what I'm trying to express.  And their response, from--to what I'm doing leads me on to another degree of giving.  It's sort of like--okay, here.  It's back and forth, back and forth.  I may--that's why people ask me, for instance, "You sing 'Old Man River' all the time.  Don't you ever get tired of singing 'Old Man River'?"  I said, "No, because number one, it's totally different every time I sing it because the audi--audience is different."  I open my mouth to sing it--something--depending on what the audience is responding to--what I feel coming back to me.  That determines what the song is going to be.  And, in addition to the fact that every day occurrences, you--in the news, for instance, this happens, that other thing happens, you are totally affected.  I am, at least.
Story_ID: 14823
Speaker 1: I am totally affected by what happens during--at any time of day in my life.  For instance, I remember the time when Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] died.  The first time I had a concert after that, I could hardly sing 'Old Man River', because I mean, we had--the words had been changed to begin with from the--and the ones we use in the movie ['Show Boat'] and the one that Paul Robeson use was that, (sings) "There's an old man called a Mississippi.  That's the old man that I--what I would like to be.  What does he care if the world's got troubles?  What does he care if the land ain't free?"  I got that far, and boy, it was hard to go on--the first concert after Dr. Martin Luther King had died because it was just--that was--you know, it was an expression of what he died for, you know. (laughs)
Story_ID: 14824
Speaker 1: When did you know that you had a gift?  There has--.
Speaker 2: Actually, I don't know when I was aware of the fact that it was any different than anybody--than anything else because it was just a natural thing to me.  Let me, let me, put it this way.  I always wanted to study piano so there was a lady at my father's [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] church who was the organist that was teaching the adults piano.  And I prevailed on her to start teaching me piano and I was nine years old at the time.  And then, later on, I, I, was a boy soprano in the choir and sang and all that.  And then later on, in junior high school, in a music class, my teacher said, "Do you know you have a lovely voice?  You ought to study voice."  And I said, "Okay, fine."  And I started studying voice after school, taking voice lessons and it went from one thing to the next. And the National Music Educators [League] national convention was out in St. Louis [Missouri] in 1938.  I was eighteen years old and they were offering a scholarship to the, the first place, I think, and second place winner.  And that was in St. Louis in 1938 and I had to win a contest in, in Rochester [New York] then win a local contest.  And I went as a group to the, the, con-, conference in St. Louis in 1938 and won first place.  And that gave me a scholarship to enter univers-- several of the universities, and I choose the Eastman School [of Music Rochester, New York] because that's where I lived and because there was a man there named Arthur Kraft that I wanted to study with.  And , I just--even then I did not think in terms of performing.  I wanted to get a degree and I wanted to get a Master's degree because I wanted to be able to teach, and to teach--and I wanted to teach--I didn't wanna teach for beginners and I didn't want to teach high school.  I wanted to teach at a college level because I was older people then--sharing and teaching was sort of together for me.  And I figured, "Well if I could get a Master's degree to teach, then I would be able to teach at a university."  And that was my main aim.  To get a master's Degree.  To be able to teach music at a college or university.  And that went through--and I went in the [U.S.] Army--went back to school--still, still performing all around every where--back to school--and, to, to finish this Master's degree and then I was asked to come to New York [New York] to audition for something that was called 'Call Me Mister'.  It was the road show of a big hit on Broadway [theater district in New York] with Jules Munshin and Betty Garrett.  And they were forming the national company.  So I went in that for '46 [1946] and '47 [1947] and it was during that period of time that I decided, "Well, when I get back to New York, I'm gonna stick around New York and see if I can make something of a career."  And I, I did all sorts of things before my time--did bit parts, nightclub work, and all kinds of things before I actually had my Town Hall [concert venue] debut in 1950, that three-year period.  But it was only after I was engaged in a job on the road every night singing--the 'Red Ball Express' and the 'Face on the Dime'--that I decided I think I'll stick around and see what this singing will do.
Story_ID: 14825
Speaker 1: Larney Goodkind who became my personal manager--I had before that been a talent scout for one of the big--I think RKO [Radio-Keith-Orpheum Pictures] or something like that.  Now how we met, we both were sent--we're in the [U.S.] Army at Military Intelligence Training Center in Camp Ritchie, Maryland.  And, I, I was in the, the military intelligence service for three years and when I got discharged--I said I went to--and he heard me and we did things together, and, and he always thought I had a great voice and I should do something with it.  But I said, "Well, I'm going back to school."  When I came to New York [New York] then to do the--'Call Me Mister', and then went on the road and came back in '47 [1947], I met--saw him again and he said, "Well--,"  he said, "--why don't I see what I can do."  He said, "I've never managed a particular artist before, but I do have contacts.  Let's see what happens--if anything comes up--it--we'll sign a contract."  And that's how we got started.  And, of course, he turned out to be that--it was, was--he remained my manager and he's in his nineties now and we still--he's retired from managing anything, but we still see each other.
Speaker 2: Did he manage your career--your whole life?  I mean, was he (unclear, simultaneously)
Speaker 1: Yes. Right up until the time--when I retired from the, when I left Rochester--left New York and went to teach at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana [Illinois].  That was in 1974.  And I more or less didn't need management or anything any more--and then, we had a loose thing in which if something came, he would negotiate it, but if--otherwise I would just handle it on my own. From 1975 up until the present time--and if still something comes to him now, and he wants to field it, as I say, I will give him a commission for it--he will get a commission for it.  And he still gets a commission for all of the records--contracts that he made for me during my career that there are royalties to.  And I get royalties twice a year from BMG [Bertelsmann AG] and from Sony [Corporation] and he gets a commission from that still because he negotiated those contracts.
Speaker 2: I wonder does he--is he a good manager?  Did he help your career a lot?  (simultaneously)
Speaker 1: As a matter of--Larney was a, was a fabulous manager.  Not only--he was a pianist himself and he was a musician and he had, he, he--I would--let's put it this way, he was my greatest fan as well as my--a man who knew music and, and when he worked--if there was anything that could be said of Larney was that, that he would, if he said something that had to be done, it had to done because I was worth it.  There was no doubt about it. (laughs) "Well--, they'd say, "--but what if we do that so and so and so."  "I'm not interested in your other artists, I am representing William Warfield and he is better than you--your other artists." (laughs) And he would not--and he was a hard man to deal with, but it was all for my benefit.  And he was really--he negotiated all of the big contracts, and movie deal, and the Columbia Records deal, the, the management--with Columbia Artists management.  He was the one that oversaw everything.  And yes, I'm very grateful for what he did for me.

Speaker 1: I was sent to, to basic training at Fort Niagara [Youngstown, New York], I think it was--no, no, to induction at Fort Niagara in 1942.  And then they shipped me to Jefferson Barracks, [St. Louis] Missouri for basic training.  And so--then they--after, after a certain time, they told what they were going to assign you to.  And I got this thing saying that I was going to be sent to some ordinance place somewhere in the United States--had no idea where it was.  And for some reason, it made me mad enough to just go down to the First Sergeant.  I said, "What in the world makes you think I--what in my background makes you think that this is where I can do ordinance and sending trucks and things around?"  I said, "I have all of this thing having to do with languages, I have a this, that--." And, and I just, just stood there and he just looked at me with shock. (laughs) He said, "Well, I'll tell you what.  I'll have them give you some exams for--in languages and see what they come up with."  So they gave me a written exam in French, German and Italian.  They put me with an interviewer, with whom I spoke in those three languages--and read.  And then so sure enough, they changed me and decided, "Well good, you qualify for military intelligence.  And they sent me to Military Intelligence Training Center in Camp Ritchie, Maryland.  Which is down where the Pentagon--where the underground Pentagon is, or where Camp David [Thurmont, Maryland] is down in that area.  And that's--when I got down there, the colonel of the post decided that he wanted to make me part of the cadre.  Because they were just starting more or less the camp, and he figured that he could use me there to run the theater and some of the training programs, seeing that I could, known all of this sort of thing.  And then I became one of the, the station complement.  And that's where I remained for--through the years I was in there.  I went in '42 [1942] and came out in '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: And how do you think--did the military have any influence on your, you know, on your background? Or was it just sort of a blip in your own history?  Was it--did it--?
Speaker 1: The military didn't have any influence.  In a sense only in a language sense.  But so far as I--to me it was just marking time 'til I could get out.  And what, what it did for me though was because I was in military intelligence, we trained refugees who came to the United States and joined the [U.S.] Army to go back and fight.  And so--and I was in charge of the recreation center and the theater.  And at night we would meet, and if there was a group of people who were French, we would talk French.  If there was a group that were Italian, we'd talk Italian.  If the group were German, we'd speak German.  And what it did was heighten my language ability. (pauses) And as a result, my, my singing in languages became easier.  Because I was totally natural in, in this speaking of the language.  As a matter of fact, I remember an incident.  I went  back with my full uniform, and went by my former teacher--French teacher's studio, and peeked through the door.  And she looked up and saw me.  And she said, (in a high voice) "Oh Monsieur Warfield!"  Her name was Miss Cummings.  And I started speaking French.  And she started speaking French.  She invited me in, she said, "Monsieur Warfield's in the class."  And all of a sudden when we were speaking French, this look of consternation came on her face.  And she stopped and in an instant she said, "Mr. Warfield, you've evidently been talking to people from Marseilles and it's ruining your accent." (laughs) I said, "Oh, here I was--."  So it did have an effect on me in the sense that it heightened my language ability.

Speaker 1: None of your growth had seemed to have been impacted by the fact that you were black. Nothing.  I mean nothing--.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact to be perfectly frank with you, that was the first time that I experienced segregation as such, because when I went into the [U.S.] Army in 1942, the Army was not desegregated.  And I would stay in the barracks with black soldiers.  And we had our--where we--recreation facilities were all separate.  And then when I got to Jefferson Barracks in [St. Louis] Missouri the same thing was there.  And then when I got down to Camp Ritchie, Maryland, that all was different.  There was no segregation on that camp because number one, we were G2s [Military Intelligence].  Not, not--the Army was--general classification of G3 [Operations]--the Army, Navy, Marines and them.  We were in G2 which had to do with the management of the war.  That's what the general services, and all that, the military intelligence was in that, so there was no segregation there.  But I was in Maryland, and I ran into segregation there on several occasions, but outside (with emphasis) the post.  It wasn't on the post itself.  And but--what was the question you asked me?  Did I get away from--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) No, no.  My question was what was happening in the country in the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) that, that was. It was pretty much segregated. And it was only after, I think it was--Wasn't it [President Harry S.] Truman that did it?  That desegregated the services? And then of course, you know the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision came later about desegregation.  But I--even then only if I went into town, I, I had, I, I had to face segregation in Maryland.  Because it--and then going into--on buses and things like that, going into Washington D.C. or Baltimore-Washington and so on and so forth, we didn't have any problem.  I sat where I wanted to and I've had several incidents happen to me.  Once I was sitting alone.  A white lady came in and sat down beside me.  And one of the soldiers in the back who was from the South tapped her on the shoulder and said, "Ma'am, would you change places with me?"  And she got up and changed places and he sat down and said to me, says, "Our white ladies are not used to sitting next to black people."  And I looked at him.  And you know, I, I kept my composure.  But I, I almost "read him to filth," (laughs), as the expression goes.  And you know, that, that kind of a thing, and thinking, "I would understand that he would have this white lady move, because she wasn't used to sitting to--" and he was a fellow soldier.  And I could have really come down on him, 'cause I was a Sergeant and he was a Corporal.  But I said, "Well, let it go."  You know.
Story_ID: 14828
Speaker 1: I definitely think that because I was in the arts, I was shielded from a lot of things.  Because if you remember, even with--before segregation, Actors' Equity [Association] in New York [New York] said they would not play in houses that were segregated.  So the arts really started desegregation long before the [U.S.] Supreme Court did.  And Marian Anderson for instance who did concerts made it evident that she would not sing with a segregated audience.  So they would make an exception to, to the rule for Marian Anderson.  People like Paul Robeson were out there fighting for, for desegregation and for the human spirit, and they were my forerunners.  And many gates--doors were opened to me before I got there, having to do with these great people in the arts.  Who just said--took a stand against it?  If you remember, Marian Anderson was to have sung at Constitution Hall [Washington, D.C.], and the Daughters of of American Revolution wouldn't let her sing because she was black.  And she did it in from of the [Abraham] Lincoln Monument [Washington, D.C.].  And thousands of people came.  And I'll never for get that day.  She walked out and the first thing she sang was, "My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty."  A few days later after my career got started, they booked me into Constitution Hall and not a whisper was made.  So it was these--the arts have always been more liberal and recognized the fact that there were not boundaries where art is concerned.  And, so to answer your question about that, yes.  I was shielded a lot from the things because I was an artist and performing my art.
Story_ID: 14829
Speaker 1: I'd spoke about the thing that I'd said in my book ['William Warfield: My Music and My Life', 1991] about a charmed--and I explained what I thought.  Back when I was in the service, in military intelligence, they were going to do a production of 'Carmen Jones'.  And Billy Rose had heard about me and said, "There's somebody."  They had me come in and audition to do the role of the, the toreador, you know, the Husky Miller, they called him, and Escamillo, he was called in the opera ['Carmen'].  And I came and auditioned and they--he tried to get me actually put on what do you call it--Special Services so that I could do that on the side, and do that role.  And that happened in 1943 or so.  And then I forgot totally about it, but there was a man there who had heard me sing that audition.  And this man, years later when they were getting ready to do the show, 'Call Me Mister' said, "There is a man named William Warfield who would be wonderful for this role.  He was in the service.  But I think he's out now."  They investigated.  Found out that I was at the Eastman School of Music [Rochester, New York] and called me and asked me to come down and audition for that role, which I got, which set me into the professional line of a career.  Now isn't that--? (laughs) How do you explain that, you know, that, that happening that way?  I never actually asked for it.  It was always something that I responded to and it took place.  And that's how that happened.
Story_ID: 14830
Speaker 1: Your Town Hall [concert venue] debut [1950].  What--can you describe what that was like and all, and the aftermath after that?
Speaker 2: My Town Hall debut, I was singing in a night club in a motel in Toronto, Canada.  It was called the Club Norman.  And there was a gentleman that came in there, he was a financier with a girlfriend and he would listen to me.  And one night he invited me over to the table and said, "Monica here--that was her name--says that you evidently have been trained for something more than this.  And is that true?"  And I said, "Yes."  I said, "I'm actually in classical music and I'm doing this to make a living, but I want to have a career as a concert artist."  He said, "What would that take?"  I said, 'Well it would take a Town Hall debut in New York [New York]. That's the general thing so the critics can hear you.  And if the critics are kind to you, and say nice things, you'll get a manager and you'll--it will start you off on a career."  And he said, "Well, okay, I'll tell you what.  You have a manager that--?" Larney [Goodkind] was my manager at the time trying to get things for me.  And, he said, "Have him draw up a budget and give it to me.  Bring it back on your next--."  I was gonna be back in two weeks for a return engagement at the Club Norman.  And he looked at it and he said, "Okay.  I'm gonna sponsor you."  And it was something like $1500 then.  And he gave me $600 cash to take back to give to Larney to get started.  And then--the, the--because that's how much he had, much he had on him that night, and made sure that when I came back the next time--and that's how I got my Town Hall  debut.  Now let's me tell you something that really frightening.  This man's name was Walter Carr.  And he was a Scotch, English--Scotch-Irish decent in Canada.  As a result of my Town Hall debut, I got contracts, I got management, and even the movie ['Show Boat', 1951] followed after that.  And one of the things that I got was a contract for a full tour of Australia.  And when I went out there with the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Sidney, Australia, a young man came and listened to me all goggle-eyed.  And he was getting ready to go to England, because he wanted to have a career in, in the jazz field, and so on and so forth.  So I put him with some of the people at the Australian Broadcasting Commission.  And they listened to him, they said, "He's good."  They sent him to England and he had a great career in England as a result of meeting me, and me putting him with--and his name was Walter Carr.  Now you see what I meant by when I said, "Charm and mystic has been surrounding me all my life."
Story_ID: 14831
Speaker 1: I had actually auditioned for 'Show Boat' in the early '50s [sic, 1940s] before I made my debut [at Town Hall, New York, New York, 1950] and nothing came of it.  Actually, we did an audition in New York which was supposed to have been sent--the tape was supposed to have been sent out.  And once I got my debut and got this contract with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, I read in the paper there was a columnist named Hedda Hopper. You remember Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper?  In her column she said that the producers of 'Show Boat' had still not found the person they wanted to play Joe and sing 'Old Man River'.  Now Larney [Goodkind] was with me at the time.  And he was coming back, he said, "I'll tell you what to do."  He says, "Have the Australian Broadcasting Commission give you a studio and a technician.  You record 'Old Man River'."  So I went in and recorded 'Old Man River'--playing it for myself.  "And have them send it to Dorie Sherry.  In the meanwhile, I'm going to send a bunch of pictures and candid shots of you to Dorie Sherry personally to have him look over.  And see if he would, if Arthur Freed the Producer would be interested in having you do the role."  And, in the meanwhile, Oscar Levant was listening to somebody on the radio, Peter Herman Adler--this is a strange story--Peter Herman Adler in New York who was talking about this young black fella who had just had his debut and that you were gonna hear a lot about him, because he was really good.  Oscar Levant called Freed and said, "Listen, I just heard Peter Herman Adler talk about a guy named William Warfield.  And he's supposed to be very good."  He walked into Dorie Sherry's office that morning and Dorie Sherry said, "Look, here's a picture of some guy named Bill Warfield and a record."  He sat down--and they wired me a contract for 'Show Boat', (laughs).  Isn't that strange?
Speaker 2: That is strange.
Speaker 1: It's wild.  That, that--this is the kind of things that's happened all my life.  And I, and I can only explain it as this--that they call it a charmed.  You know.
Story_ID: 14832
Speaker 1: He was one of the people that encouraged me most.  I was--Paul Robeson sang a concert in Rochester [New York] and I was at the Eastman School of Music at the time, and I met him.  And he said to come over--it was the Sagamore Hotel then.  It was right next door, practically on East Avenue.  And I went and he had this suite.  And he--"come over and talk to me while I'm having breakfast," he said.  And I was just sitting there in awe.  And Lawrence Brown was his accompanist.  Who was a great, great--and they had done a--on the program, Lawrence Brown had joined in from the piano singing a spiritual.  And Lawrence Brown came out from his bedroom, while he was there.  And I said, "Oh, I enjoyed your singing last night."  And he said, (in high pitch voice) "I wasn't in too good a voice."  And Robeson let out this roar, (laughs) of laughter.  'Cause, you know, that he felt that his voice was good or bad, one way or the other, it was nothing like that and Robeson thought it was the funniest thing.  And he ordered a breakfast like--I think something like six slices of toast and double bacon and three eggs--And I was sitting there in absolute awe.  And he was just--and then later on, after my career got started, he was, was very, very supportive of me.  And I admired him so much, he was like an idol to me.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know what--just a follow-up question with that.  Why, why do you think Paul Robeson--what do you think made him special?
Speaker 1: I think Paul Robeson was special because he--of the vision that he had of brotherhood and mankind.  And they took all of that, and reversed it around and made it, made brotherhood sound like a dirty word.  Because that's what the Russians were calling it.  And when you called--for the people, and he was for the people.  Sincerely meaning people and equality and brotherhood and all of that sort of thing.  And they tried to make him synonymous with the Russian's communism.  That was a communistic view.  And as you know, what, what [Senator Joseph] McCarthy did with all of that.  And all of those witch hunts, and the fights and so on and so forth.  But, so far as anybody knows, Robeson never was a Communist [political party] as such, you know, carrying a communist card.  And many of us feel that the Russians really, embraced him because he was a big figure, and because he was a using this language.  But whether he actually believed that, that communism itself was the solution, I, I cannot say.  And I don't thing that he was a communist as such.  He was truly a man who had vision for the equality of man, the brotherhood of man, and, and the injustices not being.  For instance, he was the one that premiered the, the--there was a--(sings) "In '76 [1976] the sky--" 'The Ballad for Americans'.  I remember hearing him do that as a youngster, and I've done it.  And when we did a concert at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], in his year, I performed that too with a group of our students, 'The Ballad for Americans', which he was famous for.  He also went through several changes and was responsible for several changes in the words of 'Old Man River'.  The one we used in the verse--for instance in the movie ['Show Boat', 1951], he was responsible for having [Oscar] Hammerstein change that.  It said, "There was an old man called the Mississippi; That's an old man I would like to be.  What if he care if the world's got troubles; What does he care if the lands ain't free."  Do you know what the original words was?  "Niggers all work on the Mississippi.  Niggers work while the white folks play."  Then, "Take me away from the Mississippi, take me away from the white man boss," and all that.  So those were the original words for that verse that started 'Old Man River'.  And then they changed it to, "Colored folks work on the Mississippi," And then they changed it to, "Here we all work on the Mississippi."  And Paul Robeson went a step further and it became his--actually his protest song.  He turned a song around that had the word "Nigger" in it to make it his protest song.  And it was this.  "There's an old man called the Mississippi.  There's an old man I don't want to be.  What does he care if the world's got troubles.  What does he care if the lands ain't free."  And then it--when words say, "You and me we sweat and strain.  Body all aching and racked with pain.  Tote the barge.  Lift that bail.  Get a little drunk and you land in jail."  He said, "Get a little gump and you land in jail."  And then at the end where it says, but--where it--I forgotten to remember the words--the original words. (pauses) He instead of--Oh my goodness!  I know them as well as I know my own--"But I gets weary and sick of trying.  I'm tired of living and scared of dying."  He said, "But I keeps laughin' instead of crying; And I keep fighting until I'm dying, while Old Man River rolls along."  That's what Robeson did for 'Old Man River'.  And I'm pleased to say that in the recent revival that [Harold S.] Hal Prince did of it, they did the original text in the beginning.  But at the very end--the reprise at the end of the show, they used the Robeson words.  And I'm--it speaks of what an influence Robeson has been on us.

Speaker 1: Marian Anderson, what, what were your views on--I mean she's viewed as sort of angelic and sort of--.
Speaker 2: I knew Marian Anderson--I met Marian Anderson the same way--and Dorothy Maynor and Roland Hayes.  They were all friends--idols of mine.  And when I first met Dorothy Maynor, she came and sang a concert and I went back and I met her.  And, I had a picture of her that I had gotten from someone at the Eastman School [of Music Rochester, New York].  And I asked her would she autograph this picture.  And she--when I took it and walked away, she had written, "To a colleague,"  and signed it.  And I just--my God, I was just like walking on air.  She called me a colleague (laughs), you know.  And then later on, I was privileged to get to know her later on, of course, when she was in New York with [Rev.] Dr. Shelby [Rooks] at the [St. James Presbyterian] Church and the founding of the Harlem School of The Arts [New York, New York].  And I got to know her very well during New York, and then the founding days of the Harlem School of the Arts.  And now, you know Betty Allen is, is doing--is the director of the school now.
Story_ID: 14834
Speaker 1: Now Roland Hayes also, after I had my debut, I got to know him pretty well.  But Paul Robeson I got to know better than Roland Hayes-- than I did Roland Hayes.  And, and, he was very complimentary to me. When I did the, Hallmark [Cards, Inc.] Hall of Fame's '[The] Green Pastures' [television program, 1957], and he and Leontyne [Price] were at friends of ours' home in San Francisco [California].  And he sat and watched me do this whole thing.  And at a certain point he turned to Leontyne and said, "That man can act."  And I consider this the greatest compliment (laughs) I ever got in my life.  And it wasn't said to me, it was said to Leontyne while he was watching the show.  Isn't that sweet?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well 'Green Pastures' was great.  I remember the first time I saw it.  I was so amazed that there were all this black cast--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.  I know. (laughs)
Speaker 2: Well anyway, you were great at that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And Butterfly McQueen.
Speaker 2: Butterfly McQueen.
Speaker 1: Oh Butterfly McQueen, I just--she was the one that was the angel that was testing the Lord--that wanted the Lord to, to (speaks line from play) "Why don't you go up to his office--."  And in the rehearsals and in the filming, I would, like out the corner of my eye she would go out to the door and she did something very strange.  But I couldn't turn to look to see what it was. (laughs) So, at once I could--"Butterfly, what, what do you do when you leave?"  I said, "I see out of the corner of my eyes when you go out of the office after you asked me to (unclear) it up, and you do something.  What do you--?"  She says, (speaks in high voice) "Well, we's angels ain't we?"  I said, "Yes."  "Well I's flying away!" (laughs) She was flying away.  She would jump off and fly away off the platform.  That, that was typical Butterfly McQueen, you know.
Speaker 2: You know, what's amazing is her voice.  I had interviewed her (unclear)--,
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I couldn't believe it.
Speaker 1: I know.  But nobody still remembers, (speaks in high voice) "I don't know nothing about birthin' no babies!" (laughs) in 'Gone with the Wind' [motion picture, 1939].
Story_ID: 14835
Speaker 1: Marian Anderson came to Rochester [New York], did a concert, and I went back stage and met her and told her that I wanted to be a singer.  And then she came back later on and I was at the Eastman School [of Music Rochester, New York].  And she came over and listened to me and some students.  And, and encouraged me.  She said, "Do one thing--," she said to me, she said, "Exhaust everything you can in learning.  Because once you get to New York [New York], and you get started, the more you know, the better you're gonna have a chance to have a--." (coughs) She said, "The more you know, the better you're going to have a chance to have a successful career."  That was before the service.  And I kept in touch with Marian Anderson during the time.  And when I was getting ready to come out, get discharged, I asked her again.  I said, "Do you think I should come to New York now, or go back and get my degree?"  She says, "Go back and get your Master's degree.  You can't be too well-armed when you get to New York, because there's talent, talent, talent.  And more you know, the better you're going to have a chance."  So I went back, so I went back.  And sure enough, I was asked to come an audition.  As I said before, for 'Call Me Mister' and that started it all off.
Speaker 2: But Marian Anderson was my, my advisor and I remember when we did 'Porgy and Bess'--Leontyne [Price] and I were married just before we went.  And Marian Anderson and Franz Rupp [accompanist] were in London, and we all had dinner together at one time.  And Marian Anderson turned to Leontyne and she said to Leontyne, she says, "Don't let them overuse you my dear.  You have everything that's necessary to make a fabulous career.  Don't let them push you."  And Leontyne took that advice and Leontyne is seventy [years old] today and still singing like a young lady, because she remembered what Marian Anderson said, "Don't let them exploit you."  And she had that in her mind all of her career.  And she decided, "Well, if I'm gonna do the Met [Metropolitan Opera, New York, New York] this year, I'm not gonna do Covent Garden [London, England].  If I'm gonna do Covent Garden, I'm not gonna do [Teatro alla] Scala [Milan, Italy].  And it was that--she let those words, and today Leontyne sings beautifully and she's in her seventies.  And that's--both of us were advised by Marian Anderson.
Story_ID: 14836
Speaker 1: I remember for instance [opera singer] Roland Hayes came to Rochester [New York] for the first time--the first time I heard him when he came to [Eastman School of Music] Rochester.  And he never--he stayed at the homes of people that he knew--and these were relatives of the Eastmans, I mean, and he always stayed at their home.  And there was a lady there who had named her grandson after him.  And she took little Roland Hayes, little Roland Hayes to Mrs. Eastm-, to the home and knocked on the door, and said that she wanted to have her grandson who named after Roland Hayes meet, meet him.  And she explained to her, "Mr. Hayes"--it was the day of his concert--"Mr. Hayes is taking his afternoon nap.  But if you give me your name and address, and I will tell him about it."  And she did.  And sure enough, at 6:00 that evening, this big limousine rolled up into the, the ghetto area where we were and out stepped Roland Hayes, went in this home and asked for this lady and met the young man that was named after him.  And I said, "My gosh.  I, I just--."  That made him even more precious in my eyesight.  I was at his concert, I remember.  And he started to sing a little song called, 'Have You Seen But a White Lily Grow'.  And, I started to cry--cried through the whole concert.  And then when I met him afterwards and he was so kind to me, and just the fact that I was interested in becoming a singer.  Of course, that I was a black man and he knew what the problems were going to be, because he had talked about his--he was the trailblazer for black singing, German lieder and French chanson and things like that.  And--because he really opened those, those areas up even for [Paul] Robeson and for Marian Anderson.  And when I'd heard Marian Anderson sing--and she sang the [Franz] Schubert 'Ave Maria', of course in German--and I, I just never heard anything in my life that was that beautiful.  And because of that, you know, I've sung it many, many, many times myself since then.  But I never, ever programmed 'Ave Maria' on a program that I was to sing, because I just--I could not fancy myself putting something on a program that Marian Anderson sang like that. (laughs) I was asked to do it.  As a matter of fact, I had a tremendous experience in this same nightclub [Club Norman].  In, Montr-, in, in Toronto [Canada].  I was there over a Christmas period of time.  And I was singing in--my, my act and somebody said, "Sing 'Ave Maria'."  It was Christmastime and I said, "Oh, no, no, no."  Then several other people said, "Sing 'Ave Maria'.  Sing 'Ave Maria'."  And so I said, "Well I'll tell you--" I said, "I'm not used to doing this kind of music in this setting."  I said, "It's Christmas and I'm very serious about how I feel about my religion and the Virgin Mary and Jesus."  I said, "If you promise me that you will not take one drink, or eat one mouth of food and if every waiter will stand still, I'll sing over--I'll sing 'Ave Maria' for you."  They all clapped and I started singing 'Ave Maria'.  It was in a nightclub in Montreal--in, Toronto. I don't know why I keep saying Montreal.  And I sang two verses of it in Latin.  And when I ended, I got an ovation like I had never had in a nightclub.  So, I thought you might like to know that.

Speaker 1: When I was a teenager, I was playing piano and stuff, and somebody who had a night act, group in a nightclub in Rochester [New York] said, "Oh would you join us?  you could--we'll teach you how to play jazz."  Now jazz was a no-no in our house.  We couldn't bring a jazz record in with the--you know, back in those days, the people thought that jazz was evil.  That, that was the work of the devil, (laughs) you know.  And so my father [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] said, "No, no son of mine is gonna sing in a nightclub.  That's the den of iniquity."  The, the whole bit.  The whole thing.  And it was very ironic that years later, I should meet somebody in a nightclub who would sponsor or be the one responsible for my classical career. (laughs) And this thing goes back to that charm again, remember?  And it's like, how does this all happen, you know?
Story_ID: 14838
Speaker 1: I'm sure Hollywood's [Los Angeles, California] got---you know, had a big allure, you know--.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I got out there on the set [of 'Show Boat', motion picture, 1951], and of course I was star struck just like anybody else.  'Cause this is my first thing--Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, Joe E. Brown, Agnes Moorehead.  And it was just--and I was all agog, you know, with the whole thing.  But, so I got out there.  Now the procedure, you know, having to do with any musical you have to record the whole thing beforehand with a full orchestra and all of that.  And it's a sound studio, and which we did.  And they set up all of the mics [microphones] and--on the various instruments and me and everything.  And we had rehearsed it with the orchestra.  They said, "Well let's see what we got for a take."  So they played this--we, we went through it once and there was a dead silence.  And all of a sudden a huge sound (excitedly) "It's a take!  It's a take!"  The first time we did it was it.  And they were so absolutely amazed, because see we never had done this before.  Usually we have to do two or three takes.  And then two or three recordings, and then the engineer puts together to make the tape.  That's, that's common procedure.  And they called Louis Mayer.  Louis Mayer--everything stopped.  Louis Mayer came down and they had played it.  And I didn't know what, what (unclear).  I didn't know I was not supposed to do it right the first time, (laughs) you know.  It was not a matter of doing it right, it was a matter of so many things going into it, having to do with the balance of the orchestra, the different microphones set for different instruments.  And it all dovetailed into one take and that was it.  And he listened to it and tears came in his eyes.  And I teased him, I teased him later on when we were talking about--and then somebody said, "I hear Louis Mayer had tears in his eyes when he listened to the recording."  I said, "Yes.  But I'm not so sure whether he was so moved by the recording, or whether he was just so happy that I saved him all that money." (laughs) And later on he comes and says, he said,  "That's alright Bill, you could say that." (laughs)
Speaker 1: So how was that whole experience?  You know
Speaker 2: --.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That whole experience was just fabulous for me.  I remember the first time we, we were working the veterans especially--Ava Gardner and Howard and other people, they just sort of, you know, "Now this is what we're doing now."  And then they hollered, "Two shot! Two shot!"  And so I asked Ava, I said, "What's that?"  And she said, "Honey, that's means that on that great big wide screen, there's gonna be nobody's face but yours and mine." (laughs) "They like you," she said.  I said, "Oh great." (laughs) And sure enough, there is.  Ava Gardner and me, just our two faces--a two, a two tape record.  And then in the--I was never so, so amazed at how anybody could take all of these various shots and then go in a room and edit it and put it all together.  And come out.  Anyway it would--to me it would just--I, I was so absolutely awed by the technique of what movie making was all about.  And how it was edited and got together and all of that.
Story_ID: 14839
Speaker 1: Let me tell you one other little thing though. On the set [of 'Show Boat', motion picture, 1951] when I got there, these people--everybody would ask me about Australia and about the platypuses and about the koala bears, the kangaroos and things.  And I would tell them all about them and so on and so forth.  And then all of a sudden I realized that they thought that I was an Aborigine that they had brought in (laughs) from Australia.  And they were totally interested in what an Aborigine was like.  And when I told them, "Oh no.  I was born in Mississippi."  I think they were all (laughs) so disappointed.  They said, "Oh! You were born here.  We thought you were an Aborigines." (laughs)
Speaker 2: And you were exotic. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Yeah. 'Cause the word had gotten around that they had brought this guy in from Australia.  'Cause I came directly from my Australia tour to the set.
Story_ID: 14840
Speaker 1: Would you have preferred being in Los Angeles [California] and making more movies?  If the opportunity was there?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't like--I don't know if I would say I would have preferred, but I actually did go back to make a movie that never got made.  I was to be in the movie with Danny Kaye and Gene--. (pauses) Oh, Lord.  The, the musical version of 'Huckleberry Finn'.  And, and it was some schedules--difficulties with Danny Kaye.  Because he was supposed to make a movie for I think [David O.] Selznick or somebody and the time ran out, and they had to scrap the idea--Gene Kelly and Danny Kaye were supposed to be--and I was gonna be Jim.  And we--I was actually paid for a movie that I never did.  I got paid for it and was out there rehearsing and everything.  The, the movie never came off.  And then I never got a chance to go back to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] to do any other movie, but my first preference was the concert stage and that, that milieu.  And I don't think I would have preferred just going out and doing movies alone.  Everything that came to me, came as a result of being versatile in several different kinds of things.  And I wouldn't have liked to just gone out and did only movies.  No.
Story_ID: 14841
Speaker 1: 'Show Boat' [motion picture] came out in '51 [1951].  And I did 'Porgy and Bess' [stage production] in 1952.  And that was the production that the [U.S.] State Department sent to Europe.  And that was the first time, black--all-black production had been sent to Europe.  And we went from--we were sent to Vienna [Austria] and Berlin [Germany] by the State Department as a part of the cultural exchange program that was very big during that time.  And at first--before we went to Europe, there was a great deal of concern and criticism from, especially from some of the, the, the black people about sending a thing like 'Porgy and Bess' to Europe, because it had all of the cliches, the, the crap-shooting, the killing and all that.  And they thought that that, the Russians were gonna have a field day in publicity.  Talking about, "See we told you that's the way they are over there."  And so on and so forth.  When we got there and we opened, and it was the absolute opposite.  The Russian press praised it and cited us all as examples of the ones that were, "Lucky enough to be able to get a career and be able to sing like that."  And, and, we were just, we were just pleased at the, at the reaction to the Russian press.  Well of course, naturally, these people they're are the exception of what really goes on in the United States. (laughs)  And they thought of us as artists doing it for--and this is not unusual.  Because I don't think any European would, would judge an opera, or worth of an opera by it's libretto.  If you did that, half of the things that were done, couldn't be done (laughs), because they were about bad things that were happening to rulers and people and you name it, you know.  So they just thought of that as a libretto about something.  And we were the artists that were performing, you know.
Speaker 2: Now this--'Porgy and Bess' brought you and Leontyne Price together.
Speaker 1: And Cab Calloway.
Speaker 2: And Cab Calloway.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's right, that's right.  So what was, what was Cab Calloway like?
Speaker 1: Oh, Cab was wonderful.  He was, he was a very, very down-to-earth person.  But when he got on stage, he was like "Boom!"  It was electric.  And, you know, actually he was the prototype of what [George] Gershwin wanted when he wrote the role.  He wanted a Cab Calloway type thing.  But of course, Cab was so famous, then he couldn't stop what he was doing and come and be 'Sportin' Life' in our shows.  But, but Cab I think was around fifty [years old] when, when he did it with us, yeah.  And he'd stopped doing a lot of the strenuous things in his career.  But he was a magnificent Sportin' Life.  And had the voice to do it too.  He had a big sound and could sing high, and, and--see a lot of the Sportin' Life tends to (unclear) pretty high.
Story_ID: 14842
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with Leontyne Price and, and--you know, how you came to meet and--.
Speaker 2: I--my first hearing about Leontyne was through the producers of 'Porgy and Bess's' Blevins Davis and, and Robert Breen.  And they said that they were thinking of using a young lady who was still at Julliard [School, New York, New York] and she was finishing her Master's degree and she was singing Mistress Ford in the 'Falstaff' production [Giuseppe Verdi opera], up at Julliard.  And they said, "We'd like you to go up there with us and listen to her and see what--give an opinion."  So I went and I was just totally floored by Leontyne and what she sounded like, we went backstage and we met.  And then, of course, subsequently they hired her to be one of the Besses. There was--I was--there was about three different sets of Porgys and Besses in it, and we were the main set.  And, so we really fell in love with each other and got married in the fall [of 1952].  Before we went to Europe, we met in the spring and married in the fall and then went to Europe as man and wife.  As a matter of fact, one of the Viennese [Austrian] magazines wrote an article on us.  And they called it "flitterwochen" (speaks in German) in Wien, which means "honeymoon" in Vienna. (laughs) And they wrote an article about our coming there as man and wife. There afterwards, Columbia Artists [Management, Inc.] was interested in having Leontyne and me be a team, concert team and so on and so forth.  And I and Leontyne realized, "No."  She was--if anybody was going to really become a great opera diva, it would have been Leontyne,  and we knew this from the beginning.  And we said, "Well, no.  We will not be billed as a two-person thing.  Leontyne is really opera material.  And that's what she should pursue."  And she also went to Larney [Goodkind].  And Larney started getting her in things.
Story_ID: 14843
Speaker 1: At the time we got married [1952], and after--when she was sent--Leontyne [Price] finished 'Porgy and Bess' and came back to New York [New York], and we wouldn't allow them to bill us as a team.  Because that was a time in which the light was opening up and blacks--the female blacks were about to get into opera.  And we--she and several other people, youngsters that were on the scene at the time, were really operatic material.  And we thought--we talked about it and we thought that she should go for broke and see what could happen with opera with her.  And, and she had the voice for it and the temperament for it, she could act and all of that.  And there were several other youngsters coming along at the time.  Two black young ladies of course, a little later on, Grace Bumbry came out and became the Venus [in Richard Wagner's opera, 'Tannhäuser'] in, in Covent Garden [London, England], and started her operatic career.  And as you know, once [Rudolf] Bing opened it up, he used Marian Anderson to do the role of Ulrica [in Giuseppe Verdi's opera, 'Un Ballo in Maschera'].  Because he wanted her who had been not able to have a career in opera, to be the first black to sing at the Metropolitan [Opera, New York, New York] in a full-fledged opera as such.  But to get back to Leontyne,  she--Peter Herman Adler had used her in doing 'Tosca' on the NBC [National Broadcasting Company] Opera.  And he had--she had been asked to go to the Metropolitan fully a couple of years before she went, but Peter Herman Adler said "No, Leontyne--," (with German accent) he says, "--go to Europe, sing.  Make your career in opera in, in Europe.  Learn four or five roles and perform them.  And when you go to the Metropolitan, go as a grand lady of opera and not as 'Aida'."  And she followed his--and when she--you know she did Leonora [in Verdi's opera, 'Il Trovatore'], that was her opera.  She only did [Verdi's opera] 'Aida' afterwards.  And sure enough, this was great advice for her.  Because when she did in the '30s [sic, 1960s] make her debut there, she did Leonora and just was a tremendous success.  Now, but having to do with our marriage, that was practically the success and the, the, the demands, was practically a death note for our marriage being a marriage as such.  We, we saw each other so seldom and it was just--we just drifted apart so far as being, being intimate or close together.  And so finally, at a certain point, we decided that it would be better if we were legally separated.  Which we did in 1958. However, we never got actually divorced until the '70s [1970s], and you know why?  Well, her mother [Kate Baker Price] and father [James Anthony Price] and my mother [Bertha McCamery Warfield] and father [Robert E. Warfield, Sr.] always felt that this separation was a passing fantasy, that we both would come to our senses and go back together again.  And especially her mother.  And, and her mother was so adamant with it--"When you--Now you got all this going--When you and Bill gonna get back together?  When you and Bill gonna get back together?"  And she--we decided when the last of our parents died was her mother.  And she called, she said, "Bill I really should be master of my house.  Because  for tax purposes, I am paying a lot and I need a legal divorce."  And I said, "Go ahead.  Sure."  And it was only after the last parent died that we officially divorced, because we didn't want to disappoint our parents.
Story_ID: 14844
Speaker 1: When I propo-, well you know when I was in--Leontyne [Price] and I were in Chicago [Illinois] together, doing the 'Porgy and Bess' at the Civic Opera, you know where Lyric Opera--and this was in 1952.  And I went to a jewelry store in the 'Miracle Mile' [sic, 'Magnificent Mile'] you call it up here on Michigan Avenue and bought this diamond ring.  And it's a surprise.  We're sitting at dinner with people and I reached under and put this ring, tried to put this ring on her finger and dropped it.  And my manager, Larney Goodkind was there, and he knew I was gonna--and there all four of us--no it was about four of us at the table were down under the table.  And the waiters and everything were looking, looking for this diamond ring (laughs) that I had dropped on the floor, which I retrieved.  And then I put it on her finger and she grinned from ear to ear--no she didn't grin, she just howled. (laughs) "Well this is a unique way for a lady to (laughs) to receive an engagement ring. Somebody crawling on the floor to find it."  But that's what actually happened.
Speaker 2: And are you still friends today?
Speaker 1: Oh yes. Very much so, I mean, through thick and thin. And we call, we keep in touch with each other.  And I call, she calls, and at Christmastime particularly, we, we exchange, greetings with the family.  Her, her--one, one of her nephews is named after me as a matter of fact.  Yeah William.  And I will be talking to her at Christmastime.  She would be with her family and her brother, who is now her manager, and his children down in--out in Maryland, off--you know, outside of Washington, D.C.  She always spends Christmas with them as I spend Christmas with my family in Rochester [New York].
Speaker 2: Do you think--(pauses)--Do you think that artists, I mean a true artist like yourself (pauses) can have true relationships, or really--?  You know, often it's been said that you are married to your art form.
Speaker 1: I don't know. There have been well-known couples who have been man and wife and successful at it. And mostly there have been couples who have combined their talents and gone together as a team.  Or if, if you have a successful personal relationship, it's generally with someone who is--sights like the person behind you, helping you and pushing you along while you are out doing the big thing.  It's very rare for two people to have totally different careers and go each their way and still maintain a marriage, a relationship I think.  If, if, for instance if she had wanted to stay home and just piddle in music and then help me with mine, my career, that probably would work.  Or if I had wanted to just piddle in music and help her with hers, or be the prince consort to the queen, if you might put it, It might have worked.  But we had both big careers going together and we had no alternative except to follow our call.  And then--which we did and that unfortunately kept us apart most of the time.
Story_ID: 14845
Speaker 1: After I left 'Porgy and Bess' and Leontyne [Price] in Europe doing it, there was a period there in which there was the first big separation.  And I, I never got a chance to be with her or she with me 'cause I was in this country concertizing and she was with 'Porgy and Bess'.  And then when she came back, the whole thing--she was there for a while and played at the Ziegfeld Theatre for a few months. Then she took off and was on the road with 'Porgy and Bess', and I took off doing something else.  And I don't know whether you would call it a down period.  But it was a period in which certainly we were not together as man and wife.  It was--it just, just didn't exist.  And--but we were both up, up like crazy in our careers.  That's, that's, that's what it was.
Speaker 2: Well, has there been ever a down period in your life?
Speaker 1: If you, you ask me whether there's been a down period in my life, there have been points in my life in which I felt that I went through a thing in the oh, late '50s [1950s] in which--actually my voice sunk into a lower category.  And as a result of that, technically I was not doing as well as I could have.  And I needed to learn--relearn how to handle the lower voice.  And I went to work in the summers with a very famous prima donna named Rosa Ponselle, and the first thing that I did when she listened to me and she said, "Ah-ha!"  She says, "You know what you've been doing?"  She said, "You have been singing so much song literature that you've, you've  brought all of your voice up into here and you're singing this way."  She said, "Just stand in the middle of the floor and say, "Mi-a-mama!  Mi-a-Mama!" with your, with your body--"Mi-a-mama!"  She says, "Now just turn all of that--you sing with your body and the sound comes out of here, but its your whole body that's singing."  And she worked with me on this concept.  And by the end of that summer, I had conquered a great deal of the technical things that I had gotten into doing.  And the top had opened up beautifully and everything.  And I had not, not had any slumps vocally since then.  And that was in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Now how was the traveling on the road?  What was that like?  And what--you know, what, what was that whole experience of being--you know, I mean you had made a--you had made a commitment as a career as a concert singer, singer so that required a lot of traveling and (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Traveling and the commitment that you make as a, as a concert performer is something that fits me like a glove. I love going places.  I, I, love meeting new, new, new friends.  I love all kinds of cuisine.  And as a matter of fact--but to be perfectly frank with you, when I'm out for a while eating steaks and caviar and all of that stuff, the first thing I do when I get home is put me on a pot of greens and make some cornbread. (laughs) But, but, traveling--and I've gotten, it's gotten to the place now that I have some friends all over and in Europe.  And I just enjoy just--I don't enjoy flying per se, it doesn't bother me.  But I mean flying too high in the sky, it doesn't thrill me particularly just to fly.  But going some place and being with friends, and especially if I've not seen them for a while, and, and just as we say in the Baptist church, fellowshipping. (laughs)
Story_ID: 14846
Speaker 1: What would you describe as the high point of your career?  Would you say, your Town Hall [concert venue, New York, New York] debut?  Would you say your Carnegie Hall debut?  Would you say--you know, would you say a variety of things?  And I would say why?
Speaker 2: I'm always asked what I would consider the big thing in my career or the crowning point, and I really can't answer that with one answer.  Certainly, my Town Hall debut [in 1950].  And when I first did--saw myself in the movies ['Show Boat', 1951] sitting in a, in a, in the mezza-, or the loge of a Loews [Cineplex Theatres, Inc.] theater in New York City, and saw myself on the screen.  That was indescribable.  I can't--to this day I cannot tell you what looking at myself--I knew it was me and, and then the voice came out.  And then when people started to applaud at the end of 'Old Man River', in a movie and they didn't even know me, you know.  I sat there and I just started to cry.  It was just--I can't explain what that was.  I just, just started to cry.  It was--I couldn't believe it, you know.  Certainly, my debut in Europe was, the first time I did 'Porgy and Bess'.  I had a great thrill out of doing De Lawd in '[The] Green Pastures' on TV [in 1957].  And then if you ask me about individual concerts, I can't tell you, because there were times that a concert could be in a little, small town some place.  But for some reason or other, I felt like singing, and it felt--and that experience of being fulfilled--it does--it--you feel good when you're singing.  But there's sometimes you finish something and you feel, (sighs) I've said it all, you know.  And I can't tell you when, when--that's happened with me in several cases.  But I don't remember where it happened, you know. Certainly--then one of the great thrills that happened to me that I'll never forget was when I started to teach, and I was teaching kids at the University of Illinois down in [Urbana] Champaign.  And I went to the first recital of a student of mine.  And sat there, and listened, and saw this student give back to me seeds that I'd planted that had become full blown into beautiful--like a beautiful flower.  I sat there and that feeling made me go, "Ah-ha!  That's what I'm here for.  Not to just sing and receive the accolades of a crowd.  But to give this to someone and have them take it on and do something with it, from what they've learned from me." Now that is one of the greatest thrills. Any teacher will tell you that.
Story_ID: 14847
Speaker 1: So in, in your teaching experience, because you wanted to be a teacher, what has that meant?  That sort of coming full circle, and, you know? what--because in a way, you start--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, you sort start there and you come back there.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.  That's, that's, that's very interesting.  That I've really started out and that's wanting to be a teacher.  As a matter of fact I remember when, when I was a kid and people would come to visit our family.  And Mrs. Jones's daughter was coming, (whispers) "And she's a teacher, you know."  I thought, "Oh, my goodness!  that's, that's good."  Teaching, you know.  To be--have that title.  And the first time somebody called me 'Professor', I looked at them--"Professor Warfield."  "Me?  Professor?" (laughs) You know, the aura of what teaching meant to me was always there.  And then, as fate would have it, and this charm we talked about, I came full circle around and got both, teaching and performing.  And I can't tell you which I enjoy the more.
Speaker 1: What, what seems to surprise you about teaching?  What lessons have you learned?  I mean, life is a series of sort of lessons.
Speaker 2: What, what teaching taught me was that I could learn a lot from teaching students that helped me in my actual performance.  I would find, for instance, I would work with a student on something, and then I found that when I would go back and sing something that I may have worked with on a student, it had added proportions.  It had added meaning, because I had, I had taken it apart and worked with a youngster to help him to find a way of expressing it.  And that's the one big thing that teaching taught me that I was a learner from it.  As a matter of fact, I had--it also taught me what mistakes I made.  I had a habit of standing in front of my big bay window at, at my studio, and listening to students sing.  And then I would--if they said something wrong, I'd say, "Oh, wait a minute, you made a wrong note there!"  Then I'd come and I'd look at the paper.  And I did this one day, and I looked at it.  And my student was absolutely right.  I had been singing that note wrong (laughs) all my career.  And I looked at it and I couldn't (laughs) believe it.  So, well, you know what happened the next time, I, I would saunter around to the piano and look first, and say, "Wait a minute, this note--." (laughs) Maybe that's one of those things--that's what I meant by teaching teaches you a lot, too.  And I couldn't have--How did I learn that that way?"  You know.  So we're all human.
Story_ID: 14848
Speaker 1: January 22 [2000] will be my eightieth birthday, and Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] here is putting on a big thing in my honor.  And my city, Rochester [New York] and the Eastman [School of Music, Rochester, New York] are putting on a big thing on the [January] 26th.  So, I hope I get time to keep--get all my teaching in (laughs) with all these things happening to me.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  What--how would you, you're--for, for someone who has still a lot of grace and style, and that's how I would sort of describe you.  What gives you a constant--still a constant passion for life?
Speaker 1: You know, if you ask me what makes things still for me vibrant and still constantly alive I would say--I would go back to something that I said earlier.  It's the nature of music itself.  There is always something happening new, musically.  And if you have any kind of inquiring mind, musically, you relate to it.  For instance, just recently I did an evening in which we honored Duke Ellington, this being his 100th birth year.  And sang things from the sacred service, and then in the secular part, they sang, they sang popular music of his, like (sings) "Missed the Saturday dance. Heard they crowded the floor." [from 'Don't Get Around Much Anymore']  And all--and I'm into a whole thing of doing many things that the strictly classical career did not allow me to do.  And just the fact that it is something that I've not been doing for eighty years (laughs), makes it vibrant, makes it more exciting to me.  And, of course, after I won the [Recording Academy] Grammy [Award] for the 'Lincoln Portrait' [by Aaron Copland], I've had all sorts of calls to do narrations and things, which I do a great deal.  And then added to that, I have added doing poetry of black composers.  I do James Weldon Johnson sermons that, that--the one's that they call, you know, 'The Trombones to Glory'.  And I also do a lot of Paul Laurence Dunbar, which goes back to my hearing people doing it in church musicals when I was a boy. And adding things like that to the already existing classical repertoire, plus adding things in the classical repertoire that is different and new, is what keeps the vibrancy, I think, and the interest still going.  Even though I've been doing it all this time.
Story_ID: 14849
Speaker 1: I've added to a lot of readings of poems, and one is Paul Laurence Dunbar.  I use to hear, hear the ladies that would give Sunday afternoon musicals and they'd always sing--sing like 'When Malindy Sings', and "Lias, Lias" [from Dunbar's 'In the Morning'] and things like that.  Would you hand me those glasses over there?  But Paul Laurence Dunbar, Paul Laurence Dunbar was a--I always thought was somebody that just wrote in, in, in Southern dialect.  But he was a Midwesterner, actually.  And he wrote in other things too.  And there's one--being a singer--I get a kick out of reading.  It's called 'Deacon Jones' Grievance'.  And it says, "I been watchin' [of] 'em Parson, An' I'm sorry fur to say, 'At my mind is not contented, With the loose an' keerless way, 'At the young folks treat the music; T'ain't the proper sort o' choir. Then I don't believe in Christuns, A-singin' hymns for hire.  But I never would 'a' murmured, An' the matter might 'a' gone, Ef it wasn't fur the antics, ['At] I've seen 'em kerry on; So I thought it was my dooty, Fur to come to you an' ask, Ef you wouldn't sort o' gently, Take them singin' folks to task. Fust, the music they've be'n singin', Will disgrace us mighty soon; It's a cross between a opry, An' a ol' cotillion tune.  With its dashes an' its quavers, An' its hifalutin style-- Why, it sets my head to swimmin' When I come walkin' down the aisle.  Now it might be almost decent, Ef it wasn't fur the way, 'At they git up there an' sing it, Hum dum diddle, loose and gay.  Why, it shames the name of sacred, in its brazen worldliness,  An' they've even got "Ol' Hundred", In a bold, new-fangled dress.  You'll excuse me Mr. Parson, Ef I seem a little sore.  But I've sung the songs of Isr'el, For threescore years an' more, An' it sort o' hurts my feelin's, Fur to see 'em put away, Fur these harum, darum [sic, scarum] ditties, 'At is capturin' the day.  There's anuther little happ'nin', 'At I'll mention while I'm here,  Jes' to show 'at my objections, All is offered sound and clear.  It was one day they was singin', An' was doin' well enough--, Singin' good as people could sing, Sich an awful mess o' stuff--." (turns page) Oh no!  Hold--pause a minute.
Speaker 2: (Tape skips).
Speaker 1: And then, then continue on.  I'll repeat. "There's anuther little happ'nin', 'At I'll mention while I'm here,  Jes' to show 'at my objections, All is offered sound and clear.  It was one day they was singin', An' was doin' well enough--, Singin' good as people could sing, Sich an awful mess o' stuff--,  When the choir give a holler, An' the organ give a groan, An' they left one weak-voiced feller, A-singin' there all alone!  But he stuck right to the music, Tho' 't was tryin' as could be; An' when I tried to help him, [Why] the hull church scowled at me.  You say that's so-low singin', Well, I pray the Lord that I, Growed up when folks was willin', To sing their hymns so high.  Well, we never had sich doin's, In the good ol' Bethel days, When the folks was all contented, With the simple songs of praise.  Now I may have spoken too open, But 't was too hard to keep still, An' I hope you'll tell the singers, 'At I bear 'em no ill-will.  'At they all may git to glory, Is my wish an' my desire, But they'll need some extry trainin', 'Fore they jine the heavenly choir." (laughs)

Speaker 1: If I were to have advice to young people who wanted to get into music, my big advice that I always say is, "Don't have halters on your eyes.  You have to have a tremendous amount of peripheral vision.  You can't just look at one thing and go ahead with that.  You must learn if you want to be a singer, you ought to know all about orchestral works, string quartets.  You must know about the poets.  You must know about the great painters who inspired music.  All of these things tend to broaden you and make you the well developed artist that you're gonna become.  And unless you are aware of all these things, mindful of it, investigate.  Be absolutely, unquestionably curious about everything that you see in life.  Anything that has to do with art.  Because when you stand up on stage, and open your mouth to sing, you are going to be the sum total of everything you've ever learned, every experience you've ever had, and every feeling that you felt.  And if you don't know how then to project what you think about a song, all of that background goes into just the singing of one little song, and makes your interpretation different from the next guy."
Story_ID: 14851
Speaker 1: Travel is important if you are going to be a performing artist.  Because in traveling, you learn an awful lot about what, what the world is about.  And what human beings are about, and what the differences may be--ethnic differences and the--and you come to (pauses) a philosophy of accepting that, that you don't understand many times.  And that, that becomes very important in the learning process.  Acceptance--you have to accept something to learn, learn about it.  You not willing to accept, "Okay, this exists, now what is it all about?"  Then you learn.  And, to me, travel does that.  It puts you in a scene in which you have to be aware of what's going on around you.  And that's the--travel makes it wonderful, because it's always different scenes.  If you just go from here to Washington [D.C.] and back all your life, that wouldn't help.  But to go different places, see different people, experience different foods, listen to different complaints even, that people are making where they are.  It all helps you, you to understand what the world is about.

Speaker 1: What does it mean to be an artist?  What is--What, what is actually being an artist?
Speaker 2: If you ask me what it means to me to be an artist, I can't answer that question in a certain sense, because deep down inside of me, I don't think of myself as being an artist. That is a title that somebody has put to me when they heard me or seen me do the thing that I do.  And when I sing, singing is for me a fulfillment.  It's not being an artist. (laughs) And so it's hard for me to say what it feels like to be an artist. Because somebody could, could, could--I don't know what that, that really means.  When you say, "Being an artist.  How does it feel being an artist?"  If you mean being able to stand up and sing in front of people and move them, that is the mystery.
Speaker 1: Then what would life be if there were no music?
Speaker 2: If there were what?
Speaker 1: No music.
Speaker 2: I can't imagine life being anything without any music, because for me music is my life.  And, if I had no music, in my life--I don't think anybody would exist.  That to, to an extent, for instance look in the street.  You see youngsters going down--what do they got?  They got ear things on listening to music.  What if they didn't have that?  What indescribable crimes could the brain conjure up without music?  What indescribable horrors could take place if there wasn't music?  I can't image no music.  Music--what is it--what do they say?  "Soothes the savage breast." (laughs) I just don't know what I would do without music.
Story_ID: 14853
Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?  Have you given much thought to that?
Speaker 2: I don't know what I would actually say I want to be remember for.  I'd, I'd certainly would like to be thought of as a person that fulfilled what my talents were.  And if that--that in itself is a great deal to expect, because many of us have talents that we don't do anything about.  And I do something about my talent, because I'm convicted that I must do something.  So, if I'm to be remembered, I think I would like to be remembered of--by how I treat people, in a basis not being "The Artist"--my relationship with a person.  If I've helped somebody, and, or by my career, it has helped somebody else.  If by something that I've said to a youngster, when it pulled him out of a doldrum of some sort.  I like to individually be remembered by those people for those things that I've done.  Rather than say, "Oh, he was a singer."
Story_ID: 14854
Speaker 1: Is the future for black people better or is it--what are your views on things?  On--in that regard?
Speaker 2: My feelings about change and what has happened even within my lifetime is that we--I do believe that we are better human beings now.  And I don't believe that just from the standpoint of a black--or a young black person.  I believe it is from--I'm talking from the standpoint of, of human beings as such.  I heard Dr. [Howard] Thurman preach a sermon years ago at the dedication of, of, one of the colleges.  I'm trying to remember which one it was down South.  He said, "In the dead center of God's brain is the image that God has for man.  And that it is the image of himself.  And that man is still in a state of creation.  He has not yet reached that point in which he has become the image of God."  And so I think this is the inevitable thing.  Eventually mankind is going to be that image that's in the dead center of God's brain.  And when that happens, it has nothing to do with color, it has nothing to do with class, it has nothing to do with race.  It is God.

Speaker 1: When I was doing Porgy, doing 'Show Boat' at the Vienna [Austria] Volksoper [Folk Opera] in (pauses)--I was there doing it in repertory with 'Porgy and Bess' and with 'Show Boat'.  And the 'Show Boat' production was in German.  (sings 'Old Man River' in German).
Story_ID: 671465
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me receiving one of my, 'bout ten, honorary doctorate degrees from various universities; I don't remember which university it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And do you have any idea how long ago that might have been--this particular shot?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is one of the first shots of a production that was done in Vienna [Austria] by this--it was sent there by the state department [U.S. Department of State] in 1952 of my playing Porgy in 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: What can you tell us about this?  I know you said you don't remember who these gentlemen are; do you remember anything about where this might have been taken, or when?
Speaker 1: No.  I'm trying to remember.  I can't identify who they are either.
Speaker 2: Okay, or anything about the place at all, or--
Speaker 1: I don't recognize that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  One of hundreds of concert halls that you've been in in your career?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's fine, great.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And what about that?
Speaker 1: Oh, I wish I knew who that was; I was in someone's studio, but--
Speaker 2: Okay--but that is you, correct?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Any guess as to like even the decade it was in?  Do you think this was maybe the--what--'60s [1960s], '70s [1970s]?  Let's see, there's something that says about show--here, 'Show Boat,' November 13th, 8 p.m.  I'm looking to see if I can see anything with a date--oh, there's a poster on the wall that says something about 'Requiem' for Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]--Sunday, May 7th, 1978; so I guess we will say this would have been possibly the late '70s [1970s], huh?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute; this was a picture of me in the rehearsal room with Bruno Walter when I did the Mozart 'Requiem;' we recorded for Mozart 'Requiem' May of--when was it?
Speaker 2: Says '78 [1978] on the poster--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: May of '78 [1978]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it was done at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Excellent.  I'm gonna pause just--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This is a picture or me with Jim Cullum of the Jim Cullum Jazz Band in San Antonio, Texas.  I've done several performances and broadcasts with him and his band--Jim Cullum.
Speaker 2: Okay, very good.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --picture of me with Nora Holt [Nora Douglas Holt], who was one of the founders of the National Association of Negro Musicians, and she was a critic at that time--one of the top critics here in Chicago [Illinois], and was very instrumental in my career, and the young lady with her is a--became a big star also--oh, what's her name?  Her father, Franklin [ph.]--not Franklin.  Oh, she's a big--she had a big career in Europe.
Speaker 1: I'm drawin' a blank; I'm not sure.  Nothing on the back.  Okay, well, I guess we can't remember all of them.  Take that out, and now we're going to put this one on, and go ahead when you're ready.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me with the wonderful mezzo soprano, Shirley Verrett, after a performance in New York City [New York, New York]; that would have been in the '80s [1980s].  She is now teaching at--up at Ann Arbor [Michigan] in a university there [University of Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell Verrett?
Speaker 2: V-E-R-R-E-T-T.
Speaker 1: Great.  Okay?
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me as De Lawd when I did the 'Hallmark Hall of Fame,' a 'Green Pastures' ['The Green Pastures,' Marc Connelly], on TV, and won the 'Hallmark Hall of Fame,' and I played the role of the Lord.
Speaker 1: And do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: No, but it's history.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that, that--they could just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Find that out easily--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was the same year that Mike Todd had that big thing [Academy Award for Best Picture].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is one of the shots of me as Joe in the 'Show Boat' that I did for MGM [Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc.; Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios, Inc.] that was actually photographed in 1950, came out in 1951, and it's been shown on late shows ever since.  It was the first color version; the one had been made of black and white that was ran through (unclear) and was made in the '30s [1930s] with Paul Robeson doing the role of Joe, and then I came along and did it with Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, and that, that whole cast in color for MGM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm pretty sure this is a variation of the shot that we had when you were working with Bruno Walter on the Mozart 'Requiem;' I think it's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the same picture that was in the dressing room office at Carnegie rehearsing for the Mozart 'Requiem' with Bruno Walter.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This is--I wish I could identify this, but it's one of my many performances that someone took a candid shot of and then sent to me.  The way it's set up there, it was probably a rehearsal because, as you see, there's a--I do--because the chair is sitting there, it was probably one of the things that I narrate like the 'Lincoln Portrait' of Aaron Copland, for which I received a Grammy [Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album] in 1984, or the new (unclear)--the 'New Morning--Morning for the World' ['New Morning For The World'], which I also have done several performances of--
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: --and the words of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you; that's very helpful.  That's exactly the kind of commentary that we're looking for.  Okay, and this is the last real large one, then we'll go to the small ones.  I'm just gonna get this one set up here.
Speaker 2: This one tells everything, almost, but we'll take whatever commentary you have.  It says, "Booking for '50 [1950]-'51 [1951]," okay?
Speaker 1: What was that magazine?
Speaker 2: This was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Musical Courier, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Yes, Musical Courier, April 15th, 1950, with Toscanini [Arturo Toscanini] on the cover.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the ad that appeared in the Musical Courier prior to my debut, which was in 1950 in Town Hall [The Town Hall, New York, New York], and that was the inside cover announcing my concert coming up.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, this was the announcement of the second--the first one had taken place, and this was the advertisement that went in the Musical Courier on my second concert in New York which--it was at Town Hall and preceded the year before I made my Town Hall concert--my Carnegie Hall debut concert.

Speaker 1: I am on the co- artistic committee of the Kennedy awards [Kennedy Center Honors], which each year asks us to submit people that we think should be--receive the award, and then that entails a big reception at the White House [Washington, D.C.] that the president of the country and the first lady are the host and hostess, and this was one of my first pictures with Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] at one of the receptions having to do with the Kennedy awards at the White House.
Speaker 2: Good, all right, great.
Speaker 1: This was actually the same occasion, except it was that when we went from the president and we also shook hands with the first lady [Hillary Rodham Clinton], and this was a picture of my shaking hands with the first lady at the Kennedy awards.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I might say that I--each year, they have the Kennedy awards, and there are several pictures of me with the Clintons, and then subsequently you will see pictures of me with other presidents and their wives at the same occasion, and this was one of the occasions at the White House at the reception.
Speaker 2: I made a little bit of a mistake, Mr. Warfield [HistoryMaker William Warfield]; I grabbed the pile of the ones I wasn't gonna do that were extras, but that's okay; we'll just have a few extras; this is the main pile that I had set aside, so--
Speaker 1: This is also a picture of my being at the White House, and it was with the father [President George Herbert Walker Bush] of the present president [President George Walker Bush], and--whom you will see later on; I was with his son just recently, but this was with his dad and his mother [Barbara Bush] when he was president at the time--at the White House.
Speaker 2: Great; thank you.  And since you mentioned it--
Speaker 1: Now, this is the latest picture which I received from the White House with the present president, autographed to me by he and his wife [Laura Bush], and I'm very proud of that.  That was this past December, 2001.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Now, this was a picture of the same event several years earlier, with Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] and Mrs. Reagan [Nancy Reagan], who were president at the time, so I had a wonderful time at the White House on that year, too (laughter).  And they also--as you can see, it's autographed to me.
Speaker 2: This is with Al Gore on the same occasion at the White House, he was also a guest there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Was it--the Clintons didn't give autographs, huh (laughter)?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, this was another year--yes, I do have one with the Clintons--with the Clintons that autographed also, but this was not the same one as you saw before; this, I think, was the year afterwards.  I was there twice, or three times, I think, with the Clintons when they were--as you see, there's the president in the center there between the two of us greeting somebody who was behind me.
Speaker 2: And, here he is greeting you.
Speaker 1: And the same thing here, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead and talk when you're ready.
Speaker 1: Yes, this was the same occasion of the year that I did it; that was with the three of us together.
Speaker 2: And, the last of the presidential series is this one here.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, this was--this goes back to the time that I was there with Ronald Reagan.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that was all the presidents.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me with Virginia Uldrick, who is the president of the North Carolina arts ins- school [South Carolina Governor's School for the Arts and Humanities, Greenville, South Carolina]; they've just had a new building that they've opened recently; it started as a summer project, and now it's a fulltime, full year school for young people.
Speaker 2: Great.  How does Ms. Uldrick spell her last name?
Speaker 1: U-L-D-R-I-C-K.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Any idea when this was taken?  Oh, wait, it says 1996.  Does that sound right?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think this is her again, so we might wanna just--if you have anything to add.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is Virginia Uldrick again.  (Unclear), in that time was here in New York [New York], and which I received a very prestigious award from the Music Institute.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this is also--this may be similar events, 1996 again.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Frank Little, who is the president of the Music Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  He has been a friend of mine for years; we've performed together, he's one of the top past opera tenors, and this was an occasion when I received the award from the Music Institute.
Speaker 2: Great.  Here's the Rachel Barton [Rachel Barton Pine] photo.
Speaker 1: This is Frank Little with Rachel Barton, the young violinist whom I've performed with on several occasions as fundraising things for the Music Institute of Chicago.

Speaker 2: This is a picture on the occasion of the birthday of Etta Moten [HistoryMaker Etta Moten Barnett], who was one of the Porgy--the second Bess of 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin] in the '30s [1930s] with Todd Duncan, and with whom I had the pleasure of doing several performances--solo performances, including one at Ravinia [Ravinia Festival, Highland Park, IllinoisHighhIhasdfasd] with the Chicago orchestra [Chicago Symphony Orchestra].  Etta Moten, who just this--and there's [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett there on that photograph, from Ebony magazine, and it was a wonder--her ninety-sixth birthday, and we just celebrated recently her hundredth, and she's quite a lady, and a great actress; she had quite a career.  She's a hundred years old now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you be able to identify any of the other people in the photo?
Speaker 2: The lady right behind her, as you might have noticed, is a lady who was my escort at--in one of the other pictures at the White House, and then the other lady on the other side of Lerone Bennett is a very dear friend of mine, she and her husband, from San Antonio, Texas, Aaronetta [HistoryMaker Aaronetta Pierce] and Joe Pierce [HistoryMaker Dr. Joseph A. Pierce, Jr.].  And the lady on the right, standing, is Etta Moten's daughter [Sarah Brooks-Ish]--yes.
Speaker 1: And Pierce is--how do they spell Pierce?  Is it--
Speaker 2: P-I-E-R-C-E.  Just P-I-E-R-C-E, Pierce--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --C-E.  Okay; you know, sometimes it's P-E-A, and sometimes it's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, P-I-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, great.  Now, we'll go to--
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me with Jim Cullum again, the cornetist of the jazz band [Jim Cullum Jazz Band], and one of the announcers, down in San Antonio, Texas--of the show.
Speaker 1: And how does Jim spell his last name?
Speaker 2: C-U-L-L-U-M.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.
Story_ID: 671467
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me and several of the people--Mark Elyn, and the one on the left is John Wustman, who was also my accompanist, and then when he took on the professorship and head of the graduate company degree down there, then he was the one who was instrumental in getting me to go to teach at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], which I went in 1974 and remained for sixteen years.  And he has retired also now.  John Wustman on the far left.
Speaker 2: This guy (points).
Speaker 1: Yes.  And he's also--but he's a very distinguished accompanist, and was the only accompanist that Pavarotti [Luciano Pavarotti] used for his recitals.
Speaker 2: And how does he spell his last name?
Speaker 1: W-U-S-T-M-A-N, Wustman.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And do we need to identify the other two individuals, or--
Speaker 1: That's Mark Elyn, and I don't know who the lady is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mark Elyn was a professor at the University of Illinois.
Speaker 2: Okay, and how does he spell his last name?
Speaker 1: E-L-Y-N.
Speaker 2: Great.  Okay, good.  All right.  Oh, this is a great shot of you.  Let me see if it says anything on the back.  Nope, it just says, program.
Speaker 1: That's one of the--one of the (unclear) of my performing something dramatic (laughter).  I use my hands a lot, and someone--a lot--many times, fans will take pictures of me and then send it to me later on; they send it to me in duplicate and ask me to sign one and keep the other, and this is one that I found in the files; I don't--couldn't identify what the performance was--it could have been anywhere.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, this is a good one; this is a great shot, and this is another one that's from 1996 and--actually, let me take some of this stack down, here.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is the--another shot of Etta Moten [HistoryMaker Etta Moten Barnett], who is the second Bess in 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin], and the--following [HistoryMaker] Anne Brown, who was the first Bess that did it with Todd Duncan.  This was four years ago, when she was ninety-six and--ninety-five, she was; and then, as I said, we just celebrated, this past year, her hundredth birthday.
Speaker 2: She looks great--you look great.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's a good shot of both of you together--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it's wonderful.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is my dear friend, the pianist star--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mary?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Mary Lou (unclear).
Speaker 1: Mary Lou Williams.  Mary Lou has left us, but she was in Chicago [Illinois] about oh, five or six years ago [sic.], and she played at a big concert here and did her thing down at--I think it was a benefit thing at the Hilton [Hilton Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and we were all down there clowning, and she was just a fabulous artist, yeah--Mary Lou Williams.
Speaker 2: Anything you can remember about that one of you?
Speaker 1: This is probably a picture of my, my conducting a master class because I'm speaking to probably a group of students and I've award--the, the format would be to speak to them about something and then they would sing for me, and I would give them suggestions on how to improve it or ideas about projecting certain--certain things, and if--that they may not have conceived.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This one looks really strong.
Speaker 1: This was my acceptance speech here, at the university when I received an honorary doctorate, yeah.
Speaker 2: Here's one of our treasured photos.
Speaker 1: Oh, now, that goes back to 1952, and it's a picture of Leontyne and I cutting the wedding cake; the wedding was in New York [New York] at Abyssinian Baptist Church, and the reception was up at--I'm tryin' to remember what the--big, big hotel there, and there was a picture of my--our cutting the cake--wedding cake.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is one of the color shots of my--of a production of 'Porgy and Bess' that I was in, and I'm not exactly sure of which--where it was, whether it was the European--this is one of those pictures in which fan--somebody who was in the show probably took these pictures, and they sent me a set of them, but I can't identify exactly which shows.  And in the first one I was in, I did in 1952, and that's the one that the state department [U.S. Department of State] sent to Vienna [Austria] and Berlin [Germany], and then it went on that--that production lasted four years, and ended up in Russia.  There was a big thing with the--I--we didn't stay that long.  That was the production that, that played here at the opera house, and it had Leontyne Price and I, and Cab Calloway doing the Sportin' Life--yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow, wow; boy that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This is another--that was a rehearsal because--of, of a 'Porgy and Bess' rehearsal, and it was probably right here because, if you see, there's somebody standing back there in a suit (laughter), and a shirt and tie, so that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's not a costume--
Speaker 2: And this would have been the same.  This was that same batch of pictures that someone sent me of rehearsals here in Chicago for the 1952 performance that we did.
Speaker 1: Great.  We're gonna do a series of five now from the Yachats Music Festival [Yachats, Oregon]; I hope I said that right.  These are captioned 1997.
Speaker 2: Each year, I go to Yachats, which is on the coast of Oregon; we go to Portland [Oregon], stay overnight, and then take a bus to Yachats on the Thursday, and the whole weekend is spent in giving music, lectures, master classes, and it's a small festival in Yachats; I'm doing it again this year.  It usually follows the week after the 4th of July.
Speaker 1: Tell our--for, for the people who will make the text captions, tell them how to spell Yachats.
Speaker 2: Y-A-C-H-A-T-S, isn't that what it says there?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yachats, Y-A-C-H-A--
Speaker 1: Okay, and who--this gentleman here?
Speaker 2: He was one of the, the artists, but I'm not quite sure.  Gra- he looks like it's Grant Johannesen.  He was also one of the artists at the festival.
Speaker 1: That was on the bus going somewhere (laughter), but it was in Yachats, yeah.
Speaker 2: That was in Yachats, and the lady that's in the background is Floyd [Alpha Floyd]; she was one of the first prima--black prima donnas in, in, in, in this country, and appeared with symphony orchestras and in opera houses in Europe.
Speaker 1: Each year, we end up that Yachats festival with, with, with, (singing) "Va, pensiero," ['Va, pensiero,' Giuseppe Verdi] and I conducted, and that was one of the--this 1997--and that was a group of artists that were there; we all sang that, and I conducted it.
Story_ID: 671468
Speaker 1: Oh this is an occasion in which several artists got together, probably a convention.  That's Mattiwilda Dobbs [HistoryMaker Mattiwilda Dobbs Janzon], who was one of our great coloratura sopranos--one of the first black prima donnas at the Met [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Is that--that her (points)?
Speaker 1: That's she.
Speaker 2: Which one is?--
Speaker 1: The one you was--finger (unclear); that's Mattiwilda Dobbs.
Speaker 2: D-O-B-B-S?
Speaker 1: D-O-B-B-S, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And is there anyone else you would like to identify, or that you could identify?
Speaker 1: I think that's Shirley Verrett on the other side of her.
Speaker 2: (Points) Over here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the red also--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and these were people at the convention.
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  And then we have this one.
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the National Association of Negro Musicians convention, and I was president that year, and one of the things a president had to do was to lead a parade of--at the fashion show that the--life members gave luncheon each year, and this was the lady who was president of the luncheon--of the life members, and we had a big event, and I was crowned king and had to (laughter) wear the crown and lead the, the march.
Speaker 2: Good fun.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This was probably one of the master classes that I gave.  Even before I started teaching formally at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], it was quite popular if you were appearing someplace, especially if it was at a university, they would ask you, "Could you stay over the next day and give a master class to the students," and I started doing that before I actually committed myself to taking a position as a professor, and this was one of the occasions in probably which I was lecturing on some phase of music.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.  (Whispers) A couple more of this series--okay.
Speaker 1: Now, that is a picture of me and Betty Jackson King, and Theodore Charles Stone, both of whom were past presidents of the National Association of Negro Musicians, at a convention.  In fact, Stone, the one on the right hand side, left us this past year; he was the president at the time.  He was the one who was responsible for my coming into the organization, and Betty Jackson King was the president of the--she's a, quite a composer to--of the national association prior to my becoming president.  The way they would set up by constitution, a person can become president and run two consecutive--two years, and run two consecutive terms after that, but the maximum time they can serve is six years, and I fulfilled my six years.  Betty Jackson came--was just prior to me, and Stone was prior to both of us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's president--that was another convention of the national association, and that's Theodore Charles Stone that's seated there next to me.  I don't know what they're gonna--no, yes it is.  He is also a past--past president now, but he wasn't at that time.  He's the president of the local chapter in Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.  We're close to the end; we got a few more here.  Let me do these small horizontal.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is another picture of me with Mattiwilda Dobbs, who was one of the great coloratura sopranos; she's still living, of course.  And she, she--actually, she started teaching at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I think, and is living in--what's Washington, D.C. right there?  She has a home right down there near--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Maybe Maryland, or Virginia, or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's right up (background noise)--oh, that's somebody arriving; let me go let them in.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: In Rochester, New York, and that's my nephew, one of my nephews; his name is Thomas [Thomas Warfield]--a very talented young man.  As you notice, I had not shaved my hair off at that time.  (Unclear), and he sings, dances, and choreographs.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then here's a sequence of the Bernstein and (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, that is Rosalynn Carter and I.  Rosalynn did the--a voice--Leonard Bernstein--the narration of the 'Lincoln Portrait' [Aaron Copland], and I was at the, the performance and, of course, we all got together afterwards for a reception, and that was at the reception in Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We'll just continue on; we've got two more of this one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Lenny Bernstein and Rosalynn and I together--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he was the conductor that night with the National Symphony [National Symphony Orchestra].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then here's a little bit larger group photo if you wanna identify any of the other people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, this was one of the--because that's Betty Comden and Ted Green [sic. Adolph Green]; they also received--that year they received the Kennedy award [Kennedy Center Honors], and that's a picture of us together.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What year would that have been, do you have any idea?
Speaker 1: Oh, I could not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I got a (unclear) here that would--that, that, that, that I could pull out, and it tells the date everybody got one.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  We're gonna do a few of the vertical formats--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I've been to practically all of 'em, and they've been (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, that's really something.  Now, one more straggler here from the horizontal; I meant to put this one in earlier when we did the other 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin], but we'll just put it in now, and I'll have to reframe a little bit to get all of that in there.  (Unclear), okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of Porgy and--one of the 'Porgy and Bess' productions, and I think I can identify that as the "Bess, You is My Woman Now" duet that I was doing with Bess because of the expression on her face, and knowing the dramatic scene that that would (unclear) when I was trying to comfort Bess to let her know that she had Porgy now and a love in her life--"Bess, You is My Woman Now"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And which actress is this?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That would have been, that would have been--oh, that would have been the production that we did down at the University of Illinois, and this young lady was from St. Louis [Missouri].  Oh, Lord--
Speaker 2: Really put your memory through its paces on this one, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 1: She had come in and was doing--was the guest artist doing 'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 2: Okay.  Nothing's come to mind?  Okay.  Well, we'll drop another one in and maybe it'll--maybe it'll come to you; we've got one more.  We're switching to the vertical mode now, and this is the last of the 'Porgy and Bess,' (background noise) and this one's vertical, so I'll go ahead and reframe while you describe it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would have been the duet--the, the trio at the end when Porgy comes back and Sportin' Life has succeeded in taking Bess to New York [New York], and this is the trio, "Bess, Where's My Bess?" ["Bess, Oh Where's My Bess?"] which was done--when they informed him that she's going to New York, and that's when he decides he was gonna go to New York and find her and bring her back.  "Bess, oh, where is my Bess?  Won't somebody tell me where," was the lyrics to that.
Speaker 2: And does seeing this angle with these faces jog your memory at all as to who these other performers might have been?
Speaker 1: No; I mean I don't remember the specific names.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The date on this one is 2000; does that seem right--September, 2000?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my--a picture of my brothers--my youngest brother [Thaddeus "Tat" Warfield] and my brother that's next to me [Robert E. Warfield, Jr.]--in Rochester, New York, and that was probably at the, the--every Christmas, I go home for Christmas, and the whole family--whatever house or whichever brother's house I'm in is where the whole family gets together for Christmas.  This last Christmas, there were five generations of us.  I have aunts who are near a hundred, and I have little great-great nephew, a little great-great niece, who is just sort of--is months old so there was five generations of us at Christmas time--of Warfields.
Story_ID: 671469
Speaker 1: I tell him I'm his greatest fan, and he sings 'Ol' Man River' as an alto, and the last time I--when he said, "Oh my god."  Now, the first time I went, and he said, "Oh my god, if I knew you were out there, I wouldn't have sung."  I said, "It was great, Sam [Samuel Ramey]."  And then the last time I went, I sat and looked at him, I said, "(Unclear), I couldn't wait for you to sing 'Ol' Man River,'" and he roared laughing (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's funny.  Just for our caption editors, spell Mr. Ramey's last name.
Speaker 1: R-A-M-E-Y.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.  'Cause there was that film director, Sam Raimi, who's R-A-M-I [sic.]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Sam--he goes by Samuel, he does--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's fine, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: When I was--who knows?--some performance.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was probably a picture that was sent to me by a fan.  As I said before, many times, people have said, "May I take a picture of you?"  And then they'd send it to me and ask me to sign it for them and send it back.  They're very good at putting the amount of postage and everything, and then they'll include one for me to keep for myself.  So I don't know; I can't identify exactly where that was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, we have a date on this photo, but that's all we have, and it's--it's--the, the camera says that the date it was taken was May 22nd, 1993, and you can tell us who and when and where.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's one of my former students, and he's doing very well; his name is Lawrence Greg [ph.], and he's doing very well.  As a matter of fact, he did his 'Messiah' debut last Christmas at Avery Fisher Hall [David Geffen Hall, New York, New York], and I went to see his performance--yeah.
Speaker 2: Great.  Good recalling.  There are no notations here to help us at all, so hopefully, you'll remember.
Speaker 1: Now, that is a picture of me with the lady that I did twenty-six years in a row--she conducted the Handel's [George Frideric Handel] 'Messiah' at the Monumental Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois] out here on Oakwood Boulevard; her name was Hortense Love, and she was also a fine singer herself, had quite a reputation, had done--had done her debut in New York [New York], and had appeared in (unclear) in Chicago [Illinois], a soprano, and she was the music minister of the Monumental Baptist Church, and each year, we did the 'Messiah'--Handel's 'Messiah.'
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, this one, somebody was kind enough to write on the back.  This is John Kelsch [John A. Kelsch], K-E-L-S-C-H, ex-director, Judy Garland Museum, Grand Rapids, Minnesota, 1997.  I'll leave that one up there for you, and then any comments you wanna--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was probably a performance that we did together and someone took a picture of is afterwards, yeah--at rehearsal; that would have been at rehearsal.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you remember what, what, what piece you were performing, or--'97 [1997]?
Speaker 1: Is it the same month?
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: It could have been anything; in '97 [1997], I was doing quite often, the narration for the 'Lincoln Portrait' of Aaron Copland, and that usually was coupled with some of the Aaron Copland songs, or 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin], and with encore of "Ol' Man River."
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, here's a, a--this is the Riviera Club [ph.], February 22nd, 1989, so I guess a performance shot of you, maybe another one that someone shot from the audience--great shot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that, that was a--probably a reception after one of the concerts, yeah.  So it was at a club, yeah.
Speaker 2: What would you have been doing at the Riviera in 1989 in February?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, it wouldn't have been at the Riviera; it was a--the reception was at the Riviera--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --but the, but the concert would've been at--what does it say?  What does it say?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, there's a microphone, and it looks like you're holding a plaque or something there.
Speaker 1: Oh, I was probably receiving an honor, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  And one more; it's just this little one that's in the folder, and this'll complete the session.  Beautiful colored photo; I think it's one of the--another one of your honorary degrees; I'll put it up, and you can tell us about it (unclear).
Speaker 1: That was--yes, that was the honorary degree, and I--if I could only remember who that--oh!  It was at the University of Rochester.  As a matter of fact, that was--it was--when I was in the service, I received my degree, and they wanted me to come and, and--but, but all the people who were receiving degrees, they wanted us to wear uniforms, so I, I received my bachelor's degree at the university in 1942, and this--I don't remember what date it was, they, they, they conferred upon me an honorary degree, and I said--I related to them the story that I received my degree, and one of the things that I'd always looked forward to was having a cap and gown, and I said, "I'm glad to see that finally I'm getting a cap and gown at the awarding institute."  They just roared (laughter); but, but, but that, that's Rochester, New York--University of Rochester, and I received an honorary doctorate.  Jordan [ph.]--what is his name?  (Audio disturbance) He was 101 years old, and he received one that same day.  But that's a matter of history so you can look that up, I'm sure.
