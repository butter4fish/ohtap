Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I'm not usually short of words and thoughts, but I, don't have a fav- I mean I have had a number of expressions that I say from time to time.  I've not had any occasion to say it so I won't be able to make it be my favorite right now.
Story_ID: 2716
Speaker 1: I want to start out and, you know, ask about your parents.  And I'd like you to first start talking about your, mother and what you know about her background, you know, but give her name and just talk about what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Vina, V-I-N-A, Velma, V-E-L-M-A, Johnson, maiden name Johnson.  Was born in a very small town in, not quite northern, southeast--northeastern Louisiana in East Feliciana Parish, of a family of, I think the fourth of, her mother's, of her mother's children, and the youngest, like eighteen years younger than the oldest child.  I suspect as I, spent time with them that they were not far from where they were slaves.  But in the area where they are, maybe her grandmother or somebody might have been slaves very much near the same area.  I spent a lot of time in summers visiting with my maternal grandmother and my uncle who was her, second child.  And so I had a, sense of what the--that family life was like. And, probably which is what prejudices me now at this point toward the South, toward family life, toward a certain sense of the people and a certain kind of down at the ground--on the ground level.
Speaker 1: When you say, prejudice, you mean in favor of?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you--did your--you said that you had a sense by what you've learned that they were not that far, you know, the area was not far from slavery.  Why do you have that sense?
Speaker 2: Just as they talk, just as they talk about the grandmother or somebody, grandmother, who lives on the Sawmill Hill.  There was a sawmill apparently in the neighborhood.  You know so that--or whose plantation they belonged to at some point.  And again, I, don't have, a specific piece.  It's just that nobody seems to be far.  Everybody seems to be at home from one place or the other. That we, when we were small children with my grandmother, would walk and I had no idea how long, how far the distance was because now it looks like I cannot even believe some small children and an old woman walking that distance.  But we would go to visit her sister.  It was maybe ten, fifteen miles, but it was like in the, road with us behind her.  And it covered a big portion of the, parish.  So that I'm saying that I don't believe, as I look at all of them scattered around the parish, that anybody was too far from where they all started from.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?  What kind of person is she?
Speaker 2: Very focused.  Very definite.  Very loving and kind, very much disposed toward family.  Believes in right.  Will take up for anybody that she believes to be right.  Will criticize and chastise anybody she believes to be wrong.  And it's consistent in every way.  But very strong.  I was maybe, all of the time growing up, my mother was always up when you got up and up when you went to bed.  I think that that's one of those things where you try to figure out, "When does she sleep?"  You know, "When did she sleep?"  And it's only been in the last few years that you can see her sleeping.
Speaker 1: Well, did she talk any ever more about her growing up?  Any, anything along those lines?
Speaker 2: No, just that it was hard and, you know, it was they all, they--my grandmother managed to own a piece of land.  And my--and I think as my, uncle was, much like I said, my mother was eighteen years younger than her oldest sibling so that I think my uncle must have become involved with the farm at some point so that he and my grandmother wound--owned it when we were small children.  And so there as always--there were always people around.  And there was always, there was always a sense of, I mean, I think the land, I'm, really struck by.  And, and often as I ride down the, down the road, I think, "I would like to have a piece of land with a tree that sits in the middle of it just like that."  And it really is out of some memories that I have as a child.
Story_ID: 2717
Speaker 1: And your father, can you tell us, you know, his name and what you know about his growing up?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Henry [Dudley] Johnson, H-E-N-R-Y, J-O-H-N-S-O-N.  No middle name.  Was born in Ferriday/Vidalia [Louisiana] up near, Natchez [Mississippi], in Louisiana, but near Natchez.  And grew up.  And he said, just recently--before--my father just passed last year in October of 2001.  And somewhere in the months before, we were talking about family.  And he said, my family, we were not farmers.  My mother's family--my mother [Vina Velma Johnson] was from a family of farmers.  And he talks about the fact that we were not family; we were not farmers.  We were business people.  And so I think his uncle or somebody owned a store.  And some people owned real estate and a variety of other things that were a little bit different than had been our, experience because pretty much, we were all from a farm.  They were all from the farm, my mother's side.  But my father was very--was interested in fact, probably how I became a physician was really related to my father's experience.  He had wanted to become a physician and apparently started school, but somewhere between money and other family, other obligations, he wound up not being able to go to, medical school.  And so when he and my mother married shortly thereafter, they said, my mother apparently said as part of the little consoling to him, "Well, don't worry.  We--basically our firstborn can be a, will be a physician."  And so assume--and I think they were assuming that they would have a son.  And then I didn't come along as a son and so they said, I would be the, when I was born, they said I would be it anyway.  So it's an interesting piece to, in terms of being born into a family mission.
Story_ID: 2718
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: I, and I just heard this recently.  They--my, mother--my father's stepfather was a pastor of a church.  And my mother [Vina Velma Johnson] attended--and the church was around the corner from where my mother lived.  And she attended the church.  And my father [Henry Dudley Johnson] came from the country, came from (unclear) and met her.  And she was very and apparently, it's really interesting because as long as they had been--they were married sixty-five years.  And it was only in the last few months before my father died that I even heard this story.  But it turns out that he came---he's five years older than my mother.  So he was maybe eighteen and my mother was thirteen or fourteen and when he came to the church.  And they met, and then, apparently his eyes were on her from the time he got to the church until maybe six or seven years later they got to marry.  You know, so they got, they married I think at eighteen, when she, my mother was eighteen.  But his whole life from that point on, and then from that point on until they died.  So they go from the mid 30s [1930s] until 2001 when, my father passed this past October.  And in an interesting continual devotion.  An argument for every minute, but continual devotion.  So it's been a it's, it is--so my parents were really a very strong influence and, to have them until you are old yourself is really such a, privilege.  And so, it's only like I say, it's only been the six, eight months now since my father's passed.  I had the chance last year during his illness, in the last year of his life, to be able to be at home and to spend time with him.
Story_ID: 2719
Speaker 1: Your siblings. You can give their--in order.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my sister, Joyce Johnson Burton is a schoolteacher.  She lives in New Orleans [Louisiana], is a counselor, school counselor now.  Lived in Chicago [Illinois] for a short period for a period of time, maybe ten or fifteen years in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], but lives near my mother and father, where they lived and has two children.  And it's very insightful.  It's very insightful and, streetwise in a way that I think, me as a older sister, being smart in other kind of ways.  Am not.  And, so, it's been a, it's been an interesting kind of combination in terms of who she is.  And then I have, I had one brother who is now, deceased, named Henry Dudley Johnson.  The Dudley being my, father's father's name.  Was born in 1943, died in, 1990.  So he was only forty-seven when he died.  And, smart, very smart, but unable to deal with ordinary kinds of discipline and order and stupid people.  So that he had real difficulty in, the whole rush of life, being able to deal with people who really had authority and had power, but who didn't have sense or who didn't have knowledge.  So he would just like--so that would just bomb him out.  So (laughs) that's it.  And, you know, so he was in and out of a lot of things in life, but really never hit his stride.  And never--I always said that he had a life in which he never got the bankbook and therefore, never got credit for all the things that he did.  So he did a lot of things for a lot of people, lots and lots of skills.  But because he didn't have--he wasn't registered and had all the things in place, he never really got fully--he never fully got credit for.
Story_ID: 2720
Speaker 1: Now, what's your earliest memory growing up?
Speaker 2: My father [Henry Dudley Johnson] teaching me my ABC's.  Making me count.  My mother [Vina Velma Johnson] arguing with him, saying leave me alone, that I was a child, are probably one of, some of the earliest memories, but always, always studying.  And I always--it would be my father doing that.
Speaker 1: So your father believed a lot in, education, and he wanted to see--.
Speaker 2: My father and my mother believed in education.  My father was the implementer, like he was the doer of it.  My fa--my mother basically created the sense of the vision of the family and how we would move forward.  But in terms of actual doing lots of things, it was my father who, liked I said, he taught me my ABC's.  He taught me to count.  He taught me to multiply.  He taught me all--so that by the time I went to school, I knew almost everything that I was supposed to be taught in school.  And then just a consistent kind of, almost to the point of being (laughs), well I don't know.  He was like, "You are going to learn it before you went out the door."  And I was--that was always, always.  And, very strong and very--was the one who went to PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meeting.  And he participated in a lot of things, but like I say, my mother set the tone in terms of the family.  And how we would go.  And then he, my father, was basically, in many ways, was the implementer of, a lot of the dreams and the plans.
Story_ID: 2721
Speaker 1: Well, who do you think you were closest to, your mother [Vina Velma Johnson] or father [Henry Dudley Johnson] or was it equal?
Speaker 2: No, I was probably closest to my mother.  My mother--my father basically set the--he had the rules.  And you did what he did, and, you know, but, in terms of--my mother is a, nurturer and probably in the, fullest sense of that.  So that she's always going to look out for you.  She's always going to look back around to make sure that you've got something, you know, that you were taken care of.  And so, it's the kind of sense where, "What about my baby?"  You know, last little bit.  You can see it now.  My daughter [Constance G. Jackson] spent some time with her when she was a very small child.  And she is so imprinted by her that, I mean the, strength that she draws from my mother is just unbelievable in that she would sometimes, given a choice of me or my you know, it's like, it's back to my grandmother.  It would always be as my grandmother's always going to be the one there for me.  And that's the way my mother was when we were coming up.
Story_ID: 2722
Speaker 1: I thought it was nice when you were talking about the tree, you know, in the middle of the field and I want to ask you a question about what, if you take yourself back to your childhood, you know, growing up, there in New Orleans [Louisiana], what sights, smells and sounds really remind you of your childhood, if you could sort of take yourself back?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it--in New Orleans, you'd look, or somewhere in Louisiana, you'd look at the magnolia tree. We called them bay ball because it had big beautiful, the big flower that is.  That would be one of the things that I would remember.
Speaker 1: You called them?
Speaker 2: Bay balls, bay, you know, like bay leaves.  It's a variation (unclear).  I mean and I don't know whether that's right, but that's what we called them when we were little kids.  But it's the big, you know, it's the flower you see on a magnolia, just pretty.  Pine, and talk about smells, pine because pine trees were almost everywhere.  There are some pine trees almost everywhere.  In terms of trees and life--and the other thing I think you'd--the next thing you, in New Orleans, you'd start to think about would be food.  I mean we ate.  And looking at some of the--and it would not necessarily be the seafood that we all think about, but probably for me, the most remembered food of childhood is red beans, red beans and rice.  And I think that that's probably--anybody's whose lived and grown up in New Orleans would almost always have unless they had some real severe allergy, would have red, beans and rice as a major part of what, you ate.  And then the rest of the things were just ordinary.  I, don't, I don't have any--but you also, for, for the time, you had the vendors.  You had street vendors in terms of sights and sounds.  Saying, "Watermelons, I got watermelons."  One of the things, one of the interesting things that, now that you ask me, bananas.  I grew up in the '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].  And, New Orleans was the shipping port for the South--for South America and Central America so that bananas came in.  And without the refrigeration in the same way it is now, bananas would spoil.  And so often if the docks had been--if extra bananas docked or if they had--were not sent out or shipped out, the vendors would come through with bananas, and it's like, "I got bananas, two dozen for a quarter," which was a penny a piece.  (Laughter)  "I've got bananas," you know, it's like, that line I think I remember the most.  "I've got bananas, two dozen for--."  So that coming up bananas were absolutely my favorite food (unclear) in terms of fruit.  And probably second to that, oranges because, even though the, even though the average person doesn't know about Louisiana oranges.  A lot of oranges grow in Louisiana.
Story_ID: 2723
Speaker 1: Can you describe family life and also were a typical like older child?
Speaker 2: You mean the one whose like know everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I mean maybe sometimes they say most responsible, you know, like that.  I mean
Speaker 2: I'll give you a most responsible experience.  My father [Henry Dudley Johnson], this would be, I must have been, I don't even remember what age I would've been. My father was still in the service, I think.  So it might be '45 [1945] or before.  So I'm six, seven, whatever, but also I've got two smaller sis- [sic, siblings]--I got a sister [Joyce Johnson Burton] and brother [Henry Dudley Johnson], smaller.  So we're going some place, and I wanted to go someplace and it was like, "You got to look after your sister and brother."  And so I said to my mother in the most pained kind of way, "I don't ever want to be the oldest again."  (Laughter)  "I don't ever--."  You know, it was like, I mean pained beyond description.  I am so sick of this.  So if you ask about responsibility, yes, that's my responsibility story.  But it was fun.  I mean I, what I, found early on is I think that I was like my father described himself as a child, I found out early that there were a lot of benefits from being a good child.  And I saw, you do well, people think you're wonderful.  They give you privileges.  They give you responsibility.  They give you respect.  You don't get into trouble often, you know, so basically I did whatever I was supposed to do for the most part. I mean every now and then I would do, be out of line, but for the most part, I found it was just easier to, do, to do right from the beginning.  And it just brought for you a lot privileges.  And so that's probably the biggest story what I would say about growing up.  You just pick out and you just figure out what you're supposed to do, and do it.
Story_ID: 2724
Speaker 1: Now, can you also describe just some memories of family life and growing up in that household, in the neighborhood or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I have two distinct pieces.  I have the first--I was born in a, neighborhood and then, at my aunt's house.  And then we moved down the street.  And so that's my first five or six, six, seven years.  And it was just a little--I remember, when we came home from school in the evening, we'd be signaling to jump rope and to play hopscotch.  I mean those were two things that I remember most.  I mean it was just like when you'd get on.  As soon as you'd get in the block. As soon as you saw somebody else, it was like first.  Or you'd call, you'd claim, (unclear) whatever you're doing, do hopscotch or we're doing or jumping rope.  And, just playing.  I remember playing, playing outside as, as a big part of it.  But I also remember, and particularly summertime, when you played all day long in the clothes from the day before.  And then you got dressed (unclear) in the evening, and you got dressed up and got cleaned up and you sat on the steps.  And we were kind of laughing about that how--and you didn't dirty, you didn't dirty the clean clothes for the evening.  And you kept them on and the next morning, you got up and put those on.  Then you ran and played all day long.  And then you took your bath in the afternoon and you sat out on the steps.  It's a, and, and there are a number of the people I've talked to who have grown up in similar places, have, similar kind of experiences where you just sat on the steps.  The little girl sitting on the steps, you put your ribbons on.  You got cleaned up and, and you sat on the steps again.  So.
Speaker 1: Now, what--tell me around the neighborhood, what was the neighborhood like when you were a child?
Speaker 2: It's a section of New Orleans [Louisiana] called Back o' Town.  And it was a solid working class neighborhood at the time.  It has since deteriorated as neighborhoods do from time to time.  And--but the drugs were on the edge of it.  I, do remember as an experience of somebody saying, "Don't go, don't go across the street, those boys smoke weed [marijuana]."  This was like, I'm eight now, seven or eight now.  I mean I'm obviously, this is a long time ago.  So it wasn't like, it wasn't anything we would do.  And I remember my father whipping me, picking me up off the porch by my one arm and whipping me and walking down the street because he told me not to play on this porch, where there were bad kids.  Where there were older kids who were probably involved in some things that were outside of what I was supposed to do.  And I wound up some kind of way being attracted and finding myself sitting down there and looking in the middle.  And he came along and found me sitting there and just picked me up by my arm.  And I was basically--the idea was, our job is to protect you and to make sure that you wind up being able to be whole.  And be able to take advantage of all the things that may come to you.  And so that's, that was pretty much the sense I got, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the Gloria Bacon--.  Oh, yeah, we do need to have this.  What--how do you spell 'back in town'?
Speaker 2: Back of, no.  Back of town.  Back o' Town.
Speaker 1: Oh, Back o' Town?
Speaker 2: Back o' Town.  Back o' Town.  You know, it's like, but it's basically, it's written Back o' Town, o' Town, but,  you say 'Backatown.'  'Backa,' like that.
Story_ID: 2725
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a young person?  Were you--I mean it seems like you were well mannered and all of that, but were you well-mannered?  Were you mischievous? Were you outspoken?  Were you a dreamer?  And were you, I mean--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was very much outspoken.  I was, you know, the first one, I put my hand up in class always.  I loved school.  I think that that's probably if I were to tell you anything about myself, I loved school.  I mean I would get out in June and after about a week or two, I was like, "Please," and then I would cry all summer long waiting.  I mean I would be ready for summer--for school to open.  I loved school.  Even as an adult, I found myself when I went to graduate school, I found, I really loved school.  I loved the, I loved the discipline and the, exchange that school is, that school provides and certain environments.  And that's probably, if anybody knew me coming up, that would be the thing that, you know, that most people would know most about me, that I loved school.  I mean I loved school, and it wasn't hard.  But I loved school.  I mean I didn't, slough.  It was just I liked, being in school.  It was, maybe it was that I liked being able to excel.  But I liked school, and, continued, I mean, continued to do so.  I--was I dreaming?  I, just was always doing.  I was always going to be a doctor so I mean which is--and maybe I just may have to mention that.  It was an interesting piece because it, separated--this is what I say about myself.  It separated my upbringing so that I wasn't raised as a girl.  I was raised as somebody who was going to be a doctor.  So it gave me a personhood distinct from being a girl so that, you know, I, gave you my age already.  So that I'm, well past the time--I'm, well ahead of the time when you had the average onslaught of women becoming physicians, except maybe women of families of physicians or women who had had some other experience.  My parents saw that, decided that, that I could do that, focused me in that direction, told all the rest of the world that I was going to be that, and everybody then decided to help me to do it.  And, that's really what it--.  So I mean I--there was, there was not ever any expectation that I would fail at anything.  You know, and, but not as a burden, not as a burden, not as a burden, not as the expectation that to--of you succeeding, but never an expectation that you would fail.  If you, know the, (unclear).  And so I always, approached whatever I was doing as if I would always succeed.
Story_ID: 2726
Speaker 1: Well, the truth is, my mother [Vina Velma Johnson] made--I, had a challenge.  I went to the, doctor's office.  I was maybe in my teens and the doctor said, "Oh, I understand you're going to be a doctor."  And I said, "That's what my ma- that's what my mother (with emphasis) wants," like the teenager, like the sullen kind of teenager is going to say.  So I got home and my mother said, "No, now, that's the last time I want to hear that from you.  You don't want to be a doctor.  You don't have to be a doctor.  You just do whatever you want to do, but I just was trying to give you some--."  Basically, "I'm trying to give you a good start on life."  You know what I'm saying, "But you don't have to be a doctor for me.  I don't need you to do anything for me."  (Unclear) so she fronted me off in such a way that it was, "Okay."  (Laughs).  I'd been getting all my passes based on the fact that I wanted to be a doctor.  (Laughs)  Now, you know, here I am in high school, you know, getting ready, people know me all around, all the things that I do. "Am I going to back out?"  But I'll say it's like at that point, it was at--it was probably at that point that I took it on because, like I say, she threw it back at me, because I had really in a very sullen way, I mean I was a, good--I could--I had a good, some good years of being a really sullen, ugly teenager.  Where you just give the really ugly answers.  And so she just threw it at me.  I mean just up in my face.  And from that point on, then I think that having come to grips with the, with the whole piece of choice, then I made the choice.
Story_ID: 2727
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your elementary school, and I'm wondering if you could give the name of it, anything, you know, significant about that experience, you know, going there or any teachers that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to two schools.  I went to Sylvanie, Sylvanie and I'll spell it for you S-Y-L-V-A-N-I-E, Williams [Sylvanie F. Williams School, New Orleans, Louisiana], which I guess who was a black woman that--for which the school was named, for the first through fourth, grade.  And that was not very far from where I lived, so we walked--I walked to school, like two or three blocks to the school.  And it was in that, school, several things happened.  The principal came to us on the first time we were taking the standardized test, which might have been first, second or third grade.  I don't know where.  But he leaned over the shoulder--he went--we were taking the test and he said, "Answer the questions you know first, as fast as you can.  And then go back and get the rest of them."  And to me, that is the most significant information I ever got in school because that's, the secret to taking standardized tests.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean I really like couldn't have been more than--left out of the school at fourth grade so it had to be like second or third grade.  And one other time I raised my hand in his class, and the guy looked around the class, and he said, he said, "Oh, no, that's Gloria," my name was Johnson.  He said, "That's Gloria, that's, Miss Johnson.  She knows the answer," (Unclear) which was like, which was like an affirmation of whatever I might, have known.  So those were, those were two significant experiences from my first through fourth.  And then when I went to the second school which was Thomy LaFon, T-H-O-M-Y, and then LaFon is L-A-F-O-N, a black man apparently who had been a realtor, owned a lot of property, left a lot of money to, charitable institutions in New Orleans [Louisiana].  I went to that school and basically did well, but I was coming in, the middle of a group of people who had come from fourth, first grade, so I found my way in the middle at, fifth grade. But had two, again, some significant experiences.  I talked a lot in class, just talked all talk, talk, talk.  I would just be, you know, I'd finish my lesson and I would just talk.  I would talk.  I would be (unclear).  The man, the principal, I mean the teacher, a guy named Willard Keller, I'll never forget Mr. Keller, put me in the corner.  Took me out of my chair, and put me in a folding chair next to the, radiator pipe for the whole school year, with a pad in my--and I sat and wrote my lesson in this chair in the corner, basically a dunce corner, the whole year. Never told my mother about it because I, would have had to explain why I was put the class--except that when you think about it now, what an absolute, I mean, you know, that's an ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] piece or anything else for the time.  I mean I sat in this corner the whole year, never had a desk, never had a desk, the whole year of my eighth grade class.  And I finished at the top of the class.  I mean I but I never had a desk.  I mean I don't know what I would have done if I had been--
Speaker 1: Teacher sounds like a little--that was--seems a little extreme.
Speaker 2: Well, I think so too, but he put me in this--I mean it's like he's--I guess at some point, I don't know where it was in the school year, but he got tired of me talking and moving around and jumping all over.  And he set me in this (unclear) and I sat there the whole year.  My mother [Vina Velma Johnson] found out about it after I graduated.
Speaker 1: Now, what precipitated the move to that, to the second elementary school?
Speaker 2: You know, one school went, was one to four.
Speaker 1: Okay, and okay.
Speaker 2: And then the other thing is we moved to another neighborhood.  And this school was not far away from, well, actually, it is far away, but it was the school  my mother--actually, my mother went to that same high, to the same grammar school.  And it was the school we went to.  And the learning was good.  I think we did well.  You know, I finished like number one in that class and with a lot of honors.  And, again, lots of validation of a lot of things.  I have some we just had our fiftieth class reunion in 2000, which I organized and got a lot of people back.  So, we still have--I still have a lot of friends, some of whom are very close that, I talk to on a regular basis who are from that, from that experience.  So it was good.  I mean and, then I left and went to high school.

Speaker 1: Do you remember anyone, any teacher, any adults saying, you know, you're smart?
Speaker 2: Let me just tell you about that.  Let me tell you about the experience I had at this same school [Thomy LaFon Elementary School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  There was a teacher, whom unfortunately I did not find again as an adult until, and find out where he was until he had died.  But, I had a teacher named Mr. Delay who had been in World War II and had come back crippled and I, and I don't--and walked with a limp. But who was such an insightful person who gave me such a sense of myself and, and my ability.  He was my sixth grade teacher.  And I made a comment about in these days, in this day and time, he would have difficulty.  We would have had difficulty because, basically, somebody would have, accused us--accused him of behavior that was not becoming because we sat in--I, went to, downstairs in the cafeteria everyday, got his lunch.  And I sat in, the room with him.  The two of us sat in the room and talked every lunch period about what you want to do in life, about where you want to go, about what kind of possibilities, about--.  One conversation I had, we talked about how you string clothes across the line so that you don't have to--so that you don't use all of the line by hanging clothes between the lines.  I mean, many kind of--I mean it was just like here was somebody who said, "I think that you are brilliant.  I think that you have so many possibilities."  Actually, he was trying to find a way if I had any relatives that lived any place else for me to be able to go away to school.  But I mean every single day, we validated me and myself and my sense of, my abilities, and the willingness to work, and here's another project.  And here's something else to do.  And here's how you think about it.  And here's there's a world beyond where we live.  And you can participate in that world.  And you can do well in that world.  I mean that's what I got.  Just, absolutely, just, an incredible kind of experience.  And so, yes, I mean I would talk about that school, about those two and those two would probably be some, of the more significant events that happened.  But, just very solid, very solid.  I mean very, very pleased to be there, found myself, did not have any problem at all being who I was.  Being able to move about.  One of the things that I'll tap on if--I don't know what our time is in terms of college, because that has another significance in terms of--in terms of New Orleans and color.  But this is not something I experienced until I went to, college.
Speaker 1: I'm, yeah, because I was going to ask that because New Orleans especially, the, whole culture.  But I have--so do you know why he, took an interest in you?
Speaker 2: He thought I was smart.  He thought I--he liked--he thought I was smart.  I was willing to work.  You know, I--part of the problem, we're laughing in fact, I was raised to be a good child in a sense.  And that's to be obedient, to be as hardworking as you can, to be as--to be in line, you know.  To be in--to basically be in line and to--and so, I'm in class with a bunch of kids.  And if I'm the one whose got the hand up the most, who knows the answers, whose willing to talk, whose willing to--and, whose willing to do the additional work.  He just saw me.  I don't know.  Like I say, he was--we, went to--I went to high--I went grammar school from 1946 to 1950, this school.  So that most--and there may be ten or twelve men who had just come back from World War II.  So here are men coming into a--to the elementary school system who were coming in, probably with a lot of experiences.  Many, many of them coming from having been farther away than most people had ever envisioned they would ever be in life.  And, therefore, coming in seeing so much, and then seeing somebody who looks like maybe, you have the potential to be something, to do something else beyond walking up and down the same street and maybe and took an interest.  That's, the only thing I can think about it.  But just really, just exceptional.  Just very interesting, and I, would go home every day and talk to my mother about it.  Mr. Delay, what we talked about today, what we talked about today, you know, just, that.
Speaker 1: Seems nice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very nice, very nice.
Story_ID: 2729
Speaker 1: When you went to high school, what, was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: The high school I went to was McDonogh, and that's M-C-D-O-N-O-G-H, #35 [Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  There was a guy, John McDonogh, who came from Maryland I think is the story that we got, who came and gave a bunch of money--gave a lot of money to the schools in New Orleans [Louisiana].  I don't, I really don't know.  And there are a whole series of schools that are named after him.  And McDonogh #35 was the school that was, in terms of--again we're in a segregated environment because I graduated from high school two weeks after the desegregation decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas] of 1954.  So that we--that was a black school, the school that, the high school.  And it was the one that had college preparation.  And so that was the focus.  People were-- basically everybody went to school, they were--there was an interest and, desire to, for the people who wanted to go to college.  That was the school that most people went to.
Speaker 1: So what was--this is a pretty insular environment, were you aware--I mean I find New Orleans [Louisiana] just, I don't know, but every time I go there, I find it sort of interesting, but I can't quite figure it out.  And I'm wondering, were you insular in the black community of your environment?  Did you have exposure much outside?  You know, it appears to be a very nurturing environment, you know, the people are really raising you up, they've identified you while raising you up.  But I, I'm just wondering--.
Speaker 2: But, you don't, hit that until after.  You don't hit that until a later point.  And see, I actually didn't really hit it in New Orleans because I went--in '54 [1954] I finished high school.  '54 [1954] to '58 [1958] I went to college.  And so I went to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] and that basically is just a wider--even though probably in the experience, there are at least white professors and there are the, there are a number of other people that you would have on a day-to-day.  In my experience, there was never anybody white in the school in the day-to-day school systems, in the, whole system from the time I went to, from the time I went to, to first grade until the time I graduated from high school.  We had a superintendent, a few people who might have been supervisors and who might have come around the school occasionally, but in terms of the day-to-day experience, there was nobody white.  Xavier had a few people.  The nuns were, the nuns, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament were white.  And there were a number professors who were white, but by and large--and so you, so then at, from that experience, you got at least a glimpse of what the, a broader world would be.  And that was like the first experience that I had had with anybody who was non-black in any, in any setting.
Story_ID: 2730
Speaker 1: You had started to talk about, you know, you, the valedictorian that you were in line for.  You were in line for being, you know, being--you were in a tie, probably in a tie. Were you in a tie with?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, you know, if, you had rounded it off, we would have been ninety-three each of us.  And just the question about whether or not to divide it up, you know.  And it was really something that I had really anticipated, and I had set my sights, I had basically worked.  And I had worked in the broader sense.  Something interesting that you don't think about, and now we would all laugh about because it now, nobody black would be looking for the American Legion Award [academic scholarship].  But it's just like--.  But one of my friends, who was like a mentor of mine, had received the American Legion Award maybe, I finished in '54 [1954] so maybe in 1950 or '51 [1951].  And so I wanted to be like her.  So it's like, so when my time came, it was like I was hoping to be but I didn't wind up getting it.  I think probably it was two or three outspoken (unclear).  But I was the broad participant, active.  And in high school [at McDonogh #35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] is where I learned to--is where I started singing.  Music teacher picked me out around the piano in my second year in high school and started me singing.  And so I had been very much involved in social activities and whatever there was that would make the school go.  I mean I, I'm organized a group.  I'm pulling up people.  I mean I've organized a reunion for all of my class, college classes.  I mean I to the point where I pass it on to my children.  And twenty, twenty-five, forty, thirty and forty spoke at the community--you know, I mean it's that, it's that kind of I was always--was very much involved in, these groups.  So that's what I was doing.  So I really had looked forward in anticipation of doing that, but it's like I had been a little bad girl so they had (laughter) so since (unclear) some are things are subjective, you wind up being subjected.  So that went through.  So I mean I-- so I was, yes, I was disappointed.  And I, and I think it was an interesting piece.  We were talking about my mother [Vina Velma Johnson], the nurturer.  The day that they made the announcement, and I came home, I walked up on the front porch and she jumped up my mother was a hairdresser.  And had a shop, had a beauty shop on the, in the front, in the front room on one side of the house that we lived in.  We had like a double-sided house, and on one side, the living room, instead of the living room, she had a beauty shop.  So when I walked up on my porch, she jumped off the stool and came running out the door.  And she said, "I heard your steps and I knew something was wrong."  And so I, you know, I must have told, just told her about that.  You know, it's like in the end, you know it, it's something that happened.  And it's, and in many ways as I've learned, am learning listening to my children, it may be one of those kind of experiences where it may be better for you at sixteen than it is at forty-six (laughs) to come across your first failure.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you think the lesson was at that point?  Or were you just thinking that, "That teacher, forget him, I mean I'm going to--."
Speaker 2: Well, the lesson was, the lesson was real, the lesson was real.  I was supposed to have done what I was supposed to have done.  And that's really what the lesson is.  I mean it's like I could be mad at him all my life, but I-- but he told us, specifically, "Do this assignment."  And I wanted--and I was--I just started singing.  And a friend of mine was playing.  And I wanted to watch and do what she--watch what she was doing and work with her on her piece.  And I didn't do my piece.  You know, I mean I--and I, really loved the guy who was the music teacher.  So I mean--so it isn't--it was, like I could be mad with him, but I couldn't be mad with him beyond the reality of what I had done myself.  You know, so, I mean it's a--it's one of those pieces you do.  And so I'm saying, so you really do, even now looking back thirty-five, forty years, you recognize that it really is probably better to learn the failure and be able to acknowledge what your part is early on, so that you understand that when, if it does hit at some point, when you've never had it before, what a painful piece it can be.
Story_ID: 2731
Speaker 1: When you decide to go away to college, I mean, you know, when the decision was to go away to college, was there a decision about where to go?
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't go away to college.  I went to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Xavier's in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: That's what I mean.  Okay, I mean, but was there a--I didn't mean I mean going to college period.  Was there a decision about where you were actually going to go?  I mean was that or was it assumed that you were going to go to Xavier?  That's what I mean.
Speaker 2: Probably more assumed.  The only--we had talked.  My mother [Vina Velma Johnson] had talked at some point about Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], but probably financially, it was just going to be more of a hardship than she wanted to do in terms of room and board and all the other traveling and things.  So basically, we were pretty much set on Xavier, and they gave the scholarship.  It was, at, the time probably, of the schools, probably the more predominant of the schools of (unclear) and those were my choices.  Though the, the desegregation had just occurred and so I wrote the same music teacher who I think ran around in some circles that included black and white in terms of musicians, had talked about the fact that Tulane [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] might have been at the point where they would have accepted somebody.  So I sent an application to them, but they, they basically, turned me down and said, basically, this was a school for--it was started by Paul Tulane [philanthropist] for white men.  And, therefore, that, you know, whatever I had heard was not, in fact, so.  That it, you know, that basically they were not admitting black people at this point.  But that was like the minute after, that was like the minute or two after the decision, desegregation decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, 1954].  So it must have been another five or six years, maybe ten even, years, before they really got into accepting black, black students.
Story_ID: 2732
Speaker 1: Do you remember any discussions around Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, 1954]? And that decision and the feelings or, you know, the--.
Speaker 2: You know, I remember we had this one teacher [at McDonogh #35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] named Mr. Germaine, Mr. Germaine, who was from the--across from Haiti--the Dominican Republic.  And he was maybe in March, April, he was trying to get our class excited about what was possibly happening.  And most of our people were not paying any attention to it at all.  So, you know, it was like, "What's the deal, what's the deal?"  And he talked, I just remember talking so much about it.  I mean the most historic thing in the world, I mean the, whole thing in terms of how it affects us, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  It's coming up.  So, yes, we heard it, but, yes, it didn't have any--didn't have any reality to us, not as it came up, not, as, not as it came to us.  You know, because what happens is you grow up black in a black environment.  You adjust to being black.  And in some ways, you adjust to where you are.  And you, you know about other things, but you don't spend your days trying to figure out, can I go across the street to play?  I mean you figure you how to play where you, are.  And it's a, good side and a bad side because obviously that keeps you from aspiring to go across the street, but in the meantime, it doesn't have you sitting around throwing rocks across the street and losing your time in your own effort when, in fact, there are other things to be done, if you can, in fact, deal with it.  I mean if you, if, in fact, you can make the changes.  So, yes, it came.  And then it came and I--because I'm saying, I mean I'm, I'm telling you my graduation date is June 5, 1954.  So I'm two and a half weeks, two weeks and what, like nineteen days.  And so it's really very close to it and very much a part of it so that what I say about my experiences, all my experience, all of my training, was in a segregated, fully segregated environment, so that I have no experiences, outside of that whole piece.  And then we had, basically we had teachers who were there basically, trying to figure out how to make us be as good as we could be at every level, and that was the whole game.  I mean just trying to figure out--we had a principal who said, "Negroes cannot afford the 'Sloppy Joe' movement."  That's Mr. Lucien V. Alexis, who was absolutely brilliant in a variety of different ways.  But he, his piece was we can, you cannot afford to walk around looking sloppy.  You cannot afford to walk around thinking that you can get by and do whatever you want to do, that sooner or later, you have got to recognize that you'll get caught by this--that white people can go take a bath, comb their hair, put on a suit and be your boss in five seconds.  And you're still down and you're now penalized by all the, negative behavior that you have.  So that was, so those were the kind of lessons and the kind of information that I mean that's the kind of stuff in front of you.  So you were always focused on that and recognizing that this is, a world that is not fair.  It is not right, but it is.  And the real reality is trying to figure out how do you live within the world that you are in, while you keep your eye on whatever changes that are going to go on, but make--but not, having yourself absolutely thwarted by, all the things that do exist.
Story_ID: 2733
Speaker 1: You're at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Are you--do you go and are you resident or are you living at home?
Speaker 2: No, I live at home.
Speaker 1: You live at home.
Speaker 2: I live at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how is this experience?
Speaker 2: This is good.  This is good.  I'm a participant.  I had a negative experience when I, graduated from high school [McDonogh #35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] in that my friend, my best--it's like something happened and, in terms of maybe the salutatorian and some other things in terms of students.  And my, best friend says, "You know, the people--the kids really don't like you because you talk to the teachers and you do whatever, they says--you, you really don't pay attention to them."  This is my best friend.  It's my best friend to this day, you know.  It's like, and so it was like, I didn't, I didn't--they weren't on my mind.  They, I mean I didn't think about them.  And it was like basically, my life was like (pointing straight ahead) in that direction.  And so I didn't sit around and talk.  I mean to this day, I don't gossip much.  You know, and I don't do a lot of little things that people do in terms of friendly things.  So I've got one or two friends, or three or four friends, you know, but I don't have a, you know, I just never did a whole bunch of socializing and (unclear).  I just never did.  And, and really don't do it to this day.  So she said, "Um, you know, they don't like you because you didn't do this, you didn't remember to talk, you didn't think about it, you kind of ran ahead of everybody.  You had it, you had your hands up."  So when I went to college, I said, "Okay, I'll change."  So I mean I just decided.  I mean I became aware of myself.  And so, you say, "Hello, how are, my name, my name's Gloria."  I'll do whatever else.  "Is there something I can do to help you move around?"  And so by the time I finished college, I was voted the most likely to succeed, best personality and the best dressed.  And I sewed my way through college and sang my way through college.  And, probably would have been homecoming queen except that the, people--I had been, I was in homecoming court, this, my junior year, but not--but I wasn't the queen my senior because I just didn't start in time.  My mother [Vina Velma Johnson] was really happy that I didn't because she said that she didn't have the money to buy all the clothes.  So she didn't really give a push, push but, I was very popular, got along very well.  I mean really kind of got in--I mean I would say Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] was the place that gave me my transition in terms of how you get through life and how you get along and, how you make the most of what your gifts are, because the problem is not just having gifts.  The problem is how do you make the most of the gifts.  And my, high school experience had not allowed me to make the most of my gifts.  My college experience did.  And so I got, I would a good name, good name, good people from my college and from the participation from the things that I did, from the things that I learned.  And it really kind of like moved me in the phase in terms of life.
Speaker 1: Now, what things did you learn there?  I mean that have stood you well.  But I, yeah, answer that question and then I--
Speaker 2: Well, I, got a good solid academic background, which then allowed me to go out because then you went away, because you see, you, do the undergraduate school.  I mean you basically have been in a, in an environment, in a protective environment from zero now through here.  And even though there is, there's a mixed faculty, it is still basically a black college and the focus is--and all the students are black and pretty much, basically, people are trying to--and you measure yourself against that.  From that point on, when you start going to graduate school and professional schools and whatever else, you're, now out to the world. Now, the question is will you be able to stand well?  And so the one thing I would say most of all that I got from them, I did get from them, the ability to be able to go out and stand.
Story_ID: 2734
Speaker 1: There was an issue around color.  You know, and I wanted to ask you, I think and, and it was around--was around the, sorority or was it around--?
Speaker 2: Well, the sororities were all, in my time, the sororities were all off campus [at Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] .  And I don't know what had happened.  I don't know whether or not it had been color, had been hazing--could have been some variation on hazing, I'm sure and I don't know, but they were off from maybe '54 [1954], '50 [1950], but before we got in until after were out.  So nobody from my time in college became a member of an undergraduate chapter at the--in the--with any of the Greek organization, not sororities nor fraternities.  All of them were banned from the campus.  So I don't know when they came back on campus.  But, so that was not it.  But I'm certain that color was probably involved in it and maybe some class piece or whatever.  I had no idea, but I know that that was one of the pieces.  But my experience in terms of color was like, to some extent, a degree of color blindness.  And that is, I had basically been made to be a person.  And what color I was, was not what I looked at.  Basically, I came and brought the issue.  I performed.  I participated.  And I was in.  And obviously, I wasn't going to somebody's house.  And there were a number of times when you could see the difficulty in some of the men and some of the choices because basically, people were very, very strict about making sure that they did not choose out of group.  So that they wound marrying and therefore, having to look at down the road in a number places.  There were a number of instances.  But I didn't have any real problem probably because basically I had come--I was smart enough to be able to get along in terms of school, in terms of what I was doing.  I was in pre-med [preparatory course for medical school].  So basically, I was with a bunch of guys to start with.  And I got along.  I mean I got--I mean I had developed the whole personality piece.  I got along with--so I got guys and I got along with their girlfriends.  So that gave me a solid group of people with whom I had, an ongoing relationship.  And then by performance I was able to, like move myself and notch myself into whatever I was doing.  So it, worked--college worked out really well for me.  I don't, have any bad experience.  The funniest thing that happened is when I went back for my twentieth, twenty-fifth, twenty-fifth, maybe twenty-fifth class reunion, what--well, twenty or twenty-fifth, whenever.  The guys--the comment was that they called me 'Blackie Blue Juice.'  And remember they--the expression is, "The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice."  So I, and this is, something I find out twenty-five, thirty years later, twenty-five years later.  They called me Blackie, 'Blackie Blue Juice.'  Now, it's sufficient to say (unclear) (laughter) here you and I was like, okay.  I mean I--that, and that's, it.  Never to my face, never heard it, never heard the whole time I was in college, but did hear about twenty-five years later, being--going through the (unclear) hear, "Blackie the Blue Juice, Blackie Blue Juice."
Story_ID: 2735
Speaker 1: What did you major in [at Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], and--?
Speaker 2: Pre-med [preparatory course for medical school].
Speaker 1: Okay, pre-med.  So, so did you have any, a sense--did you like all those courses?  Were you, you know.
Speaker 2: It wasn't a matter of whether I liked them or not.  It was I was doing it.  I was--that's what I was going to do.  That's what I would, that's what I had to do in order to succeed.  Now, in the meantime, I had discovered singing.  But it wasn't a reasonable choice because that wasn't anything my mother [Vina Velma Johnson] was going to support.  So I just, so I did it.  I got in.  I could do it.  I was at least as smart as most of the people in my--maybe like probably one or two or three out of the group.  So I had a place.  I got along.  The work wasn't hard.  My first semester in chemistry, was very hard because we had not had good chemistry in, high school [McDonogh #35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And I made sixty-nine on the first test.  Never had made a sixty-nine in my life.  And then the second test I made a sixty.  And I was like, "Oh, no.  I can't fail."  So I went to the professor, and I said to him--Mr. Peter Paytash, who was a, Quaker who had come to Xavier [University] maybe twenty-five or thirty years before and basically, devoted his life to pulling us, seeing that we all got to medical school, as many as we could.  And I just said to him, "I can't, you know, I--these are my two grades and I, don't understand.  I didn't have much preparation beforehand, but I am not prepared to fail.  You know, can you help me?"  So he said, "Okay, well here, here's the problem.  Go write on the board."  And then every afternoon after class, I went and worked the problems on the board and then he would help me, and give me little stuff.  And then next test I made a ninety-three.  So I mean I had kind of like gotten the groove, in terms of doing it.  But we had never, I had, we had never--and the, interesting piece about my talking about music is that the, chemistry teacher we had in high school was really a frustrated musician.  He transposed music almost the whole day.  He would write music scores.  And, really didn't have any real interest in, chemistry.  So he did enough, put the, put the problem up, whatever, but really, nobody really I, don't know of any people who really learned any chemistry in his class.  So when I got to chemistry, I was hampered by having had a poor experience in high school.  But the guy, Paytash, really helped us all, helped me and helped a number of people and,  gave you that sense, you know.  He was the first person I ever heard talk about cigarette smoking, really anti-cigarette smoking and about lung cancer and everything.  This is like '54 [1954].  So I never smoked, my, parents didn't at the time.  And so I never--and so when he talked, I never smoked.  I never, so I never had the occasion to smoke at all.  And, largely, first of all because my parents didn't smoke, but, the other piece was him talking about it at such an early time.
Story_ID: 2736
Speaker 1: You started singing really in high school [McDonogh #35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: When I, in high school.
Speaker 1: And you're a contralto, right?
Speaker 2: I started off as a contralto.  The first--when I first started contralto, what I found is that I actually had a mezzo-soprano range.  So, but initially, in the, first piece that I did, I was, in a competition as contralto.  Like almost two minutes after the man heard I, heard me singing.  So it was, an interesting experience.  And as I go back over it now and look at some of the difficulty in terms of some of the music that we did in high school.  It was just like, they gave you a sense of any--I mean we did--the first piece I did was something from 'The Holy City--' [spiritual].  "eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard."  Absolutely wonderful piece of music, hard as all get out.  I mean I learned it in the last five or six years.  It was like, this is a hard piece of music.  I mean I'm twelve years old, my first time singing thirteen, I'm thirteen, I'm, this is my first time singing.  Next piece I did, when a concert on the stage was 'City Called Heaven' [spiritual].  And then the next thing I know, from the spring we were doing a concert, we would do excerpts from the opera 'Mignon' [by Ambroise Thomas].  And the piece, I've tried to learn it in the last year or so, it's still, I mean it's hard to get.  I mean it's like--but the, idea was it's here, somebody's done it; you can do it.  You can do it.  Just do it.  And you got up and did it.  And it's, just amazing.  When I look at, back on, "God, how could you--?"  Thirteen, fourteen years old, you know, never really had a whole lot of formal training.  Just here's the music.  We'll take you through it. You'll learn it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the time when you first found your voice?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you I was standing around the piano.  The man found me, I mean I, never had--I was singing with a group of people and he said, "Gloria, come over here, come over here.  Come over here."  Just picked me out.  And, I was making like, the faces like, you know, you make when you're a teenager.  I thought, "Is he talking to me?"  And then you--then I just--then it's like it's--and, that's a good way to--that's a good expression because that's what it is.  It really is knowing that you can open your mouth and sing.  It was a while, because I mean I, like I said, when in, less than three or four months from the time I, he heard me sing, I was standing up on the stage in a competition, which is certainly not what would be considered a usual piece.  So I--it just happened and it, came to me.  And then it was around the same time I was singing in the junior choir at my church.  And so that was a whole other experience with somebody else that I liked very much and, a chance to sing with my peers and maybe a couple other small things that, I did.  But that's how it got started.  And liked it from the beginning, did well at it because it really is, it really is a whole performance.  I mean it's like--and I really didn't think about myself in that whole stage but it's like the whole business of--you are raised to the, you know, the whole business of (unclear).  So you're standing and everybody is trying to figure out how you, put your best foot forward.  I mean that's really--it's like you're getting dressed and you've got everything in place.  So that's really what, so much of what, what the music and the stage is about.  So the more I did that, the more I liked it.  But again, I was already--a man asked me, heard me sing who was one of the music teachers at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], and he asked me if he could train me, thought I had a wonderful voice, that I could really be fabulous opera singer.  And I said to him, "Oh no.  Mr., I can't do that.  My mother [Vina Velma Johnson] would kill me if I came home and said I want to be a singer.  And I just know there's no way to even possibly consider it."  So I just left that.  I mean you just know.  And I think it's interesting because I didn't really know then--I said it on my mother, but the truth is, I wouldn't have--if I had started singing then, I wouldn't have been able to go to medicine because I would have loved--I mean I loved singing now as much as I love anything I've ever done and that, you know, and I, could, I would have been consumed by it.  Then I would be like all the other music majors running around trying to find a place to sing, trying to find a piano.  So, that was, my experience and so that was, that was college, that was high school.  That was college, that was singing and how it came.  And I, I did that until I finished college.  And then I went to medical school, and then I sang in a little choir, in the choir in the medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And then I never, then after that I didn't sing, you know, for about twenty-five years.
Story_ID: 2737
Speaker 1: Medical school.  Was there--? And your decision to go to medical school.  I mean you already were going, but what--were there places that you looked at besides Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?  Or was Howard in your sight view?
Speaker 2: Howard and Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and were, basically, you know, remember now, this is '50s [1950s].  We're, basically still in a black environment.  We're still looking in that focus.  I'm looking--we're looking at Howard and Meharry.  I'm not--I don't have any line on LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] or Tulane [University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I mean I don't have any line any place else.  And these would be my, state schools, so if I don't have a line on them, then obviously, I'm looking at the places where I'm likely to go.  So I got accepted at Howard and Meharry.  And I chose Howard because my mother had always talked about, had always some idea about Howard over the years, you know, just to Washington [D.C.], the school, all the history of the school.  And so I was off to, Howard.  And didn't think about it, I found just in the last month, I found my letter of acceptance and a number of things of Howard.  I got all of the, all the experiences, the day I got there and all the other pieces and found all the papers.  I found the first--I found the telegram from my parents on my first birthday away from home, you know, in 195- in 1958, when I went to medical school.  It was really interesting.
Story_ID: 2738
Speaker 1: How did you feel when you--because this is really your first time away, from home.  And, you know, and you're actually getting ready.  It's 1958 and you are--?
Speaker 2: Well, I sewed the whole summer.  I made--because I, made a whole wardrobe of clothes (unclear).  I sewed the whole summer.  I mean I sewed all day long.  I ate watermelon two or three times a day for my, floor and I sewed all day long.  When I went away to school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], I, packed a trunk full of clothes that I had made for myself.  I sewed all day long.  I tell you, I told you I had been voted the best dresser out of college [at Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And that was with my clothes that I made.  I mean I sewed the whole (laughing) time.  And all day long in the summertime, all, all summer long.
Speaker 1: You were eating watermelon to keep your figure?
Speaker 2: No, I, was just eating watermelon cause I love watermelon.  And, that's why I ate watermelon from morning and then I would get to sewing and it would maybe late in the afternoon before I'd think about food again.  And then I'd eat another piece of watermelon.  And that was what I ate the summer.  And then I sewed, but I sewed. That's really what that's the, summer before I went to medical school.  I sewed the whole summer.
Speaker 1: So you arrived in good shape then.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean I had trunk full of clothes.  It was like I was pulling out stuff and pulling out stuff.  I mean I had sewed the whole summer.
Speaker 1: I bet there were other students who like-- (laughs).
Speaker 2: I sewed the whole summer, I'm telling you. As I'm thinking about that, because I had sewed in, I had sewed in college.  I started sewing in high school [at McDonogh #35 High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Would you believe that the woman who taught me sewing in sixth grade is still alive?  And (laughs) looking, is about this size.  I mean just like and is, and is dressed as neatly and has everything in place, as she was fifty odd years ago.  Anyway, I see her from time to time when I, when I'm in New Orleans [Louisiana].  But, that, that was it.  So I did I sewed.  And I sewed.  Sometimes I sewed, as we used to say, for out, like taking of some pieces.  I sewed lots of things for mother [Vina Velma Johnson] and for my sister [Joyce Johnson Burton].
Speaker 1: So you're a very good seamstress.
Speaker 2: I had been, I had been.  I haven't I mean it's hard to get you got to get your hands back in, but I was at one time.  I was really very good, and, and could well have--and a designer beyond just a, just beyond a pattern sewer.
Speaker 1: So you could decide what you wanted to change in the pattern and just--.
Speaker 2: I'm so sorry, and I had another picture of me in home, when I was in the homecoming court with a dress on that a friend of mine and I made.  And I, didn't even think about it because I when I took, out one, when I took out one picture, the picture behind it was a picture of me and my date for that night in this dress that we made, that I made.  We just looked at it in the newspaper.  We got on the floor.  We cut out a pattern, and we made the dress.  Yeah, but, you know, so it was really, life was about possibilities. It was about how many more things can I do because I didn't know what I'll need to help me cross over.  It was, you never know--and the, and the biggest admonition was that you were always trying to make sure that you didn't wind up working for some white people, in their kitchen.  That was always like, you know, you never wanted to wind up in someone--I mean that was like the, at the bottom of what--you know, so I had, I have a black, white experience.  I mean America to me was a black, white country.  You know, that's my, you know, my experiences, and I, and I'm able to take the very positive experiences that I've, had in a, fully integrated society and being able to participate.  But I had--but my experiences are truly of a black person, living in a society that is basically not favorably disposed to black people.  And trying to figure out then how you do the best that you can in that whole circumstances.
Story_ID: 2739
Speaker 1: You get there.  So what is it--what (unclear) you at Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?  It's different from Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] in some respects, but you're in the medical school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're in the medical school.  So we're not in the--we're in the medical school and the medical school's one building by itself.  And, the first day I'm there, I walk down the hall and I walk down the street and I meet one guy who's my classmate, a guy named Caldwell.  I think he's practicing, still practicing in Chicago [Illinois].  And then I meet Frances Cress who was from Chicago, whose now Dr. Frances Cress Welsing [author, psychiatrist], and who's a psychiatrist, fairly well known, in terms of, some, theory and some discussion [analysis of white supremacy].  And we become friends that day.  And we lock and we are we talked two days ago, and we had locked on to each other for life.  You know, so that, it's what I tell everybody.  If you go someplace and it's strange and different, find a friend.  Find somebody that you have common, share common interests in, and you can go through any experience in life, if you can find a partner from time to time.  It's very difficult sometimes to be in a very strange place and be altogether by yourself.  You just need to have somebody else who doesn't make you seem different.  And so Frances and I became the best of buddies.  And then we, were there.
Speaker 1: Was it difficult?
Speaker 2: School?  No.  No, it was.  I had learned.  I took Latin in my senior year of high school, which gave me such a broad base of understanding and knowing the English language.  Between what you would do with a base, with a root and a suffix and prefix, you could make almost any word you needed to make in medicine.  I didn't buy a dictionary until almost the end of the first semester when the professor called, called out, asked to make sure everybody had a dictionary, and I raised my hand like stupidly, and said I didn't.  He was like, you (unclear) tried to disgrace me for not having one, but I had not needed one because almost any word I could, almost define almost any word in terms of most of the routine things we had to do, in terms of prefix, suffixes, from the Latin.  And I got along, I got along okay.  I mean I didn't--it was hard.  You just have to it was, I'm not trying to say that I was easy, and that I, even study.  You studied, but it was not difficult in the sense that it was not anything other than what you had expected.  You expected it to be hard.
Story_ID: 2740
Speaker 1: How many women were in your class?
Speaker 2: Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] was a very, special place.  In my we had a class of a hundred and I think we may have had ten, twelve women in my class.  This is, and this is like forty odd years ago.  I would say maybe ten, somewhere in range of ten or so.  And Howard was even though it was predominantly black, it was, there were also a number of white students, particularly, I mean the Jewish students, who, there were maybe, and maybe up to ten other than, than black people in the, class.  So it may be a little more than that if I count about it.  So it was good and people from New York and California and somebody from Alabama and somebody from, maybe one somebody else from Louisiana.  I don't remember if somebody was in my class.  I mean, but people from all over the country.  A couple of people from the islands, somebody from Africa.  You know, so it was like the first real, real world experience.
Story_ID: 2741
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense about what, kind of medicine you wanted to practice?  It wasn't so much specialization then too, was it?
Speaker 2: No, it was just, we just at the edge of it, you know.  I was, I actually, initially, wanted to, thought in terms of ENT [ear, nose, and throat] because it had been, ENT had been my major experience because I had had tonsillitis and sinusitis and earache and the whole--I had, been focused in that, area.  And I had thought in terms of doing then, and then the specialty was eye, ear, nose and throat.  It was, the two of them were combined.  And I had thought about that, and, in some way in my early training I found that, my eyesight wasn't the world's best and I was like squinting all the time.  And I was having to change, and I said, well, I really don't want to be limited to this focus.  But I had, actually what I said when I went to medical school, which really kind of basic to who, to how I kind of have lived my life, and as I kind of some days think, maybe you didn't do it the right way.  When I went to medical school in the application that I wrote, I said, "I believe that I would be--" why should you chose me in the, question, in the questionnaire kind of piece.  And I said, "I think that I would make a great contribution to the practice of medicine because as a woman, I believe that I would be free to explore possibilities that many of our male colleagues would not be able to do because they would have the responsibility of taking care of their wives and families."  But I assumed that, I assumed in my life, based on what my experience had been, that I would marry somebody who would take care of me.  And, therefore, I would then be free to be able to explore and to do and to venture out in ways, which is pretty much what I did.  I mean I'd, you know, I, didn't go to medicine to make money.  I went to medicine to do, to be able to serve, to be able to practice, not so much even the specific of, just working, but to be able to have an influence.  And you said something earlier on was a word not, was to make a difference.  It really was, I mean really, I got excited about it when I was in college [at Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And I looked at poor people and I thought, we--I can make a difference in what they do.  I mean I, felt that riding on the bus, going back to college because the people there was a, the neighborhood we passed through and the people would be sitting on the porch just looking all broken down.  And I thought maybe there might be something that you might be able to do.  And that really is, was really how, what crystallized in my mind about what I wanted to do.  So when I got out, it, wasn't that I have to take a job that pays the most money or that gives me the longest in terms of future, but really is the one that gives me a chance to do the best.  And so that, that was, that's how I got started and got focused in.
Speaker 1: You know, that seems so refreshing because, you know, for a long time, most people, you know, people have gone for a long time, you know, for money and all the other things that sort of go with those professions.
Story_ID: 2742
Speaker 1: Now, there wasn't anything--I know you said there were--were there--there was nothing on the professors that you're taking up the seat of a man.  It wasn't any of those, was there?
Speaker 2: You know, I had that, I had the little note a couple times where a couple of my colleagues when I was in undergrad school at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] there was one, this one guy in particular.  We had this club called the ChemiBioPhys which was chemi-, bi-, biology and physics.  And they were like a pre-whatever else kind of group.  And we went in the group and there's some kind of way in the initiation this one guy said, who was about five feet two [inches], "How long are you going to be in?"  "How long you going to be, in pre-med?"  I'm in pre-med, we're in first day, whenever.  "How long you going to be here or you just going to just take up a seat, are you just going to take up a seat for somebody else who could be in place and go to medical school?"  You know, so it was that kind of comment.  And I, and really, maybe every now and then a little bit of note on that but, not really, not, really because be like I said because pretty much, you know, if you can it wasn't, I was, it was not a challenge.  And like I told you, I think that in many ways, I grew up with the mission to become a physician, but also almost like with permission because I was not basically viewed as a girl as much as I was viewed as a person who could do it.  You, understand what I'm saying.  So that when I was in college with the I was one of the boys, not in any masculine way, but just one of the people who when you sat and took the seat and took a test; that if they had five tests, that I was going to probably come out somewhere between one and three, out of the five in terms of who was going to answer.  And maybe it was going to come out, you know, it was that, kind of, experience.  So that it was kind of like a respect and maybe even sometimes, sometimes even deference.  And so I didn't have a lot of problems.  I didn't have, I did not have a lot of problems.
Story_ID: 2743
Speaker 1: You were there two years [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: And then I, went to--and then I got married and then I came to Chicago [Illinois].  And then I went to [University of] Illinois [at Chicago, College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So you met your husband in, at Howard?
Speaker 2: No, I met my husband in, New Orleans at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And he had just come out of the [U.S.] Army and shortly thereafter, then we got married.
Speaker 1: And no, nothing about him being threatened with you being a lawyer.  I mean lawyer, not lawyer, I mean (laughter) doctor, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, you know, because you weren't a doctor at the time.  I mean I didn't think that was a thought.  And unfortunately, he actually should have gone to law cause he had been accepted to go to Washington [University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], Wash U to law school, and some kind of way in the discussion, but he was an artist, and some way back and forth in discussion, it was like, I said, I really that that's a special talent and he wasn't really sure he wanted to go, back and forth.  So he didn't go to law school. But--and I came to Illinois and that was an experience.
Speaker 1: Because okay, now why was it an experience?  Was it--?
Speaker 2: That was an experience because it was for me, this was my first altogether white experience.
Speaker 1: Right, the first all and really first sub--I mean, still [Washington] D.C. is still--,
Speaker 2: Southern, yeah.  This is my first real (unclear) with real American white--.
Speaker 1: Was he from Illinois?
Speaker 2: He had come, he had gotten out of the Army and had come to Chicago to live with a relative, working, the whole job opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was in, he was in fine arts.  So he was basically a graphic artist.  And so he came to Chicago for a job opportunity.  And then we decided to get married and it was like, "Oh, do you think you can transfer?  Do you think we can--I'll either come--I already got a job in, in Chicago.  What about you?  Do you think you can get, transfer the school?"  So, I mean nobody ever thinks about transferring medical school.  I mean I don't even know how I did that.  But I just, I did.  And I talked to the woman who I lived in the--this woman--in the house that I lived.  She said, "Nobody does anything in Washington [D.C.] without calling their, their senator."  So I called [U.S. Senator Everett] Dirksen's office.  You know, now do I know Dirksen?  Does Dirksen know me?  No, I called Dirksen's office.  And I guess Dirksen then just routinely passed the slip on to the people at [University of] Illinois [at Chicago College of Medicine].  So they called.  I don't know whether or not that affected my getting in or not, but she just said nobody does anything without their Senator (laughs).  I thought "Okay congressman."  So, it was really interesting.  So I got in Illinois and then there was one other black person in my class.  And it turns out that we lived in the same building.  You can't imagine I could come, move to Chicago in June and wind up living in the same building, in the 401 building in Lake Meadows [apartment complex], in the same building with a guy who was the only other black person in my class, you know, without having, ever having met him.  The day we met, and we were talking about where do you live.  It turns out we lived in the building, up two floors from each other.  Just such a story.  So the, experience of it was they were just--this forty years ago, this is forty--I, got there in '60 [1960].  So this is forty-two years ago.  I mean [the University of] Illinois [at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] still has a problem with, black, with the whole, in terms of enrollment, even at this point.  Even as well as they've done in the last twenty-five years or so, it's still not an, it's still not a skate, skate, skating experience, I mean skate through easy.  It was difficult from time to time.  It was--they don't give you anything to hold onto.  I mean it's, there's not, there's no reassurances.  There're no, I mean, "We're glad you're here.  Is there something we can do to help?"  You don't get that kind of, you didn't get that kind of sense of you know, everybody's looking at you.  And you're trying to figure out, well, is my slip hanging (laughs), you know.  I mean they're looking at, they look at you in such a way that you don't get any sense of support at all.  But, you know, I got through.  I got through.  I mean I got through.  If I would change again I would go to Howard first--I would go to Illinois first because I think they've got a better preclinical program.  I think Howard's got a--I think Howard makes better doctors as in people doctor, the kind of doctor that I wanted to be.  But I think Illinois trains better in terms of the sciences and the whatever else.  But it was a, it was a good experience.  I mean it was a good experience.  And, in fact, it was, it is the experience that really has probably tied, to which I have been tied the rest of my life.  And I mean, so I would go from Illinois and then same involvement with the medical center and, in terms of the urban health program and a variety of things, and then the eight years that I spent on the board as a trustee.  And almost everywhere I go, in some kind of way, I have some connect with Illinois.  So it's like the longest running experience I've had in Chicago.  I came here to go to [the University of] Illinois [at Chicago College of Medicine], and I continue back and forth to be associated with them.
Speaker 1: So do you--what do you think you learned out of that experience because part of it was difficult?  What did you learn that's sort of stood (unclear) because, you know, you, you even said, "I didn't come to stay."  You know, you weren't--this was not planning to be home, even though you're, you married here, was it?
Speaker 2: No, I had always planned before I, before I went away to school that I would go back to New Orleans [Louisiana] when I finished.  But it got to be, you know, this is an easy place, and this is a place to live.  I mean, even, as I come thinking about moving back to New Orleans, it's an exciting place.  And I, and I think that certainly in the last ten, twelve years, this administration has just made it just like, the--you cannot find--I mean you could look around.  You can get a little bit from a lot of other cities, but you would be hard pressed to find as many good things in one place as you can find here in this city.  But I, just came and, then I got busy living.  You know, you just--I got busy living and, and basically accepted the fact that I was here. Then about, then a few years later, my sister [Joyce Johnson Burton] came.  And so we then created a small portion of home.  And so it wasn't, really any sense of needing to go anywhere because you had family.  And my sis--but my sister stayed about fifteen years and then she left at the end of the '70s [1970s].  And for the last twenty-odd years, I've, I've been really, you know, without any other family connections.
Story_ID: 2744
Speaker 1: And the other experience would be the one about the cold.  (Unclear) about the cold.  It must have been the summer--must have been the winter of '60 [1960], because we [she and her husband] didn't have a car.  Or maybe '60--, may have even been, might have been '61 [1961] when we had a car and the car had--the battery was frozen.  I was so cold one night on the parking lot out of school, by the time we came back in the evening, the car and the battery was down.  And I was so cold, and I was just petrified.  A couple whose name I don't know and whose face I could not identify right now, if, I had a million dollars to give them, to give me, saw me just standing there, and put me in their car.  Warmed me up and, started my battery.  I mean I was just like dead.  I mean I was there.  I mean I was just there.  I mean I--you, understand?  If I explained to you--I mean I'm standing there.  I am so pitiful.  I mean they see me as one somebody about to stand up and freeze to death standing, and my car is sitting there.  I cannot do anything with the car.  And they just take mercy on me, you know.  So that you, really just have to smile as you go through life and, you're given a privilege like this to be able to sit and do, recall when there's nothing, no special, when there's no special agenda, about all the ways that people have helped you.  And, how sometimes when you extend something to somebody, you really are just passing it on.  You're not, you know, it's like it's, nothing special that you're doing.  It's simply something that you got so long that you had forgotten about, that you're just passing along.  And so that couple, I mean started, jumped my battery, warmed my car up, let me, left me in their car, and then sent me home.  You know, and I--it was I don't know that night how I would have done, I mean what I would have done.  I mean I was--I just didn't even know how to turn around.  And I couldn't--I was just standing there and I had my hands right out.  I mean I, just remember just the, coldness at a level, I mean like nothing that I could describe.
Story_ID: 2745
Speaker 1: Connie [Constance G. Jackson, Bacon's daughter] was born in what year, was she?
Speaker 2: She was born in, 1960. 1960, oh, she  okay, so it's around that time.
Speaker 1: --Were you pregnant when you were standing--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I was, I was pregnant my second, (unclear).  She was born at, when I was at Howard [University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], at the end of, my time at Howard.  At the end of my time at Howard.  So she came here [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: She was a little baby when she came in here, came here.  So she was born when we got to, when I was Howard.  So the whole, my whole year, the whole year, my second year at Howard, I was pregnant.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, which was a--so many things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because at that time--.
Speaker 2: I'm saying, the people just did not, I mean if, I look, I look back at the things, it's like, you know.  I look back, you look back at the things, like, "God, you just stepped out out faith."  And then Connie was breech birth, you know, so it, there was a whole bunch of question about whether they were going to have to do a "C" [cesarean section operation], or whether they were going to do it or whether it was going to be a difficult birth.  So, but I just was--from the experience of being able to do and to do, you just did, whatever you had to do.
Speaker 1: I thought (unclear) put people, women away at that point in time, didn't they?  I thought that's what they did (Laughter).
Speaker 2: How you mean put away?
Speaker 1: I mean you're not supposed to be seen in public, you're not--.
Speaker 2: Girl, no, that's not a (unclear).  That's not, we're not that far back.
Story_ID: 2746
Speaker 1: After you finish--.
Speaker 2: [University of] Illinois [at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Illinois.
Speaker 2: You, don't you start working in a clinic?
Speaker 1: I, worked.  I did a year's rotating internship.  This is before, this is just before the--like we talked, just before specialty piece.  I did a rotating internship.  And after that, I took my exam and got my license and then I went to work with somebody.  I didn't--I couldn't figure out at the time about where I wanted to do, what specialty training I wanted to do.  My mother [Vina Velma Johnson] begged me to do it, and I just--there was nothing I could think of that I wanted to.  There was nothing I really wanted to do other than basically, do, general medicine.  And I felt at some point I'd pick up what I wanted to do.  But I started and I went to work on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] at a, clinic that basically was a Medicaid [federal medical insurance program] mill.  Busy, busy, busy.  Had I had my wits about me, or if I had sat down and had somebody tell me what to do and how you plan your life.  If I had stayed there three years and saved my money, I would never have had to work again.  It was that much money.  It was so--this is 1963.  Interest rates on mortgages were like three and four percent.
Speaker 2: So would you get by--is there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: You get--you would--I worked for a guy, that, the (unclear).  To give you an idea about the intensity of the whole piece.  The Medicaid rate was six dollars a, six dollars a patient, six dollars, six dollars and maybe six and four, I'm not sure or six and three.  It was six dollars for a first visit, four dollars for--I'm--let's, average six dollars.  Let's just say six dollars for an average.  And he was charging six dollars for private patients.  One week I made nineteen hundred dollars in cash at six dollars a head, of the cash people, not the Medicaid patients.  And then I had fifty--I did--I took fifty percent of the cut.  And so I mean multiply those numbers.  But what I found is, it's like it kept me, my stomach like that because it's like the patients, people were sick.  And we are now living in a totally experience medical, medically wise.  I mean there are a number of people who are sick, but access to care for the last thirty-five years has made a major difference in this society.  And I don't care who says what.  There are a number of people and, there are a number of people in pockets and places where people don't have any.  But across the board, across the board, there are enough places.  You don't have people who have never been to the doctor or haven't been to the doctor in the last ten years.  I mean it's like you don't have the same kind of non-exposure.  Then the only place you could go if you didn't have insurance of some kind, you could go to [Cook] County [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois].  And then County would give you just a little bit of something.  It wouldn't, would not be a whole lot.  And they would give you, if, if you turned out to be somebody who had a life threatening circumstance, they would take you in after you had waited for the next twelve, fifteen hours, whatever.  But just for you would go in and having a cold and somebody giving you some medication, you were looking down the road in terms of what care, the treatment was and how much you would get.  So this is like the, really like the beginning of the Medicaid as a, open, as an open green card access piece.  That change didn't occur until '65 [1965].  So I'm talking about '63 [1963], '64 [1964], when I worked on the West Side.  So you had a few people who had the three dollar, six dollar card, and I don't, again, I don't remember what the number , but I know it was, it was not more than six.  But this guy, I mean the guy on the, on the West Side, I mean, you know, 3857 West Washington [Street, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean patients in the, out, in the door, out the door, in the door, out the door, in the door, out the door. And as life, and luck would have it, I went to work for him in September of '63 [1963], just as soon as I got my drive--as soon as I got my license I said driver's license, as soon as I got my medical license.  And then, he got sick.  He developed hepatitis now (unclear) a year.  And he, and then the, the next year, about twelve months, at somewhere like in the middle of '64 [1964], he developed hepatitis.  And I wound up working the whole three months by myself.  And, we started off working from eleven o'clock till seven o'clock.  That was, those were the hours, not eleven o'clock to nine o'clock.  And then because the volume was so high, I would, after he had been sick about three or four weeks, then I would come about ten-thirty, come at ten, you know, come at nine-thirty, come at nine o'clock.  And if you came at nine o'clock, the office was full.  You'd look outside the door and the place was full.  And then you worked and you saw twenty-five or thirty patients, and look outside and it's full.  I'm sorry. (laughter).  And at nine o'clock or seventy-thirty at night, it's still full.  It was like, "God!"  It had my, it just had me like my stomach was like growling all day long because, and everybody who came through was sick, sick, like sick onto death sick. In cold winters when--it could get cold in December and stay cold all winter.  And when people didn't have heating and they really didn't have a bunch of city inspectors to call and complain about the fact you didn't have heat.  When there wasn't adequate food.  Then you didn't have things like the WIC [Women Infants and Children] Program and you didn't have supplemental feeding, you know, you didn't have a lot of things that have, evolved over the past thirty-five, forty years.  So that you had a sick, you had sick people who any, anybody who came in there could be sick enough to die.  So then, think about that.  I'm twenty-six years, twenty-five, twenty-six years old.  It's like just pumping, it's pumping.  So what I decided was, after I had been there about a year or so, I said, I could make a bunch of money here, but the only thing I could do was use this money to cure my ulcer.  And I had had the experience earlier in the summer of going out to Altgeld [Gardens housing project, Chicago, Illinois] and working a few weeks.  And I said, I think that this place more fits what I had in mind in terms of what I wanted to do and how I wanted to, how I wanted to treat my people.  I don't want to just stand in a place and just pass them through the door and stick them, stick some medicine in their hand and stick prescription in their hand and send them out the door and not having given them the best.  And so I, chose at the end of 1964 to leave and go work in Altgeld full, time.  So I had started in Altgeld in '64 [1964] in, the, in August of '64 [1964].  But then I went full time in January of '65 [1965].  And that was at the beginning of the implementation of in the Medicare [federal medical insurance program for the elderly], the whole, the full fledged Medicare, Medicaid bill.  And so, you know, it's, been and seeing the, significant difference that providing care on a continuous basis makes, for people.  And having it accessible and available to them so that they don't have to think in terms rationing.  They don't have to think in terms of setting aside special time and/or attention, but that they can say, "I can go to the grocery store and then I can come back and go to the doctor cause the doctor will still be here."  You know, I can make a choice and go do something else.  It is not as if it is just rationed to them from nine o'clock to three o'clock, from nine o'clock to eleven o'clock or nine o'clock to ten o'clock as some places may, may have been at different times.  But I think it has made a difference.  I, mean I on any given day, I would certainly say Medicaid, the whole broad access and the other piece, the addition of WIC and social services have made major differences because what happens is, it gives people a chance to give, to get, to get support for so many other things that are ailing you besides just being sick from health, physically.
Story_ID: 2747
Speaker 1: Now, you--I read that you had--Altgeld [Gardens, public housing projects, Chicago, Illinois] reminded you, Altgeld and its people reminded you of Louisiana where you were born?
Speaker 2: Small town.  Just people from, nothing in the, nothing about it physically as much as just the people.  Just the fact that, you know, I was just in New Orleans [Louisiana] last week doing 'Essence' [magazine Music] Festival and doing and just being down after singing a couple of places, and, and just how striking it is, New Orleans, and then drive, we drove back, and then driving through the South, how anywhere you went, walked, somebody speaks to you.  You know, it's just like "Good morning, how are you doing?"  Black, white, old, young, it doesn't make any difference.  "Good morning, good morning.  Hope you have a good day," which is a very different piece than in, generally, in the general population in the city.  And so Altgeld had that.  It had people looking out for other people's children.  It had somebody saying, "Oh, I can take care of that for the--or I'll look after--I'll, call the mother, I'll do such and such.  I'll come to the doctor, child got hurt.  I'll call, I'll take care of this.  Somebody is out of food, somebody needs some clothes."  That kind of support.  And that's really what, that's really what a lot of it was.  And the other fact that so many people were related to each other, you know.  I mean you stay in a place and then physically who marries, who winds up--everybody's eighteen and you eighteen, you eighteen, you eighteen.  So John Smith's son is dating somebody else's, the, Jones on this side.  And then back and forth and so you've got a lot of relationships in terms of family groupings.  So that, that's really what I found.  And the people were warm to me.  I mean Alt---the people in Altgeld seduced me into staying.  And then I went out there thinking I'd stay a few months.  But you gave them service and they gave you back such a wonderful, warm response, it was just like, "Oh, I can stay here a little bit longer."  It's the, line that I, that I've heard attributed to [Clayton] "Peg Leg" Bates [dancer, entertainer] which says, "If you, keep after the, after--" you know, the dancer?  At the end of the dancing, he says, "At the end of a rou- the routine and the people applaud and applaud and applaud," he says, "if you keep on applauding like that, I'll break the other leg."  And that's the whole thing.  The more and more you the more I do, the more you respond, the harder I'm working to give you some more of the things that cause you to respond.  And so that's, that's really been a lot of what the experience was in, Altgeld.  I did not expect that I would wind up being almost forty years older than I was--I went, there at twenty-six.  I'm going to be sixty-five next month in, two months.  I've been there all my life.  And so I didn't expect--I thought maybe I'd stayed there four or five years at most.  But I really found myself to be kin to the people in many ways.  And they, took me on as one of their kin.
Story_ID: 2748
Speaker 1: How did the idea to start the clinic--well, you were the medical director first, right?
Speaker 2: Un-un.  Un-un, un-un.  See I had to start--.
Speaker 1: You had to start--.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I went to Altgeld [Gardens public housing project, Chicago, Illinois] to work in a place called the Altgeld-Murray Dispensary [medical clinic] which was run by the Cook County Board of Commissions [sic, Cook County Board of Commissioners] at the time.  I worked there six years.  But the people were just like, a variation of where I, what I'd left on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], except for, for less money.  They just didn't have a bunch of care about the patients in my mind.  So I came to the place there were a lot of other doctors who worked part time there.  I came to the place in the afternoons, twenty-seven years old, nothing--hadn't done anything before the morning.  Most people came from their offices or came on their way to their offices.  I got there at one o'clock in the afternoon to work till five o'clock, fresh, you know.  So people come, they bring their problem, you're not in a hurry, you're tired, you take a little time with it.  The more time you take with it, the more they tell other people about it, the more they come back to see you.  The more time you take.  So after that I had developed a really big practice, but I didn't control the time the place opened, what, the dispensing approaches were.  I didn't, control much of what was going on there.  So I objected to that.  So I--that was the other thing I was supposed to bring.  I wrote a, detailed paper.  I went back to graduate school in 1968 at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] because what I found after I'd been Altgeld is that much of--past the, penicillin [antibiotic] for a sore throat and whatever else medicine you need for your high blood pressure, there's so much in their social needs, that you need to understand in order to be able to effectively address the health care needs of poor people.  And that's what I went--and I went studying so I went in the Masters [degree] in social--to get a degree, a Masters in--ooh, ooh, I can't think of (unclear) in social, it was social science (unclear).  And I started looking at the black family, looking at some issues--this is '68 [1968] so I'm right at the--I'm at cutting edge time.  I mean it's just like everything's going on.  People are finally talking about it and they're looking at this as a whole unit.  Lots of things are going on.  So I get to school, and one of the papers that I, one of the pieces that I write is for a class, is called Social Welfare Institutions and one of the pieces I do in there is I look at Altgeld and what I see in terms of health care services.  And I write out what I think is--what is there, what I think is there and what I think ought to be there.  You know, I lay out a twenty page paper, seventeen, eighteen page paper, which, says existing study of exist, existing facilities in Altgeld Gardens and a proposal for what ought to be here.  And I write it out.  And it really is--and I've, read it in the last year or so and it really has quite stood up.  I mean it's, really amazing how many thoughts I had about how to approach health care beyond just the dispensing of medicine and how there are some things with a little modification you can deal, but, the paper withstands the test.  And I really am--and I went and I got the paper in July.  So, of course, I wrote the paper.  So by the time the person that was in charge of the facility found out that I had written some document complaining about them, I got fired.  So that's like July.  So I went then I called some people I knew at the [Chicago] Department of Public Aid, at [Chicago] Board of Health and at the [Chicago] Housing Authority and asked them--and we had a meeting down at City Hall talking about how we might be able to implement the service.  Everybody said, "Wonderful idea, Gloria, think this is a good idea.  It needs to be done.  We don't have any money.  We don't have any money; we don't have any money."  So I was like thirty or thirty, thirty-one.  So I said, you know, "I can do this."  I mean I'll just take my basic practice right here, and I'll just evolve it.  Now, I mean, this is something that needs to be done.  And so I started it.  So I went to the Chicago Housing Authority.  They gave me some space and helped me to reconvert the space.  And so that was in July.  So on August 31st, like the end of August of, 1970, we opened up [The Clinic in Altgeld Inc, medical clinic, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 2749
Speaker 1: So how did it feel to open up?  This is totally, I mean this is, it's different.  You had not come from a, you know, let's say a hospital administrative background.  Okay, and you're motivated by passion.  You really want to do right.  But can you, can you recount how you felt that day when you opened the doors [to The Clinic of Altgeld, Inc, medical clinic, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, we opened the doors cause we opened the kitchen first.  So we opened (laughter), we opened the kitchen door.  We opened the kitchen door initially so it's easy when you come to get something to eat (unclear).  So, it's, it's probably not quite the step it, it's not like going into the place we go--we opened up in 1997.  It's, you go through the kitchen door.  And so you just open up and you're there.  And then I'm seeing the patients, and I've got maybe one, other person with me, you know, somebody, a staff person and somebody else whose a, one of the community people whose kind of helped, got involved with me.  And it was just basically seeing patients.  I'm just seeing patients.  But, what it, means is we have now the ability to do it like I think it ought to be done.  And so this is August, so August through the end of the year, I talked to, and I finally talked, am able to talk to a couple of my friends, colleagues and ask them about coming out to work.  I asked one guy who's a surgeon to come.  I got Dr. Lucius Earles who's, who's my friend, who's a dermatologist.  He came a couple times.  And then, you know, like a couple days a week or one day a week or whatever.  And so, we started then to give the flavor of a clinic of broader base than one single person being able to take care of the patients.  And so that's really what I ran.  I mean that was the model that I spent maybe the next five or ten years begging people to come and actually, the reason I probably didn't get a better financial setting is that I used the money that I generated, that came to me, to finance the other operations.  So I basically paid them since most of them were not, didn't have the same vision I had.  I had to pay them upfront and then wait for the money from public aid which came or didn't come depending on what it was.  So that really is--so when, I find us now which is another part of the story, we find at the end looking at financial difficulties, you really are talking about thirty years of being under-funded.  I took all of my money and replowed it back in and just continued to do.  But being able to continue to serve and to serve more people and hopefully to serve them better.  And thinking sooner or later, somebody's going to see what this is and is going to come and give us the money and we're going to be able to do it, but basically, continuing to do so.  And that, and that's really how I got involved in it.  Part of my idea was, aside from the, the little noble piece from when I was going to medical school about being able to do something different, was really I thought that maybe I would be able to give a glimpse, give, a glimpse of possibilities to some of my other colleagues and to people around to say, it's possible that if you put a little bit of effort, you can get some other people to help, and then we can get some money, a little government fund you can get some other things and do more than we do.  But not to a very large extent was able, was I able to really do that.  And probably, long term, if I look over the thirty year period, the biggest problem was probably not having the right legal pieces from the beginning, help and from the beginning and we probably had without administrative assistance.  Because probably from where life was in the '70s [1970s] until now, the rights of the people getting the right fundraising from the beginning could really have given a life that would have sustained itself better than having to go back and find fresh money every time.  You know, so we didn't--we got it--we, organized the clinic in '70 [1970].  We did the not-for-profit piece in '72 [1972].  We got a, 501c3  status [government designation for non-profit organizations] in, I think '73 [1973].  But we really didn't do any fundraising and we really didn't really use it.  '79 [1979] we got one grant from the George Foundation and something I think from the [Chicago] Community Trust fund.  So a little bit of money.  And then it was maybe until 1991 before we really got a federal, before we got any really federal, any federal grants or any large amount of money.  So it was like maybe twenty-one years we carried it without it.
Speaker 1: So you carried it really with a combination of your own resources and with your Medicaid [federal medical insurance program] fees?
Speaker 2: Medicaid fees, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 2750
Speaker 1: Now, can you put this in context the, you know, the--you've done a little bit of it, but the Altgeld, you know, The Clinic at Altgeld [Bacon's medical clinic in Chicago, Illinois], can you put in context historical context in terms of what was happening in the medical industry at that time, you know, I mean what changes were happening, how poor people were actually being treated, you know, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, you have a lot of things going on, well, in terms of, now remember Altgeld [Gardens, public housing projects, Chicago, Illinois] was isolated altogether.  Altgeld was not part even in 1969, '70 [1970], Altgeld wasn't even part of the regular CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] transportation line.  So you had the south, we had the South Suburban line which was a, line that ran straight up [Martin Luther] King Drive, separate, which brought people.  But that was like once every hour or once whenever it came.  And, so you didn't and then you had to pay a separate fee to get on CTA to go from Alt-  you know, to go from Altgeld any place else.  So, a lot of the people in Altgeld used Michael Reese [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] and some, to some extent Mercy [Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois] as a, place because you could come directly on the line, get off on King Drive [Chicago, Illinois] and be by Mercy or be by, Reese.  So that going out and going some place else was very difficult.  I mean it was two or three bus lines, trips.  It was two or three bus fares.  It was a lot of time.  So that's, one, that's part of what the impetus was in the, in writing of the, of the proposal because it was so difficult.  It was not any place easy. Plus, the people in Altgeld basically had been from the projects as we all--it was sometimes in quotes and basically were not reasonably well accepted outside.  Many of them did not venture outside.  Many of them lived almost like insular lives inside of Altgeld.  There's a school.  There's a grocery store.  There's a church.  There's whatever else you basically, the kind of things you need inside.  So many of the people lived inside and so going downtown to Marshall Fields [department store] was like going to New York [New York] on a (unclear).  It was like, it was like really going away.  So that part of it we're looking for was trying to figure out how to bring better quality care inside a development since a large percentage of the people were going to use the services inside and not outside.  So that's part of, what's going on.  The other piece that I alluded to in the beginning was just, Medicaid [federal medical insurance program] was beginning to evolve.  So if you're talking about a population of people in public housing by and large a large percentage of them would be, would be eligible for Medicaid.  We're now talking about increasing the access that's available for them to be able to use medical and health care services.  So that's, really, what I had in mind.  I, like I say, when I'm, I'm trying  probably got caught up in the whole, you know, in much more a social, in much more a social, sociological model, rather than me being caught up in medicine.  Medicine was like the, sticker.  It was like the lost leader piece almost in terms of how you got people in that came for, services.  But it really was looking at the total, the total life that was the, and, and some of the things that were missing and, and beginning to try and think about how to do that.  And that, that's how, that's really what, the, what the clinic was.  It was, it was always more than just a medical facility.
Speaker 1: Were, politics, Chicago politic, did they enter in at all in this?  Or was that a factor?  Are you--?
Speaker 2: You know, I kind of it's like I, I'm not, I don't read the newspaper daily during the last twenty--most of my life because I, initially, I was getting children ready in the morning and I didn't have time.  And then after that, I never got to it.  So in, there are a lots of things that I do sometimes which are good and sometimes are bad, where I live my life like separate from whatever the rest of the world's doing, what the rest of the city's doing on that day.  And most of the time we didn't really have a lot of fights, and we didn't--I, didn't get into it too much in the way of many problems from time to time.  I had good relationships with most of the commissioners of health, you know, basically, either who knew me or who knew what we were doing.  And so we could make that kind of contact.  I knew [Mayor] Jane Byrne just in terms of mayors by name, and I knew [Mayor] Harold [Washington].  I know the mayor, and, and I think he knows basically the as in--I didn't know, I just met briefly senior, [Mayor Richard J.] Daley.  I know Mayor [RIchard M.] Daley at this point, but, not a lot of, interaction.  You know, but we pretty much have been my job was to take care of my own business to try to make sure I'm not we didn't get in, we didn't  we have not had much in the way of, a fight.
Story_ID: 2751
Speaker 1: How many people were you servicing there at [The Clinic in] Altgeld [Bacon's medical clinic, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: When we started off the population was about twenty thousand in the area.  It's down now to probably ten or less, ten thousand or less.  We serviced on average let's just say, we'll start we did twenty, we used to, we did twenty, twenty, roughly around twenty thousand patient visits which may be about seven to eight thousand unduplicated visits.  And that can be, and that can vary over time, but I'm like spreading out over the thirty years probably on average like, so whenever.
Speaker 1: And these are people that for them to be serviced at Cook County [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] would have been a problem.  You don't really go into but they were isolated from Cook County.
Speaker 2: They were isolated from Cook County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would they have been serviced by Provident [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] at all, and that would have been a big distance too, right?
Speaker 2: They could have been serviced by Provident though Provident wasn't really set up, the Provident now could service them, but Provident before wasn't really set up to service them in the same way.  They would have basically fallen into the emergency room or if somebody had--had been a private physician might have taken them as patients.
Story_ID: 2752
Speaker 1: When you look back at, you know, like maybe the first five or ten years of the clinic's [The Clinic in Altgeld, Bacon's medical clinic, Chicago, Illinois] existence what do you say were some valuable lessons you learned or some things that, you know, that you know you're proud you accomplished?
Speaker 2: Well, we existed and we continue--. First of all, we that without any assistance from anybody else outside, that I was able to go forward with what the community had basically brought to my attention that was needed and what I believed as a person and as a physician was needed also, that I was able to do it.  And it was without any assistance.  And I wasn't, I'm not proud that I was able to do it in the sense that I'm, I take the pride in doing it alone.  I take pride because we had to do it.  And that was the only way you could get it done at the time.  Nobody was willing to say anything on behalf of anybody in Altgeld [Gardens, public housing project in Chicago, Illinois]. And now, as you see, if you, if you ride out 130th Street and you see the big, beautiful building outside and you see all the things that are there, people are saying, "Well, you know, I don't see why they can't do whatever."  But in the meantime, it didn't start like that.  It's just like you, you know, you dropped a little bit of seed in the ground. It's a long time before you have some trees or some stalks hanging up, standing up.
Story_ID: 2753
Speaker 1: You said that, you know, really what you were practicing more sociology in many ways?
Speaker 2: Well, I said soc--I mean really, it's really not so much sociology as much socioeconomics.  I mean I'm really looking--I mean you look at a mother of three children. You look at some of the things that, impact her life. You see somebody who comes to you for anxiety or depression and you realize that so much of this is situational, and you look at all the things that go on.  You think that if you were in the same situation. You would already, probably have jumped off the bridge because so many times, you don't have enough money for this, you don't have this. You got the problem with the man. You've got not an education, not any real chances that you have of being able to advance. You've got your kids. You've got kids who may get out of control and then you have no way to be able to do anything with them.  And you don't have a lot of resources.  And so what I found was trying to figure out how to understand what some of the problems was so that I could, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't stand up and say, in an arbitrary way, that you have to take your medicine and you have to come back on this time and you have to do such and such, not under, not understanding what the problems a person might have.  And, therefore, trying to figure out how do I make this medicine so that this person is able to participate in it.  And how do I not release her from responsibility, her or him, from responsibility, but how do I give them assistance so that they're able to use it better by giving them instructions, by giving them some more directions and some more guidance.  And that's really one of the things that I think is wrong with, a lot of the stuff that's wrong with medicine now, in the sense that you can't expect somebody who doesn't know and doesn't understand any of the reasons and the difficulties that are involved in, and some of the, and some of the dangers in terms of health conditions, to be able to come up with some of the answers.  And part of the problem I think and the responsibility for us as professionals is that you've got to be able to translate, translate to the patient what is going on in their body; what does it mean to have hypertension?  What does it mean when your nose bleeds?  What, what does it mean the variety of different--what does it mean so that the patient then is able to understand, I won't do that again.  I won't do such and such again.  I can understand that if I do this, this is what's going to happen.  So often we give the information as physicians, but we don't give any understanding so that the person who hears it is able to translate it from the words which are English, to an understanding.  And that's, that's the biggest thing that I think is probably missing in most places.
Speaker 1: And that was the whole area really of patient education which it was, it was really a long leap on the part of the medical community sort of a haughtiness that people didn't need to know--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Or they could fix the problem but they weren't going to be explaining too much.
Speaker 2: Well, now, you know, now that there's so much freedom of information, so much in the way of knowledge, now that the drug companies have decided to use television as a way of, marketing their major products, patients know so much or if they don't know, they have heard and that therefore, they are looking for more, much more information, so that few people are now able to get away without getting some explanation all together.

Speaker 1: What was happening to you also career--career wise at this point?  How was Provident [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois]?  How (unclear) taking over did that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: You know, I, got involved with Provident because I, as an individual--this is, this goes back to me, I told you I was raise, I'd been raised in America in a whole black, white environment.  What I looked at was, this is an institution.  It is so important for us as black people to control institutions.  And, by that I mean to be able to direct the policy, to be able to have the understanding, to be able to think whether or not we exist or not.  And so, Provident and I don't even, know, I have to sit and think about how I actually got to Provident, you know, in terms to be involved, because I had not been much involved in terms of hospital staff.  I, got involved with them as I was looking at the whole issue or whether or not they would close.  And I felt that if our forefathers could struggle as hard as they must have struggled in the 1800s and the early 1900s, that surely we ought to be able to figure a way to extend it and to, continue this.  Several things I figured would happen.  If we let it go, we would not have a positive force within the community.  At that time, they were beginning to talk about horizontal linkages and vertical integration or it's the other way, the other way so that what you do is, you're able then--if you stand, I can tie it to all the people around me.  If I stand, I can go up the pole and down the pole so that I can have a nursing home, I can have homecare services.  I can have a variety of things, but I must exist as an institution in order to be able to do it.  So I'm, looking at trying to think about how do we remain a viable force within the community.  How we then are able to look at the health care needs of our people and not do a rerun of what the AMA [American Medical Association] said is important.  But rather try and figure out what are some of the specific needs on 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois], and how do we go about trying to address them for people who may not have access and may not have the information, who may not have money to be able to deliver, to be able to go and find and get everything that is done straight out the book.
Story_ID: 2755
Speaker 1: Did you come calling to Provident [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] and you were the first--you know, the natural selection--or did they come calling to you?
Speaker 2: It's interesting that you ask me that because I really don't know how I got involved with them.  I, got involved a little bit with the staff you know, I got, I probably got a selection by my peers and maybe if anybody sees it, they'll be able to tell me something differently, but I don't, you know, I don't know how I got involved.  But I, know at one point after I had become actively involved with the staff, I proposed to the then administration a way to look at, and I took a, like a position as vice president for marketing looking at trying to physicians, trying to get other kind of services, trying to bring other people in.  And that's how I got involved and then the next piece my, when my colleagues elected as president of the, of the medical staff.  And that's really when I, think I probably spent the most time in, a vocal fashion, out trying to, basically see if it was not possible for us to maintain and to find other sources that would allow us then to continue this hospital under our own direction and with, the vision that our forefathers had before us and which we should probably have at this point for our children.  It was a, possibility to say that we can always be sure that there will always be a place for us.  I had had a, an experience of talking in that period of time to Ruth Rothstein [medical administrator], who is now, who, was then at Mount Sinai [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois].  And she talked about, the Jewish hospital and about how an important fixture that was in their whole life, that always there would be a place for, Jewish residents to be able to train, for people doctors to be able to perform, just the whole sense for the, for a community to be able to have some control and direction.  And, it was, it really echoed what I had in the, in, in my sense of what I felt that I needed, because so often, once there's not a big old pool from which to pick, I mean it's like they'll pick off the two or three people when everybody else is left, is left out.  And I think to a large extent, I mean, obviously, you're looking at in some ways the whole concept of integration and being able to move into a major society.  But for the most part, it doesn't happen for the masses.  It happens for the best of us.  But the rest of us generally get left out.  And I was looking for someplace where we would be able to keep all of ourselves, keep all of us and be able to find a place.  And also, and always be able to provide services and to have a, have a concept of what, you know, what do you want to do?  I mean how, how do you want to look at the whole issue?  Look at the--I mean look at the issue of obesity as you're just driving--I mean look at us up and down the street.  Look at the whole question of stroke.  Lots of things that in a real way, we ought to have a better handle on, but we're still looking at people in their fifties, sixties, you know, walking around, really being almost like victims who would be seventy-five or eighty years old.  So I, think that that's what my fight was and, and, and maybe like I said, I think it was to some extent my colleagues, to some extent myself, offering myself out saying, I think, based on what I've been doing, I think that I have some idea about how we might be able to approach it, and I would like to be able to be part of it to make sure that Provident is here in the twenty-first century.
Story_ID: 2756
Speaker 1: Can you put this in--just talk a little bit about the history of Provident [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], just a little bit and then also who the major players were in this fight, you know, to close or keep it open.
Speaker 2: Provident, I think we're from 1895, this was '85 [1885], '95 [1895].  I don't know how, I don't know how I missed the number, but I knew it was ninety, you know, it was ninety-five years old at the time, at that, in about 1980.  So it may, it must be a little bit, it must be maybe '85 [1885].  And I really don't--let me just, let me give, let me back (unclear).  Provident was such a hurtful piece, the closing of it and that whole transition of it, that I, seldom ride down 51st Street [Chicago, Illinois].  Because I thought that, just like I'm finding circumstances, we didn't have to.  And I've just blank I, I've really just blanked it out.  I, I don't think I've been in the building maybe more than twice since, the closing and the changeover [in 1987].
Speaker 1: So what, who were the players at the time?
Speaker 2: I think [Lester] Dugas [medical administrator] was the--he's now dead.  Lester was the chairman of the board.  Joe Mann [medical administrator] had been the Director before him and there was a, guy who came I think he's from New Orleans [Louisiana], but I can't remember his name right at this moment.  And then there was just basically, the, the medical staff, a lot of people around.  But I don't, I don't really know (unclear) was a principal player, (unclear).  Who was principal.  And then thinking that it would make a difference, I solicited the help of [Edward] Garner, Gardner.
Speaker 1: Ed Gardner [entrepreneur, philanthropist]?
Speaker 2: Ed Gardner.  But I didn't give the full-fledged piece and, basically, he slipped right out and moved to the other side.  And I think his wife, I think, his wife really, Betty, I think really saw the vision much more than he did.  I think that he, I think it became reduced to a business venture.  I think that she saw it in terms of the community and what the involvement is.  But when they got involved and then the other person was Hillman Sorrie who had come with experience from Michael Reese [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], had helped to start the HMO [Health Maintenance Organization], had come from I think had been at Northwestern [University Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], but had basically, become like a variation or a demolition specialist.  You know, it's like as the things were going down, he would come in the name of restructuring or rescuing, one of those, but almost always, almost always it wound up being closed down. And so there was a period of maybe four or five years I guess between the time the hospital closed in 1987 and the time it reopened, maybe at least five or six years, if not longer.
Speaker 1: That just sat there; it was just sitting there.
Speaker 2: Sat, sitting there.  And then they did about two or three years of renovations and changes and whatever else before [Cook] County [Hospital] took it over.  And I don't know what year County took it over.  But I haven't had much thought about it.  I really just blanked that space in my head out, because at this, I it was us, the physicians and in some ways when, we would, didn't know how to step up to the plate.  And then, I think the people outside because actually [Mayor] Harold Washington was involved.  I mean I he called me on the telephone and gave me a big screaming out about fighting what he felt was an, was a, was an inevitable loss.  And I told him well, I really felt that it, that we needed to do as much as we could to make sure that we maintained institutions and that we have some control over and some say so and some direction of.  But he had been convinced, I think through Gardner and through other people that it was not salvageable.  And so, he went in the direction of the other people.
Speaker 1: So that was a hurtful experience.
Speaker 2: Very much so.  It wasn't mine at all.  I just because, and, then in many ways we've been able to see and I'm not real close to the medical community, but as I talk to people from around every now and then, you can really see the scattering of the physicians that, occurred afterwards.  So that you didn't really have a central place or that you, that you never had the potential threat that you could do something because you, didn't, really didn't have a group of people that existed in any way.  You know, with the, with the staff you had twenty, two hundred, three hundred physicians, depending on how you counted and in terms of degree of activity.  So that you always had the potential if somebody pulled something together to have a body that could move out.  But once everybody scattered, then you had five people here and three people here.  And then somebody who would the best people were probably given a plum of a position so that moved them out of participating with any lesser people.  And, so you never had the ability then to, the potential at least to be able to think, "Oh, we could make a group; we could buy--do a hospital; we could do a whatever else.  And that was really what I feared, and I think that to a large extent, that's what's happen"ed.  I, don't know anything about the functioning of the hospital so I, there's nothing I could say good or bad about it at this point.
Story_ID: 2757
Speaker 1: Do you consider what is happening now with, your clinic and Provident [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] a parallel track in some respects or were there things that you learned there that are now allowing you to deal with this situation?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: No, you know, just the tragedy is, I come to my own situation is that obviously I didn't learn anything at all because I didn't anticipate that, there would be the possibility that we would come to a point--we were always in debt since I started the place with no money.  We were always running behind and so I never really conceptualized a possibility that we would have more debt that we would be able to manage.  And that obviously was a failing because I mean it's like, it, can happen.  But I never, I never really conceptualized that.  And, I, and that's really my piece, nor did I protect myself in terms of my own personal interest, I mean clearly all we had to do was to have put myself in for a life, trusteeship or a variety in the life, you know, a variety of different things.  But again, my focus had never been to main, to maintain myself.  It really had been whatever the dream was and whatever the vision that you, that you were working on was really to try to maximize whatever you can do with it.  So, I didn't, think how--do I make sure that--I mean even though I raised it at one point.  I think I raised it at the first time we got the federal grant about ten years ago, I raised the point, and I wound up in a contract situation.  But I didn't think about it beyond the contract time in terms of because I had seen and heard of a number of experiences.  I mean I heard of experiences down in, a guy in Mississippi who has a big, huge developed a big, huge practice in a variety of things--who wound up outside of the facility he started. And luckily had created some relationships with the neighboring medical, the medical center and therefore, wound up going in there, but, was really outside of it.  And so I just didn't do what you're supposed to do and that is forewarned is forearmed.  And I just didn't anticipate.  I really didn't.  I mean I think that I thought that, you know, having made it and created it and worked in whatever else, that even though I did not anticipate having any monetary gain to me personally, I always intended, I always anticipated that I would have control, which is really what I set out for me.  I mean it was the control and direction, was to make sure that you were able to look at this and (unclear) issues, meaning it wasn't about money.  If I had been looking, if I had been looking for money, I would have stayed on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and never gone to Altgeld [Gardens, public housing projects, Chicago, Illinois], because like I said, then I could have made enough money in three to five years to have been able not to have to work anymore.  But I didn't know about how you think about that, and obviously, you just need to run into the right mentor to tell you that you can do this and then you can be about whatever else you want to do.  I mean because by the time I was thirty, I could have well had it.  There was, money being made and without a lot of challenge to it.  You know, all you had to do was fill out the form and do a little bit of stuff.  You didn't have a lot of challenge, I mean a lot not a lot of registrations, not a lot of regulations, not a lot of anything.  It was just a different time.  And then, again, I'm saying, if, I tell you that the mortgage rates were 3 to 5, 3, 4, 5, 6 percent, maybe six at most, this is on the first time around, and you're talking about a house that might have cost ten thousand dollars. I mean there were lots of things to have done in order to be able to create enough of a fortune.  But my focus was never on making a fortune.  My, thing was on trying to figure out how to do the servicing.
Speaker 1: And do it right.
Speaker 2: And do it right.
Speaker 1: And do good.
Speaker 2: To try to do as good as you can, mainly because you never you don't want to wake up one day and find yourself on the other side.  And I, use as a philosophy you asked me about a quote and I didn't think about it at the time.  In, my practice I've tried to say this, that I look at the people who are my age as myself; I look at the people who are younger than me as my children, and I look at the people who are older than me as my parents. And in doing so anytime I'm doing whatever I do, I try to make sure I'm doing right by one of those three people.  And in doing that, that's been the focus.  And that's, pretty much how I've operated, how I've tried to operate.  But sometimes if you don't know the answer, you just have to really say, I don't know the answer, but let me try to see who I, what I can do to find it; not simply do something that you can get away with, but rather, try and figure out what would happen if I were over there and this person had my life in their hand?  Would they treat me as good as they could possibly treat me or would they just let me do something to get by?
Story_ID: 2758
Speaker 1: I want to go to U of I [University of Illinois] before I go back to some other (unclear) questions.  But, you got appointed to the board--.
Speaker 2: No, I got elected
Speaker 1: Elected, sorry.  And what that, was a sort of coming home.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  1988.  That was like an answer to a prayer that I had whispered when I was at Illinois in, the '60s [1960s] saying, if I ever have something to say about this place, I would, I would love to have an opportunity to say something about how this place is run.  And that was really, for me, that really wound up being just a major treat.  I mean it was, just a great privilege for me, and I, came by it because Ann Smith, who had been the trustee beforehand, resigned and took a position with the university.  And I saw her announcement of her, of her changeover, and decided, "Oh, man, I really wish I could run for that."  And then was able or lucky enough to get the late, catch up with the late, late [State Senator] Cecil Partee who was then very active in terms of--was the state, I think either the vice chairman of the party or something, but was able and, through his help and through a few other people, was able to be slated, and then able to run and, be elected.  And that was in '88 [1988].  I ran for two years.  And then I ran again in 1990 for six years.
Speaker 1: So did you--what about that experience?  You were able to have a great deal of influence (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I loved it.  You know, I loved it.  I loved it.  I got tired toward the end because I was so often one against eight or it was so often they were eight against me, my one.  But it was really difficult after a while, but I, was very, I'm very pleased even as I see the University [of Illinois] now, I think that there were a number of things and I think that I had a, fairly positive impact.  I was loud and noisy from time to time, and, brought to a table, where nobody would bring that to a table and almost like I brought to, into polite conversation all the things that people don't want to talk about.  And, I think in many way, as I see the university now, I'm, I'm quite impressed and quite pleased.  I, certainly won't attribute all of it to myself, but I certainly think that me and part of whatever else was happening at the time, did make a difference.
Speaker 1: Did you learn anything about organizations and operating within that board you know--?
Speaker 2: You know I didn't learn as much as I should have.  I didn't if, I didn't learn as much as I should have.  I saw how they do it.  I didn't learn how to do it, how to make the best of it.  I remained almost the whole time I was there outside of it because I, was afraid of being sucked int--see, the, problem about organizations like that is that you get in, you start moving up in the hierarchy.  You get wrapped up in the whole process.  You no longer, you're no longer the person who can bring the ideas--that's my, that's the outside piece.  Now, there's an insider piece which says that that's really how you learn how to make the changes in a quiet and subtle way.  I just have never learned that.  And I think that I'm probably just about getting to be old enough now that given another opportunity I might know how to do it better.  But then I didn't know how.  I felt that to be pulled into it would have sucked, would have sucked me in and would have left me with a silent voice from time to time.  Because then you would be part of the group.  And then it becomes real hard for you to stand up and make the hard, ask the hard questions when you now are infinitely a part of the group.  Now, somebody else would say, it's when you're in the group then you, that you can do.  But I, but I don't find particularly, when you consistently have eight people against you.  Sometimes seven.  But for the most part, eight, most of the time when, when the issues really got down to it.  It was most, of the time, it was, it was eight to one.  So that was part of that.
Speaker 1: And what were those things that you fought about, or thought to bring to the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, looking at, you know, the, the role and participation in terms o black students and the black faculty.  Looking at what the representation is.  Those were probably among the biggest issues because that's where the contracts--it really is about the distribution of, the wealth and the resources that are within the institution and how they are shared.  My argument was if we are between fifteen and twenty percent of the population in the state, we surely should have a better representation.  And that's across the board.  And those are issues, and you, say, well, what are the issues?  If I give you those five or six categories, then you can apply them in a variety of different ways, but in the end when you get back to them, that's basically what you're fighting about all the time because that's, that's what it is to be divided up.
Story_ID: 2759
Speaker 1: I can't help be--but be struck by the love you have for the black community--for black people.  Well I know you feel mixed right now (laughs).
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: But I mean what I'm saying, it's all been about that in your life.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's like it's been good.  I mean I think that, you know, after you struggle through all the, the things the--the things that are done to us and look at when I, when I looked at the, when I looked at the videotape of the boy in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], every time they, the policeman's beating the boy in the, last weekend--you didn't see it.  I mean they, they'd take him and they'd bang him on the, on the, on the trunk of the car, on the front of the car, on the hood of the car.  And, even all the things you see, you really want--I love being black.  I think that's what (unclear) saying, but all the, all the things and it's such because I think we're such, we are such a special people.  I mean I think that anybody else given all the things that have been done to us, wouldn't even exist.  I mean, you know, just wouldn't exist.  They certainly wouldn't exist as a force as we are.  And, so I think it's very special.  And I, like I said, I enjoyed growing up in the very warm black community where I grew up and in the family.  And then to find myself in the midst of all the things that have happened, and always finding a place.  I mean it's like there's hardly any place I can go and on a good day when I'm in my good form, where I can't turn around somebody won't turn around and say hello or won't be struck by your presence, won't try to figure out how did you do this in the middle of it, all the things. My daughter, our younger daughter [Judith B. Jackson Fossett] is, is married to a New, New Englander, six generations, family came over on not the Mayflower, but the, there's a name of the boat.  I can't think of the name of it.  His mother is maybe--his father, his father is six months older than I am, went to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  The mother is maybe a year or two younger than I am, went to Swarthmore [College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania], finished in science and math, can't imagine how I could have thought about being a physician.  She couldn't have.  It, you understand what I'm saying?  She was far--she was even a couple years behind me, really would have been a wonderful physician, was really quite capable of doing it, but didn't have that in her path, didn't have even a either between her vision--had money, had resources.  You understand?  So I mean I'm, struck by us.  I'm struck by us and our abilities.  And I think that we as, you know the Jews often say that they are God's people, but I believe we also are.  And I think in very special ways, there are things that we have done that have not been done, I think, in the history of man in this society.  I mean and, then there are things on the other hand, the, that you want to take us all and smash, take them all and put them in a garbage grinder.  You know, just some of the things we do are so stupid, but the masses of the people, I think, have such warmth, have such a genuine love for each other.  I mean it's, just a helpfulness.  I mean and New Orleans [Louisiana] is a special--and you have to come to New Orleans when I'm town some time and we have to do some stuff and when something is going on, because the people are just--they embrace you.  You go in the store to try on a jacket, try on a jacket.  And they say, "Oh no, that's not the right color to go with that."  Never saw you before in your life.  "Oh, you ought to do such and such and such and such," you know, it's like they become part of you, next to you.  They don't see themselves separated from you.  They see, you're a total stranger.  They're looking at what they would think would be the best, the what is in your best interest at that point.  And it's translated all around and so you have that kind of feeling of people just willing to help in many ways.  And so I'm-- that's really a lot of what I, what I grew up from.  And, which is, and which has given me the whole sense that it's always possible.  I grew up in a family--even my father [Henry Johnson] was a postman.  And actually worked in the, was a clerk in the, inside the mail, inside the post office and my mother [Vina Velda Johnson] whom I forgot to tell you a real story about.  My mother was a hair, started doing hair, during the war when my father was in the, in the service.  And then in the early fifties heard about an extension course from Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and started going to the Southern--extension course in the local high school.  Wound up getting enough hours to say, she could go on campus.  So my mother used to drive eighty miles each way to school, back and forth to school, once or twice a week, depending on what the time was, and wound up graduating from college the year after I graduated from college at age forty-one or whatever else all by herself without (unclear).  And then in about two or three more years, getting her Master's degree.  But just having a sense that these are possibilities and we just embrace them.  And my sister [Joyce Johnson Burton] used to always kid, used to always kid my father and say, "Well, since you drove her there, typed every paper, why didn't you at least sign up for the class too?"  (Laughs)  You know, but it's just that kind of sense.  You--but I, but I started that--this conversation said that what I--what we had was just minimal dollars and enough resources.  My parents bought their home in 1946, I was like eight or nine, but I never had a sense--part of the reason, I haven't been more aggressive in terms of keeping money is that I've never had a sense of need.  I always had enough.  And, it really is a killing piece because it doesn't make you actively aggressive because you don't need, you don't need a lot.  I mean I've spent a lot.  I've done a lot, you know, I mean I've, but I don't have driving--I know some people who have been poor and say, "Whatever it takes, I will never be poor again."  I don't have that sensation because I've never, I never felt being poor.  And even though my parents didn't much, they gave me such a sense of having enough, which I think is really the key piece because even the rich who are not satisfied don't have enough.  But I think if you can get a sense that you have enough, then you're ahead of the game.  And I think that that really probably accounts for whoever I am.  I remember when we were little kids going to my grandmother's house, that's my father's mother.  You know, different--and she would say, "Well, here take a dollar or take whatever else."  I'm like, "I don't need anything.  I have enough."  My mother would be kicking me on the leg, (laughter) like take the money, bring it home.  But it's like, if I didn't need it, I wouldn't take it.  And, you know, it's, it served me well.  I mean I, think to, to a very large extent it's the same kind of philosophy that the Native Americans have, you know, we use what we have.  The rest we turn back to the land or to other people or to leave available for the next time around.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: That we don't have a sense of ourselves, that we don't have a sense of the, of the real potential that we have, that we don't understand the people that everybody understands that we can be.  See I think the real wide black and white America still continue at odds is that white Americans really realize our potential.  They know who we can be.  They know that you can create--you can take somebody from Mississippi and rape her, whatever else, and turn into, and turn an Oprah [Winfrey, media entrepreneur] out.  That you can have a Bill Cosby [comedian] who can come and turn television all around, all together different.  That you can look at, that you can, that a man [Richard Williams, tennis coach] can say, "I want my daughters [Venus and Serena Williams] to play tennis and collect money."  And can sit down at least eighteen years or seventeen, whatever the amount of time is, have his daughters be number one and number two and changed up and down and however it was or do or (unclear).  And like I said, I think that we have the, see we have an innate potential to succeed given the right set of forces.  I think the problem for as a mass, is we have been so oppressed and suppressed, not even oppressed.  You know, and I use that one to be over and one to be on.  You know, in terms of and I may not be correct in--I may not actually be correct in my definition, but in my mind, there's the way I, that's the way I think about.  I mean I think that we had been oppressed so long that we have now been suppressed.  And as such, we are under the, under the will, and we, in many ways have lost our will because if we had now in 19--in the Year 2002 the drive that we had in the year 1954, with the laws and rules and all the opportunities that existed, we would own the world.  But it, that, it may be that we thought we had it already.  And we really thought like I told you earlier, that I didn't think it would happen.  I think that we thought for a while that with the desegregation decision ['Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas,' 1954] coming, that it really would be fair and equal, and that we would be treated equal, and that we could give up our homes and we could give up our businesses and we could give up our schools and believe that we would be brought into the fold all together.  And in doing so, we set ourselves back because we really wanted to be like everybody else wants to be equal at the table.  We wanted to be fair.  We wanted to be the same.  We didn't want to be discriminated against.  We thought that we, thought.  And I think that that's really one of the things that (unclear).  So I'm really interested in seeing who is going to write the definitive report which shows fifty years since 1954.  And I don't know whose doing it.  I don't, and I don't, and I don't know I'm not good at this point, but I really, I've really been thinking of my--I really would like to see us make a real accounting of what has happened, and then try to make a projection out for the next fifty-four, I mean out, out to, 2054 so that we can think over the next fifty years, what would we like to see.  So when my granddaughter who is three now, is fifty-seven years old, we might be able to, make a point in terms of where we were and then how we got to some things.  But that's what I'd want.  I, I'd like to see us, I'd like to see more active think tank kind of groupings without competition, you know, without, without one-upsmanship, but rather with a common point which says, these are black people and here we are.  And here's what we have.  Here are the, gifts and the assets that we have.  Here are the problems.  Here are the world conditions and the world forces which may impact on us.  How can we therefore try as best we can to make the best use of it we have, dodge the bullets as they are there and try and figure out how to make ourselves as good as we would like to be and, maybe, and maybe to fulfill the hopes.  And I, I'd be willing--and it obviously it wouldn't be mine, wouldn't be mine to see, but I would be willing to say, could we look at a fifty year vision which would take us a hundred years past desegregation to see how we would go about doing it and how--who we could be?  Because, we're extraordinary.  We are, we're again, I mean that's the long and short of it.  I think that black people are extraordinary.
Speaker 1: So you're hopeful in a way if certain steps are taken, is what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I'm actually hopeful even if some steps, are not.  We, because if we, we've managed to live in--if you think about us and how we have survived.  Sometimes you look at some living conditions and you try to think, "God, how does somebody get up out of there?"  Or, more than that, how does somebody lay down in some of the space.  Sometimes you go some places and you say, "God."  And yet you can see the little children, his eyes are smile and shine and whatever, in a bright, you know, and bright and on to the next piece.  And so I think, yes, we will, we, I think we will continue to exist.  Whether or not we become as good as we can be, really will need some help.  And that's what I'm saying.  We need, like I said, non-competing, the kind that would really just lay out the forces.  And I was at, the 'Essence' [magazine Music] Festival [New Orleans, Louisiana] last week and if you've not been, you ought to consider next year going, just to see that many black people together.  By and large it's not it's, they call it the party with a purpose.  And it's not as--but, there're lots of, a lot of interesting discussions on issues, but just to see that many people walking up and down the street, meeting together, sitting around, basically just enjoying being black.  It's, really I think Susan Taylor [magazine editor] has done a, just extraordinary piece.  I mean I think they've done a vision beyond, and I know that even as we because I was there for the first year and  because Connie [Constance G. Jackson, Bacon's daughter] worked on the first year.  It's evolved so beyond anything that they had envisioned, but it is something to see.  And probably a hundred thousand plus black people, basically, just wandering, I mean wand sometimes wandering the streets, sometimes sitting in the meetings, but sitting in the discussions back and forth, lots of stuff, lots of entertainment.  Very interesting.

Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about the medical profession, because you, this is something that you've (unclear), you know, there's some people that don't have a plan and you had a plan.  Your parents had a plan and you had a plan.
Speaker 2: You know, medicine now has, from what I see, and I haven't really paid a lot of attention, medicine seems to have evolved into an elitist group and then the others.  You know, so that you can look at the people--you can look at--I've been going over to the University of Chicago [Hospital Chicago, Illinois] to the Duchossois Center for Advanced Medicine [Chicago, Illinois], cutting edge. Money, technology and research and wonderful clinical application.  I see Northwestern's [University Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] getting ready to, replicate a similar facility in, the, where I guess Wesley [Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] or somebody used to be.  So what you're going to have is, you're going to pull out the cream of the crop piece in terms of money, resources and the, and the talent.  And then everybody else will just kind of like be around the edges.  Out of that you'll get some good, you'll get some very good, you'll get some good things, but, it now means that you're waiting six months for, for an appointment that ought to take you five days, because they've like spindled it up to the top so that you get less, you get lesser and lesser.  You get a more refined and more defined and better whatever else, but you're getting less and less at the top.  So now, everybody who wants to get to them has got to wait in line longer and longer and longer.  In the end, when you go through some numbers, when you--you may wind up actually having it balance out that you would, going to end up, that a hundred people will get no more better, no better care from having that system than would have gotten from people, mediocre people being able to deliver it because you'll miss so many people in between time.  You know, and, I'm, just kind of like, on my feet, kind of like, you know, creating a thought.  But that's what, I mean I'm thinking that.  So much now, there's so much of a wait.  And so many things that move it from the reach of ordinary people.  Again, you know, so it's so to speak (unclear).  Again, I don't really know.  I really don't know.  I haven't thought a lot about medicine.  The only thing I think is that, one of the things I've thought is that the HMO [Health Maintenance Organizations] piece clearly, you know, has backfired in that sense and then you, it's like the pendulum piece.  And I think that we'll switch more and more back to private individual choice piece medicine.  And I think that that's the, you know, clearly once it became apparent to a large number of people that you can't choose and you may wind up with inferior care and you may wind up actually dying because somebody doesn't choose you this day because they've already met their quota for the day or whatever has to happen, then there would be a protest.  But I, think it'll go back and actually I think, actually, I think that the, next group of people coming out to practice may come out, more really ready to practice because now that the money--there'll be a few people who'll make a lot of money, but money is spreading across at a lower level for the masses of people.  And I think that basically, the people will have it medicine will just be a job again.
Story_ID: 2762
Speaker 1: Would you advise people to go into--young black people to go into medicine?
Speaker 2: I think if somebody wants to go into it to do it.  I think you can make a reasonable living.  I don't think you'll rich you won't get rich unless you just happen to hit upon the right specialty or the right combination of things.  But I, would certainly not discourage anybody from going, from a, the point of view as a profession because I think there's a lot of good, and a lot of good needs to be done.  And we're still are, we're still low in our proportion of black physicians to, to the black population.

Speaker 1: Music has been an important part and you refound music, you rediscovered it, I'm sorry.  And in that, the sense I get is you've discovered the artistic and other, you know, another, well, I've used the term voice again, but you, you that part of you, you wanted to bring back.  I mean even you've been writing poetry, right? And so I was just wondering if you would talk about that and even in terms of what is, Dr. Bacon, what is, what is she still wanting to do in her life?
Speaker 2: It's interesting because coming up in college, in high school and college, (unclear) English was always my favorite subject so that in the last twenty years, say twenty or so years.  When I started writing, it really was like rediscovering something that I had always loved to do.  Okay.  The singing for me was something I did and then I, was not able to do, and then I just kind of cut it off and I didn't worry about myself about doing it.  In 1989, when I kind of started to rediscover my voice, I met a guy who heard me and wanted to sing wanted to play for me and I wanted to sing with him.  And so we started singing and, it really was like a reawakening so that my kids used to say, "Mother's going for her fix," when I'd go to rehearsal because it was like a transformation.  I would go down and depressed and unhappy and whatever else, whatever else and after about half a line, you know, I was already transformed into somebody else.  And so that's been what music has been.  In terms of artistic stuff, yes, I mean it, really is.  I mean I think that I, really have to laugh at myself sometimes at how much of a performer I am and how much I could be on stage at all times.  I love clothes.  I love being dressed.  I love the combinations.  I love the flurry.  I love that, you know, just a number of things.  So I'm hoping.  I've got a couple sets of books, two, two different, two or three sets of books.  I would like to be able to make a little bit of money.  I'd like to be able to make some money from what I do in terms of writing and from singing.  The problem is, that you really can't sing unless you make money because you have, you have to spend money to sing.  You got to spend money for the accompanist.  You got to find time.  You've got to train.  You've got a whole lot of things so you really need either to already have enough money to do it or you need to be able to make money in order to be able to let you do it without you using up all the rest of your money.  When I look at my income tax from year to year and it's like I've spent a lot of money in the last five to ten years developing my singing and finding ways in order to sing.  So if I would give any thought, I would like to as I said to somebody the other day.  Sunday I was singing in the aud- in the auditorium in the Marriott [Hotel] down in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I said to the woman the lights were, the back lights were on my, lights were on my back and it was very hot.  So I said that, "You know what I really would like?"  She asked me about the lights and if it was a problem.  I said, "You know, I really am trying to, I am really trying to learn how to live with the hot lights on my back (laughs)," because I very much would like to be able to stand up like [Rev.] T.D. Jakes [minister] the other day, did, twenty, maybe fifteen, twenty thousand people.  I don't know how many people were in the auditorium.  But to be able to command an audience and to be able to get the feedback.  So if that, really is in my aspirations at this point to try to figure out how to find the right niche, to find a way into the industry over if I could do that over the next five years, I don't know, I would count myself extremely blessed.
Story_ID: 2764
Speaker 1: Your legacy, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: What you said earlier, that I cared about black people.  I really did.  I mean that I really did and do.  And beyond black people, I really care about people, but, but my primary focus because my life has been just looking at us and so many injustices.  I really would like to see that, not only did I care, but I tried as best I could to do something to try and make life better.  And that really is the whole thing, the hope that we could be better because if you don't do that, for sure, life goes down.  I mean if you don't get better, it does get worse.  Very little stays the same.  Even when it looks the same, when you get close to it, you'll find out that there's a skim on it, that it's cold or it's whatever, it's hard.  But that is, you know.  And it's been good.  I mean I, think that I have been blessed and it's the, the other piece would be the other quote.  You asked me about a quote, would be "To whom much is given, much is expected."  And I think that that's the only thing we can all say.  I consider myself for, for every time I've had a, stumble that I have been extremely blessed all of my life from parents who absolutely adored me and, you know, from my mother [Vina Velma Johnson] saying, "Sugar, sugar, sugar" to me like I'm five years old now to my father [Henry Johnson] on his dying bed basically saying, "I want to thank you and your mother and your sister [Joyce Johnson Burton] for taking such good care of me," you know.  I mean what else could you have in terms of, a gift, to be first born beloved is like without parallel (laughs) without parallel.
