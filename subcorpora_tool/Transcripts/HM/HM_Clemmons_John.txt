Speaker 1: We're going to start by talking about your mother [Bessie Turner Clemmons] and father [Lewis Clemmons] and, and their family. You can remember your grandmother and grandfather on your mother's side. Is that correct?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Molly Turner. Oh, my mother say it--that my mother's mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Tell me about Molly Turner, tell me about your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Well, she was a real sweet person, and she had twelve children. My mother was the oldest girl. There were four girls and eight boys. And she was married to Henry Turner [Henry Turner, Sr.] who was, who owned his own farm. He had worked at some time for a man who had a lot of land, and he actually gave him so many acres. I don't recall how many, and that was his farm. They called it Turner's Bend 'cause his name was Henry Turner. And then, Turner's Bend, that's located about ten miles south of Rome, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And did you visit Turner's Bend as a child?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, as a little boy, I had several cousins, one that I liked who live on the farm. And one of them was named Altley Turner [ph.], and he liked to hunt, go swimming, wrestle. And he was one of my favorite buddies and he was quite a scholar. He ended up going into baseball. He, he was, well, fortunately enough to be, living during the time when we could, we could play him in the national teams [Negro League].
Speaker 1: Did you used to go hunting? What did you used to hunt when you used to go out there?
Speaker 2: Well, especially down in Turner's Bend, the rivers, when it rained, the rivers would rise and run the rabbits out, out of the little swamps. And I used to go hunting with my relatives on Turner's Bend farm. And, and then, we also hunt possums. We did, we had possum dogs, oh, possum dogs were trained to find the possum, and then run them up the tree. And then, he start barking, and that was the signal for us to catch up with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and that was the main thing.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, we were talking about your grandmother. Tell me, do you know anything about her mother and father, or anything else about her?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I've heard them talk a little bit about it, but I, when I was a little boy, but I really don't, I can't, I can't say I know anything about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my great--great-grams.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your grandfather, Henry Turner. What kind of man was he? He--we know that he owned land.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: And he had a farm. What did they farm?
Speaker 2: Well, cotton was the main product then, but corn and products and, and cotton were the, but they had grew all types of vegetables, and grew them in great abundance. I can remember when my mother and father moved into the city limits of Rome, Georgia. My grandfather would load up a wagon with, with bananas--not, I don't mean bananas, what I'm talking about. He, he loaded up with watermelons, cantaloupe, and other things, and bring the whole load, and put it on our front porch. And we, my mother would give some of them to the neighbors and all that, but that meant we didn't happen to have much of a hard time.
Story_ID: 531740
Speaker 1: Tell me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Bessie Clemmons [Bessie Turner Clemmons], B-E-S-S-I-E, Bessie Clemmons.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did your mother share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little. She did mention how my daddy [Lewis Clemmons] met her and--
Speaker 1: Okay. How did they meet?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my daddy's father [Green Clemmons], or it was my grandfather on that side, had sent him over to take a message, and to pick up something from my, my mother's father [Henry Turner, Sr.]. And my mother happened to be present. And my, my daddy, when, touched her when, when mother went, darted out of the room. And then, he explained to us, he said, my mama got the message.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from that, I don't know the details of that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Getting together.
Speaker 1: What type of mother was she to you?
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother had three boys. And she was good and kind to us. But when we did something that she didn't approve, she would warn us that she was going to tell daddy. And when daddy came home, it depends on how severe my mother was when she told him, and asked her what do you do? Sometime we got a warning. Sometime, he would, he had a big strap that he would pull out. And sometime he'd pull it out, and didn't even use it, but, but then sometime, he, he let you know he would tie you up.
Story_ID: 531741
Speaker 1: Tell me your father's name.
Speaker 2: My daddy name was Lewis Clemmons, L-E-W-I-S, Lewis Clemmons.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you knew your father's father, your grandfather?

Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Green, G-R-E-E-N, Clemmons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, he had always prophesied that he was gonna to live to be a hundred years old.

Speaker 2: I don't remember the year.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the year he died?
Speaker 2: No, he, let me see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't try to say--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --what it would have been.
Speaker 1: All right. But was anybody in that family a slave? Was he a slave?
Speaker 2: He was a slave.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He often told a story when his, his father, his slave, his master of the plantation where they were, grew up, which sent, he sent him on a journey somewhere. And he ran into three of his, his master's--he ran into his master's son, and two other boys. And they asked him for his pass. And he didn't, he didn't have it. He said, "Well, you know, who I am, I don't need it." And then, they gave him, took his shirt off, and gave him a beating. That's what, the way he's, he explained it so.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, when he became free, what did he do then? Did he have land or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He--well, my grandfather didn't have any land. He was, he was, that Green Clemmons was, what you call a sharecropper. And he would--the system was then that you, they didn't give you any money for working, but they let you go to the company store. And they had some money, what they call scrip, and they had issued some scrip--if at the end of the season, you had not overspent your allowance. See, and he, my grandfather said he had never, never got any money from the, from his master. But so, he--the--one year, he, he didn't tell when it was--if he did, I've forgotten. But he went to the master, and asked him about his scrip. And he told him, he says, "Well, Green, you almost got out of debt." And he, he said, that was the story evident, so he went home. And he told his wife [Mary Clemmons] that he was gonna, we were gonna leave. And he packed what little things that he could, and some big hams that they had cured, and some other food, and got in the wagon and left. And he said, he already had been talking to another master, a person who had (unclear). And, and he went to him, and I don't know all the details of that story.
Speaker 1: Did he eventually start his own business, a lawn business, or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he, in his later years--I think he was in his nineties, then he, he bought him up some tools, I think. His children helped him with that, bought him up some tools that he could cut grass and do a good job. So, he worked for rich white people who had nice homes and, and knew one of the lawns keepers. And he did that up 'til he was ninety-eight years old. Then, he, he went, he called himself retired, and, actually, lived in with his daughter. His wife had died. Then, he lived with one of his daughters, one named Nettie, Nettie Clemmons, and located at that time, they were located just outside of Rome, Georgia in, in a place called Kingston, Georgia.
Story_ID: 531742
Speaker 1: Where did you and your family live, you and your mother [Bessie Turner Clemmons] and father [Lewis Clemmons], and, and you have siblings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my daddy left the farm after he married my mother. And he went--they were outside of the farm. Kingston [Georgia] is not so very far from, about fifteen or twenty miles from Rome [Georgia], I guess. But anyway, they left the farm and went to Rome. And he got a job in a company called Fairbanks [Fairbanks Company, Rome, Georgia], where they made dollies that you roll around. Sometimes, they're called trucks to deliver things, like heavy things, like cotton and other things. And the, one of the men who worked there asked him one day, by the way, was, where they living. And he said that his wife was still living with her folks [Molly Turner and Henry Turner, Sr.]. But he was living with a friend, so he--this white friend named Mr. Reese [ph.] said he had owned some land which really was a mountain. He told him he could go up there on that mountain, Reese's Mountain [ph.], and cut down some trees and, and build him a place to live on his own. In the meantime, he learned of a lady named Ms. Hughes, who was, who had several hundred acres of land that she had cut it up, so that she had a street running from the Alabama Road [Old Alabama Road] all the way to the end of her property. And she called it Hughes Street. One street was Hughes Street, and on the, on the north side of Hughes Street, she sold to black people. And on the south side, they--so Hughes Street, although there were four more streets parallel to Hughes, but the white people there. But, and my, my daddy tell me, he paid twenty-five dollars for a sixty by three hundred and sixty feet, was big enough for a garden and things like that. But he bought two lots, and, and his best friend bought four lots. And they paid twenty-five dollars, twenty-five dollars each, for each lot. And his estate, which I'm the executive of, still own that property. My mother died, and he died. She died in, in 1946. And after she died, several years later, my dad had married again. And I don't know much about, I didn't have much dealing with that. I don't know much about. But--
Speaker 1: But y'all still own the land out there?
Speaker 2: --but we still owned the land. Daddy willed it to his three boys. And, and the--he said in the will that his wife [Eleanor Clemmons] could live there until she died or married. If she married, that was, she had to make arrangements then, or let somebody make them.
Speaker 1: Is she still alive?
Speaker 2: What? Yeah, she's still alive.
Speaker 1: And she still lives there?
Speaker 2: She still live there. I do things, I keep the property up, and I pay the taxes. And, 'cause daddy had another piece of property that we rented out. And there was some income, but not enough to keep up both pieces in the neighbor- in that particular neighborhood.
Story_ID: 531743
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your brothers.
Speaker 2: Well, I had two brothers. I was the oldest, or the first child. And, by the way, I was born up on that mountain, Reese Moun- Reese's Mountain [ph.], and they had a midwife to come, Mrs. Maude Edwards [ph.]. And, but then, getting back to--what'd you ask me now?
Speaker 1: I was asking you about your siblings. Well, that's fine. You, you were born on Reese's Mountain, and she was the, the midwife. Was she a neighbor?
Speaker 2: Yeah. She lived on that same Hughes Street [Rome, Georgia] where my daddy [Lewis Clemmons] had, but at that time, my, my daddy had not built anything down there on that. He just had a lot. And he was still up on the, on the Reese's, Reese's Mountain (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On the mountain. Okay, all right. Tell me your brothers' names.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm the oldest. And the next one was Eddie, Eddie and Brittan, They put a lot of names in it--Eddie Brittan Weber Washington Clemmons [Eddie Clemmons], but that's what daddy named him. He trying to put in all the good people he could think of. And, of course, I don't go by it, but mine, mine was long like that, too.
Speaker 1: What, what was your name?
Speaker 2: My name was John Benjamin Willie Clifford Clemmons [HistoryMaker John B. Clemmons, Sr.]. They named me after two of my uncles (laughter). Got both of them in there, and then he got, he called himself, naming me after John D. Rockefeller at that time, but, but he missed him.
Speaker 1: Well, he got the John (laughter).
Speaker 2: Got the John in there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so, your brother's name was, was Eddie and--
Speaker 2: Eddie Willie Clifford Clemmons. And Eddie was a good student, and a good athlete and, and he was good all-around in, in school. What else you want to know, anything about him?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What was your--
Speaker 2: Willie [Willie Clemmons]?
Speaker 1: Willie is your next brother?
Speaker 2: Willie is the baby brother. See, he's, he's still in, he live in California now. Eddie lived in California. Well, the, the way he got out to California, my mama [Bessie Turner Clemmons] had a brother living in California, an uncle, we called him Uncle Bud. I think his name was Willie [Willie Turner], too, but we called him Uncle Bud. And Eddie got in--he, and he's working at a hotel in Rome [Georgia] after school. And he and the clerk got into dispute. And Eddie kind of got the best of the tussle and, and he, he left and went home. Well, Eddie had been driving the, the owner of the hotel's, wife around. And when she came, and she asked where Eddie was, and they told her the, the details of why he wasn't there. And she said, "Well, nobody gonna fight Eddie. I'll--." And she came out to the house, and explained it to my mother that she wanted him to come back, that wouldn't nothing happen to him. But my mother had called her brother in California, and he told 'em to put him on the train that day. And so, it wasn't but a day or so before he was on his way.
Story_ID: 531744
Speaker 1: Tell me about life on Hughes Street. What was it like for you and your brothers [Eddie Clemmons and Willie Clemmons]?
Speaker 2: Oh, in Rome [Georgia], well, it wasn't paved, that's one thing. And they did pave the, the, they ran a sidewalk down on the white side. And, and on all the rest, there was four more streets parallel to ours. And those streets were all paved with, with--well, it wasn't actually pavement. It was a black substance, but it was good. It wasn't mud, see. But, see, we, our street got muddy and, and sometime had a little branch that ran across it. And it was, sometime we had to try to cross that branch. But, fortunately, for us, we had another way out to go down in the, go away from the, the main part of it, of the community. And then, we, there was another road that led to a better street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we could do that.
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Bessie Turner Clemmons] work outside the home?
Speaker 2: No, what she did was she'd keep people's children and things sometime. And another thing she did, she would wash their clothes. She took in what they call washings, and washed them there at her house. But in those days, they didn't have washing machines and things like that--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) so.
Speaker 1: What did your father do?
Speaker 2: He worked at, at Fairbanks Company [Rome, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, you did tell me that.
Speaker 2: Fairbanks Company. In fact, daddy learned how to do blueprints. And I recall one time, his boss came to him, and said then, "Lewis [Lewis Clemmons], I got a raise for that project we did for a certain company." What the company would do is write letters to Fairbanks Company, and say, we want some trucks, dollies to be, they be, weigh a certain amount, made out of certain kind of wheels, and certain kind of handles, and things that's how. And that was just in words, and they gave the words to my dad's boss. My daddy's boss gave it to him. So, my daddy ended up with a blueprint of, of, and then he had to go to the foundry, and tell them what, about molding the wheels. He go to the machine shop, telling them about the axels, and the carpentry shop, all those places. But when he, he made the blueprints by scaled drawing. And I never understood how he could do that, but he did. And he--somebody taught how to draw that and he sent that blueprint to the company. And then, the company marked it up a little bit, said, "Make this three inches," and said, "that one five." And instead of using a bracket made of aluminum, use another metal. And, and then, his boss told him to make a sample, build one. And he built one, and they sent that to the company. And they got a big order for 'em of several hundred. And the boss came down one day, and says, "Hey, Lewis, I got a nice raise for that job we did." And he hadn't done anything, but approved it. Yeah, so, but that's, that was the life then, that's the life now sometimes. The, the right people don't get the credit.
Story_ID: 531745
Speaker 1: How much education did your father [Lewis Clemmons] have?
Speaker 2: He went to the third grade, he said. I don't know, but I know he could, he kept a, on his job, he kept a ruled notebook where he--real neat--where he would say, oh, you know, I, bill fifteen, uh, meaning assemble, fifteen 5213 trucks. That's the number of it. And those were cotton trucks, 5213. I will always remember that 'cause I remember most of them. And at the assembly, the price might have been--let us say, twelve cents. And then, if he built ten of them, then he put a dollar and twenty cents out there, and then on down the line, whatever trucks he was assembling. And then, one time, they were--the bosses sent three white boys down there one summer to work with him. And, and daddy said, "No, I'm not going to teach these boys how to take my job" (laughter). So, so he told his boss no. Well, one of the boys that came down there was one of the bosses' son. One--another one of the officials of the company [Fairbanks Company, Rome, Georgia]--son. And, and it was three boys. And, and the, and the, I don't know whether if that's what they planned to do or not. But daddy said, he wasn't going to teach them how to take his job--not him.
Speaker 1: So, did you and your brothers [Eddie Clemmons and Willie Clemmons] have--I'm sure you had chores, but did you work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we would work sometimes after school. We, when we got a certain age, we'd go down to the same company. See, my daddy's work was piecework. And, and then, we had tapped, we knew the numbers of different things and, and, that were in certain bins. And it was a big factory too, covered about three or four blocks. And what we would do is, if he had to build fifty 230s--2- 2- trucks that were called 230s--then, we knew what brackets to get, what axels to get, all of the parts. And we'd bring it out of the bins, out to a desk. And my daddy and another man, Mr. Williams [ph.], for part of the time, and then, finally, there was just, there's a lot of different folks with him. But we'd pile those other, stack them up neatly by the desk, where the bench, where the, where each man was working. And then, and as the truck is assembled--first, you, you put the two hands down, then you do what, what they call nose guards and things, put them down. And then, finally, you end up, you putting the wheels on the axel. And then, you push it off. And every day about four o'clock, some man comes through, and see how many of them you assembled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, our job was to roll them to the warehouse. And in the warehouse, well, they shipped everything from the warehouse. That was what daddy did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was doing that when he died--up to, and lived to that point, he got--up 'til he retired.
Story_ID: 531746
Speaker 1: Tell me what was the name of the school that you went to?
Speaker 2: Which one--Rome high [Main High School, Rome, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Well, elementary school, what elementary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Elementary school, it was Rose Higginbotham [ph.]. (Background noise) I don't know why they named it, that was the elementary school, but--
Speaker 1: Rose Higginbotham?
Speaker 2: Finally, then, we got a--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Higginbotham.
Speaker 2: (Background noise) And one of them, but it was one school, was built by the--what's the name of that? It was a fund [Julius Rosenwald Fund]--I've forgotten now what the name of the fund. But we had to raise--my daddy [Lewis Clemmons] and the, and the parents--had to raise a certain amount of money. And, and then, but to say, they were building schools for the white kids. And I had to pass by a brick, steam heated building, when I went to school. And that we went to one that got a big stove in the middle of the room. And we had to go out and cut the wood to put in it, yeah. But that, that when I went to high school, that was the, yeah, I had to--we had to go from west Rome [Georgia] all the way up in north Rome to the school. They didn't go, they went to the tenth, tenth grade. That was the highest grade that blacks could go. The kids, the white kids had a big steam heated, they had several, they had, they even had a nice school for them on, on the west side of town, one on the north side of town, one on the east side, and all sides. We had to go to the one--look like a barn--on the north side.
Speaker 1: How did you get to school?
Speaker 2: We walked on, on--they give us tokens, but sometimes we walk. It's about--I'd say about five miles, five miles to, from where we lived. And the teachers were not well trained, and they were, some of the time, abusive, if you didn't ask questions, say, well, you didn't know, especially when we got in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, from Jeremiah Town [ph.], that's what they call it. That's where poor people cross the track. I don't know anything. Teachers now tell you, you can't do that, you can't do things like other kids. Yet, some, some of the kids were from the different side of town. And we, when we, at the end of the tenth grade, we went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]. And when Morehouse gave the entrance exam, they gave it for all students and that, in those years, because you had those kind of schools all over Georgia. And they wanted the students because some of them had a good mind.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, well--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --we had to take exam called the entrance exam. And then, the year I went, 60 percent of them failed. We hadn't had the stuff. And we had to go into what they called sub-freshman math, sub-freshman English, and then another course was general knowledge. That wasn't the name of it. It was called it--well, Western culture, I believe.
Story_ID: 531747
Speaker 1: When you were in elementary school that went to what grade?
Speaker 2: Went to the seventh, I think--
Speaker 1: Seventh grade.
Speaker 2: --seventh or eighth.
Speaker 1: Okay, seventh grade. And while you were in elementary school, tell me about the teachers there. Were the teachers well trained? You said in high school [Main High School, Rome, Georgia], they weren't, but--
Speaker 2: No, they weren't, they wasn't, they were nice, but you, we didn't know they weren't well trained. When they were, when we were there in elementary school, then what, they, they were nice and sweet to us.
Speaker 1: Did they encourage you to continue on in school?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't ever say anything about going to college. And, actually, the year I went, there was one boy whose father was a tailor, and he made rich white people's clothes. They had an office right downtown. Another boy's father was a doctor, Dr. Weaver [ph.]. Well, and then, another boy's father was Mr. Barry Hill [ph.], who owned a white barbershop, where he cut white people's hair. And, and then, so you get--rub shoulders with them. And that barbershop was downtown. We used to have one of those here [Savannah, Georgia]. A friend of mine--well, there were several here.
Story_ID: 531748
Speaker 1: While you were in elementary school on you- in your younger days, did you and your brother [sic. brothers, Eddie Clemmons and Willie Clemmons] belong to any organizations, or have any outside activities, like the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)], or the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America]?
Speaker 2: No, we--I think when we got into the Boy Scouts, we had a man who called us Boy Scouts. And he got a book with all the things we're supposed to learn.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, but he didn't ever know all them knots and things. And so, some of them, they had them in the book, but some of them, we learned for ourselves. And, but we were pretty fair Boy Scouts, but we weren't like we ought to been. Like I had mine when I went up, my troop, I had a troop in, in Harlan, Kentucky, and then, and one in Maryland, too.
Speaker 1: Well, your troop, they weren't allowed to, to buy uniforms, you told me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they couldn't, couldn't buy them, and--
Speaker 1: They couldn't buy them--
Speaker 2: No, I'm--
Speaker 1: Why, why, they couldn't, couldn't buy them?
Speaker 2: They wouldn't sell them to you. They said, they didn't want them black boys to have them. And then, that's been, that hadn't been too long ago when, when, when--it's just the way things were. And so, my mama [Bessie Turner Clemmons] and daddy [Lewis Clemmons], and a lot of other people, they roll with the punch. So, in the South, I don't know about other places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The black people who, if they've gotten ahead any kind of way, they ought to be patted on the back because they, they had so many obstacles, see.

Speaker 1: We were talking about high school [Main High School, Rome, Georgia], and you were explaining that the schools then would only go to the tenth grade.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And after the tenth grade, you were--
Speaker 2: They in college, graduating from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had separate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and did you, did you pass, uh--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't pass.
Speaker 1: You didn't pass?
Speaker 2: None of us passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm saying, they was five of us. Five boys went there the year I went, and not a single one of us, 'cause there was 60 percent of the kids from all over Georgia flunked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, all those boys who had--the doctor's son, Dr. Weaver [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he, he had a son and--
Speaker 1: None of you passed?
Speaker 2: --Mr. Barry Hill [ph.], Mr. Humphrey's [ph.] the big, he was a big tailor, made fine clothes for white people to wear.
Speaker 1: So, after you finished taking the, the sub-classes, the sub-freshman classes, then you were able to go on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had to do that--
Speaker 1: Or able to--
Speaker 2: --to become a freshman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You had to be in college. See, you had--Morehouse took them 'cause they needed the students, and wanted them. And I don't know who came up with the idea, but you had to take that exam. Everybody took it. Even it was some boys that lived in Atlanta [Georgia], where they had four years, flunked it. One of my friends, Flicky Nelson [ph.], he flunked it. And I remember one of the teachers gave him a hard time, too, because he comes to the class late. And she'd say, "Mr. Nelson, where are you going?" And he'd say, "Going to your class." She'd say, "No, you're not, you might turn right around and go back in. If you come, if you come tomorrow, you be on time."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she meant that, too.
Speaker 1: So, this was 1927 when you left high school. And what happened between 1927 when you left high school and you entered Morehouse?
Speaker 2: No, no, I, I don't think it was '27 [1927]. I think it was '29 [1929] or '30 [1930].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1930, all right. So, how long did you stay at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Six years, but I was not in school. See, my freshman year, I was there. And that, end of that year, I went to the tobacco farm.
Speaker 1: You went where?
Speaker 2: Tobacco farm.
Speaker 1: You went to a tobacco farm?
Speaker 2: Up in Hartford, Connecticut--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) then we, I came back.
Story_ID: 531750
Speaker 1: Tell me about the tobacco farm [in Hartford, Connecticut]. You went there to work?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, we had one boy from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], who was a junior, had been there before, and he just had got a crew. And some of the boys were going for the second time. That was the first time we went. And we, they, we, we, we set out the tobacco plants from the beginning. And we cultivate them to the end, so we put them up in what we call the barns, the way we hang them up to be cured. The tobacco leaves are this, tobacco leaves, and then, whatever happened to them after then, we was back in school. Well, the, the next year, we went up, (cough) the boys say they wanted more money, or they was going to strike. So, the man said, "Well, strike." And we struck, and we was up there about a week. You needed money getting short, (cough) excuse me, and everything is getting short. And, and we say, we just can't stay here and starve, so we, we all came back to New York [New York], and some of them came on back home. Some of us didn't have the money to come back home. So, I stayed, everyone else stayed in New York. And we worked in New York that summer, and some didn't, just survived, and until the buddies took care of them. And, anyway, I, I--
Story_ID: 531751
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did you work in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked at a place called Duffy's Tavern [New York, New York] that summer. See, and then, I came back to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] one year, and then I had to stay out again. And that time, I went to--see, the first year, I was out, I went to St. Petersburg [Florida] for the work in a hotel. The year, when I came back, there's one of those boys who flunked out of Morehouse. His mother found out that my mother [Bessie Turner Clemmons]--well, I, I was the only one that was on the honor roll out of the boys. We had a honor roll, even though we were doing some sub-freshman work. Well, the man in Rome [Georgia] had a little scoop, a little paper [Rome Enterprise], like we got a weekly paper here. Every--it came out, the honor roll would come out in Atlanta World [Atlanta Daily World]. And then, Mr. Atwater [Anak T. Atwater] would print it again in Rome. Well, those parents read it, and then said after, maybe then, when doing might leave them with us 'cause I lived on the other side of the track. And, but all of them, including one named Ms. Gore [ph.]. Ms. Gore had a boy named Howard Gore [ph.]. And he came out to the house--I mean, she came out to the house often. She had a little, a little chauffeur. She, she had things. Some of the rest of us didn't have, see. And she had a car, and this boy would bring her out to see mama. Well, it happened right after I got back from New York, and didn't have any money. He said he was going to Florida, and he said he, and he told me I could go with him. Well, I told my mama, and she cried and (unclear) with him, but I had--came, came, and that won't do any good. I just don't have the money, and I can't--he'd already told us what we had to have. And so, I went to Florida that year. And from Florida, the lady who owned the Morrison Hotel [ph.] knew the lady, who owned the hotel up on Lookout Mountain. And she liked me. And since I was from Rome, and the lady who owned it, lived in Rome, she called and told her that I was a good worker and a good boy. And so, she gave me a job up there. I worked up there two or three weeks cleaning up, giving--see, it's the summer, it's all it seem, so we could open. And this lady named Ms. Dora [ph.] was a supervisor of us--a white lady. So, she told Ms. Leadabanner [ph.], "I don't need me running around here after them boys all the times. And let, let John [HistoryMaker John B. Clemmons, Sr.], so Ms. Lead-, he's a college boy." I'd been one year in college. So, Ms. Leadabanner put me in charge. And soon as they--we've started, he said, "Man, we don't have to." I said, "Yes, we do. We got to earn this money," but anyway, that was--
Speaker 1: That was the second year, that second summer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you worked at Lookout Mountain?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 531752
Speaker 1: You went back to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went back there that, that year. And then, when that, after that year, I went back to, I stayed out again. I went to New York [New York], and I worked two jobs, Duffy's Tavern [New York, New York] and Chiefs Head Bay. It was a long ride out there every morning, and I'd get up to ride out there, but--
Speaker 1: Where, where did you stay in New York?
Speaker 2: Down on 25th Street. I don't remember now what, what apartment, see, 25.
Speaker 1: Okay. So when you were at Morehouse, what was your course of study? What were you majoring in?
Speaker 2: I majored in pre-med, and then I, and ended up that I took more math than I did anything because it was easy. And I could study on jobs and things. And, and so, I got a degree in mathematics and--
Speaker 1: But you didn't get your degree from Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Oh, did you? Okay.
Speaker 2: And it--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: In, in '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: In '36 [1936], okay. Did you attend Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me about that. When did you, when did you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --attend?
Speaker 2: --after I got in medical school, and couldn't, didn't have any money, Mr. Whitaker [ph.], who was the dean then at Morehouse, came to me and he said, "They finally get some good students in math to get a master's degree in mathematics from Atlanta University." They would only graduated--there's only been one boy in the program in math. And they, when I got in there, there was about four of them, four or five. And they gave me some kind of scholarship. I don't, I don't think it was, it was something where you had to work, and then, and, and, but anyway, they arranged it. It wasn't much, but it is barely enough to get by. And so, you had to try to hustle and do other things. I, I threw papers part of the time 'cause it was one of my former--well, I was in Morehouse with a fellow named Ben Ingersoll.
Story_ID: 531753
Speaker 1: I just want to go back a little bit to make sure that we have everything straight. You were, you know, in Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and you had to leave a couple of times. So, it was 1936 that you received your B.A. in mathematics. Is that right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then, you went to the Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to obtain your master's degree in mathematics (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --which you received in 1937--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or a year later from when you got your bachelor's [degree], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your thesis. You were going to tell me about your thesis in math.
Speaker 2: Well, there's not much I can tell a layman. But what, what it was, because I had worked in physics, vectors descriptions of, of forces and, and in physics. And I used vector analysis to prove all of the theorems in geometry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I proved them with vector theories, rather than the words we've used on there, and a copy of it is in Atlanta University--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --library, so they say. I haven't been back to see, but there are people who've told me they referred to.
Story_ID: 531754
Speaker 1: So, you leave Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and, and what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: You go to Harlan, Kentucky?
Speaker 2: I'm trying, no, yeah, I went to Harlan. But see, I had applied to medical school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before I went into the master's. And I didn't have any money. And, and that's just, to sum it up, and I decided I was going to work. So, then that delayed me a little bit by letting me get the master's degree, but that didn't hurt me. Then I went to Kentucky. And I was the only person, white or black, in the county that had a master's degree. That's how I fall behind, I guess. We had been--because there was nobody that had one, you know. And then, the funny thing, we met with the white teachers. And we had--the schools were separated, but we met together. And I mean, Mr. Henderson [ph.] was the superintendent and had a secretary that would call. When she called the rule, she called all the white teachers by Mrs., or Miss, or something. When they got to the black, they started calling their name, Kate [ph.], King [ph.], all that. So, the next year, I, I was made principal. And so, I went to the superintendent and I told him--I said, "That's really embarrassing to us. You go down the list, and you call all these, all these other people a Miss, or Mrs., or whatever."  Well, you had to be a Miss because then, you couldn't be married and, and teach there in that system 'cause they said jobs were too scarce. But see, that was in a pretty, pretty rough time, too, 'cause right after the Depression [Great Depression], yeah. Yeah, so, he, the next time they called the roll, they just put Miss to, to all the women, the black women, too. But that was the one little thing I taught him. Mr. Henderson was from Mississippi, so I knew why, that she could get away with that. She seemed to be a nice person, but she called the roll, and she did, but she called me professor. And then, she was, yeah, yeah, they had, we had two more men. I don't know what she called them--professors or not--but after that, I think she might have called the men Mr., up, maybe she called them professors. I don't know for that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the school in Harlan, Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Rosenwald [Rosenwald High School].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Rosenwald.
Speaker 1: Rosenwald?
Speaker 2: Rosenwald, R-O-S-E-N-W-A-L-D. But Rosenwald was a man who gave--all those in the South. His policy was if you raise one third of the money, he'd put the other two thirds to build the school 'cause we got one of those out there in the area where I lived in west Rome [Georgia]. We got one of them Rosenwald schools. My daddy [Lewis Clemmons] didn't, didn't have any money, but they would get, find and they, and we raised that one third. And Mr. Rosenwald put the--Julius Rosenwald, that was his name.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you, were you the principal of the school, Rosenwald School?
Speaker 2: Three years, I think, three year.
Story_ID: 531755
Speaker 1: Did you leave Kentucky after that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I liked a girl up there, and she died. And somehow or another, I just didn't want to be there anymore. And I got a better job as far as pay was concerned in Cumberland, Maryland. Yeah, so I was not the principal. I got about two or three times as much pay in Cumberland, Maryland than I was getting in, in Harlan [at Rosenwald High School, Harlan, Kentucky], so that's a good enough reason. But after the girlfriend died, I didn't care for it--
Speaker 1: For--
Speaker 2: That town much anymore (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for that town, okay. So, you went--
Speaker 2: I, while I was there, I would wait table. And people said, I had never seen a professor, (laughter), professor teach--wait table. And then, I say, yeah, but they pay me, and I need the money. I was still just trying to go in medical school then.
Speaker 1: You were still trying to go back to medical school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to save the money and, and each year, like I might have it, but I said, well, I would go to stay another year and so.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, after you left Harlan, Kentucky, that's when you went to Cumberland, Maryland?
Speaker 2: Cumberland, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that's where you waited the tables?
Speaker 2: No, I waited in both places. See, I can, as far as white people was concerned, they didn't care what you did. But the black people, they said, didn't like to see the professor--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --waiting tables. See, but--
Speaker 1: Did you have a teaching position in Cumberland, Maryland?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the vice principal and all--in Cumberland, Maryland. And, and I also had a hobby, couldn't have, I worked in a barbershop, so I mean, I, I also had a hobby. If I knew of a person who was old and had--sick and couldn't get to the barbershop, I'd cut his hair free.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the people who knew that because some of them was so proud to get their daddy's hair, granddaddy's haircut. And I, and I cut little boys' hair, too.
Story_ID: 531756
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about the draft. Were you ever--
Speaker 2: I was in Harlan, Kentucky when I was drafted. And funny thing, we were integrated in, in the draft. I was, I had the highest training, I think. But I was corporal in charge when we went out to Louisville [Kentucky] to have the physical, sitting there. And they gave me some pieces of paper that we get to have people to--I would sign and give it to them to pay for any expense we had. We went, on the way up there, I mean, we stopped at a cafe. And we went in, and the man said, "Y'all can't eat here, but they can." So, see, it was some black and some white. And I said, "Well, none of us will eat," and I started out. And the woman hollered, "All of you can eat here." I guess it was his wife. She, she was turning down--see, the government paid a little bit more than any of the other people for a meal. And they had already written in, in this thing--I mean, what you, what you pay for the meals, see. And--
Speaker 1: So, what happened when you, when you got there to, to enlist? I mean, you know, they, they drafted you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, they examine you, you know--
Speaker 1: Were you--examination?
Speaker 2: What they do is that you--all, all the men, if you strip, and then you go in, and the doctors carry you through different things.
Speaker 1: So, did you pass?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I passed.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you went into the [U.S. military] service?
Speaker 2: Well, the--and I was scheduled to go to Fort Huachuca [Arizona]. And my--there's--the guy who, who's, what you, who's chairman of the draft board, was also chairman of the school board, Dr. Bentley [ph.]. And they'd already taken two men. There wasn't, but three of us in there, in the school [Rosenwald High School, Harlan, Kentucky]. And they--he is, he just said that I wasn't going. That's all. That's, that's the power they had in those days. Yeah, and so I didn't, I didn't have to go. I didn't--I was single, I didn't mind.
Story_ID: 531757
Speaker 1: So, you were saving money to try and get in medical school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did you go to school in Southern California?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, I got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When was this?
Speaker 2: Actually, the president of the college took three of us. And he told us that he had some blanks, that he want us to apply for a scholarship, and from Ford Foundation. We all applied. One of the fellows went to New York where he was in a school, and he got some people to help him make, set up his application. Well, I wrote mine, and I gave it to one of the teachers out there. I had my wife [Mozelle Daily Clemmons] look at it. I thought it was--she's in English, got her master's degree. And she, she didn't find anything. Well, this lady marked it up, like I was, with red marks. I couldn't use it, couldn't hardly, so many marks up there. And so, I didn't even try to understand it there. So, I had another copy. I took it to another teacher, Luella (Unclear) [ph.]. And Luella made two suggestions. "On page so and so and so, did you mean to say this or this?" And on another page, she made some reference. She didn't put any marks on the paper. All right, but so I sent one of those to the place where we were supposed to apply. And they gave two in Georgia--one to me, and one to a white fellow that went to Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I could choose any school in America. Well, I had two brothers [Eddie Clemmons and Willie Clemmons] out there, so I said, it may give me a chance to spend some time with them. So, I chose USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California]. It's one of the toughest schools in the country, and, well--
Speaker 1: So, you're working on your Ph.D. at this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, were you successful in getting your Ph.D. from USC?
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't, didn't, didn't get it because, well, I had spent, I spent two years. And then, I had problems with the man who was--I had three men on my committee. One of them was Dr. Hankins [ph.] who I love very much. And I was gonna do it in his concentration, and he accepted. And then, he decided to go somewhere else to work. Well, see, when I got that far, that was the third year. When I got that far, I had been out of school back here about five years doing the research, and trying to teach, and do that, and all that, too. And, so, when I went back, there was a Dr. Ballantine [ph.] on there, and he had gone over to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]. And then, all, all of them said they didn't think they was, was quite qualified to, for that subject, to have (unclear), all right. I don't know whether they did it, but that was their excuse for getting out of working with me, see, 'cause some of the Ph.D. candidates went to (unclear) here. One fellow named Beck [ph.], he said, "Well, Beck," his advisor, "what you doing about so and so tonight?" Said, "Bring your stuff over to the house." Well, they take it to his house. And then, but there wasn't, but nine candidates for the Ph.D. in there. So, I went over to UCLA following Dr. Ballantine. And when I got over there, the, the registrar wrote me a letter and said, he waited 'til I was there two or three months, and seeing that I hadn't, I wasn't, I had registered as a candidate for the Ph.D. And because I had done all the classwork I needed, and he wrote me a letter and says, you, before you can be classified as a candidate for Ph.D., you got to spend one year at UCLA. But I just, I wrote my wife, and told her, I'm coming home when this is over, and that's it. I ain't going to worry about no Ph.D. anymore.
Story_ID: 531758
Speaker 1: When did you marry? Do you remember what year it was?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-seven [1947] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seven [1947], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '47 [1947] 'cause it was the year my mama [Bessie Turner Clemmons] died, and a lot of things happened.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, let me see. You spend the summer in the late '40s [1940s] at University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. What did you do there?
Speaker 2: You know, in the summer at the University of Pittsburgh, I was just auditing courses in education. See, that was not my field, but it, at that time, I was teaching. And so, I decided that I need some more experience in, and I, I--one audit was, what's the man name? Well, I can't call his, can't call, I'm telling--John Dewey. Now, he's not the, the teacher, but there was a teacher--John Dewey had come up with some (unclear), and new things in what they call set theory in mathematics. And then, and it was scaring teachers. So they, it didn't frighten me, but I decided I needed a course to, in, in--I need to have some knowledge, better knowledge, of how you go about teaching set theory and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. By this time, when you get married, is this when you move to Savannah [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yep. The truth is, I had, I had, when I had to ask to renew my contract in Maryland [Cumberland, Maryland], they said--I told them I was married. Then, they told me, we'd be glad to have you, and she can have a job, too. Well, we saw this thing. I had an article in the paper about Colston [James A. Colston] coming here as president, and I thought I'd just say congratulations. I didn't, I didn't mean, I wasn't thinking about it. I was going back to Maryland 'cause I had a good paying job. Maryland paid about three times as much as the other southern schools were paying. But, anyway, after I decided to go back to, to, to Maryland, and Colston called. And after he finally talked me into--I took less money. I was making already that. Contract for the next year was gonna be $4,200 a year. And, and so then, Savannah State [Georgia State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia], he offered me $18,000--$1,800 a month--I mean, a year. And so, when I spent the, the time thinking about it, I just said to Colston--says, he says, top salary was 2,400. And my, and he, this Dr. Griffith [ph.] was the man he'd paid that, and he said he's gonna be your boss, the chairman of the division, if I'd come in mathematics. See, he was in chemistry, physics, about, he was over all of that. So, I did, told him I'd take his 1,800 'cause I didn't want to have a (unclear) with him. And then, I had saved some money to go to medical school. And I, I'd saved pretty well and had, and worked all kinds of jobs.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: That's, that's how I came to Savannah State.
Speaker 1: So, Savannah, Savannah State (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I talked to my wife [Mozelle Daily Clemmons] about it and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year this was that you came to Savannah State?
Speaker 2: Forty-seven [1947].
Speaker 1: In '47 [1947], okay. That was the same year that, that you got married.
Story_ID: 531759
Speaker 1: You received a Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and the National Science grants to try again to get your Ph.D. And so, you, in the early '50s [1950s], you went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] for a short period of time trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, I ended up, well, I was on, I was, I was not on a grant then. I got the grant--the, for the year of, let me see, when, well, the Ford Foundation was in 1951.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the next year, I got a National Science Foundation. I'm back at University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, the other, I was going to manage it myself, 'cause I had two brothers [Eddie Clemmons and Willie Clemmons] out there and everything, see.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened that you didn't get your Ph.D. from UCLA?
Speaker 2: It--'cause I, as I just told you, they told me that I was not a candidate. I had to be there a whole year. And I just, I, I wasn't going through that until, let's see, I don't even know whether I would have gotten it, even if I stayed another year. You understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: I see, I see.
Speaker 2: I had spent three years over there, and so I was--
Speaker 1: That was enough for you.
Speaker 2: It was times in your life when you decide--that's, that's the reason why I guess I learned how to do so many things, like--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then, then, then, see, even back then, I had met Mr. Toomer [Louis B. Toomer] and got, he got me interested in real estate and things like that and so.
Speaker 1: And that was, okay, you were in Savannah, at Savannah State [Georgia State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia], and this is when you start the Alpha Mu Boule [sic. Alpha Lambda Boule]. Is that right?
Speaker 2: I didn't start it.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I was--went to the, I was one of the original people. The president of the college was a member of it, and he was the one that selected me. And he elect--selected six fellows--no, yeah, six, 'cause he was the seventh one. And I was kind of a lieutenant for him doing the paperwork and stuff, and getting that ready.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Dr. Payne [William K. Payne] was the man that selected the big--and then because--I don't want that to be in the record though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His wife was a--they were, they were concerned about the compatibility of those wives. And there was an incident, but I didn't--I don't want to talk about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, we won't talk about that.
Story_ID: 531760
Speaker 1: We were talking about when you met Mr. Toomer [Louis B. Toomer].
Speaker 2: Well, okay. I was, I was--
Speaker 1: You said you were, look, when you first moved here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I first moved here--
Speaker 1: In '47 [1947].
Speaker 2: --I wanted to find out--see, 'cause there was a black bank in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I had, being in Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and being very conscious of those things, and knowing Julian Bond's daddy [Horace Mann Bond], and people like that, who were great fighters for civil rights. And I was, I had some money. See, when I was in Maryland and in Kentucky, I, I had a little case, a little checking account. in both of those towns, but I saved money in Atlanta C and S [The Citizens and Southern National Bank]--I mean, I mean, not C and S. It's a black bank. And I would send the money, send my book, and money every month with something, some money, a check, a money order, or something. And then, when I came here, I wanted to continue that when, and I had saved seventeen thousand dollars back in the real hard time. And I came, and put that money in Mr. Toomer's bank [Carver State Bank, Savannah, Georgia]. And then, it meant that he--I don't know whether anybody has had as much, one person--had that much money in it. It might have been much more, but I didn't, I didn't ask him. He didn't tell me either. And so, he, he took a liking to me. I used to go, I'd see him at--we had a local baseball team. We--he, he liked baseball. I'd go there and, Dr., another fellow and him was closer to him than I was. Well, at least, he thought he was closer. Dr. Kai [ph.], well. Dr. Kai would pick him up and take him. And I'd go to the game, but I never sat with them. But, anyway, he, he would--we would see him, usually on Friday afternoons. I've forgotten now what was the reasons, but one time, Mr. Toomer had made a deal in some real estate. And he, he said, yeah, he came in, and said, "Well," I think he gave us a hundred dollars apiece. "Are you broke, boys? Yeah, yeah. I'm going to give y'all a present," and he did give us all a hundred dollar bill. And for, then, I used to hang around. I was living in the proper part of Savannah [Georgia] then. I was living on 37th Street now. I had bought property, I started buying property like this. But, and Mr. Toomer, after I put that money in his bank, I said, "Mr. Toomer," I says, "I want to buy some real estate." And he told me then, then, "I'm going, I'll take care of it." And so, there was some white people on 41st Street, a family, 'cause a black man had moved in that block. They wanted to sell that property. And he told me it's a good buy. They, they on a flight. So, when they--Mr. Toomer said--now, the house is worth about nine thousand dollars back then. And he said, "You can probably get it for about seven." I said, "Well, let's offer them six." And we did, and he took it. The next day, the people next door wanted to sell their--I bought that. Well, they had abandoned it. See, Mr. Toomer just--I'll take care of it. I mean, I didn't have to, I had put that money in there. I didn't mortgage it to him. I mortgaged it to the bank, mortgaged the houses to the bank, went through all that procedure. And then, after then, he would just throw my things my way. I mean, he'd give me for--right now, his widow [Janie Toomer], if she gets a good buy, she'd give me first choice, want to know if I want it. And then, I, I quit buying unless it's a real good choice so. And she's just like a sister to me now. She lives across the street.
Story_ID: 531761
Speaker 1: So, you made a, a good investment buying in, and selling real estate.
Speaker 2: Well, I bought that and then that led to others, and I had no trouble in financing. That was--my, my mentor [Louis B. Toomer] told, then say, you, you like it, buy it. And then, what I, what I'll do is when the rent came, and I was working--my wife [Mozelle Daily Clemmons] wasn't working then, though. But I was working, and I had this money, and I just pinch up and paid the, paid the notes, or make another one, see. Well, now I got ready. It's been two years ago I believe, I, in November, I--does--I've been selling something, and some. Another thing you could do when I first started buying, you could take the equity that you had in one, when you, especially, when you bought one, you, you could, instead of capital gains, they didn't charge a capital gains tax. You could use, long as you--they did have capital gain, but as long as you put it back in, so other property within a year--I think it was--you didn't have to pay that, that capital gain (unclear). And, and then, they cut that out a few years ago, so that when I, when I bought this, when I sold this last property--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I had to pay something like $300,000 for capital gains tax, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, so--
Speaker 2: And what else did you want to know?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 531762
Speaker 1: At this time, you're still, you're teaching at Savannah State [Georgia State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia]. How long--
Speaker 2: I'm not teaching. I didn't--
Speaker 1: Not--no, at this time, this is in 1947, 1948.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was teaching.
Speaker 1: Yeah. How long did you teach at Savannah State?
Speaker 2: I, I taught, let me see, I taught thirty-five years there.
Speaker 1: What did you teach? Was it mathematics and physics (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mathematics, physics, and computer science.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you were the chairman of the department of mathematics?
Speaker 2: Chairman, chairman of the department. One of the things, special things I did, I wrote IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] at Poughkeepsie, New York. They gave me a trip up there, and tell--I went to a meeting in University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] for all of the units in Georgia. And they took us out to Georgia Tech in, in Georgia [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]. And, and those places, they had rooms where each student would have a computer way back then, and I didn't know that. I didn't know that was happening. And so, I wrote IBM. They gave me a trip up there. And I took one of the leader, leader students with me up there, and see, he's, he's deceased now. But (unclear), I was able to talk to the vice president of IBM. And I told them, that's--you all should--we trying to get the computers. And when--you all should give, give us some, a resource person. Said, "Well, we'll let you know." And I stayed two days up there. But when I got back, I got a letter saying they had decided that they would give us a resource person at their expense for one year. Well, that person came, and we were living at The Landings [Savannah, Georgia]. That's where rich people--they paid for all of that. And, and we had, and he taught a class in it. And I, I and they didn't--lady named Ms. Wilson [ph.] knew a good bit about programming and stuff. But that, that fellow kind of directed us and taught us more. And we got what you call the 1620 computer [IBM 1620]. And, and they put that in, in here at the college. And then, later, we got a, one called a 360 [IBM System/360], but the college bought it. And then, but you see, but that's something, a lot of the kids didn't know how the computer got here. But, and a lot of teachers probably didn't know, but that's how we got it, see (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 531763
Speaker 1: Tell me how you got involved, I know that Mr. Toomer [Louis B. Toomer] was a good friend of yours, and he was in the real estate, teaching you how to buy properties, and taking care of your real estate investments. How did you get involved in being on the board at the, at Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, one day I was in his office, and he had a meeting coming up. And he told me to go in, come on and go with me, and I went with him. When he got in the door, he--there was seven or eight more men. I could name them sitting around the table. And he said, "Hi, fellows." They all spoke. Some of them got up. They--yeah, when he came in, we all got in a habit, and he would now, when his wife comes in, I mean, they get up. And she's the only woman that's ever been on the board. But anyway, he says, "I'm putting this boy on the board." I, I don't know if I have a thing, idea about it. I, I'm flabbergasted myself. And wasn't anybody on that board that could say anything about it 'cause he put them on there. And it was--the stock belonged to him practically all of it. He had us buying stock, and at that time, we paid sixty-five dollars a share. Well, then, wasn't many people could spare that much money but, anyway, and but, anyway, when Bob James [HistoryMaker Robert James] came, we, we hired him. He was working for C and S [The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Georgia] and, and Mr. (Unclear) Lane [ph.] recommended him to us, who's, who's over all of the C and S Banks in Georgia--Bank of America [Bank of America Corporation] bought all of them.
Speaker 1: Well, there was a president before Bob James came--L.D. [Lawrence D. Perry]?
Speaker 2: But, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, there was, (unclear), that one--the--Mr. Perry was president when I got there. See, he was, he was there when Mr. Toomer walks in and said, I'm putting--but he was, I don't think he was on the board. But Mr. Perry was the president of the bank, and so a good, nice qualified man.
Speaker 1: So, when he retired, then Bob James came?
Speaker 2: Let me see. Oh, yes, yeah, when he, when he retired, he wasn't ready to retire, but Mr. Lane had an influence with Mr. Toomer. And he told Mr. Toomer that we, that we needed--and Mr., Mr. Toomer died before we got, got to that. And then, we, we got Mr., Mr. Lane was more of a bigger advisor then. And then, we got a message from him saying, well, he came and told us that Mr. Perry ought to retire. He's sixty years old and, and 'cause he made all the people in his bank, which is now Bank of America, all over Georgia, retire at sixty. And so, he, he got to prepare to retire that way. He worked one more year after Mr., Mr.--after we got that suggestion. And Mr. Lane was a good friend of Mr. Toomer and, and they was like brothers. Sometimes I remember when we had--there was--we, we needed--we had a good big long, and we couldn't handle it actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he called Mr., Mr. Lane. He just send them right over there. I don't know what kind of race and he--what kind of papers they fill out if he knew then see, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, when, that's the way it had happened.
Speaker 1: That's how you got on the board, okay.
Speaker 2: That's why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, now, what--
Speaker 2: --I got almost--when he took me up there and then--
Speaker 1: How long have you been on the board?
Speaker 2: --then once Dr. Moore [R.W. Moore] was, was chairman of the board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dr. Moore, well, Dr. Moore died, their board selected me.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year this was that you became the board chairman?
Speaker 2: I don't know, maybe been a long time--
Speaker 1: You don't remember, okay, a long time, okay.
Speaker 2: --been a long time.
Speaker 1: All right. So, now, we're--
Speaker 2: 'Cause Ms. Toomer [Janie Toomer] and I, and Bob James had the most stock in it. That's one of the reasons why we could, we could just--Ms. Toomer and I could decide on that ourselves because she and I got the most stock.
Story_ID: 531764
Speaker 1: All right, so now we're in the, the Civil Rights Movement. Tell me about any involvement in the '60s [1960s] as the Civil Rights Movement is evolving here. Tell me what's going on in Savannah [Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, directly, I, I was not too directly involved because they--actually the school administration frowned on it, at first, see, but it seemed now they can do almost anything but--
Speaker 1: Were the students doing anything at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had, you'd see them around, on the weekends with, with baskets trying to collect money. And I can see now, even coming by on Saturday at my house. They coming in and were, and were raising money.
Speaker 1: What part did you play?
Speaker 2: The only part, main part that I played, was to support them, like I get, and then get the girls and boys out of--when they sat-in here, well, there was a story behind it. They heard about the boys in North Carolina sitting-in. And so, the girls and boys playing when here, and when they got down there, the police was there because one of the girls had told her mama, and the mama notified the police and they were there. So, they didn't get to sit-in. So, then, they began to sit and meet in the Y [Young Men's Christian Association]. And I used to go--they invited me. I was one of those people they would invite. They didn't invite everybody, faculty member, I remembered 'cause some of them were openly against it, against us being there. And so, they met in the Y, a YMCA at this time, when they, when they're having more, most our best meetings. We had a YMCA director who was--I don't know how much involved, but he was very supportive of us. So, so the students could meet there, and I was one of the people from the faculty, could, could go to the meetings. They didn't let all them go because some of them betrayed 'em. See, and the, sometime the president [William K. Payne], they wouldn't like it. So--
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other major players here in Savannah?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been invited by--Bobby Hill [Bobby L. Hill], he was a student at Savannah State--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when he first got started, Bobby Hill, Hosea Williams, Mr., a, a man named Mr. Delaware [John S. Delaware]. There's so many. I mean, the young lady, she had two young, young sons who were enrolled in Savannah State. And she was a widow, but she was a big member in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and she was in that march [Selma to Montgomery March] down in--I can't call that name, yeah, right now.
Speaker 1: The march in Washington [March on Washington], you, you--
Speaker 2: No, the march in, in Alabama.
Speaker 1: In Ala- okay, that was in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: In Selma [Alabama]? You talking about the one in Selma?
Speaker 2: The one that, what, when they would march one city to another--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --down there in Alabama. And when, the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was down there, and put in jail. She was down there and had a group, too, and we had several people from the city.
Speaker 1: You were talking about W.W. Law?
Speaker 2: Yeah, W.W. Law, he was president of the NAACP. And he was a strong man because, and then he, he tried to, there was a senator who tried to get him fired and, but he was a postman, worked for the post--did get him. He did lose his job for a few weeks or a month, but then, there was a lot of protest from the NAACP, and he got his job back. He died. He was working for the post office.
Story_ID: 531765
Speaker 1: Now in 1963, are you a part of the group that charters the Alpha Lambda Boule?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me about that. What, what type of organization?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Why was it started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as I can say, is Dr. Payne [William K. Payne] was a member. And it was an organization that, what they said, scholars would meet together, and try to promote various causes among--was it the--their race. Well, it was one, I mean, it was in places--well, I got in. And Percy Julian [Percy Lavon Julian] was an outstanding chemist, black chemist, and he was already, already in it. And Upjohn Company [Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company] gave him $8 million for discovering a pill. I think it was, I don't remember the name of it, but it was a blood pressure pill. And, and then, hired him, so that made, gave him a lot of voice, so we, we went to a meeting. It was at, the meeting was in San Francisco [California], and Percy Julian spoke. He said, "We're doing this, and we're doing that, but we're not doing much to promote this, the right kind of things and things." And that's when the scholars, they appointed him as chairman of the committee. And when he--well, the, the person who was head of the fraternity was--what are their names? Anyway, he was just a Chicago University [sic. University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] graduate, and he had gotten his Ph.D. in mathematics at nineteen. And I knew him, J. Ernest Wilkins [J. Ernest Wilkins, Jr.], that's his name, J. Ernest Wilkins. And I had met J. Ernest Wilkins in the, in math meetings, nice little association for math teachers. And not only that, but the American Mathematics Society [sic. American Mathematical Society] was three organizations that he'd go to, and I went to all three of them, too. Well, I knew J., J. Ernest was smart. And sometimes, he presented papers at the math meetings. And I'd go, and I'd ask him questions about certain things. Well--
Speaker 1: Was he a part of the--
Speaker 2: Boule?
Speaker 1: Boule?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the, he was the grand sire archon then--what would you call--he was the top man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--Percy Julian made a speech to us at our meeting telling us about things what we ought to do.
Speaker 1: Right, so the idea of the organization is to do what?
Speaker 2: Well, at that, at time, it was mainly for people of, of two degrees, being able to associate, and do things to promote the community, their local communities, and then of that. But Percy Julian made a speech and said at these grand meetings we have, and one of them every two years. And, and these meetings, he find out that Law [W.W. Law] said, wait, and then he said that Law's away, you drank it, and you spending all this money. Put more in. We're not promoting anything that he wanted to promote. And so, J. Ernest Wilkins, who was the grand sire archon, appointed him chairman of the committee in San Francisco. And since he knew me, he appointed me on the committee, and he appointed all of the people on there. And the president of Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] at that time was on it. And there was a guy who was about--and the vice president of Pepsi-Cola [PepsiCo]. His name was Franklin [ph.], and then there was a judge in Toledo, Ohio, who was probably--anyway, I don't remember all the members of that first committee.
Story_ID: 531766
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about Sigma Pi Phi [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, Inc.] and the recommendations, you know--was a group put together. What did you recommend that be done?
Speaker 2: He, he--Percy Julian made his report. And, and then, we recommend that we form a, an institution [Alpha Lambda Boule], not only to do things for scholars, but to help the scholars get through, but that we also be prepared to do things for things, like the hurricane [Hurricane Katrina] down in New Orleans [Louisiana]. And 'cause we didn't all agree when it, when actually, we didn't know about that was going to happen. But when it happened, we had telephone conversation where you had all of, all of the members of the committee own the land. And I was one that, that, I was one of them who didn't agree that I, 'cause I had given money directly to it. And I thought that, that shouldn't interfere with the scholarship money because we had decided that we'd take the money, invest it, and then, we use the earnings for scholarship. And that's what we actually, what, the way I understood it. And then, some of them wanted just anything that come up. They was ready to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: Well, what, what I was trying to say is that actually the foundation's mingle is to give scholarships because there were a lot of students that had good minds, you were telling me?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And, and, and they come off of the, the National Merit list [National Merit Scholarship Program]. See, they did not just--somebody say, this is a good student. Well, there are some students who take the Merit, the National Merit exams and, and, and that's where we select them from. Actually, I've been on the, on the subcommittees where we recommend. See, they were two, it's three people on a committee, on the subcommittee. And you send so many of those names. Say, they send me fifty names. And I got to cut that list down to, I think, thirty or something like that, okay. And then, they, they are some more people got them same names I got. And those thirty has to be the top people out of the, of, of the--if you send them to three people, the top of those three people, the people that we select 'em.
Story_ID: 531767
Speaker 1: You were recognized for helping students get through college, sometimes paying out of your own pocket. Was this because you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where, where did you get that from?
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm asking, is that true? You were recognized for helping students.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And where, I don't know how you would know it--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --'cause I, well, anyway, the--
Speaker 1: Is it true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What, what happened, I found out there were so many kids that were good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They couldn't get through?
Speaker 2: And, and other teachers said they were good and, but they couldn't stay in school. So, we organized in my department, the math, physics, and political science department for all the students now, not just for, we organized a grant program at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia], so that they could borrow the money from us. And we had a limit, though, of--I think something like seventy-five dollars. But this was, was not to put them through school 'cause, naturally, it would cost a whole lot more than that. But if, if they get in a jam, we, we would give them their money. And that grew out of a fact 'cause when I first came here, I had little money, and kids would borrow it from me. So, I got every member on my faculty--and I was head of the department--to agree that we would set up a foundation for the department. Well, a loan fund, that's what it was. And, and when students, even when they want to go in a sorority and for a fraternity or something, and they were, just didn't have the money, we didn't want to see them get left, see, because that it was, they had a committee that had to approve their loan. You understand?
Story_ID: 531768
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Mr. Clemmons [HistoryMaker John B. Clemmons, Sr.], tell me what other organizations you're the, or on the board or, or the board of directors of--what other organizations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I have served--I got something today from Goodwill [Goodwill Industries International, Inc.]. I'm, I'm on that committee. And they, they have honored me and another man--he died last year--for our personal interest in kind of a, some--hey, they figured out the criteria.
Speaker 1: What other boards are you on?
Speaker 2: I'm, I have been on a hospital board. I am not now.
Speaker 1: Was, was that Memorial Medical Center [Memorial University Medical Center, Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Memorial, Memorial Medical Center. I have been on their association for the blind committee. I served strongly on the handicapped children's committee. Now, there's a lady named--she got that place where my wife [Mozelle Daily Clemmons] is now--she's sick--but named Ms. Kicklighter [Lilla Mae Kicklighter]. She had a handicapped son, and a little boy, and she got some more people who had handicapped children. And she formed the organization called the--what was it--the association for the handicapped children, I think. I can at least--we can leave it there, but I don't know the, I can't quite get it together with the real name of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, anyway, she, she started with about five children. We asked the government. I was on that. She asked the lady named Gertie Green [ph.] for a black person who would--willing to work with her. I was one of them. All right, and--
Speaker 1: What about--were you on the committee, the board for the Red Cross [American Red Cross] also?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was on that board--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, I was on, let's see, Red Cross, association for the blind, handicapped children (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I just saw--
Story_ID: 531769
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were also telling me about an honor that you and your wife [Mozelle Daily Clemmons] received together (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's called--
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: It's that, that organization is called the hall of fame for members of Chatham County and Savannah, Chatham County [Savannah Business Hall of Fame]. I think that's the way they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, naturally, I wasn't there when they selected me. But the--somebody on the committee told me that they had never had a black person named to it. And then, when they discussed it, discussion went into--why not make it a couple because his wife has supported him in all those things, and she's owned a lot of them herself? She was the first, first black owner in Chatham County [Georgia], symphony committee [Savannah Symphony Women's Guild]. She was on the concert board [Savannah Concert Association], and she was the first one--see, when we came here, they had committees, an English committee. And, and they didn't have anybody, so my wife was--I don't know how she got on there, but she was on that, and she was on the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], very--she's the right hand to Mr. W.W. Law.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Mr. W.W. Law, and a white man named Mr. Adler [Lee Adler], rich man, bought a house with their money, a little house, and, and--
Speaker 1: So they, they--well, okay, they--
Speaker 2: They bought--
Speaker 1: --they put you in the hall of fame, the two of you, because there had never been a black or a woman to the hall of fame.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know why that--I mean I, I don't know. The discussion came up in a meeting when they were selecting people. This year, they selected Mr. and Mrs. Levy [Aaron Levy and Dayle Levy]. They had never been a couple on it before, before we were named by--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right. But in their discussion, there was no question about whether, like me, because I'm, I've been, I've been a Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America]. I got the Silver Beaver [Silver Beaver Award] and this, all the committees I've been on, I can't even think--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but anyway, those are the main ones--Red Cross [American Red Cross]. And so, when the discussion came up, there was no problem, 'cause a lot of the people who was on that committee knew me. And they endorse it. Well, somebody brought up that my wife had been very much involved, and since we had never had anyone, we might as well put her on there some. Anyway, I don't know how, but they selected both of us, and when we got the award and the certificate, and everything so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's got both of our names on it so.
Speaker 1: Right, so you were, you and your wife were the first blacks.
Speaker 2: Yeah, first blacks--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then, and, and--
Speaker 1: In the hall of fame.
Speaker 2: --and no matter what they were doing. See, because, actually, the white people had just forgotten about us in the South until now we make them, make them think of us, you see. Like I said, I told you earlier that Reverend--can't call his name--but anyway, he was the first member of the hospital board, first member, black member. When he died, they, naturally, I, I wasn't on it then. They, they--I guess they kicked it around. We ought to put another black on there. Well, I was well known enough and involved enough. I've been involved in, in whatever was going on, trying to be, NAACP and all that. Well, after, after, after, after--
Speaker 1: After he died, they appointed you?
Speaker 2: Appointed me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Mr. Clemmons [HistoryMaker John B. Clemmons, Sr.], tell me--
Speaker 2: I don't know how they did. I, I know how Curtis Cooper [Curtis V. Cooper] got on there. I know how--the other man was Reverend--what is his name--he was a preacher. I know him from the First Congregational Church [Savannah, Georgia], but he was, he was involved in things already, see.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered? (Pause) What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Some people say the (unclear) on me last what--and they are, I, I helped students, paying the (unclear) financially. And I don't particularly want to be known for that, but I was, I was a part of it. I, I taught drama and speech at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia]. I was a director of drama 'cause I was in the university players and Atlanta [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]--all them colleges went together then. And we had the university players. And there was a good lady came here, who lived here. And we, they got her as director of drama at Savannah State College--Ethel, I mean, what her name, Ethel Jacobs [Ethel Jacobs Campbell]. Anyway, I was in the university players with Ethel. So, when she got involved, it was a heavy load for her. And she asked the English department, head of the English department, if I could help. I didn't get any pay. "He doesn't want money, but he'll, he'll help me." And the very next year, she left. And then, they asked me if I would take it 'til they got somebody. Well, I directed drama then maybe fifteen years or more. And speech and drama, and I had some good plays. I--see, like I gave a play up in Harlan, Kentucky. What they had been used to, you take a sheet, and draw it across the stage, and put some little furniture up there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I built the stage up for Harlan, Kentucky, and it's a little play. And I had telephone company set up a telecom that would ring. And I had the real things and we, we got the stage, I use the cardboard from boxes and things that, we went to the incinerator before they told them not to burn them up. We built it, put tape over there, painted them, had windows, doors, all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, that's, that's just a little bit. But the main thing was speech and drama.
