Speaker 1: Okay now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions I ask as a warm up--

Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: I saw those on--

Speaker 1: Okay and the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean I say a lot of things, but not anything that I say all the time other than (pause)--I don't know I was gonna say something about time, but no.
Story_ID: 640812
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Grover Howard] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Ruby Mae Howard [Ruby Phillips Howard], R-U-B-Y, and Mae is, M-A-E, Howard, H-O-W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Phillips.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of--to be very honest with you I don't know and that's the truth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I should have asked but I don't.
Speaker 1: So do you suspect she was born in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, she was definitely in Louisiana--
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you're not sure where (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) around--
Speaker 1: You're not sure where?
Speaker 2: It was north of Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In that area.
Speaker 1: All right and approximately how old, I mean when was she born, what would you think?
Speaker 2: Approximately what?
Speaker 1: About when was she born approximately?
Speaker 2: Oh approximately she is right now she's seventy-eight years old.  So she was actually eighteen when I was born and her birthday is in December and I don't do that because my wife [Bobby Jean Howard], wife said she tells me all the time I should know this stuff, but I don't.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's about 1930 I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were born in '52 that's 1930, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah something like that, actually never thought about.
Speaker 1: All right, now what do you know about your mother's family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Actually both my mother and father's family basically was sort of at the time when I guess when she was born, were pretty much tenement farmers and that's what they pretty much did in areas there were I know there were beans and there were, and cotton. And the bulk of the family I think moved to Baton Rouge and I don't quite know what my grandfather [Abraham Phillips, Sr.] did.  My grandfather actually just died about three weeks ago, he was ninety-eight years old.  Didn't know him very well, actually didn't know him at all actually and she was actually the first born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother talk about growing up or what it was like growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really I--actually you know, see that's the thing about my family. My mother and father separated when I was around about four years old, so really didn't get to, and you know, you don't, you know, talk about those kinds things in my family I guess.  We didn't do a lot of talking about that.
Speaker 1: Okay did you live with your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: I s- most of the times I lived with my father and stepmothers, that's another story but--
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and I stayed with my mother probably out of that time it probably be two, two and half years something like that when I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a teenager.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about what she wanted to be when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother was primarily, well she did have to for all times she was kind of a single mother and she basically worked in a cleaners.  But no it wasn't any aspiration about what she wanted to be. No, just worked.
Speaker 1: Did you think she was--she considered it a move up to be off the farm? Not be on the farm anymore?  Or did she (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I guess during that time most folks that's what they pretty much did.  They went to the city and my mother and father both actually went to New Orleans [Louisiana]. Separate, but New Orleans. And I don't know if they thought it was a move up or anything I think it's probably, probably a better way of getting employment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So did she have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: I think she finished--finished the ninth grade.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 640813
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Grover Howard.  I don't think there's a middle name.  I'm pretty sure there's not.  Grover is, G-R-O-V-E-R, and Howard, H-O-W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was twenty-one when I was born and that would take you back--
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-eight [1928], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know that because of my birth certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1928.  And, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in sort of the general area.  And I wanna say Lettiworth [sic. Lettsworth], L-E-T-T-, I think, I-W-O-R-T-H, Louisiana. And it's up in that sort of general area where my mother [Ruby Phillips Howard] is.  They're very close together.  I guess I should ask these questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've never--
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Again, there are my grandparents.  I know my grandmother [Louisiana Howard] was--she's half Cherokee.  I knew that because that's something we talk about and I don't know who those people were before then, or any of those relatives is.  My grandfather is just my grandfather.  I don't know much there either and his name was Charlie Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your grandparents never talked about growing up or what they did?
Speaker 2: It was actually--this is just because they basically stayed up in that rural area up north Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and we were in in--
Speaker 1: So were they farmers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) New Orleans [Louisiana]. Pretty much like I say most everybody that was around there were tenement farmers.  That's what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had rented whatever they rented and did, did whatever they did there.  They had their little farm.  I mean not a farm but they had you know their chickens and their pigs. A pig or two and cow.  My grandfather had geese.  We did spend summers there until about three or four years.  So, which was quite interesting. But it's a place to be because for us growing up in the City of New Orleans and then having that countryside to actually go out and run like crazy people was good for us, at least good for me.  I think having that sort of dual sort of environment I think actually that helped me to be a landscape architect.  And so by having that environment was quite, was quite wonderful.  The environment (unclear) it had levies of course I don't know much about Louisiana but the levies are always there you know high places.  We used those for play and of course you always fished because there's a lot of wet areas so you fish.  Because there's always wildlife like snakes and all kinds of other things, bees and things so it was plenty of things for, for kids, teenage kids or new teenage kids to do.  It was great actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they ever tell any stories fictional or otherwise about--
Speaker 2: No the stories they told of course you know, in general you might have heard one about--not, not about the family since you asked but stories, they would say something like someone would come on the road you know coming from church and say, "God is good and bare me---." Oh, "God is good in prayer meeting but it wasn't very great in bear meeting" because you might because there's bears, they had bears that you would encounter.  So that would be a story you know sort of a joke to somebody was saying, "God was good in prayer meeting but God wasn't very good in bear meeting," so that was one of those kinds of things.  No again I don't see that I don't have those kinds of memories because you really, again you didn't sit and have these kinds of--my family--those kinds of talks.  Now you ask my older brother [Grover Howard], he probably can give you every- that's who you should be talking to about that.  He would give you everything there is about the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the second, second one, so that's why it's--
Speaker 1: Okay I just--so they didn't have any much discussion about what the family was doing. Is--do you assume they had been farmers all the way back to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm assuming, yes you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So and do you think they were on the same land all the way back from--
Speaker 2: No, because I know they were basically--my--on several times we've gone back and they may be in a different house but the area, you know it wasn't very many houses around this little town.  Like I said that's work in a little place that's called Torry [ph.] and there was a little tiny little town, not really a town even, might have a little general store some place that you would have to drive to or walk to, it wasn't anything that was actually that, that, that great so it was one of those little rural communities you know.
Story_ID: 640814
Speaker 1: There any--oh I hardly ever ask this but I just, I just wondered like what were the cultural differences that you found between the cul- the country and the city?
Speaker 2: The culture, well one of the things about the country because my you know the larger family was there, of course we would go back but we--my father [Grover Howard] I think had ten siblings.  He was the second youngest.  Actually there were two younger ones were actually twins and he's the only one still alive and he's not doing well either but. But so I had a lot of cousins and uncles and they were, most people were around you know and a couple of really lar- other large families and because our family was kind of large, but, so you had that sort of connection at least immediately from your aunts and uncles and cousins.  That was the difference but the city was different because (pause) we were a little bit more protective I guess, you know, parents my father did, you know, we had some freedom to do things but not you know you didn't do a lot more things because I guess in some sense was I guess it was perceived to be a little bit more dangerous than sort of the wilds, it's interesting.
Speaker 1: More dangerous in the city? Than in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  And where we were in where we grew up, and initially was down in the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans [Louisiana] you know it was right where you know all the action from Katrina [Hurricane Katrina]--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --happened.
Story_ID: 640815
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about that in a second.  But let me go back to your parents [Ruby Phillips Howard and Grover Howard] for a second, and is there a story that they tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: No.  How they met or even how they--that's another one of those things that I don't know if it's for me not- just afraid no- how to ask that question.
Speaker 1: You have any assumptions about it?
Speaker 2: I think it's basically, I mean I think they grew up together.  I mean I think again it's like this little community for the most part anyhow because I know, when you do--we spend most of our time with my father's parents but her parents weren't that far away and you walking by whatever well that's where Grandma Sissy [Della Ree Phillips] or something is there or something like that but so I think again it's just a small community and grew up around each other.
Speaker 1: Did they attend the same schools, the same church?
Speaker 2: I don't--again I don't know that either.  What schools, I don't think--my dad finished fourth grade.  My mother finished ninth. And I assume they had to I mean it wasn't that many schools around.  I'm assuming they did.
Speaker 1: Okay when you went to church would representatives of both families be at the same church?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't even know if they went to church.  I know my mother's parents probably did but I'm not too sure my--they did go but not on regular--again it's one of those places where I think the pastors actually--maybe they came once every few weeks or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Circuit preachers.
Speaker 2: Circuit preachers, exactly.  It's a very rural community. They didn't have very much, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You remember the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't have a clue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not a clue, not a clue.
Story_ID: 640816
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their mannerisms, their interests, hobbies, talents, looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father [Grover Howard]. Not his looks.  My father for his--he's a very, I think because he's you know he's older, you know, the whole cement thing but he also was a--he carved things one of those whittlers, you wanna call it that. And he had, he made these little windmill toy kinds of things that when the wind blows it turns the propeller and this person might be sawing a saw or something like that.  That's some of my earliest memories that he could make these things and they're really kind of cool.  And I would stand up there and stare at him just the way you know he actually figured how they worked and things like that.  I think from that point I think I got that from my father.  My mother [Ruby Phillips Howard], not very much.
Speaker 1: So these are little, these are toys you say he would carve (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not toys.  I don't know if you ever seen them but they are like you if put them on a--they're like windmills but--they are windmills actually and basically they're done with propellers on them where they catch the wind and that propels some little figures that you--they carved in that, like for instance they had a--I do remember a guy, two guys with one you know one of those long saw blades and were sawing down logs and they would actually be sawing something back and forth and this is because the wind turns these things so these are--someone would be hammering something or someone be doing something else and I always wanted to go back and actually try to make one of them and I've been meaning to ask him to show me how to do it but he just had a stroke two weeks ago.
Speaker 1: Now this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's now gone.
Speaker 1: If you watch public television--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'Antiques Roadshow'--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --these things are big time--
Speaker 2: I know they are, I know they are (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) art now. Folk art.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Speaker 1: And they pay a of lot money for these--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --these wind driven--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with the wooden gears--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and all that, little figures.
Speaker 2: That's what he you know make, he made those.  So that creativity was there you know it was sort of you know you can see it, the harness. And I, and I thought, you know I was really drawn to those kinds of things.  I was always tinkering with something, just questioning.  My older brother [Grover Howard] would say, "You're always in trouble because you're always asking questions or taking something apart," and I think that's part of, part of that.  And he liked fixing things.  You know he did that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  I wish I could think of it.  There's a specific name for those.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know the name either you know. I don't know the name either (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I do I know it somewhere but I can't bring it up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that's something he did.
Speaker 1: But that's, that's interesting so if, if you have any of them?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have any.  Actually I wanna start making them.  That's something I may wanna do when I retire is start doing my work with, yeah--
Speaker 1: Did he sell them?
Speaker 2: I was thinking probably when he was younger he sold them.  Last time I remember seeing one was we had moved to New Orleans [Louisiana] and he had one in the yard outside the house.  That's the last time I seen them. Had one and that was around about when I was probably like six or seven years old.  That's, that's one of those things that's gonna stick in your mind.  You look up and see that thing and you know, kind of wonder. I wi- should have asked him to show me how to do that.
Story_ID: 640817
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: By my father [Grover Howard] and mother [Ruby Phillips Howard]?  I think it's two combined, six.
Speaker 1: Six okay?
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: And can you name them and where you fit in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well there's six but my mother has additional four and my dad has additional two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then of course I had, growing up we had basically kind of half, but they were stepsisters and brothers that actually live in the household.  So altogether actually there're eighteen you know somewhere or another you know not altogether eighteen you know but they were different households.  But as me growing up there was like eighteen of us.
Speaker 1: So that's counting your stepbrothers and sisters too?
Speaker 2: Yeah half brothers and sisters and stepbrothers and sisters, yeah. Eighteen of us.  'Cause they were like, you know become your--
Speaker 1: Who's the oldest?
Speaker 2: My brother--well out of the whole group of the eighteen?
Speaker 1: Well no the oldest (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother and father--there's Bruce [Grover Howard], he's the oldest. He's--
Speaker 1: That's your oldest brother?
Speaker 2: --two years older, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So were you and Bruce together everywhere? I mean, growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, that's the other thing. Bruce, Bruce was a rebel and he didn't keep very well so.  He didn't keep very with stepmothers so mother for the most part kept him most of the time because he would always get in trouble with some of the half or step, stepbrothers.  I had one older stepbrother and they always clashing; it didn't work. Because they were sort of you know sort of that dominant male thing and he's still that way, not really. He's actually much calmer, but.
Story_ID: 640818
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up after you- how old were you when your parents [Ruby Phillips Howard and Grover Howard] split up?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't ask.  I have I guess one of those relationships, my wife [Bobby Jean Howard] and I talk about it all the time, my relationship--she's gonna get me when she sees this too, I'm gonna be in trouble--but she's very extremely close to her family.  And mine isn't that you know I guess because there's so many mixtures and because, it's just you know it's just you don't have that longevity I guess as far as being with someone for eighteen years totally because you're constantly sort of moving stuff like that so you get sort of a different sort of upbringing.
Speaker 1: So I was asking how old you were when your parents split up.
Speaker 2: I was about four or five.
Speaker 1: Four or Five?  Okay.
Speaker 2: The reason I remember, remember that because we were at my father's mother, grandmother [Louisiana Howard], my father's side, and I remember briefly staying with them and then the next thing you know we were in New Orleans [Louisiana] and it was a small bit of time before I went to kindergarten and it was my first stepmother.  So it was interesting.
Story_ID: 640819
Speaker 1: Did you move a lot when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, we lived various places in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, well bearing that in mind and bearing all the situations you were in, we always ask this question, can you describe some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights yes, I mean if--again I can talk about the rural area a lot.  I mean that's pretty much across the board I mean it's just the nature in itself and being able to participate in that but New Orleans [Louisiana], the first place I remember was a duplex house.  That's where my father [Grover Howard] had his little wind instrument.  I do remember walking to--actually my--walking to school?  I do remember attending kindergarten of course for the first time and having actually had a, you know in the kindergarten room we actually had a slide that you could work on so something about kindergarten was actually sort of a magical in some sense.  The whole school, the whole school thing was always a, in some sense, it's different and just going back and forth in school and I do remember graduating.  I had graduation of course dressed up in white and really excited about you know getting because we didn't have very much money and of course and getting anything new is--but the idea they had to have a white shirt and pants and white shoes and socks. And I do remember going downtown with my stepmother to pick that stuff up and that was a really big treat and getting on the bus in New Orleans.  You didn't necessarily have cars for the most part.  Dad did have one but you travel on the bus all the time so the bus and the public transportation was very important to the city and everybody used it for the most part.  So those kinds of images, walking to and from school, that place and then the second place we actually moved again and we ended up in another school.  This place was actually Lawless [Alfred Lawless Elementary School], it's actually the high school, the junior high school in the Lower Ninth Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana] that's where I actually went to elementary school and the first place we were in it was a larger house and we actually lived on the ground floor and I think someone else lived on the second floor so we rented this place too but I do remember there and had a lot of these pipes and things that you actually get on and you of course you're a little kid, you're swinging back and forth and those kinds of things, you know, stuff kids get into. And the yard was pretty big but it was a lot of things you could actually get into.  As a kid it was always adventures you know.  It was, that afforded some really cool adventures and we didn't get too far out from the sidewalk and things like that and then we moved again a little bit later to a house another block which actually had grapevines on the fence and that was good because you can go pick and eat but the neighbors back then for the most part had farm animals, chickens for the most part and maybe even a pig or two.  Just again, it's the Lower Ninth Ward back in the '60s [1960s]. Fifties [1950s], late '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s]. And my stepbrother, oldest stepbrother he would--he became sort of the raising chickens and things like that and so we actually had chickens in in the city and it was, it was a garage. A separate piece that was enclosed that had--the person who actually lived there, I guess had probably died or something had tons of tools had left there in the garage and all kinds of drawers and things and that to me was really quite fascinating you know just going in there and to this day, I love hardware stores. And New Orleans had some of these old hardware stores you can go into and things were all over the place and it's like this wonderland. And so my favorite place these days, you asked me for a place, you asked destination, I love spending time in Lowe's and Home Depot.  'Cause you can just go down the aisles and you know. And I get to spend my money (laughter) on things and tell my wife [Bobby Jean Howard], "Well I gotta go to Lowe's." And you get things, your tools and stuff like that because you're fixing the house, so she never complains about that, my wife does, she never does, which is kind of cool.  I like that.  So, so I guess the, to me the city was still just like the countryside was still this place for exploration but it's different you know that's growing up as a kid so it wasn't wanting for things to do outside for instance and outside was a wonderful thing.  I mean it's a shame that these days we--kinds are stuck behind the TV and video games because there's so much out there that you can--creatively that you could actually do with your time, so.  It's unfortunate.  But I, personally I think I had a wonderful--in that part--childhood.
Story_ID: 640820
Speaker 1: So you lived in the Lower Ninth Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana]. Was there a name for your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No. Not--no. Still isn't actually. It's the Lower Ninth Ward which is what it is right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the place that I--the place and we lived there until--Betsy, I don't know if you remember Hurricane Betsy, actually happened to a year I think Betsy was in '65 [1965], Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] was what 2005?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So what was that forty years?
Speaker 1: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Forty years. So it was actually four years difference than it was a major hurricane.  We left there then because mainly flooding just like it was. Wasn't as bad but the Lower Ninth Wards were totally flooded. We got out the day--the night the hurricane came in the middle of the night actually. And the water I don't know how small I was, I think I was in seventh grade. Yeah I had just started that day--no eighth grade, just started eighth grade because I just completed seventh grade. Brand new school [Alfred Lawless Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], one year old, first day of eighth grade and the hurricane came and basically in the middle of the night we got up, I remember water was up to my chest so I figured I was a small kid so water was that high and luckily the road was higher than the house was because where the car was, so we all got in the car which was basically one, two three of us, four of us, plus one, two, three, stepsisters, half-sisters, stepsisters and my father [Grover Howard] and my second stepmother got in the car and drove out to my stepmother's mother's place; and so we stayed for a good bit of time because we couldn't go back because things had flooded.
Story_ID: 640821
Speaker 1: Okay we were talking about Hurricane Betsy--
Speaker 2: Betsy.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965]. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Family had to leave the--
Speaker 2: Yeah we had to leave primarily because it was you know it was underwater.  You know just like--it's the same thing the, the levee broke right there on--what's the canal called? God see my brain gone that's why--I know I was gonna have one of these moments, senior moments. But the canal right there that's, that's--the Industrial Canal [Inner Harbor Navigation Canal] that connects the Mississippi River with Lake Pontchartrain that's where boats go back and forth. It broke, the levee broke just like did before but that wasn't the only levee broke with Katrina, several others had broken.
Speaker 1: Yea we're here in 2012 and we're reflecting on what happened with Hurricane Katrina like seven years ago.  We had a whole Ninth Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana] went under and--
Speaker 2: Yea, well more than Ninth Ward this time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Ninth Ward plus New Orleans East [Eastern New Orleans] plus some of the other portions of New Orleans [Louisiana] that was before it survived didn't get that, that's why I think it was so bad because this was you know was almost like the whole City of New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Yeah Katrina was the worst hurricane New Orleans ever had (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was worse because of the damage.  And actually I had went to bed that night and looking at the news because whenever there's a hurricane coming to New Orleans I'm like glued because you know growing up 1965 you--it never leaves your mind you know it's always, even when I'm in there, New Orleans like in the summertime sometime and they say the hurricane's coming, I just tell my wife [Bobby Jean Howard], "Let's go.  I'm leaving because I don't wanna be around, you never know."  But any anyway I went to bed and it was fine.  I said oh god we survived this thing.  I got up the next morning and, and just devastation (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did you ever go--could you salvage anything out of that house that you could remember?
Speaker 2: You mean which one you talking about?
Speaker 1: Could you all when Betsy in '65 [1965] when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Oh no, 'cause, no.
Speaker 1: So the family lost everything?
Speaker 2: Pretty much yeah, pretty much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You got the car out of there right?
Speaker 2: Car, yeah but other than that we were pretty, yeah.  I think my stepmother did get some insurance money for basic things but it was a while before--and this was when we actually moved actually we had to go stay with mother [Ruby Phillips Howard] because they actually lived uptown, my mother and her--my stepfather stayed with three of us, four of us actually and stayed with my mother's and by that time my mother basically had three additional kids plus my two sisters and then we came the four of us, it was the five of us, five of us. So a whole bunch of folks and that--so you know you have these multiple families and now it's complicated (unclear) phase. So you got these multiple families, you know don't know, with that piece and we stayed there until I was in the tenth grade [at Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]. From eighth grade to tenth grade so half way to tenth grade.  Anyway I went back with my father [Grover Howard] after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We all did.
Story_ID: 640822
Speaker 1: Did you at the time of the hurricane [Hurricane Betsy], living in New Orleans [Louisiana] and knowing that that kind of danger could happen, I mean that kind of catastrophe could hit at any time, did you think about--I guess I'm trying to ask you did you have your first thoughts about landscape and whether, whether or not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well no, that's, architecture was, it kind of happened sort of a different way.  That wasn't like, I'm gonna be a landscape architect you know, no.
Speaker 1: No I didn't think that--
Speaker 2: But the idea that we actually did when you're in school and you're studying, yeah we should talk about these systems, I mean the whole idea of these ecological system and how it worked. And then again its more fascination you know I mean even going back from my father [Grover Howard] I said my father worked on a--that Morganza Spillway the whole idea that you know we had built ourselves in a box where we need to build up these huge levees on the side of the river and of course you know the river's natural process is for river to overflow their banks except nowadays you hear said in history it fertilizes the soil whatever and grow things and other things but we cause you know modern day we wanna keep the river within control so you build these levees up and by doing that you're denying the river its natural process. And so in order to relieve things, and things are really hard, you have to get these spillways that goes into another basin which is Atchafalaya. And actually in 1973 a lot of people don't know but the Mississippi River levees almost broke.  It was almost like a major, and they had to really shore it up and if that had happened, we would not be talking about New Orleans and the Mississippi River because the river--you can't stop it.  It would have carved a new primary channel going down the Atchafalaya Basin, which is Atchafalaya River.  A lot of folks you know--and we as mankind actually stopped that process.  So this whole process, things become, you know very I guess prevalent in your mind, you think in your mind, that's you know, you're always thinking about how they work and how we actually as mankind actually influenced these natural you know these natural processes and, and for the most part we done this to ourselves you know.  Rather than working more with nature, which you can, we basically going you know because of commerce, because of dollars and monies and whatever else you wanna call it, we created this other sort of a system that really is counterintuitive and counter to the natural processes but that's what we got.  So yeah living and studying landscape architecture that's always there and that's why I wouldn't live in New Orleans again.  I wouldn't.  I mean not only that, right now it's depressing.
Story_ID: 640823
Speaker 1: You know it's something you grew up in, and you know what it was like, not only that, New Orleans [Louisiana]--now you got me talking about New Orleans--but New Orleans, the whole processes, I mean the whole--the city was in trouble before Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  The youth were basically--I don't know if you heard you know during the Mardi Gras if you're sixteen years or younger, you had a curfew.  They had this problem before Katrina.  This is all that stuff they brought it to life.  You probably heard these things in the press and things like that.  These things--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and what happened for the most part when New Orleans actually--New Orleans was one of the unique cities (unclear) with very little land and first part was there in the first place because it's the highest piece there in that little oxbow it's the highest piece and (unclear) why the first part was built there you know because it didn't flood.  Even during Katrina it didn't flood, it's the highest piece. And then you starting, taking from the swamp land, filling 'em up, building levees, building huge pumps because the (unclear) to pump water out over the levee again going against the natural process again and then, but even within an oxbow that we were in, the little curvature there the crescent, we were--we're still okay but when we started building things out New Orleans west and New Orleans, especially New Orleans East [Eastern New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana] was again still you talking about swamp land you're basically building, even then that's when things really, really got to the point where it's not good and before then it was basically we were a cool city you know.  And culturally too, you, you may have segregation but you lived right next to Caucasians, you know. Black people lived next to Caucasians, went to separate schools although you might live right next to and it's because it wasn't very much land and very much places to go and so when the city got bigger and start moving outward, that was not a good thing because basically all you're doing is building the swamplands.  But anyway back to the culture, so when--what I was trying to get there is that so the affluent parts of those people that actually had the money moved out and left this crescent for the most part basically poor people in housing projects and just poor people in general don't have cars, can't get out of New Orleans, stayed in the super bowl [sic. Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana] all those things are because you had the flight, not only just white flight but you had even black flight out of the city.  So you got now you got this thing that's--so and so you got these youth these kids now you know that are sort of welfare kids, having welfare kids and welfare kids I mean several generations like this, it's not good you know it's not and so they basically are raising themselves, not really raising themselves but I hate to say that but that's what I see from a cultural standpoint.
Story_ID: 640824
Speaker 1: Well when you were growing up, now, you said there were a lot of activities and things to do--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --outside you know in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well again like I said my father [Grover Howard], he had control.  He, you know, we didn't go too far away from you know when we had our little place we did things, but we didn't go like some of these kids are like hanging out on Canal Street cruising and whatever they do now and we didn't have that kind of leeway at all.
Speaker 1: Okay so your father was a cement finisher right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so was that pretty stable work? Pretty steady?
Speaker 2: He was I think any construction for the most part, he always had work, he always worked.  He actually worked until a year ago believe, yeah. I think it was like seventy-nine.  He called himself retired and I think that's probably what did him in.  He always worked. So yeah he actually worked for a company called Boh Brothers [Boh Bros. Construction Co. LLC, New Orleans, Louisiana] which is basically sort of a--they were like--what did they do?  They did sewer? What did they do?  They did a lot of the streets and you know sewers and you know water lines and things like that so basically sort of infrastructure kinds of things and then at some point in time I don't quite know when, I think it was probably after, after Betsy [Hurricane Betsy] he started his own little basically, he basically he did his own business.  I mean basically people hired him to do, and he start doing foundation, housing foundations and sidewalks and driveways and so anything that had to do with flat work he'd call it, concrete, even where the foundation somebody would come in and put the piles in because you have dry piles in New Orleans [Louisiana], fifty foot logs drive in the ground and then you cap it off with a concrete foundation and that way the thing won't settle as much, still settle.
Speaker 1: The water, I mean the ground is wet--
Speaker 2: Well, it's just organic matter.  It's not like here [Greensboro, North Carolina] for instance we had bedrock, stone, there basically you got all this basically organic soil from the river [Mississippi River] over time, you know flat material and a little dirt and this organic soil deteriorates especially when you suck water from it.  It all dries and then it settles down.  So basically any structure, and it for a long time we didn't have skyscrapers in New Orleans for that reason because you just couldn't get a foundation.  Now they've devised ways of actually doing the foundations--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to keep 'em (gesture)--but things settled.
Story_ID: 640825
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about school now.  What was the name of the first school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay it was a McDonogh, we had a lot of McDonoghs.  I forgot the number.
Speaker 1: Oh there were numbered schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were numbers of the McDonoghs.  McDonoghs [sic. John McDonogh] was obviously a guy and it's weird it had like McDonoghs this, McDonogh that. And that was the first one and the second one was actually a Alfred Lawless Elementary [Alfred Lawless Elementary School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Alfred Lawless.
Speaker 2: Yeah and that's one that's in so we I guess when we first moved we weren't in the Lower Ninth Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana], we're actually in Marigny [New Orleans, Louisiana] which is right across the Industrial Canal [Inner Harbor Navigation Canal].  And then from that I spent a year in Lawless Junior High [Alfred Lawless Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]. A year and a day and that was a brand new school when I started in seventh grade, it was a brand new school, a beautiful school and then of course, Betsy [Hurricane Betsy] destroyed it.  And then I went to another McDonoghs something for half of eighth grade and then my mother [Ruby Phillips Howard] was--went to Derham Junior High [James Derham Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], D-U-R-H-A-M [sic.], Junior High School and finished half of eighth and ninth grade there. And then senior year, senior high school I, I went to Booker T. Washington High School in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay let me go back to now were there any special teachers or mentors in grade school?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't know their name.  There was one lady in third grade she was really took a special liking to me.  She was really was that's probably my best year in school period was my third grade teacher.  She kind of looked after me for some reason.  I don't know why.  She always you know you can tell you you were the favorite.  Fourth grade I hated it.  It was the worst teacher ever.  So you get this and that's when you kind of grow up say okay the whole world isn't nice any more.  But I don't even remember her name.  But if you're talking and you're talking about during high school I did my drafting teacher, I had, I had three years of drafting that's what kind of get me this whole design thing, three years of drafting in high school.
Speaker 1: Well did you like school for the most part when you started?
Speaker 2: If I didn't like it, it was--I didn't like it because I was poor and everybody knew I was poor.
Speaker 1: Well the other students had more I mean were--
Speaker 2: Well when you're--(laughter) that's a good question because basically you're in the Lower Ninth Ward because you're poor, I--we were the poorest of the poor, how's that? But you had, but you still, you know, you still have the firmness with my father [Grover Howard] that, you know you didn't get out of control and do crazy things so yeah we were, we were poorest of the--that's what I called us. We were the poorest of the poor.  I mean there was times I didn't have--I mean I could remember me getting my stepbrother's gym shorts in seventh grade.  And of course back then you know we I think they had to be gray and these were like hand me downs hand me downs and so they dyed them a gray color these white shorts gray but over about the third of fourth, fifth washing they turned pink and there was nothing else you can do about it, they were pink and so it got a point they were so pink that I wasn't allowed to dress because they were pink, they weren't gray you know what I mean.  So and everybody knew. And that's one thing I must say about it thought you know when everybody else know you're poor but no one really teased me about that.  It wasn't, it wasn't like you know someone was really teasing me about it.  So other than that you just feel bad about it so.  It's interesting though.
Story_ID: 640826
Speaker 1: Now what were you interested in as a, as a kid, as a young kid?
Speaker 2: Young kid?
Speaker 1: I mean, did you read a lot, watch TV, did you hang out in the streets, what did you--?
Speaker 2: Well we didn't hang out in no streets.  That didn't--we never did that.  We--because we had--TV was not a you know we had to--I can remember going down the street around the corner to watch a program that came on 'cause we didn't have a TV.  That was back in the day when everybody come stand in front of the whatever, so, that was a long time before we actually got a TV.  We just, like I say, played, and outside. And we made up our own toys.  I tell my you know I was telling a lady I work with, Darlene [ph.], that she liked to hear my stories, that we made our toys.  One of the things we used to do for toys for instance we took old tires and I don't if you ever seen anybody they roll them down the street.  You seen those before or again you make your own you get old skates and make your skateboards with the handles up there like the scooters and you build these things and you put these things together and you go and ride down the street you know we looked like little wild Indians [Native American] but. We made our own toys we made you know, you know that's what we did.  But as far as reading, I read.  But I wasn't--well my wife [Bobby Jean Howard] would say--she's a librarian, so she always liked reading and there are certain things I liked autobiographies of folks did that.  Started art, art in school pretty young.  Always, whenever I had to take an art class I did, so I think the really first art piece I had was actually--
Speaker 1: Were you a talented artist as a kid?
Speaker 2: I was average.  I wasn't--I wouldn't think I was, I mean not really I mean, I can't--some of the things back there in the gallery [at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], I was looking at some of the charcoal drawings I could do that if I tried hard but you know it wasn't you know it wasn't that kind of, my thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  But you liked, you liked--
Speaker 2: Yeah I did, I did like things.  I did like them.
Story_ID: 640827
Speaker 1: So your first drafting course was kind of like--
Speaker 2: In tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Tenth grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah I had a--one of my--my best friend, Abraham McFarland [ph.] I met him when I was in--of course at Derham ele- Derham Junior High School [James Derham Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and I don't know why we met, but it's good to have somebody that have same taste, same kind of interests you were, and we always found ourselves doing the same kinds of things in school and we were in some of the same classes and somehow it was just one of those persons that you gravitate to. And, and the tenth grade because I had done ninth grade, I didn't do the draft- he came to me I had taken, had all registered for my courses it was like maybe the first week or something of school. And I had, I had already taken chemistry.  I think it was in physics and I think it was in art and basic classes and said, "No you need to come over here and you know they need some more people in his class."  I say, "What are you talking about?"  He said, "Well now this drafting," I said, "What is that?"  And I actually, Derham actually, Derham Junior High actually had a drafting room and I used to always go by slowly you know and look at the tall stools and the desks and I was just fascinated and I didn't know what they did and of course you didn't ask you know. So I didn't know what they were, so when I went and came into the room and saw this I was really happy.  And, and the teacher, you're talking about a teacher that really--it was Mr. Wheeler [ph.]. Mr. Wheeler was a pretty good draftsperson but Mr. Wheeler would sign- he would have the lists of the exercises that you were supposed to do for the year and have them on the wall. But it was always like double what you can possibly, potentially can do within a year so you always constantly struggling trying to get finished and it wasn't until my senior year that I actually completed the things that he had posted because--well maybe not completing, but taking that year and really until I gotten so good at it I was able to run through it and, and get 'em all done.  So that for me was really, really for me it was a personal accomplishment to actually get all of those exercises done.  But I probably, I got a love for that because it taught me to see how to build things you know that whole idea of plan view sections and elevations and to see that it's a, it's a tough thing to teach but you know I had three years of that at Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and to be very honest with you I think you know that really helped me to get through LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], which is a whole 'nother story.
Story_ID: 640828
Speaker 1: So that was one thing and, but I--and then having you know, in math. I was in the advanced math class there which is again I was sent to sort of state, to take the state exam whatever.
Speaker 2: Were you always good in math in, in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I always loved it.  I mean it wasn't anything that you know--I don't think I'm really, really good at it.  I think my youngest son [Justin Howard] is a lot better than I am.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, well you were taking advanced math in high school, you must have been pretty good to--
Speaker 1: Yeah I was okay.  But I wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean advanced. You were better than most people.
Speaker 1: --but I didn't go get a Ph.D., (laughter) (unclear). Yeah I was better than most people.  Yeah I was better enough because he only sent two people to that state to take the state exam--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I was one of them so yeah I guess you--but I never looked at myself that way.  I just sort of this is you know I saw it and I did it. And the English thing was probably the worst thing.  I was never very good writer and even taking four years of English in school and our biggest project, I mean our final project in four year--fourth year English was basically to do a five hundred word theme.  Your final, you had the semester to do it over time. I got to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], they asked for a thousand word theme in one hour.  Can you imagine the shock that one would (laughter) get and say, "Okay this is not Kansas anymore," so, so took me--that was probably one of my hardest things but yeah over time, if you really want to, you apply yourself and get it done.
Speaker 2: Okay now--
Speaker 1: Teach yourself.
Speaker 2: Now were you an honor student in high school at Booker T. [Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: I (makes sound)--you know I don't really--no, no I mean getting honors no I didn't get any honors.
Speaker 2: So you weren't on the honor roll or anything?
Speaker 1: You know I don't know about honor rolls back then.  I know I got reasonably good grades.  I was probably was a B average kind of person and A's in some things, maybe Cs.  I never failed anything.  I never got really Ds in anything.  I can remember in chemistry class I was--my stepfather was really mad at me because I had brought home a D out of about a third, about three students.  I was the only one that a D, everybody else got F and I tried to explain that to him, he didn't care (laughter).
Speaker 2: You got a D and the rest of them got Fs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Got Fs, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so that made you the best one in the class.
Speaker 1: Class but it's still a D and he didn't, he didn't care.  It was a D and that was about the only--one of the things I remember more than anything else it's like, "But I got a--." You know he didn't wanna hear it, you know it's a D.  So step it up a notch.  That was interesting.  That was one of the interesting class, chemistry.
Story_ID: 640829
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Ruby Phillips Howard and Grover Howard] have any aspirations for you?  What were their aspiration- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They never, they never--you know, see that's again it's not, again I guess growing up where they grew up and I think you know finishing high school I guess was a big thing.  It was you know it was a big thing.  Going to college it was like okay and the whole, the whole Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] thing they didn't even--that doesn't compute.  You know it's not like what'll you do what for?  So.
Speaker 1: So you were--I take it you were a good drafting student?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I was good, I was very good yeah.  Oh no I am good I mean it's not you know that's what people say.
Speaker 1: So did your drafting teacher [at Booker T. Washington High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] encourage you to go to college or who?
Speaker 2: No, actually I--the person encouraged me to go to college was my dad, as a means of being a finisher, being he had some young teenage boys and having his own you know cement finishing business was put us in the back of his car and you know leave at six o'clock in the morning in the summertime and take us to work with him. And we would go and shovel dirt out of make these forms and pour concrete, these heavy barrels of concrete and push some more dirt and after about three summers of that I decided that I couldn't do that for the rest of my life. Because I only weighed like 125 pounds back then I just said I can't.  And it was like my brothers, my brothers you know, brick- one guy's a carpenter, a brick mason and welder and these do all these trades but (background noise) I just wasn't--
Speaker 1: That's me.
Speaker 2: --I wasn't built for that.
Speaker 1: That's me.
Speaker 2: So that in itself made me wanted to go to school and then while you're in drafting you learn about being an architect and things like that and so that's what I really wanted to go to school for, architecture. And I--this is why I went to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] actually to--for the architectural program. And when I got there I decided I didn't wanna do that because I didn't wanna flunk out of school.  They had I think like four years of physics, four years of calculus, not four years, four semesters of physics and calculus, and I decided I said you know, I'm gonna be smart about this, I don't, you know this is--I'm not here for science education. So and landscape architecture was on the other sheet and I chose that because they you know I had the opportunity there to take a lot of art classes and things like that so. And you know so I wanted to do that.
Story_ID: 640830
Speaker 1: So you're in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], you didn't wanna stay around for another summer of shoveling--
Speaker 2: Well actually, actually the last summer actually had my sort of first sort of other job with my father [Grover Howard] and stuff--it's actually not my first, it's the second one.  I worked for the City of New Orleans police department [New Orleans Police Department] actually and just for you know summer you know just for--and when I told 'em at the end of the summer that I had to go to college, they wanted to know why I would wanna give up this good city job to go to college.
Speaker 1: So you didn't tell 'em 'til the end of the summer you were going to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because it's a job you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  Now how did you get--how did you make the hook up with LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]? Now--
Speaker 2: Oh actually it was two architecture programs in State of New Or- Louisiana and one was at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], one was at LSU and I just decided that didn't want to go to Southern because everybody was going to Southern. I wanted to try LSU and so I thought you know I asked about things. And then this is how it happened we had a career day or whatever and, university day or whatever, and then there was a person from LSU who actually came to the high school and you know, I filled out an application and those kinds of things, we talked and sent it in and that was it.  And at that time you know if you had graduated from a school in Louisiana, they, you know they had to accept you.  So it wasn't like it was any you know any state school you had to accept you. Of course it's not like that anymore, but. So I thought it was a good opportunity, so it at least give you a chance you know.
Story_ID: 640831
Speaker 1: Now this is the third year that LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] is integrated, right?
Speaker 2: I think it's, I think it's '68 [1968] was the first year--
Speaker 1: Right so 1970 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) yeah, and this was like the first big class. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Fall of 1970--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you started LSU.  Now what was it like on campus?
Speaker 2: It was, it was fine.  I mean it--'cause before, before that, of course I went to predominantly black schools and this was the first time was like okay this the opposite.  I think fortunately that the landscape architecture program has--people really didn't care about where you were from and that was for me when I heard other places, other schools, other places for the landscape architecture, you know people had some very bad experiences.  I think the professors at LSU was just, they were wonderful people.  They still are actually.
Speaker 1: What about the students on the campus, did they resent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't a big, no it wasn't, it was none of that.  I didn't get any of that you know.  I--
Speaker 1: Did you hear stories about it from 1968?
Speaker 2: No.  It was not, no, we--because we had our group because they put us where we had like five in our dorm room. You had this huge--'cause I stayed in the stadium, it was the cheapest thing like eighty-one dollars I think it was for a semester for--yeah I know, just for the, the room, board was, maybe a couple hundred dollars maybe but the room was like eighty-one it was underneath the stadium, LSU stadium [Tiger Stadium, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], football stadium.  So this was the cheapest room they had you know because you could get things like four hundred dollars, that's some of these little suites and things like that, but of course being poor and wanting to stay in school and the monies I got I had a loan, I had work study and I had grant and I was, you know I wasn't really you know didn't care about all the luxuries whatever, I just basically wanted to get an education so.  It was five in a room, this particular, and of course you were in the bathroom and the bathroom is as big as this where urinals were--it was fascinating like you know this whole--that whole thing was fascinating.  I think people still live underneath that thing.
Speaker 1: So they had all the black students basically in the same--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --dorm?
Speaker 2: They, they put--no not dorm, well rooms actually you know separate because there are the other dorms. And you applied to it was you know you get whatever dorm you want.  But at least they grouped us together so at least we didn't have like white roommates or anything like that, so.  Which for me it was fine.  I didn't you know I didn't really care one way or another (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 640832
Speaker 1: Now for those who don't know LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Baton- and Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] are not that far away from each other.
Speaker 2: No they're in the same city.  Yeah you can catch a bus go to one on the other side of town to get there. And then actually my good friend as I said my best friend at the time, Abraham [Abraham McFarland (ph.)], actually went to Southern for architecture.  And I was going to LSU for architecture but I decided to change it from architecture to landscape architecture and I don't think Abraham ever finished school but Abraham was actually better draftsperson than I was actually.  He had a flair--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just had other interests besides that.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay so, well who were your teachers at LSU?
Speaker 2: Well Dr. Reich was the department chair, Dr. Robert Reich, who actually died two years ago.  He actually was a Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] graduate.  I think he got his degree in I think a degree in landscape architecture at Cornell and then got a Ph.D.--no he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] too.  I don't know what--he got his Ph.D. in horticulture. And he started a program there at LSU and he started a horticulture curriculum and then he ventured out and started the program at LSU.  LSU is rated almost like number one, depends on who you talk to, in the country as far as you know education and landscape architecture.  But Dr. Reich was one.  I had Max Conrad who is actually still teaching.  We had Dan Earle was really good--another good teacher of mine.  I'm trying to think of some of these--oh, what's those two guys' name?  I just, it just (unclear) (laughter). It was a long time ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, why did you choose landscape architect?
Speaker 2: Well as I was saying again the curriculum, the curriculum was, I was looking at the curriculum when I first, when I got on campus you could open the book up and landscape architecture was here, architecture was here and I say I'll just look at the courses I guess for the first time, they had a series of calculus and physics courses I think, four each I think.  I didn't wanna flunk out of school and I'm still the only one in my--well actually there's two of us out of the eighteen, that actually went to college and finished.  So that was one of my goals at least get through school and not to take a bunch of courses that I may and may not pass and didn't want that. Well in looking at the curriculum, I could have made it in that quite easy.  Actually I think architecture was--the professors where quite mad at me because I had changed my major. Because I--we took courses together and in the beginning of the year and of course I was better than most of the students in--all of them actually, in the classroom so.  But I got into landscape architecture because it gave--it's more freedom to do other things.  And like I said the art classes and just any other kinds of things I wanted to take, so it's more freedom to take a lot more elective classes. So that's why I was kind of happy to do that.
Story_ID: 640833
Speaker 1: I'm tempted to ask this, though, was the school like a laboratory for landscape architecture in terms of the way it was laid out and designed?
Speaker 2: Well you--at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well Dr. Reich [Robert Reich] took it under himself to--he, one of his favorite trees was the crepe myrtle.  I don't know if you what that tree is, it's sort of--it had lace like flowers.  There's a bunch of them around here.
Speaker 1: Myrtle, the land--the ground--
Speaker 2: No this is a tree.
Speaker 1: A tree okay.
Speaker 2: It's a tree, a small tree, but they're all over the place around here, it's sort of a really nice bark kind of and flowers could be pink or red or white.  I know you've seen them and they basically flower in the summertime.  He loved the tree so he planted it all over the campus so you could go in the summertime or whenever that campus is full of these things. And it basically used his will to basically you know from a landscape point of view transformed the campus.  I wish I could do that here [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] but I haven't been able to do that.  But anyway, yeah see so it wasn't as far as the laboratory, it wasn't necessary, it was a campus, it was pretty good campus, it was okay it's not--it's okay.  What he did do though since we were Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and basically sort of away from I call it civilization (laughter) I guess in Louisiana, (unclear). We had, we had an East Coast trip we were required to go onto, to go, to take and a West Coast trip and the first one was the West Coast trip so in '73 [1973] I think I was telling you earlier, we got on a Greyhound bus, of course you had to pay for this, it was more than my tuition.  Tuition was a hundred sixty dollars this was like three or four hundred dollars for this trip, for two weeks. And we'll go on the bus and all thirty of us or however many it was, it was probably more than thirty at the time, like forty and we would just stop along the way all the way over to California.  We actually went to Mexico twice, Juarez [Ciudad Juarez], and then we went to what's the other place by San Diego [California]. And we all went to California of course, Las Vegas [Nevada], stopped in Las Vegas and I think stopped in Death Valley and stopped and drove up the Pacific Coast Highway it's really beautiful water and--. So for a student for the first time leaving the State of Louisiana which was the first time--no it's the second time, but leaving and seeing all of these things is was just you know and that probably more than anything else for me did it because you know you got to meet the--we met with people that were top of the profession at the time. I think people like Tommy Church [Thomas Church], who was an outstanding (unclear) landscape designer; Pete Walker [Peter Walker] who is actually just you know just designed the World Trade Center memorial [National September 11 Memorial and Museum, New York, New York], the thing that's--and then Lawrence Halprin who died actually the FDR Memorial [Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. So all those people you met and you know they talk to you because the professors you know are pretty you know connected. In San Francisco [California] and up and down California and then you know getting back on the bus and going to Yosemite [Yosemite National Park, California] and there's waterfalls and during the wintertime, Grand Canyon and then the other projects along the way, we were always--had the stops listed out and that was wonderful. And then the following year we went up to the East Coast and you know went to Canada and, and Detroit [Michigan], Boston [Massachusetts] and all that stuff, so. That, and from a, from a landscape architecture standpoint that really opens your eyes at what the possibilities are.
Story_ID: 640834
Speaker 1: What were your favorite places, I mean, along the way?
Speaker 2: My favorite places, San Francisco [California] was always--when I went on that trip?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  On both trips I guess.
Speaker 2: Both trips.  I mean I liked the cities.  I like--I really did like San Francisco.  I actually liked the Pacific Coast Highway.  I think it was actually stunning and some of the other smaller towns there in California.  I think to very honest with you, I liked it all.
Speaker 1: I was talking specifically the landscape architecture in terms of what--
Speaker 2: Well that's--
Speaker 1: --something that you saw that was--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --you know most impressive?
Speaker 2: --it was all of it.  Each had its different sort of--even the urban areas, even like for instance the Grand Canyon.  I mean, hey, compare that to let's say there was a project done by Lawrence Halprin and it was called Embarcadero plaza [Justin Herman Plaza, San Francisco, California] at the time he did it, it was quite brilliant piece of work.  You know he said you know--and there were just two different kinds of things and you appreciate them for what they were and that's why I like landscape architecture because there's so much--the variety is all there.  You ask me of cities, one of my favorite cities are I mean they're cities on the water of course, Boston [Massachusetts], New York [New York] and Key West [Florida] and New--I actually do like New Orleans [Louisiana] even without all the other stuff.  I do like the river walk San Antonio [San Antonio River Walk, San Antonio, Texas] because of that and then San Francisco and then the other places.  We didn't go up there at the time but Vancouver [Canada].  I think Vancouver is just a wonderful place to, to live.  I mean they just got everything, a great city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I was thinking in terms of like what aspect of landscape architecture that you saw--
Speaker 2: That's my problem, that's--
Speaker 1: --that you can attach to an architect and say well this architect took this project and he did this and this is something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See that's my problem is I like it all.  And that's one of the things which with landscape architecture I guess me as what I do is that I don't have a like a favorite or some kind of thing.  It's just that because everything is different and if it's done well, it's good for that particular thing and, and I guess that's where I run into problems because I'm not--I am truly in some sense a journalist.  I don't have specific things that I really like to do because, you know, I get in trouble because I wanna try to do everything and you know, you can't and--
Speaker 1: Okay. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that, it's a fault.
Story_ID: 640835
Speaker 1: In '73 [1973] it says here that you won the Edward D. Stone Jr. and Associates scholarship for minority students [Edward D. Stone Jr. and Associates Minority Scholarship] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I had just gotten married [to Bobby Jean Howard] and didn't have any money of course, and somehow we were talking about early--earlier about black landscape architects.  American Society of Landscape Architects had published something about black landscape architects basically looking for something that came out of urban areas of course '70s [1970s] you know civil rights and all the other good stuff after the '60s [1960s] so people start looking then and even within the profession where are black landscape architects because there were like eight. And they actually met here on campus for several meetings and Dr. Fountain [Charles Allen Fountain] who started a program here [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], was sort of the ringleader I would call it. I wouldn't call it ringleader, isn't that a bad name? But he was, he would, he would orchestrate a lot of these kinds of things. And, and so American Society of Landscape Architects had a--it did have a oh what is the word you wanna call it?  Committee, put the committee together actually study wanted to see what the problem was. And Ed Stone [Edward Durell Stone, Jr.] was actually on that committee and Ed Stone after doing--Ed's one of those persons who like to do things.  He don't like to sit and talk about it, he's one of those doers.  So what he wanted to do was my first scholarship and basically scholar--I didn't I mean, Dr. Reich [Robert Reich] basically said, "Fill this out," you know, not fill it out, he told me, even told me tell me how much money I have or whatever and whatever and basically looking at income and that was all that was and I gave it to him and actually had two other African Americas in the class and they both did--Glenn [ph.], of course worked for the [U.S.] Forest Service, he's retired now and who is the other person?  Anyway we sent that in and a couple months later I heard I got a scholarship, had no idea.  Anyway I got that and basically a couple thousand dollars a year and won a thousand dollars a semester which is plenty money, it was like I was rich to be very honest with you (laughter).  And so I got that and then LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was very good about finding you summer jobs.  They had, they were really connected and Dr. Reich was one of those workers you know did the entire thing. So I had already gotten a summer job with, with national Forest Service in Oregon actually and I was supposed to be on my way over to Oregon but he came running down the hallway to the studio to say, "Got you a job."  "No I have one already."  "Oh, no, no, no I got you a job."  I said, "What are you talking about?" You know.  "You gonna go to Ed Stone's office."  "I don't know who that is but I got a job."  He said, "No I'm taking that back."  I said, "You can't take that back."  (Laughter) So here I'm arguing with my, my head of my department about what I'm gonna do.  He said, "You're gonna do what I tell you to do" (laughter).  And so I had no idea.  I didn't even know where the scholarship came from actually to be very honest with you, it was just one of--so I said, "No they offering a scholarship with the--they were offering a summer job with a scholarship," which is a good deal.  So I went to the library to show you now naive I was looking for--'cause they were in Fort Lauderdale, Florida--well actually they were--I know they were in Fort Lauderdale, I didn't know about Florida so I went to the library and found out where Fort Lauderdale was but was looking in the State of Texas (laughter). So I spent a couple of hours looking at the State of Texas for this place and came back to the studio and told the students, I said, "God," one of my classmates, I said, "I just spent two hours looking for Fort Lauderdale in Texas and I just can't find it," you know.  I know Fort Worth [Texas] was there and I figured it was a Fort it had to be something you know.  And the guy said, "You idiot, everybody knows that Fort Lauderdale is the, is the spring break capital of the world or whatever.  It's, it was in Florida."  I said, "Oh, I didn't know."
Story_ID: 640836
Speaker 1: Actually that was the first time I actually left the State of Louisiana, by Greyhound bus twenty-four hours later getting you know with my little you know with my little--summer of '73 [1973] with my trunk, a bicycle, got there on the bus and got out. And looked for--I had to find a place 'cause you know to stay and with my bicycle and trunk and that's, so I got a newspaper and called places and things like that and then the first place I called, "Sure we have a, we've got this--." I was looking for vacancy.  Yeah so I you know get a taxi we drive over there.  The lady see me come up there she said, "Oh no, we don't have anything."  I said, "I just talked to you."  I was so mad.  And so it was the first point that was like that okay you know I don't have this problem in Louisiana.  I come to Florida, I mean I got this problem you know, so I get in back in the taxi and then go back to the bus station and look at other places and found another place on the beach actually.  Like you know walking distance, a block from the beach (unclear) you see and I call she say, "Oh yeah we got a place."  I said, "Look lady I'm gonna be very frank with you."  I said, "It's twenty-four hours on the bus, went to a place told me they had it and got there and I was black and I don't have it."  I said, "Are you gonna rent me the place or not?  Let me know now because I'm not spending any more of my money for taxis."  Said, "Oh no, no, no."  I think that in itself kind of set the tone.  She wasn't gonna deal with this, so I got a place on the beach with a great summer work scholarship because my wife [Bobby Jean Howard] was back home. And it was just and that was wonderful because--
Story_ID: 640837
Speaker 1: Now were you married then?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I had just gotten married, six months (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh okay well tell us how you met your wife [Bobby Jean Howard]?  Did you meet here her at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my wife was--met my wife in church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were--when I moved from my mother's [Ruby Phillips Howard] back to my father's [Grover Howard] and my stepmother, and my actually my--her mother also, her mother was really into church and we would have discussions about you know the Bible stuff like all the time but so we at the church. (Unclear) you go to church. Well anyway I went there for the first time--
Speaker 1: Were you a teenager then or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was in the tenth--
Speaker 1: Okay I was trying to understand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in the tenth grade. Yeah tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Tenth grade all right.
Speaker 2: And my wife--tenth grade, so I was fifteen years old when I met her and so when I went there she basically signed me in.  She signed me in.  And she asked me how old I was. I said, "Fifteen."  She said, "Well I'm fifteen."  She was like a little kid, 'cause I, I really did.  So that was the first time I met her at fifteen years old in church you know so, you kind of every Sunday you see somebody. And we actually didn't start dating until high school [Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Actually went to prom together you know and start dating after that.
Speaker 1: Okay and when did you get married?
Speaker 2: About two and a half years later.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were in the middle of LSU?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I was middle of LSU.  It was kind of neat. And I think my work really to be very honest with you I say my marriage saved me because my work got better. (Laughter) It just, I started getting all A's and everything.  I actually was getting--my grades weren't bad, even in you know--actually that's not true, my first semester at LSU I got a straight 2.0 [grade point average].  The first semester was 1.8 and I needed a 2.0 to keep my, just to show you. And then you realize what it takes to stay in school and what it's all about and I said, "This is not hard," and then you come to this realization so I got my grade point up to a point where I could go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] so you know you can't, can't be bad so, but the grades remarkably got better after I got married.  Even that first semester, the work got better from here.  I guess you just happy I guess I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So, so that kind of saved me.
Story_ID: 640838
Speaker 1: Okay so we were in Fort Lauderdale [Florida]--
Speaker 2: Fort Lauderdale (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) Okay.
Speaker 2: --working--I can remember Ed Stone [Edward Durell Stone, Jr.] came in.  I kind of grew up there and over time there. But he came in of course this is Fort Lauderdale and probably been there I'm sure but so tropical paradise back then kind of still is in some places.  He walks in with his Bermuda shorts on and his boat shoes and his little you know golf shirt. So, I mean, it's so--'cause he's--his dad's prominent I don't know if you know Ed Stone, Sr. [Edward Durell Stone], but prominent architect, designed the big box in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] there the, the performing arts, Kennedy arts center.  And, but he was internationally known.  I mean his work is international style so the things that he did so Ed grew up sort of--he did you know his father knew Kennedys and--
Speaker 1: So this is The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He's the architect (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His father was an ar- and actually Ed Stone, Jr. actually did the site work for it too.  And I was just wondering, Ed did tons of things that were quite significant.  So yeah he was a gentleman.  He was you know my wife [Bobby Jean Howard] loves him because he really is a gentleman's gentleman.  He came in and he said, "I'm Ed Stone, do you have insurance for your family?"  And that's the first thing out of his mouth. It's like (laughter) so, "Well I think so," I don't--I didn't quite know what the question was coming because it was very important you have insurance and you take care of your family and on and on. So he's right to the business of things.  He said, "Well, if you need anything let me know and welcome," and such and such and such. And so he would come by half of the time just to talk.  So Ed and I over a period of time he--but he died, he--that's someone else who died a couple years ago but he--when I was president of ASLA [American Society of Landscape Architects] I was in Fort Lauderdale for a meeting and he was giving a lecture and he, and before he started he said, "I want you guys to know that one of EDSA'S [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] most famous employees," and (unclear) to four or five hundred people at one time and says, "[HistoryMaker] Perry Howard's in the audience." And I said, "Oh Jesus Christ." So he kind of announced this, because everybody you know 'cause everybody knows me, but for him to say that it was kind of, kind of strange.  It wasn't strange, he really believed this.  So it was always this sort of connection I think it was a scholarship, the idea that what he intended for the scholarship to do actually worked and the person--so from that bit of piece I think he really--so he and my--his family especially his son are pretty close you know for the most part.  But that summer was great because I learned a lot and the professors even saw when I came back [to Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] 'cause you know professional work you work at a different speed, you get to see a lot of things, you spent, me and the other two summer students went down to Key West [Florida] a lot snorkeling. And to me it was another one of those wonderful fun times you know.  We worked real hard, and we played real hard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 640839
Speaker 1: You graduated from LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] with a B.L.A. in 1975, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and had you--did you, did you go directly to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] from--
Speaker 2: No, no, no I went to actually went to, but I had another summer the previous summer after that my--Dr. Reich [Robert Reich] and I had another fight 'cause I was gonna go back to Ed Stone's office [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] because I had so much fun.  He said, "No, no, no you're gonna go some--to other place just to get some variety."  So he sends me off to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. Hated it.  And I didn't think Philadelphia was a city of brotherly love.  That brotherly, personally. Again it's more racial epithets thrown at you for other reasons.  Not from people you're working with, it's from the city.  So didn't like, didn't like Philadelphia.  But anyway I went back to Ed Stone's office. And that was really during the oil crisis I don't know if you remember we had that first big deal and they really weren't hiring people but they had made a commitment to hire me. So when they hired me it was basically almost two years before they hired anybody else so in another sense we had about, about thirty people in the office and that was because of--
Speaker 1: Now was this '75 [1975]? Is this--
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) after graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: So you were hired by Ed Stone's office?
Speaker 2: Yeah (mumbles).  Maybe a year and half. But I did all the work for everybody you know all the grunt work you can call it. And for me it was good because I learned a lot very quickly.  And then when they did hire people, I was promoted about a year and a half promoted to an associate which was quite rare to be promoted so early on.  So.
Speaker 1: This is about 1977?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].  So I worked there until--and then you get really, really busy and you start doing things and they throw more work at you. And I had gotten to a point where I was so busy I couldn't even take a vacation because I had so many jobs that were--you had three or four things, major things that you were doing that you know you never really thought about what you were doing, you just kind of do them. And it got to a point where I start questioning what I was doing.  Said do I really wanna do this and things like that. And that's when I decided to maybe I just take a break and go to grad school.  I really had intended to go to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and then when I finally told Ed [Edward Durell Stone, Jr.] he told me that he wasn't--, "You not going to Ohio State, you're going to Harvard."  I looked at him like he was crazy.  I said, "I'm not gonna go to Harvard." "Yes you are." (Laughter) So he gets on the phone of course and then, another well connected person, calls Pete Walker [Peter Walker]. I mean the one that--and Pete Walker is chair at Harvard and the guy who's, as I said, designed the World Trade Center memorial [National September 11 Memorial and Museum, New York, New York] there. So he said, "Well Pete this is Ed Stone, I got this young man in my office here who wants to go to grad school. God knows I don't know why, he'll probably teach you guys things up there." (Laughter) I'm sitting up there next to him in the conference room while he is talking to Pete. And he said Pete tell him to send my portfolio to the school. And they had already selected a class.  I think they must have saved a couple of seats and they called me back a couple weeks later and said that I was admitted and, and then another week later a secretary called and wants to know where to send my portfolio to.  She said, "And by the way this is the best portfolio we've ever had in this school." And that was another sort of little--you get these full shockers you know so that was pretty cool.
Story_ID: 640840
Speaker 1: What do you think is--what was the strength of your portfolio?
Speaker 2: Oh it was just office work.  You know off- it's--if you look at--even still today you know everybody's all computer oriented now with the graphics and everything.  You look at it Ed Stone's [Edward Durell Stone, Jr.] work and it's still with the hand graphics and stuff and that's basically you do your job and do a good job, it sells itself.  So a lot of the work is basically, I mean it's--you want it's eye candy but it's better than eye candy because the things you do actually work and. And it's not you know award, it is award winning style but it's not something that really, really sort of--because they basically do a lot of research of these awards and things like that people go to, with the graphics and packages and things put together, really beautiful stuff.
Speaker 1: Well did you really a gift for that kind of thing, for doing nice clean graphics (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well if you go, I think, again just go back fifteen, you know tenth grade you're, and taking drafting so you basically got a foundation and you go to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and you do pretty good there and pretty, you know one of the better schools in the country. Probably at the time probably one of the top five schools in the country you get two good internships, you get to see things and then you're working for a firm [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] that you you know doing all the grunt work you're not complaining you're just working because you're happy to get paid to do this 'cause this is what you want to do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay this is all very humble and stuff but are you really good at how you present your--I mean it sounds like you are. If Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] said this is the best they've ever, they've ever seen.
Speaker 2: Well he said that was the best most famous--I'm not the best, no, no people are better than I am. People are better than I am, but well what I think my work is pretty good.
Speaker 1: But it's possible.
Speaker 2: People will tell you, people will tell you that Perry's pretty good.  I have classmates and even Harvard classmates I believe there's another story Harvard before you even start in the class is a story about, "You guys got this wonderful--." We're at a party and the guys say, "You got this wonderful, you got this wonderful you know person in your class we hear."  "Really?" I said, "Who is that?"  "Oh his name is [HistoryMaker] Perry Howard." And they was talking about me and the guys was telling me, I just start laughing you know so you get these kind of--and I probably was in overall the type of things that I did probably was the better in some ways but I'm not you know.  But there's bright--Harvard has some really bright people.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: You know there's some really bright people. So be able to hold your own you gotta have something you know.  Mine was sort of the graphics you know.
Story_ID: 640841
Speaker 1: I was just wondering about the qual- what your work looked like I guess you know.  I'm just--
Speaker 2: I tell my students now, it's up--like I said, twenty-three years so it's old I mean we gotta keep up with the Joneses, if you're gonna be competitive these days you've got to have moved things far and I really haven't been practicing so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you this--
Speaker 2: But I--when I was doing the work yes it was doing good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you this though too, what kind of things did you design at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for you know when you were working on your master's [degree]?  What kind of landscape projects--
Speaker 2: Well they gave you standard projects.  They started off, which I was really frustrated the first semester because you know we have the two year people and the three year people.  The three year people basically don't have degrees or any, they are very bright people that want to be landscape architects, so spend a year learning all the basic things that I pretty much had done in, in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and college [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and then practice within one year you can imagine the difference there.  And so they put us together in that second year so you have two years now with these people so surely--there's other people in my class too that had the same amount of experience I had, five years, whatever. And you know they have firms now, pretty good firms now. And actually I was just talking to this one when we were in San Diego [California] for our meetings and we were just talking about, told him I was retiring, I was retiring soon because I had to do something else.  He said, "You can't do that."  He said, "I remember when we were in school everybody got up and talked about," it's Harvard, "everybody got up and said what they're gonna do when they finished.  And you got up and said that you were going to go and take the things that you learned you know in your career and teach, teach at a historically black college [historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)]."  And I said, "I said that?"  I said, "I don't remember saying that."  "Yes, you did.  You said you can't--," you know, "yes you did."  And this was you know a very good friend.  And he, I said, "I don't remember saying this."  He said, "You sure did." He said, "You can't quit."  I said, "I'm sorry, I'm tired."  (Laughter) "I'm tired." But, so you get those kinds of you know dialogues back and forth. And so then I know I realize I had learned some really good things, I had some skills that I could teach students with to try to move a segment of our society a little bit further along, so.

Speaker 1: Like you get your projects.  It was, you know the projects, it was standard stuff.  I mean there was one, one group project that we did where we actually I think we blew our classmates out of the water but it was sort of a new community that we decided to create this urban village versus doing suburbia, we did an urban village and you know because at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] you have these reviewers that they invited in to critique things.  There must have been like twenty of them stretched across you know the auditorium where we were presenting this stuff and when we, you know, when the lady got done presenting our group, one of the guys just stood up and said, "This is the best presentation I've ever seen in an academic situation," and you know (laughter) of course, of course that makes, that makes the rest of your classmates really mad at you, real mad. And it was, really it was, and I know what we were doing and I was sort of, I hate to say it but I was sort of the, you know, group leader. And they, you know--because basically I had myself you know that's a two year person the other was three year students.  One guy was really good with graphics and in sketching things like that.  And the other lady was just conceptually, she was really just bright and the other one was just a smart person.  So you get these groups of people together and you know that's when you--talking about team building and getting your teams together and building on people's strengths to really do a project.  For me that was really significant.
Story_ID: 640843
Speaker 1: Okay how does landscape architecture work?  Does somebody give you like a bru- blueprint of a building and then you design (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, see that's--if Ed Stone [Edward Durell Stone, Jr.] heard you say that he will--there's a reason why they say he started his practice [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida]. The reason why he wanted--I was looking out, he's not here. He's dead (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He, he's not here, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He--no, see most people think a landscape architect is sort of the secondary, tertiary, or whatever kind of profession that kind of does things for everybody else but think about building in certain landscapes you know it's not just the opposite, it's set in landscape and actually where they're placed and how they're actually organized, how people get one place to another it's all landscape architecture.  Yes, architecture at one time probably come in.  But Ed Stone started his practice because he didn't wanna be--just go and put in bushes for architects.  He wanted to be the prime--to be very honest you know because his dad [Edward Durell Stone] was famous archi- he knows what he's talking about.  He could say that.  Actually his first degree was architecture from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and then he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] first, M.L.A., but he you know he basically wanted--you know and still do that. You know probably 80 percent of their work is through prime consultants, they hire the architects and engineers and they'll design things the way they want to design things. And it's kind of great to grow up in this sort of mentality like that because you don't, you're not--and I get make command all the time because I very--I can be very arrogant.  I don't know if you noticed that but I can be extremely arrogant and I don't mind telling people that you know it's crap you know.  I can do, you know and that's architects or whoever else, I don't have any problems you know doing that and that's because of that's the way I was brought up in my profession by I think a group of people, and that's a good thing because basically what you're saying is that you know you think you know what you're doing but I think the environment's much more important and I know a lot more about the processes and things like that how things work and this the way we're gonna do it.  And you know and try to get that instilled into students but that's a whole another thing.
Speaker 1: Okay now I'm trying to get at where does a landscape architect come in?  Does he--
Speaker 2: In the beginning (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) help, does he design--okay.
Speaker 2: It should, it should always be the beginning.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: It should always be the beginning.  Always the beginning.
Speaker 1: --so an architect's plan or footprint of the building (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It should be done before the footprint's even conceived actually. It should be before that. (Unclear), you know.  What is it, how many you need and, again so you, you're just talking architecture too.  There's a lot of things out there has nothing to do with architecture.  Think about that.  I mean there's a lot of parks, there's a lot big open nature preserves and things of course in Alaska and other places that have nothing you know that have processes so it's more--and then if this goes on in a suburban area where we actually start getting into buildings and you know things and so much engineers do with streets and roads and manage to screw up everything because all their formulas and things you plug in things and you know gotta be this wide and then that wide and then but they're killing all sort of the ambiance of sort of, you know the community where you're trying to put together by human scale things you know. You look at some of these streets out here for instance.  Mostly just overly done. So you can run cars down real fast or a fire truck real fast and how, you know, and not talking about the human beings you know considering them very much.  You know when you're in a really nice space that it's sort of built for humans. And that's what you know we should be doing versus building for cars, and all these monstrous kind of things that destroy landscape.  But a landscape architect should be in the beginning of a conversation.  If you ask me if that happens all the time, no, you know.
Story_ID: 640844
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know there's two examples we always give in Chicago [Illinois] that I think is general knowledge by most educated people in Chicago. Chicago's lakefront--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is a lot different from Cleveland's [Cleveland, Ohio] lakefront.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Cleveland built theirs first but they built it as a commercial, you know, docks and all that so when it got, came time for Chicago, they decided to put landscaping on the lakefront and put the dock someplace else.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is this a you know--
Speaker 2: That would be a--people love water but you know. But a lot of time commercial activities takes precedence over humans and what humans like to do and you know basically sort of stroll up and down the waterfront with their families and whatever and have picnics, they even go to a football game back in Chicago where I think that stadium is Chicago Bears stadium [Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois] is you know, they've taken an old stadium and they modified it into something else and of course you've got, what's that project down on the end, where the amphitheater is there, Lurie gardens [Lurie Garden, Chicago, Illinois], trying to think of the name of the bigger part of the project and all that whole waterfront tied together and we had a meeting there a couple years ago, three years ago whatever and it was just nice place to be on that waterfront.  That's just, it's gotten better and the idea that the mayor [Rahm Emanuel] tried to make it the greenest city in the world basically putting things on rooftops and, and green roofs and beekeepers and whatever up there all kinds of other things.  It's very progressive and that's where we need to be going as far as when you talking sustainability, you're talking about the whole green thing and I think it's here to stay because we as human beings need these things you know, or we're gonna kill ourselves.
Story_ID: 640845
Speaker 1: So your thesis was, was praised at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Your thesis was the development of that--
Speaker 2: No it wasn't actually a thesis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's the first year actually we were--I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what was your thesis?
Speaker 2: My thesis well it wasn't really a thesis per se because Harvard's a little different.  They did what they wanted to do, you know that, so we didn't really do a thesis.  We basically did--well actually we can do this.  We can just take a design project.  I--one of my friends, we got together we just put together this proposal because I didn't wanna do one of their projects, I wanted to do my own. And basically we were in New York City [New York, New York], we did three things in South Bronx [Bronx, New York].  We did the little station farmers market called Crane Square [ph.].  We did another project which was a little bit bigger than that which is we tried 'cause South Bronx at the time, perhaps still, I haven't been back there since. That was in '80 [1980], '81 [1981] since--was again it's a bombed out place and quite scary place actually.  But there's some things that were going on you see signs of life and coming back so we did another piece and took one of the neighborhoods and tried to infuse industrial sort of almost like a cottage industry within the community itself.  So the--you know you could work live above and kind of work below and that kind of deal.  The streets were kind of controlled 'cause it was trying to at least bring some sanity back so things can grow much bigger.  So that was the one project. That was quite interesting. And then the third piece was much bigger and I can't remember what that was now.  But we did that the two of us did that and it was okay. Just exploring ideas and concepts and things like that. So the Crane Square with that little project, she actually did work for that, went back and worked for the New York parks department [New York City Department of Parks and Recreation] and actually built that thing.  I had really I had never seen what she has did but she did that and a couple of other things we were working on and actually she built them with the parks department in New York City, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--she told me--that's the thing you're talking about arrogance again, I mean, I am I guess, 'cause we had went up to meet after we had--before we had graduated or whatever. And we were--she wanted I guess she wanted to get a job at the parks department.  I didn't really care about the parks department or anything else.  She wanted to--well anyway she went up there. So a guy was there I guess he must have been interested in me coming to work for him you know.  Fine I didn't--'cause I don't--well when you like this (gesture) you don't really pay attention to people. And she told me that I told the parks department I mean the guy who was the chair or whoever director of the parks department in New York City--I guess he's an important person I guess--that I had better things to do with my time than to work for New York City parks department.  And she thought I was sort of (laughter) I didn't mean to. I may have said it, but I really didn't mean to say that. And then I had things to do.  I mean I had other things I wanted to do.  So that was it.
Story_ID: 640846
Speaker 1: When you were at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], well maybe even before, like what is your--I guess do, do you have a landscape architectural philosophy or, or--?
Speaker 2: You know when you're busy working and doing things and, and I guess that's one of the reasons why I took a break and went back to grad school because you really didn't have a chance to think about, because you're working, you just trying to do the best you can and you just I want this spectacular thing where you--in every project so you really don't think about an overall--at least I didn't thing like that.  I know I wanted to do extremely good work if you wanna say that but that basically means that whatever you do you just trying to do the best you can at it.  Before it's a philosophy about, again is, I guess, I guess not.  Really I mean again it's like that when you asked the question about what projects I like better?  It's just sort of I mean I like all of them.  You know so the philosophy isn't like something that guides me, other than I wanted to be the best and like for instance sustainability is extremely important.  You say well that should be your driving force, but I look at sustainability as something that we had probably had been doing but not to the extent that we were putting so much emphasis on and it still is worked, it's just something else that we've been you know recognized kind of adding to the puzzle and having everybody else realize it's important now. But it's something that should have always been there.  And kind of has always been there.  But now it's just getting a lot of emphasis on it. And for us as a profession I think it's good because even engineers now are getting a little jealous. I'm told that by our folks there in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] society that I think you get comments from architects and engineers because I mean society people talk to each other that, "You guys seem to be doing pretty good in that particular area now," or whatever because there's a little jealousy here that you know folks are as a society are coming to you now to do the things that maybe had came to engineers or architects before they actually coming to landscape architects.  Now, there was one thing that I actually, it was a senior moment I was gonna say, and I for- and, and I should have said it when I thought about it, now it's gone.
Story_ID: 640847
Speaker 1: I was asking about architectural philosophy in terms of being a landscape architect (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I didn't have a--wasn't a philosophy--oh it was actually what it was is when I was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] you know love libraries, always loved libraries, loved going through the books.  I was in love when Barnes and Nobles [Barnes and Noble Booksellers, Inc.] came out with its superstores and whatever because you go there and spend eight hours looking at each little title and you know that's how I get my books.  I need to do that again too.  But anyway I spend Harvard's grad school design library [Frances Loeb Library] because that's a separate library, I did find a book down there when I was there and the book was basically sort of ten years old, oh not quite ten but it was by a British landscape architect, sort of educator wrote a history book called 'Landscape of Man' ['The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day,' Geoffrey Alan Jellicoe and Susan Jellicoe] and in the epilogue he wrote something about encapsulating everything you know kind of had the book but he for instance he said, the world is moving to a phase where landscape design may well be recognized as the most comprehensive of all the arts and there's a reason for this.  It's three folds.  And goes through and talks about the three things why.  And one was basically, and he called it the green--in an almost, I think--the idea is sort of planting trees which we were maybe in this stage now because you know the more trees you plant helps with the CO2 [carbon dioxide] and you know crap out of the air and creates more oxygen and you buy trees and you know one tree for instance I don't know how much CO2 it takes out of the air and stuff like that but. So that's one of the first things and the second one he said basically we're gonna plant things expert.  Basically we drew these very complicated plans to figure out where to put things and how to save the environment and all the other stuff. And the third thing was more like he said calls it creating a landscape art on a scale never conceived of in history.  I mean the idea that we plan things on a large scale but this is not just you know something that will help us with our survival at planting trees, its more than that even planting actually planting using that lot of experts had drawings and all the other good people to help us plan better. But even, not even that. But taking all those few things and now I'm creating an art. And art being that kind of thing that propels mankind. Because art, beauty, it's that thing that drives society. And you say, "Well what do you mean by that?"  And basically what I mean by that is we pursue in some sense beauty as you know I'm talking about the world society for most part. And that propels us to do other things.  So basically you're looking at the landscape now that we're creating, starting to create but haven't gotten there yet and if sustainability would fit in that second piece too, we are creating this landscape art. And if you ask me if you wanna ask me about philosophy then I guess that's what it is.  I still think that art is sort of still the biggest driving force behind what we do and it's critical that we include sort of the beauty in things as more than just making things work and from the natural systems function but that's the art and it also pro- you know.
Story_ID: 640848
Speaker 1: Is there a black aesthetic for a landscape architect?
Speaker 2: No, we actually try to pre- we had a couple of symposiums here [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  No not really.  Well, Walter Hood is a, you know, one of our graduates but he's teaching at, he's a professor at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  He does his thing but still even that, he's got his little thing that's going and I think that aesthetic comes out of the site, the client and putting those things together comes out and I think personally I think you know our society didn't--it merged so much now I don't think we know who we are.  That's the way I feel about it personally.  I look at the work of the person back there in the gallery, student work and I don't think it's as strong as it used to be you know.  I think we lost some things but I don't think, personally I don't there is no black style.
Speaker 1: Okay so you think that architectural aesthetics are pretty much the--reflective of the personality of the artist rather than some aesthetic that comes out of the group (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--well I mean I had this discussion with one of my students because she used to be an art major but she changed her, she was talking about black art.  I said, "What is that?"  I said, "That's art that's done by a black person? Is it art that's have black people in it? Or what is it?"  She said, "I don't know." Of course you're student, so can you have a decent conversation with students (laughter) because she probably never thought about it.  And she says, "Well I don't know, but I know I guess it's with black people in it I guess," and no that's pretty sad isn't it?  It's just like is that all it is you gotta have a face and whatever so is there something there with meaning how you actually transform a canvas into something that has deeper meaning than that and made from the culture it comes out?
Speaker 1: Well I know there are some architects that like draw from I guess they, they look at African art and architecture (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I know and, and for so what--so you so what is that, what does that mean though?  You know what does that mean?
Speaker 1: Well like when you look--
Speaker 2: I, I know what you talking about, for instance, kente cloth for instance.
Speaker 1: Well, no, no form in terms of functions and, and you know circles instead of squares and other kind of forms and I don't know.
Speaker 2: Why, I guess the question I would ask why circles instead of squares and is it because in Africa you got the little huts that are circles and it's better functioning and so you're gonna use that and again maybe I just don't know enough to even have a decent conversation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well focal point there would be a circle in terms of a gathering place you know.  People focus on the center of the circle I mean but instead of all facing the same way.
Speaker 2: Like knights of the rou- like knights of the roundtable?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah could--they could have the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what are you saying then?  Is it, you know, so knights, or--?
Story_ID: 640849
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But even regardless of who you know and what--do you have a certain--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --proclivity for certain forms and--
Speaker 2: No I tell you, I got some art pieces that I've--maybe that's something I ought to do too with this because I can even send you some clips of that so you can put in the video.  I didn't bring any with me.  I don't even got pictures you asked, I know you guys asked for that. Probably send that. But there is some--and I call it my subconscious landscapes.  I started off with these drawings and basically what I do is just start and without even thinking too much ahead of time maybe a second or two about what I'm gonna do next and then things kind of evolve.  I guess probably with anybody, maybe not 'cause you, for instance you've got a sculpture you're doing you have to plan ahead of time what you're doing, how you gonna come up with that.  But these were not, you just saw the circles and squares and pieces and regular things and then he decided to do some 3Ds, I took a pottery class and did some clay pieces and when I realized what they were was just sort of a commentary on what we are doing with contemporary landscape architecture.  I mean look at the forms and things are there and what people when I saw the forms and kinds of things I think today what that's what I call it sort of a commentary of that. So, and that's basically taking everything I mean what I see here and things that I think are kind of neat and I tried--and all they are like impressions and I mean I find, found things out when walking the street or whatever, bottle cap or some pieces, old piece of jewelry or something I press them down and it's clay and it creates this own little thing and then putting several of these things together and projection pieces up so you begin to get these, these landscapes.  I call them some kind of landscapes.  So in that sense it's like you, you reacting to what's out there and as a whole and it's not just you know from an African American standpoint, it's from you know I think from the entire society in some sense.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: Well not entire--well that's not true either, because I had one guy who looked at it, he was Chinese American he said, "You know that wouldn't go very well with Chinese people," but you look at China now and a couple of times they're becoming Westernized very quickly and it's things you see here with certain flair you wouldn't see over there.  Like I see a lot of the landscape architects are going overseas now doing work all over the world now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as a landscape--so from what I've--correct me if I'm wrong, I'm trying to understand what you're saying. I think you're saying that the landscape itself dictates how, how you would--
Speaker 2: It should.
Speaker 1: --nature itself--
Speaker 2: Think about it.  It's a natural process out there.  We just, we just wanted to, we're just one of the first people, we're one of the energies or creatures that are occupying this blue sphere here and we should, we should make sure that we take care of these natural processes first before we start imposing our will.  If you don't then we (unclear) big time.  You got these huge industrial complexes there because we need to move so many pieces of furniture from China back over here for the furniture market because we don't build anything here now and back and forth so you got this huge industrial apparatus that are moving things around the globe of commerce. And that dictates what we do in our environment and it should be just the other way around.  The environment should dictate and say okay we need to put this kind of thing there, how can we reorganize those processes so and this industrial complex where they can work hand in hand together where we're not really impeding our purpose in the long run.  Even, should we be shipping things back and forth like this even, you know?  Just talking about the you know carbon footprint and all that stuff but you know everybody now trying to grow more locally, grow locally for instance say we want to ship bananas from Costa Rica wherever and to here because every time you do that you're adding putting more CO2 [carbon dioxide] whatever back in the atmosphere because you know these huge conveyors of commerce are choking the air up with the carbon fuel that we use.
Story_ID: 640850
Speaker 1: Is there--well describe one of your projects to us? That you did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Projects.
Speaker 1: How you approached it, and what you did.
Speaker 2: Well typically what you're taught in school is to you know the process would be of course you know theoretically you get a commission and somebody hires you either a private client or governmental or whoever. Or non-NGO [non-governmental organization] whoever hires you to do something and unfortunately it's what we gotta work with, we got to start with somebody that's got some money to pay. And of course even through history how things are when you're studying life in history because we were teaching history courses.  You--well, I'm getting off--that's what happens I get off key, let me go back.  The process you know you get a commission, they hire you, you do your whatever proposal whatever, they hire you.  Say I'll do it for this much money, yes, yes, yes, you're gonna get this kind of products.  The products are for us to do inventory, to do some research on whatever you're doing and we research on the site and there's also there's research on this sort of program, the things you're gonna put on the site and so you look at the things at least a client get you to start with.  Sometime you don't even know what the program is, you need to come up with it.  So you do this and so you do the research, need to come up with this inventory and see what you have, especially site inventory.  This is within the site, you got trees, you got this, you got that and you know substructure of soil, you got whatever the stream, the sun's over there, it's over because you need full variation, you gotta talk about any sustainability kinds of things and even cultural factors, manmade things that are put there that you need to respond to or protect.  All these you know things that have anything to do with the site from a natural standpoint to a cultural standpoint and two bigger things even economic standpoint, you need to pinpoint and you need to identify ahead of time. Then you have something called analysis. You take that data that you actually collected, called inventory, both on the program and the site; and analyze it. What are the opportunities and what are the constraints.
Story_ID: 640851
Speaker 1: So after you kind of inventory the site?
Speaker 2: And then you do an analysis.  You analyze the materials and say what, you know--it was basically, you know, I tell students you look for the good things and bad things, or opportunities and constraints.  What are things that are good that you can actually build upon and make them better? Things that are maybe constrained that you might wanna have to really work hard at trying to fix it so it'll work the program.  So basically it's a site thing and the same thing with the program even.  Some things, programs, may not just fit on this particular site or you might go get some more land or you don't need as much land or whatever so you look at all that stuff ahead of time before you even began to what we would call concept studies and basically now is when the first time you take and you put your site and your program together and to some form that begins to look like a plan and oftentimes that's sort of a bubble diagram that has names on them like parking lots or building or a retention pond or a vehicular circulation or pedestrian circulation. All those kinds of things are put on this sort of bubble diagram and then you know you may have you know one of these.  You may have most times I've worked on a project where they--where I probably did probably fifty of these concept things because the client was very finicky about things and always changing things and then go back and studying the numbers and make sure it works out for them or whatever.  So once you get to decide what direction you wanna go, you say okay I'm gonna take this concept now and do a sort of a final master plan if you wanna call it.  And you're free to put the hard lines down, building and it's a good time. Buildings and parking lots and whatever else, grading you know because now you got things that you know the whole world isn't flat unless you're living in Miami [Florida] I guess, but things--
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) go up and down (laughter). So you gotta work those elevations and things out so you get to a point where this thing works and you present to, and say yeah that's great.  Though you may need to take all of it or a portion of it and start actually doing what we call working drawings or drawings that they're detailed drawings you actually write down you know you give to a contractor and the contractor takes those drawings and builds it. And then you go out from that point and, and check your contractor's work, at least look at it and say, "Well you know I didn't ask for that kind of whatever I wanted this and you put that and you need to take it up," or whatever, "This is good or you didn't do--pour the concrete right, you need to take that up or whatever," and so that whole thing.  So even after that if you want a lot of times it doesn't happen because you got something called post construction evaluation where you actually go back and see how things are actually working, if it's doing what it's supposed to do or not and you might need to make some adjustments for that too.  So that's sort of the, sort of the concept I mean the whole process. And again it's all kinds of variations of that and people like Halprin [Lawrence Halprin] for instance came up with RSVP Cycle where you actually, things kind of loose back on itself. And it's not a straight thing either, it does go back and forward, it's just not a linger thing per se this thing does whatever it's to do and eventually you come up put something at the end.  So the more iterations you can go and refine it the better this thing get, get to be.  So there is a process there.
Story_ID: 640852
Speaker 1: Then you ask about a project that I--one of the things I--back when I working for EDSA [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] the second time? Or was it the first time? 'Cause I was back after--I went back after school, but I also spent a year in New Orleans [Louisiana] before that.  But the first time I think it was--anyway I don't know if you remember 'Miami Vice' and--the TV program--and then one of, one of the things the TV program was really kind of cool back then because of Miami [Florida] well we had all these architects building all these very strange things and this one particular building [Atlantis Condominium] had a hole in the middle, it's like a basically it was condominium but at midway up and this twenty-third building there's a hole in the middle with a stairway in it but that particular project that the architects came to us and the name of the architectural firm is Arquitectonica [Arquitectonica International Corporation, Miami, Florida].  They had a site on the Miami--on Biscayne Bay that had a lot of old banyan trees which are huge ficus trees and they were huge, they were all huge and they're old. And they wanted to put this building on that site and the city wouldn't let them do it because basically were putting the building they were gonna have to cut down all these trees just like we were just talking about.  And so--
Speaker 2: Now is this in eighty--is this when you working for the City of Miami's heritage conservation--
Speaker 1: No, the conservation board, no--
Speaker 2: Conservation board (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that was actually--oh no it was the first time it was between '75 [1975] and '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's in that first time--
Speaker 2: Okay I'm sorry, I just wanted to ask if you--
Speaker 1: Yeah the first time. That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were you working for the City of Miami then?
Speaker 1: No, no I never worked for the City of Miami.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was basically sort of a volunteer or pro bono thing that you do and you do because people ask you to do it because they need people to review things.  I do a lot of pro bono stuff, but anyway that particular project, so they came to us I don't know why because they were down in Miami, we're in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], but the group came to us and wanted us to look at it see if we can help them get it through the city because then you got a client and they're trying--so they hired us to get, to get it through the city. So of course we drive down.  I had actually lived in Miami and worked in Fort Lauderdale so I kind of commuted every day.  So I went--we went--I went, was it just me, or maybe one of the partners went with me I looked at the site.  I looked at what they had as a building.  They had a big parking garage, big wide sucker and then the building was such that it was linear, skinny and linear because basically I think the apartments went from one end of on this side and that side so you get views on both sides, you look out the bay, you look at east you looking west I think. Maybe it's, maybe it's north-south, east-west so you get these views but this had this huge parking garage because you know it wasn't anywhere to put surface parking so they had the parking garage. But you had the parking on the other side where they had to tear down the trees so I looked at the thing and I basically looked at it and it took me probably all of you know five seconds once you got on the site said, "Well, why don't you just move the parking garage on the other side of the building and that way you can save these trees, make it part of the arrival and be very beautiful these huge banyan trees. And these trees that are a couple trees that are over here, they're smaller and they're easily moved.  We can take 'em and move them, get a tree spade, move 'em up front and creates a nice screen from Biscayne Bay or Biscayne Boulevard--" down to I think it may be Bis- I forgot it wasn't Biscayne Boulevard it was--anyway forget the street, main street, "--and screen it and so you have this--," and they had this long--first time I seen one of those too they were very creative people a real lineal lap pool had thrown up front so they were really creative people for that time.  You didn't get that kind of stuff back then.  So now not only the hole in the building they have this lap pool that people use and it was long and it's just like, it was just like one of those aha moments that you know you're an architect again you know getting a big bucks [dollars] to design this building but can't think of a simple thing like that, you know, just move, take, you know, you got this piece, you got that piece it's over here to move it over--he looked at it and, "Okay."  And then he took it to the city and it went right through, fascinating.  I mean it wasn't, wasn't a big deal.  But that's what, those are the kind of moments you kind of get and just go, this is what I do, this is what I really appreciate, you know.
Story_ID: 640853
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you have seen that you just kind of groan at every time you see it?  I mean a piece that could have been landscaped--
Speaker 2: Oh we can talk about just--what landscape architects do is we don't do a lot of things, you know, we're not hired to do a lot of things although we should.  A lot of things are done, I hate, you know, I hate to kick the profession but civil engineers do a lot of what we do but they do it badly.  I look at a lot of the strip, strip shopping you see--
Speaker 1: Yeah strip mall type (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) where basically you know just (makes sound).  And then basically we're talking about the little shrubs or and basically these are land ordinances, it's a lot of times even landscape, some landscape architects help put together because they are compromises you know 'cause you're dealing with you know the city do these things but they get developers and everybody or you know put five shrubs here, somebody says a tree, put the trees up and this stuff is legislative. And it drives me nuts because you can walk down the street and that's what you get (gesture) and this parking lots and then you look at this stuff and go and then you know you get stuff the same thing all over the place you know any major interchange off of an interstate now you got the same stores you know the same, of course we talk about as landscape architecture actually professions. Not just landscape architects but architecture too, the sameness that we're creating in our environment. It just--you don't have any--you're talking about you know the black aesthetic, you know we don't have aesthetic at all even place aesthetic.  Just basically you're going to get a Home Depot you get an Applebee's, you get a whatever and ever and they're just lined up you know of course the McDonald's and of course you get off the highway and you got all these things. And we're part of the problem too because we're you know, you know we're somewhat demanding these things and they're providing it for us.  But all of those landscapes are out there that they're not really designed, I mean and this majority of our world and this country now it's just ugly, just ugly stuff (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 640854
Speaker 1: Let me ask--let me try to catch up on a chronology here if we can.  And so you got your M.L.A. from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I spent a year in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And the reason why I was in New Orleans 'cause I started an M.B.A. program at University of New Orleans [New Orleans, Louisiana] and I spent one semester and realized that didn't wanna manage some large office some place because that's basically what I was grooming myself to be.
Speaker 1: So where did you go to school for that?
Speaker 2: University of New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Four semesters there and I decided to quit.  I filled out my resume.  I didn't put that on there.  But at the same I was working full time at a group called Perez and Associates [August Perez and Associates, Inc.; Perez APC].  Perez, I was actually I was in school I was actually assistant to the president of the, the office, who they were doing a lot of things back then and that's of course they had that world's fair [1984 Louisiana World Exposition], they were working on any major hotel in the city that were doing any major work in the City of New Orleans, Perez group that's doing it.  And then once I quit that I went down--Caplinger Planners [Charles Caplinger Planners] was part of that group. They're landscape architects.
Speaker 1: So when was this 1980 what? Where are we now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983] all right.
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982], eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982] summer and '83 [1983] summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I did that for six months and realized that if I wanna do landscape architecture might as well go back to EDSA [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc.]. So after working a year in New Orleans, I took me and my family we moved back to, to Fort Lauderdale [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And first time I actually had an interview actually too. They, they thought it was funny.  They basically took me out to lunch and asked me why I wanted to come back.  Of course they were gonna hire me anyway, it wasn't gonna be a question of that. So that was my second time, so I worked there from '83 [1983] to, to '89 [1989] before I came here.
Story_ID: 640855
Speaker 1: Now here, tell us about now who is Dr. Charles Fountain [Charles Allen Fountain]?
Speaker 2: Well Dr. Charles Fountain had, went to--grew up in Virginia.  He went to what's the name of that school in Virginia?
Speaker 1: Norfolk State [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], Virginia State [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No.  It was over there by the water someplace like that.
Speaker 1: Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Hampton.  Yeah. Went to Hampton then he got undergrad there, he had some stories about--and then he went to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and got his master's [degree] and Ph.D. from Michigan State.  Then he worked here [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and I think before that I think he actually worked, he was in the [U.S.] Army I think, as a lieutenant in the Army, the Army or the [U.S.] Air Force, one of the two I'm not sure, but he came here as a horticulture professor and then he worked. And then of course Dr. Fountain was one of those person who always trying to explore trying new things and I guess he found out landscape architecture.  I think he started work in the late, early '60s [1960s] I think here and then he found out about landscape architecture and then he, he decided that he--maybe the school could benefit if there was a landscape architecture program--was here on campus so he went back to school, went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] to get his master's which is not you know an easy thing to do. And he would tell stories about how he was he said they had asked him to do a camping--a campground, you know camping sites, camping. He had never been camping in his life.  He said he went into the bathroom and cried like a baby because he thought he had made a mistake by trying because you know designing is really is not easy.  It's pretty difficult to--especially without any experience. You get to, again you do research and then you know you gotta and you know after he got a Ph.D. in something and then you go back and get a master's in something that makes you cry because it's so hard, then it just kind of makes you wonder. But that's what he wanted to do because he wanted to start a program here.  So he came back and started the whole process of you know of that and then in '77 [1977] he finally opened.  But in the meantime one of the things came up African Americans in profession, that and he was part of you know trying to get again a lot of that thing- stuff out like you asked me earlier is one of those eight he and then it was Bill Wilson [William L. Wilson] from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and it was a couple of guys out of Michigan and what's his name out of Minnesota?  So it was, it was a group there and you know I knew the men.  You know I used to work there about three of them left.
Story_ID: 640856
Speaker 1: I know you took the place of Dr. Fountain [Charles Allen Fountain] here at North Carolina and A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and--
Speaker 2: Well Dr. Fountain called me when I got out of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] every year and asked me to come to work and it was a nuisance and I kept telling him, "I'm not coming to work there," you know.  I thought I was gonna go work sometime when I was sixty I would maybe go and teach and then it got to a point when I was at EDSA [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] that I told them that I worked--I would work for--I would work in the office for ten years and after that I haven't been a partner by that time I was leaving and that ten years was up and I was passed over of course.  Of course I told them I was leaving and of course they asked me what I wanted and I said, "Well, I've already decided what I'm gonna do so," and at the end of course he--if I probably had stayed I would have been a partner and whole bit and so, but it was just a timing of things sometimes. But it was for me it was a good way to you know make a decision without having to make a decision.  So I called Dr. Fountain and he said, "You're not kidding with me are you?"  Here we go again.  And so he invited me down he said, "Give me some time," and he invited me down to give a little talk and I did that and I meet people and he's re- he's gonna retire--he was retiring anyway and luckily this time I called and he's basically another year and he's out the door.  So it's like it's a good sort of--so when I came he basically left so it was a good way of ending stuff.  So he was the reason why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did you overlap any at all?
Speaker 2: Well he actually came back and did some adjunct teaching but he was you know it was pretty much, didn't  want to do it any more.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: But I knew, I knew him, I knew him pretty well.  We had a lot of conversations and things like that.  Another gentlemen, almost like Ed Stone [Edward Durell Stone, Jr.] one of those--my wife [Bobby Jean Howard] wanted me to be like both of them but I wasn't, I'm not.
Story_ID: 640857
Speaker 1: Well tell us about North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and the program here, and--?
Speaker 2: Well the program again it was started in '77 [1977] and I got here in '89 [1989].  I think in the early stages it was a lot of excitement.  By the time I got here it wasn't very many students.  John Robinson had started a program there in Auburn University [Auburn, Alabama] and he had came, he came here in '85 [1985] so he was actually here four years before I got here.  John is very technically oriented.  I mean he does all of the construction courses.  I'm really glad to have him here.  I--and then I came and just had that sort of you know professional experience design background. And John Robinson too, we went to the same schools.  Actually he was LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] when I was there but I didn't know him and he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] but that was before I did so he went directly out of school but he's actually he's eight years older than I am so a little bit older but so. So you know we went to the same school but we had sort of different kinds of experiences and things, which was really good. It's good because you know we can talk the same language but it's also bad because then you know you get kind of pigeonholed because you think the same way for the most part so it's good and bad.  And then we've had in the meantime, we had a couple of people--we're talking about people now--teachers that didn't quite work out. 'Cause working here in this program there's only really three professors and you teach everything, you know, from design courses to construction courses to theory, history, ecology if you have to.  All this stuff is so you, you almost like you have to be a jack of all trades just what I was talking about earlier, I like everything, and you have to like everything to be able to do this because it'll run you ragged you know.  You might in the morning be teaching a freshmen history class and then the afternoon you might be teaching seniors design studio and the two are so far away from each other that you mean, you got to literally switch gears to do.  So in that sense it's challenging to try to grapple all of this knowledge and do it at a level where it's, students are gonna be competitive out there in the world and demand things from them.  I mean it's not an easy getting, getting you know like I said teaching people how to design stuff and be comfortable doing it and a lot of these kids don't have a clue because they have never done anything.  Again I had three years of drafting in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and a lot of them are just drawing for the first time in their life and it's scary sometimes.  But the program is just--we just received our fifth accreditation I guess last semester. And hopefully got a pass. I mean the exit review was really good and they thought because right now we just hired a young lady last year that from one, out of the major offices out of Boston [Massachusetts] who actually grew up here and wanted to move back with her husband.  And she is very good, she is really good with students, they actually like her, which is in the last people we had hadn't been such thing. Because if you don't have your stuff together, kids will know it and they will run you right over and I mean because they demand so much.  But she--they actually you know, they like her so that's a good thing.  So from a faculty standpoint it's very good.
Story_ID: 640858
Speaker 1: Facilities are, facilities are okay; I mean we're in a building without an elevator, but okay.  Being on the campus [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] itself I don't--I think the campus can be a lot more aesthetically pleasing.  I think, I think it really is heavily engineered (unclear) and there are things that are done are basically done to work, but for aesthetics, I don't care.  You put things where you know--you go out and buy a hundred benches, tacky stuff just indiscriminately stroll through campus and pop them down places you know. What the--why do you do that?  Walkways stop and no way you know simple things like that.  One doesn't pay attention to.  Parking, parking rules you know most campuses try to keep parking out of the, out of the academic space and just have people walk from place to place, but no, it's fused right in there with everything else and you probably see that if you walked around you just kind of walk in between cars. So personally if you ask me it's not a very good--and actually it's funny too because I look at some of the images taken from the web page, they're trying to find glimpses of things that are student lives that are wonderful and you know where this place is and said yeah well I guess if you take that camera and focus it that way you could look when you get there but when you look back a little bit you go, oh my god.  So I think in that sense I personally I feel like a failure because I'm not a diplomat enough to go and persuade people to do things. Because I--again like I said I rub people the wrong way I think. But I think it could be a lot--and we tried with different folks.  They come in when they're in trouble and ask you a question but then they're gone because it seems why they're in trouble; and then you don't hear anything until--again until somebody is else is in trouble and they ask you to help them fix it.
Story_ID: 640859
Speaker 1: Have you been able to shepherd some students towards a master's degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah I actually have one in particular now that's at Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], calls me his mentor, drives me crazy.  We actually have them during that (unclear) it helps us too because he really is very good at computers and things like that so he helps the students with that stuff and teaching and he's really, really aggressive. God he's--and I just have to--and he thinks he knows everything and and I'm trying to get him to move himself into maybe even thinking about Ph.D. because where he's going with this stuff he's gonna have to do that because you know you get yourself stuck and you're not good to anybody where you are now and you have to you know move up a little bit further to--
Speaker 1: So are jobs available, are many jobs available for people with a B.L.A.?
Speaker 2: B.L.A.'s are basic grunt work stuff and and it's always a discussion about B.L.A. vs. M.L.A.'s. It happens in the profession all the time.  Well right now you're talking about the job market, the job markets are, you know, tied with the, with construction industry, housing and that's bad so I mean--
Speaker 1: It's rough no matter which one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but yeah a lot of folks--but B.L.A.'s are good because if you really get good students, you can really get some really good technical and design skills because you they have time to do it.  But most of the time I really do try to encourage them to get a master's degree because it's just a theory and why you do things and the question you asked me what do you sort of--anything you actually look to. You really begin to look at that?  You need that to do what we do because you, you think it's complicated.  You think it's, you think it's not but you're dealing with all these pieces and you gotta have some way to make it make sense to you when you actually looking at even a little simple project, you need all these pieces and you have to be able to synthesize in a way that the end product is coherent and works.
Story_ID: 640860
Speaker 1: Well tell me about, I have a note here that you all here did something with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], where you were working with NASA?
Speaker 2: Oh I did--when I first got here [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and was just gung ho, you did anything and everything and somehow I got into--and NASA had some funds that something called the Earth Observing System which is just a sort of satellite looking down on the earth and taking pictures, not pictures, they take images actually because it's digital images and not photographs. And you can actually manipulate the data you know, this is very standard stuff now. I remember because when I was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I did some of that stuff and basically you can--data where you can find, for instance, what areas they are--was like you know going out and find pixel and pixels with the image for that particular area. And say well find me all the areas that look like this?  And because if it's wet or is you know wetlands whatever, will find all the areas that are like that because this is a digital image you know it's just what the computer is telling it what to do.  So you can get all kinds of other maps from this one image that's like just by looking at that kind of data and then making other maps from that.  So, then it was in my privy to do that and that monies they gave us to do that and then it was a fellowship I really didn't wanna--personally, if you ask me, I really didn't wanna go but I went, spent the summer there at Goddard Space Flight Center [Greenbelt, Maryland] running around looking at images and trying to manipulate data and stuff like that but--and that would have been a really good thing for master's degree program.  Not undergrad. It's too far away from students to make any sense, basically trying to draw you know get the principals and elements of design down, let alone that so. And then I did have some--and then they were gonna increase the money, actually double it, and I had problem with my department chair, the person that was you know--'cause we were at--the programs were in the department. And he liked to control everything. It's academia I guess.  And I was actually away.  I was actually back at EDSA [Edward Durell Stone, Jr. and Associates; EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] that summer.  I decided to go a summer just to, just after that first summer.  This was I think the second summer or third summer, I don't know. And so I remember I got a call and they wanted to increase it and I had to do pay proposal and stuff like that and Dr. Dunn [ph.], I shouldn't have said his name, that's not good, people see these things, refused to sign, he wouldn't do it.  I mean I could have got it through, I could have put the vice chancellor at the time said, "No, you're gonna do this."  I said, "No I'm not."  I said, "This is exactly (unclear) I'm gonna teach landscape architecture, not fight over grant monies you know.  If he doesn't want the money from the department then that's fine with me."  So I said, "Forget it."
Story_ID: 640861
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I think, I personally think, since the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] we got some things that are going for us. I think we're a little behind on you know teaching and bringing--well bringing up as, as, as parents. We--I think we're a little bit behind on bringing up our kids the right way and in a way I think we give 'em a lot.  We don't expect very much from them, and they get lazy.  And that's just my from teaching here [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and I don't think--'cause they expect more than they actually are willing to actually do.  It's just this sort of teaching, mine too actually.  And I think what I mean by we're a little behind, I think other people have more time to figure out how to raise people in a way that in a society now there's a lot of stuff. 'Cause just 'cause you got a lot doesn't mean you have to have a lot.  I mean you basically you refrain from giving them everything.  For instance I remember sending my kid who was nine years old on a field class over to Europe and I told the lady that she goes, "Did he work for it?  You just sent him?  You just gave him the money to go?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "Don't do that."  And she's right, because you gotta make them work for things that they get because now that they've been given everything, you don't really expect to work. And I think--and I feel that and that's and I really do I think that as an African American I think we're a little bit behind.  We haven't figured out to do that yet. Other people have.  And I think if you can do that the rest of it will take care of itself because you teach people to work, you teach people to take pride in what they do, I think you know all the other things will come, fall into place.  I don't think we--our kids wanna work, you know I guess which is fine.
Story_ID: 640862
Speaker 1: You've received a number of awards.  I know you were listed as one of the top 100 graduates of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I think it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, should put those things in my resume.
Speaker 1: --and what--when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today will you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I knew you were gonna ask a question like that. (Laughter) And I was actually talking to my wife [Bobby Jean Howard] about it and I don't know if I have, I mean I guess there's something there but I, as of yet, I don't, I don't--well I've done things maybe the first or second to do something for instance within the profession and that's all fine and dandy when you did it, oh is this really, really great, but it really isn't, and that's okay.  Personally I think is what--and I do plan to retire in a couple of years and go in my border room and create art and I think I have, I think I put that on hold for since I've been in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I mean I think I actually probably would have been an artist.  I thought if I could live doing that I would have really been an artist.
Speaker 1: So you're talking about going into fine arts?
Speaker 2: And also do projects, landscape architect, I think both.  I think it can go hand in hand in that.  I think you actually can do landscape art on a scale and I think that's the challenge.  And it would be nice to kind of end things with that for me anyway.  So I don't, so I think there's still more to come I guess for me is what I'm saying.  I don't think I've ever really done what I, you know, wanted to do.  I keep on telling the young lady I work with yesterday, I said you know I hate to say it, but it's one of those times to be selfish, it's about me for a change, not about everybody else doing things for everybody else this is what I want, see what comes out of me. And I think there's some things there I wanna try to pursue them you know. If I can get some commissions or I mean some projects, landscape architecture, fine. If not, I think I got enough things that I can actually produce in the time and then actually learned some things you know other fine art.  There's some glass, I do stained glass, which I haven't done in a while, and the whole clay thing, and then the drawing thing and there's this new type of glass techniques I really would like to get into. And I did some other, sort of scan some of the fine arts that I actually can look for outside, sculptures and whatever, even lights, lighting, sculptural lighting, or something like that.  So, so legacy I don't--I ain't there yet.
Story_ID: 640863
Speaker 1: Well when you look back again at everything you've done, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: That's always a question when asked I always say that if that was the case, I wouldn't be where I am today.  So no, I mean.  I've always gone on the kind of thing, I filled my way through life you know. Like planning you know, I may--I know this is a time for me to sort of the stop doing what I'm doing because--and kind of getting response from students, you're kind of--got an itch to do something else, you've, you think things are to a point now that someone else can take it over and so you feel this stuff and say okay it's time to do that and that's why I think my whole life has been that way.  I'm gonna do this because it feels right.  When I left EDSA [EDSA, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] I said, "I wanna do this because I feel like I wanna do this now," and then you leave and you know. So no I don't really regret anything that I've done, it's just the way it works out you know, you know, and sometimes you just need, you know, kind of talk to yourself, talk with them and kind of keep in touch with who you are, you can figure it out.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family?  You have children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kids?  I have three kids and four grandkids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My oldest son has four kids. And my oldest son--none of them actually finished, well they're working on, Perry's [Perry Howard, Jr.] I guess again given things and just assumed they're always gonna be there and he could have you know he was out here at A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] actually he was in our program at first and then he went to engineering. And he just, at the time he just wasn't ready for school.  But now he's got kids, he's (laughter) great, he's taking classes and you know and about to get an--I think he has an associate's degree, and he's getting beyond that.  My daughter [Sheri Howard] told him one time when was in school she--was too stressful, she couldn't do it.  She worked for Cocoa-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company] in Atlanta [Georgia].  She's happy you know.  And then my youngest one [Justin Howard] is, he's the daring one you know.  He's, you know, he didn't finish either but he's again he's here in engineering and quite capable but I always--I tell my kids do what you--this is your life.  This is yours you know but don't expect me to you know this is yours as long as you can take care of yourself then, I'm fine.  So by the way he's a, he's a soccer referee.  He did soccer from about ten to nineteen and I drove him all around the state and country but he's, he loves doing what he does.  He gets selected every summer to go to these national meets and you know actually he was the only one selected as all referees in the state to go do that and he's very serious about it.  He just runs back and forth all and sometimes he does six games a day but he's, he's able to support himself, so, knock yourself out.  And he's teetering with school too.  So I mean the whole thing is and sometimes people just aren't ready. And I guess you can force them to do it, but, but you know, should have made him work a little bit more on other things.  They're okay, they're kids.  I mean they're good people and the grandkids are great and they're good, just love to take them for walks in the woods.  We go on long hikes sometimes.  I hate it sometimes but go up to Hanging Rock [Hanging Rock State Park, North Carolina] some place and just for the day and you know look at things and the youngest one is fourteen months and she's, I call her the clinger.  She just, when she sees yo- me at least--I guess all of them have a you know, I don't know what it is but they got this they cling to their grandfathers. Like why me?  This little girl will, she, you know as long as I'm in sight she's fine when she's around, and if I move or go somewhere she's like, you know I gotta go get her or she just sits there.  Much like my daughter actually was.  My daughter would sit on my lap all day long if you allow her do that.  So that's kind of neat.  That's kind of neat to have them and talk to them. And I actually, their development too.  You're talking about you know talking about teaching these kids earlier and you look at see what's missing with them and then you say well Jesus, you don't know about this you know and one of the things, your favorite thing to talk about is your geography you know. "Where is this?"  "Oh, (makes sound)." "Just checking on you."  And then it's something you ask and then didn't quite know it and then we just go and start working on that.  So sometimes you think that you're getting things in school but they're not, you need to keep checking you know. And one summer a couple of summers ago, the three of them the other one wasn't born yet, took them to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], got on the train and went and 'cause we both had them, my wife [Bobby Jean Howard] had something to do and I had something to do and luckily they were perfectly aligned at--I got done, at least she got done.  My (unclear) was whatever.  So we were able to take them around D.C. and just go visit things and believe it or not their favorite place was the National Gallery [National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.] you know the, the modern piece.
Speaker 1: The Guggenheim [sic. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No, no in D.C., the National Gallery, the, not Guggenheim--
Speaker 1: There's a Guggenheim there.
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: In D.C. next to the National Portrait Gallery.
Speaker 2: Really?  I have to check that out 'cause I didn't know that.  Well anyway we went there and they actually you know it was one of the little lectures you know you can go and they take you around and tell you about.  They were, they were fascinated, they asked questions.  I said, "Where in hell that come from?" It was like they really into it.  I didn't know and if you ask them, "Where was your favorite?"  "Oh we like the art gallery," because it's such a you know an outstanding building and that mobile that's in the middle of that that space is just fascinating. And then you know so they were into it.  But you know doing those kinds of things I really, really do enjoy.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you about or you haven't mentioned that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not really.  It's a nice conversation.  I like conversations.  But anyway, no.  You can ask your last question.
Speaker 1: Okay, well last question is similar to legacy so here goes.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know it's funny, this morning I was reading I couldn't wear black, couldn't wear red, couldn't wear white, so I got up this morning about 2:30 in my house and I said, "I need to go buy," and seriously I had to go to Walmart to buy this shirt and I said to myself--and I thought amazingly about Frederick Law Olmsted was basically sort of the first landscape architect, did Central Park [New York, New York] and all that, and there's two images of him, one of course when he was really, really old, his long beard and this little coat, and another one was much younger you know. And I said well, if someone was looking at this video a hundred years from now, what would I look at?  I said definitely I don't want a coat and tie on because I been there done that, hate those things and I you know my if you look at, Google my name, this picture you'll find with the coat and tie on and I really don't like the image you know.  It really isn't me.  I did that for--to fit in with other people and the whole, you know. And not only that we have a lady over here who takes your photographs.  Won't take photographs when you're on campus [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] unless they're coat and tie.  What is that about?  What is that about?  And then there's that little mentality you have about the world you know, you gonna tell me what I should put--have on.  Anyway so I look like this whatever, so but the--I don't know, I--that's one of those things like I don't think about things like that.  I really don't.  I just don't--what I've done, basically all I've done is try to be helpful.  I try to help people and, and more specifically, you know African Americans in landscape architecture but not just that but even when I ran for president [of the American Society of Landscape Architects], I was asked to do it, I didn't wanna do it.  I was asked the reason why I did it because they never had, I mean in a society after hundred some odd years, never had an African American landscape architect and it's not good for you know, doesn't look good you know.  Because there are landscape architects really aren't that way.  It's just that I guess nobody really rise to the occasion. So I thought about it and took a lot out of me to do it because it was a small school and not very much support, it's kind of hard to take away for three years to teach and run around and stuff like that, but you do that because people ask you to do it.  But at some point in time it gets so much you just gotta say you know, "Stop." And I--like I said right now I'm trying to stop everything but it's not I did things to help because I, I think I was given things even (unclear) for whatever, just given things and it's something I think you need to give back, you know.  I think I was very lucky.  You know it's all about giving back.
Story_ID: 640866
Speaker 1: I did not ask you about NOMA you know, did you wanna address that at all?
Speaker 2: The what?
Speaker 1: NOMA, the National Organization of Minority--
Speaker 2: Architects [National Organization of Minority Architects]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Are you a part of that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never actually went to one or two meetings.  I don't know.  I don't like complaining.  I shouldn't say that.  End of conversation.  I don't--I want that out.  I'll live--no, I'm not, no.  I just didn't like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right I'm sorry to interrupt your other thing, but I--
Speaker 2: No I didn't like--no, no I understand you know.  I didn't like.  No I could be but I just didn't--I don't like belonging to things either.  Usually because it represents what I do and it helps me.  I go into meetings, I learn from people, I think people do know me for who I am in the profession and that's sort of a good thing and that's enough.  You know that's what I belong to.  I mean that's where I belong because you know it helps support me what I do and in return I don't mind even giving back there now.  Even now I'm still on our North Carolina board because the chairs of each program they're on the board so I still have to go to the meetings and it's you know sometimes tough to get up go to--been going to meetings now for twenty-three years and do about six of those a year it's--you hear some of the same stuff, and you--but now I'm sort of the elder statesman, look at myself as the elder statesman and tell them that you shouldn't do this, not do that.  It's not good, and they listen and then you're back off and listen some more until something comes up that you think you're getting it all for whatever you say, "No, no, no," so that in some sense that's good.  So you know that's good.  It's a good thing.  That's what I do.  So a lot of letters of recommendations, a lot of this, a lot of that.  I gotta go back now and write some more letters and that's what you do.  So.  That's where you know you get to this stage (laughter). I remember Ed Stone [Edward Durell Stone, Jr.] I remember every time I'm in his office he'd be down there writing and he always--he never--Ed doesn't design, basically he knew how things should have been but he let his other people design stuff because he wasn't a designer.  But he would always be down there writing letters of recommendations or whatever, he's always writing letters.  He just write, write. And I asked him once, he said, "Oh Perry [HistoryMaker Perry Howard], (unclear) you know this is for whatever you have to do that."  I never got it until now you know everybody ask you to do that.  So you know you're something else.  Just really something else.  So good?
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right well thank you very much.
