Story_ID: 650315
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, and--separately, then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Ruby, R-U-B-Y, L, Lee, L-E-E.  Her maiden name was Watkins, W-A-T-K-I-N-S.  So it's Ruby Lee Harris [Ruby Watkins Harris].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: She was born in Purvis, Mississippi; and her date of birth would be May 25th, 1925.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 1: Can't go that far back on my mother's side of the family.  I can go back to my great-grandparents; but I mean that's pretty much on my father's side as well, go back to the great-grandparents.
Speaker 2: So did you know your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, in fact I knew my great-grandmother, so maybe I can go back to my great-great-grandparents on my mother's side.  'Cause I knew my great-grandmother, and knew my grandfather [Henry Watkins] and my grandmother [Fannie Davis Watkins].
Speaker 2: Okay, well take us back as far as you can go, and now is their history basically in the same area around Purvis, Mississippi, or do they come from some other place that you know, historically?
Speaker 1: They come from around that area of Purvis, Mississippi.  But they lived in Hattiesburg, Mississippi--that's where my mother went to school, met my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now Hattiesburg is like southern Mississippi, in terms of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: And is Purvis nearby?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So what was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: Okay, Dorcia, D-O-R-C-I-A, Davis, D-A-V-I-S [Dorcia Davis].
Speaker 2: Okay.  She's your mother's--
Speaker 1: This would be on my--
Speaker 2: --grandmother, your mother's grandmother?
Speaker 1: --my, my mother's side, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, now she would have been born in 19th century, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, I--we haven't been able to lock those dates in or even, you know, where my great--my maternal great-grandmother was born.
Speaker 2: And your--did you know anything about your maternal great-grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yes.  He too was born in Mississippi; and from my great uncle [Ben Watkins (ph.)], I have a picture of my great-grandfather.  And he was a--an illustrator, he was an artist.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did he--I mean, so are there any surviving works of his anywhere?
Speaker 1: No, no, not that I'm aware.
Speaker 2: Did he illustrate for magazines or journals, or?
Speaker 1: Newspapers, I believe, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, I mean newspapers that were published--?
Speaker 1: In Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay, these are black newspapers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you have (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Local, but I don't have any copies.  I mean, I'm going by family lore right now.
Story_ID: 650316
Speaker 1: Well that's interesting, you know.  As an illustrator, now he would've been, you know, circa turn of the century, you know (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes it is, because I also have an uncle who was a--an--an artist, sign painter in Chicago [Illinois].  One of his, his sons.  This would've been a great uncle, this was one of my grandfather's [Henry Watkins] brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and--
Speaker 2: So it's almost like that runs in the family--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on my mother's [Ruby Watkins Harris] side.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, an artist then.  And what was his name?
Speaker 2: Ben Watkins [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so are there any stories about your mother's grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, only that, and again this is family lore, one of her uncles, and all I know they called him Uncle John [ph.], who was enslaved; and the story in the family is about the first time he tasted ice cream, and how he just really loved the taste of, of ice cream.  But I have--I mean this is just, you know, something passed down in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did they--he just loved it, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he didn't know what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your great-grandparents own their own land, or?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm not sure--on my mother's side I'm really not sure.
Speaker 1: Do you have any sense of what--now your great-grandfather was an illustrator--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --did he make a living doing that, or did he have some other occupation?
Speaker 2: I think he was also a minister, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What denomination, do you know?
Speaker 2: Now I think he was a Methodist minister, although the family, my great-grandmother [Dorcia Davis] was a--was a Baptist.  Like she used to make sure I went to church at Morning Star Baptist Church [Morning Star Baptist Church of Chicago] in Chicago.  They lived in what were then the, called the Ida B. Wells Homes in Chicago, my, my great-grandmother did.
Story_ID: 650317
Speaker 1: Now did your great-grandmother [Dorcia Davis] and grandfather move the family, your mother's family to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they came around the time of World War I [WWI] from Mississippi.  And this was a part of that chain migration.  I mean there were some members of the family who came around the period, the turn of the century, around the time of World War I.  Others who then came around the time of World War II [WWII], coming up using Illinois Central Railroad, coming up from Mississippi to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, the well known story in Chicago: migration from Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So did they come up to the--now you were--you were telling me earlier you were raised on the West Side, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: So did they come to the West Side first?  Is that?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Our family lived on the Near South Side of Chicago, on what was South Parkway, now King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And then in the Ida B. Wells Homes [Chicago, Illinois]; and then of course they began to move out further south.  My parents [Ruby Watkins Harris and Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] located on the West Side of Chicago.  Initially, there was a distant relative who rented out some rooms to my parents on the West Side of Chicago.  And we basically remained on the West Side as my parents later bought a home on West Side of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now what did your mother's parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was a schoolteacher.  My grandfather was a, a porter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I should say that my maternal grandfather, who had only about a sixth grade education, was someone who really had an interest--and I mention this because I think it was an influence on me, had an interest in African American history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather had a habit of buying two newspapers every day: he would buy the Chicago Defender and he would buy the Chicago Sun-Times.  And in the Chicago Defender there were these illustrations by J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers], 'Know Your History' [sic.].  And I used to read those when my grandfather brought the newspaper in.  And even though he had basically a sixth grade education, he read those two newspapers every day.  That's when Chicago Defender was a daily.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  It was a daily not until too long ago, about five years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: They finally gave it up, but became a weekly, but.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, J.A. Rogers, 'Your History' ['Your History: From Beginning of Time to the Present']--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --illustrated--And it was actually a Chicago man that illustrated some- George Lee [George L. Lee] that illustrated some of the pieces for it.
Speaker 2: I'm not--yeah.
Speaker 1: But yeah so that inspired you in those days to?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I wanted to know more about, about my past.  And also my grandfather was a great fan of baseball, he used to take us to Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois] each year for the Negro League all-star game that was played in Chicago.  And he would talk, of course, about the great black baseball players.  And he had seen some of the players before they came into the Major League [Major League Baseball], like Willie Mays, [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron, so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so, and what were your grandparent's names?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was Henry B. Watkins [Henry Watkins]; and my grandmother's name's Fannie Belle Davis [Fannie Davis Watkins].
Speaker 1: Now, so your mother--so she had a teacher--her mother was a teacher, her father was a por- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was a porter, yeah.
Speaker 1: --porter.  Pullman porter, was that--that was--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  He--I put por- no he wasn't--he wasn't in the middle class of the Pullman car porters.  He was a porter, he cleaned up in a--in a printing plant.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so he was a--
Speaker 2: He may have been a janitor you could call him.
Speaker 1: Okay, in a printing plant, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I call him a porter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because I thought--I thought you meant a porter.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Now, his brother was a Pullman car porter--my uncle, Wesley Watkins [ph.], was a Pullman car porter; and then also my brother--his brother--my grandfather's brother, James Watkins, was one of the original members of the Harlem Globetrotters.  Now Harlem Globetrotters started in Chicago [Illinois].  They called them the Harlem Globetrotters, but he was one of the original members of the Harlem Globetrotters.
Speaker 1: Yeah you're absolutely right, Abe Saperstein--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --started right there in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he came out of high school and played for the Harlem Globetrotters, he was a great basketball player.
Speaker 1: Okay.  His name again?
Speaker 2: James Watkins.
Speaker 1: James Watkins, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And again, show how this runs in the family in a way.  I have a cousin, not his son, but another uncle's son, Bobby Watkins, who played Dunbar High School [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois]; and then later played basketball at Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you got athletes in the family.
Speaker 2: Except me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 650318
Speaker 1: Now, your mother [Ruby Watkins Harris], did she have any--what did she say about, or what do you remember your mother saying about growing up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know if she really talked that much about growing up in Chicago.  She, she did talk about going to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois] and studying French, as I recall, in high school.  Because we took our--my mother on a couple of occasions to visit our daughter [Lauren Harris] who was studying in--in France.  We took her to Paris [France] and she recalled some of the French that she had studied in high school.  But, and then she babysat for my uncle who--great uncle, actually, Uncle James [James Watkins] who played for the Harlem Globetrotters when he was out of town; she babysat for his family.  That's, that's about as much as I can, I mean you know, can recall for the moment.
Speaker 1: Your mother going to Englewood, now that was, it wasn't--I know there were other black students at Englewood, but there weren't that many.
Speaker 2: There weren't that many, no.
Speaker 1: She was there it was mostly white?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  My mother never had a problem in getting along with--I mean she did not let being well, colored as she called it, bother her.
Speaker 1: Now was she, you mentioned another sign painter in that family.  I just went--you mentioned Englewood and my mind went to [HistoryMaker] LeRoy Winbush who we interviewed in Chicago--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --who is a famous sign painter, he used to paint the signs for the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Was she related to him at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Well I just thought I'd ask (laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm sure my Uncle Ben [Harris' maternal great uncle, Ben Watkins (ph.)] would've--would've known him though.
Speaker 1: Right, LeRoy Winbush.  He--someone mentored him and taught him how to sign paint, and it might've been one of your relatives, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Could've been.
Speaker 1: But--yeah.
Speaker 2: Could've been.
Speaker 1: But he went to Englewood, majored in I think drafting or something.  Okay, so she went to Englewood High School and was, did she live in the district for Englewood?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  She had to travel.  My mother, I guess, given that her mother [Fannie Davis Watkins] was a schoolteacher, although my grandparents divorced early and my mother was raised by a gr- my great aunt [Pearl Mayweather (ph.)] in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  And so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now this is important.  Your mother was raised in Hattiesburg--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --rather than Chicago?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she went back to Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and was raised by her great aunt?
Speaker 2: --no, okay.  Part of the family came up around World War I [WWI].  My mother came up during World War II [WWII].  So as I say it's part of the chain migration.  There were family members who came up around time of World War I, other family members who came up during time of World War II.  My mother and my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] were part of that World War II, and that in part was because in the, the [U.S.] military, my father was stationed at, I think it was Fort Sheridan [Illinois], outside of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so--
Speaker 2: So she grew up, in fact she went to elementary school, as did my father, they knew each other from time they were in elementary school, and part of high school, they went to school in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right then so your mother come--so her mother lived in--
Speaker 2: In Hattiesburg, but then she moved to Los Angeles [California] after she and my grandfather [Henry Watkins] got a divorce.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've got, people are--they kind of dispersed in many directions?
Speaker 2: Yes in many, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did your mother have a large family, lots of (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, my mother was an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: But she had a lot of cousins.
Speaker 1: --now did your mother have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, my parents didn't, didn't go to college.
Story_ID: 650319
Speaker 1: Now did your parents get married in Mississippi, or in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: They got married in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father's [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] from Mississippi too, he was from the same region (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi as well.
Speaker 1: Well, let me go to his side; and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your, your father's name was the same as yours, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and you're gonna have to look at the cheat sheet (laughter) for his date of birth.  I know he was born in 1926--August 24th, it should be, 1926.  Okay, I remember that.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, so he's a year--
Speaker 2: Year older, I mean a year younger, I'm sorry.  Year younger than my mother [Ruby Watkins Harris], right.
Speaker 1: And so what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I can go back to the 1840s to my great-grandfather.  We've documented more this side, my, my father's side of the family.  My great-grandfather, Henry Harris, was born on a plantation in Virginia.  And his mother was enslaved, as he was, but his father was the plantation owner.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's the son of the plantation owner.  Did, now did that afford him any privileges?
Speaker 2: That we--we're--we just recently discovered the--the plantation list and the list of names.  Now one of the things we've got to determine is how we got the last name Harris, because that wasn't the plantation owner's last name.  So there's still some questions there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've been able to see the list and identify your ancestor on that list?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And his last name was Harris at the time, even though his--the master, who was his father, had a different last name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of the master if you?
Speaker 2: That I--I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my daughter's doing a lot of this genealogical research for the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know sometimes, you know, when a plantation owner fathers a child, depending on the circumstances, they elevate that child above the other slaves?  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Right.  Right.  So we also have to determine how, I mean we've determined in the census that my great-grandfather was born in Virginia and my daughter's recently discovered the plantation records.  But then somehow or another he got to Silver Creek, Mississippi, and that's where my grandfather was born.  Now how he got to Silver Creek, I don't know.  I've tried to determine in looking at Civil War records as to whether he was in the [U.S.] military during the Civil War, but we haven't been able to--to track this down.  But he lived in Silver Creek; and that's where my grandfather was born, in Silver Creek.
Speaker 1: What's your grandfather's name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My paternal grandfather, Lee Harris.
Speaker 1: Lee Harris, okay.
Speaker 2: We got a lot of Lee's to go through here.
Story_ID: 650320
Speaker 1: So Lee Harris, so that's your paternal grandfather (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My paternal grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Okay, well my great-grandfather [Henry Harris] was a farmer.  My grandfather was a shoe rep- well shoe maker.  He could make you a pair of shoes.  He had a shoe shop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and that's where my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] learned the shoe repair trade, from my grandfather.  And my father, if I'm skipping ahead a bit here, owned a shoe repair shop in the Board of Trade Building [Chicago Board of Trade Building] in Chicago [Illinois].  My father taught me some of the shoe repair trade, but he would only teach me so much, because he was supposed to go to college, and he didn't.  He was able, basically, to make a living as a shoe repairman.  I mean this was at a time when you had real leather shoes.  And so, but he would only let me learn so much because he was determined that I should go to college.  His father was disappointed that he did not go to college.
Speaker 1: So what is the story, what's the story about how your father did not take advantage of this opportunity?
Speaker 2: To go to college?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He got married and he started a family--
Speaker 1: Now was he--?
Speaker 2: --in Chicago.
Speaker 1: What college had, you know, had they aimed to send him to a certain college?
Speaker 2: No, just that they wanted--in fact, my grandfather, as my mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] tells the story, wanted my father to become a pharmacist.  He thought that that would be a good, you know, occupation for him.  My paternal grandfather was injured during World War I [WWI].  Something happened to his eye, and I've got to figure--work this out too.  I've tried to get his [U.S.] military records to see if I could, could, could get that.  But he--and my father told me that each year he had a glass eye that would come into the mail--come through the mail for him to replace this eye that he lost in the military.  And I think it was a part of disability or something that he got a settlement from the military.  Anyway, he was able to buy a block of--a square block of property in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  That's something I've been able to trace.  I, I have the deed for the property.  And--
Speaker 1: This is a square block?
Speaker 2: A square block he owned.  He also owned his own shoe repair shop in what was the black downtown section of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now he was injured there during World War I?
Speaker 2: During World War I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's an interesting story.  They have any stories he passed down about that, because you know, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I really did not know my grandfather that well.  The only thing--I have a great aunt [Pearl Mayweather (ph.)] who, and she tells the story of going to visit my grandparents in Hattiesburg, Mississippi; and she traveled on the train with me as a baby.  My great aunt, my grandfather's sister, traveled in the white section of the train because she was passing me off as a white baby.  Then that way, she could travel in the white section of the train.
Story_ID: 650321
Speaker 1: We left you on the train (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, well as I say, I, I, I don't--I didn't know my paternal grandfather [Lee Harris] that well.  But I do have this little corncob pipe that my aunt [Pearl Mayweather (ph.)] who traveled with me on the train to--from Chicago [Illinois] to Hattiesburg, Mississippi sitting in the white section of the train, pretending that I was a white baby.  She said that he gave me this little corncob pipe 'cause he smoked a corncob pipe.  So I still have this little corncob pipe at home that he gave me.
Speaker 1: So, he made this for you or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did he bou- or bought (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

Speaker 1: You're born in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, 1943.
Speaker 1: --nineteen forty-three [1943].  This is during the midst of World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met in Mississippi, did we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, they went to school together.  And my mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] always talked about how smart my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] was.  She said as soon as the teacher--and this was when they were in I think the first year or two of high school together, how--whenever the teacher would ask a question my father would shoot his--he--he would be the first person to shoot up his hand in the--in the class.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is--so did he con- so this typifies his character in school as being a bright student, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And just, so this is why people thought he should go to college, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah especially his father [Lee Harris] thought he should go and become a pharmacist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but he hadn't decided--hadn't started the process?
Speaker 2: No, no, he--World War II, he enters the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Does he do that before he gets married or afterwards?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Does he do that before he gets married or afterwards?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to recall.  That would've been about the time that he got married because see, I was on the way and they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was in the military, Fort Sheridan, Illinois.  My mother, of course, you know she had relatives in Chicago so she came up to Chicago; and then I was born there in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, all right.  And they went immediately to the West Side (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they lived on the South Side.  I mean, as many individuals did, they lived with relatives initially on the South Side of Chicago; and then after my father was discharged from the military they moved to the West Side of Chicago.  My father got a job initially, you may remember this, the old Goldblatts department store in Chicago.  Then he later worked for this shoe repair shop on Adams Street, and he worked there for a number of years.  And actually the guy who owned that shoe repair shop, an Italian American helped my father to get his own shoe repair shop [Heeled Bar (ph.), Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: This is the one in the Merchandise Mart [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, in Board of Trade Building [Chicago Board of Trade Building, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Board of Trade.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, Board of Trade, that's right there at LaSalle [Street] and Jackson [Boulevard] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Jackson and LaSalle.  Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So, now when you think about--now did your mother do--have an occupation at all?
Speaker 2: She was a beautician.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  She was a beautician.
Speaker 2: Yeah, showed you the picture of her graduating from beauty school.
Speaker 1: She graduated from beauty school in sixty--?
Speaker 2: But this was--this was later that, I mean, yeah I was in high school [St. Philip Basilica High School, Chicago, Illinois] at the time that she went to beauty school.  Before that she was basically a housewife, homemaker.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she didn't do hair on the side before (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, yes she did.  I mean I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about that.  But before she got her license, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, she can't get in trouble now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: So, it's all right.  Now I, I thought, you know, that might be the, if that's the case, many black barbers--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and beauticians--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --they start off before they have a license.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  She, she, she, she decided to become legal at some point.

Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, their mannerisms, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  It's a combination of the two.  Because my mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] was very independent.  In fact, my mother wanted me to be able to iron my own clothes, to take care of myself basically.  And so I learned early on how to iron my own clothes for example, how to stitch a button--those kinds of things.  My mother also read more so than my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] did, and I think that was an influence on me.  My mother was the disciplinarian in the family; my father never spanked me.  In fact, one day my mother said to him, and I was in maybe fourth grade [at St. Finbarr School, Chicago, Illinois] at this time, she said, "You've got to do something with this boy."  And so my father took me into their bedroom and he put this pillow on the side and then he took a hairbrush.  He said, "Now I'm gonna hit this pillow, when I hit this pillow you scream."  And so he said, (makes sound), and so my mother was listening, I don't know, but he said, (makes sound), and I'd say, "Oh wow," (laughter) you know.  He never, never laid a hand on me, you know.  But he satisfied her that he had disciplined me.  My father was pretty easygoing.  He was very popular.  He belonged to a number of men's clubs on this--based on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  One he belonged to was called The Blue Eagles [The Blue Condors Pleasure Club].  My, also--my father also did some modeling.  Plus they would have these fashion shows and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: So did he dress clean?
Speaker 2: Oh, did he dress clean.  My father had tailor made clothes that he had from the House of Duro, I never will forget that, on North Michigan Avenue in Chicago.  No, he, he did well by himself, with shoe repair shop [Heeled Bar (ph.)] there in downtown Chicago, you know.
Story_ID: 650324
Speaker 1: Many people would see this, oh this is a menial job, you're--you know, but in downtown Chicago [Illinois] doing anything you can get tips, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --he's in the Board of Trade [Chicago Board of Trade Building, Chicago, Illinois] with the stock brokers--
Speaker 2: Right, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and anybody walking through the board of trade--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there's a lot of people there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we--we delivered.  I mean we picked--that was part of my job.  I, I worked with him in the shoe repair shop, and we'd go pick up the cust- you know, LaSalle Street's the business district there in Chicago and--with the banks and law firms.  So I'd go pick up shoes, bring them, we'd put the full soles, half soles, heels, that sort of thing.  Mainly men, some women whose shoes we would repair.  But one of the things I remember most about my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.], and a lesson he taught me, in the shoe repair shop, and my father was--was--was--was very sharp.  We had--his shoe repair shop was called the Heeled Bar [ph.].  And you had this bar like, and a person would come and sit down and on the other side we would take the shoes off of them.  So if a woman came and sat down, I would take her shoes off and say, "Looks like you need some heels replaced," and that sort of thing.  So had a woman come in once and so she wanted her shoes, she brought her shoes in, but she wanted them stretched.  And so I could do the stretching.  She came back the next day, and so I'm mentioning the heel bar because I--I went I got the shoes, I put them on.  I said, "How, how do those feel?"  Oh, she got very salty, "Did you do anything to these shoes?  These shoes don't feel like you did anything to them."  And I'm in high school [St. Philip Basilica High School, Chicago, Illinois], I'm arguing back.  "Oh, madam--," I did call her ma'am or madam or something, "oh, I stretched these shoes," you know.  "No you didn't do anything to these shoes."  My father heard this.  He said, "Come here," he said, "oh, ma'am, I'll take care of this," you know.  And so, there was a partition, a doorway going through, but you couldn't see the machinery and whatnot in the back.  My father put the shoes on the side, he said, "Now watch this."  You know, you have the shoe lass and hammers and whatnot.  He said, "Bang, bang, bang."  He brought the shoes back out. He said, "Ma'am, how do these feel now?"  She said, "Oh those feel wonderful."  He hadn't done a thing to the shoes, but he taught me a lesson about making sure that we satisfied the customers, that they would come back.  I mean this is how we're making our living, you know.  But it taught me something about human psychology.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that's gotta be quite--so did you work in the shoe repair shop often?
Speaker 2: Yes, mostly throughout high school and into college [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  It's basically how we paid my tuition in college.
Story_ID: 650325
Speaker 1: Now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have two sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, what are their names and what do they do?
Speaker 2: Sharon Yvonne Reed [Sharon Harris Reed], and she's retired now, but she's an accountant and she lives in Jackson, Mississippi.  It's interesting, my mother when she retired she moved back to Mississippi.  My parents [Ruby Watkins Harris and Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] had been divorced by that time.  And she met--my--my sister met this young man who grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, who knew our family, they got married and they settled in Jackson, Mississippi.  So when my mother retired, she moved to Jackson, Mississippi.  And my sister who ha- she has a beautiful home in Jackson, Mississippi.  In fact, my brother in law James Reed [ph.] was the first black train engineer for the Illinois Central Railroad company.  He drove the train.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had a nice place, my mother, to stay, could've stayed in the bedroom off to the side.  My mother's independent, wanted to have her own place.  So that's what she did.  My sister and I we helped her out.  And I--we--there was this new building going up, it was a senior citizens building, cost a little bit more than where my mother was living.  We said, you know, maybe you might wanna live in this new building.  So we moved her into this new building and as I said, the rent was a little bit more, but my sister and I we helped pay for it, you know.  And so my mother asked me one day, I said you know, I, I asked her how things were going.  She says, "Fine," she said, "but what's gonna happen when you and Sharon die?"  She's thinking (laughter) we're helping to pay for the rent and who's gonna pay for the rent--.  I guess she thought she was gonna live forever, you know.
Speaker 1: It's interesting--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) how people think, so.  So you have two sisters, Sharon and?
Speaker 2: And Sandra [Sandra Harris Carter].
Speaker 1: And Sandra, okay.
Speaker 2: Sandra lives in Atlanta, Georgia now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But both of them were born, grew up in Chicago [Illinois], but.
Speaker 1: You're the oldest, right?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there a big gap between you all, or is it--?
Speaker 2: No, two years and then between me and Sharon; and then eight years between me and Sandra.
Story_ID: 650326
Speaker 1: Your household when you were growing up consisted of just your nuclear family, or did the grandparents live with you, or any?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I'm trying to think back.  As my grandfa- but I was out of the house at that time, my grandfather came and stayed in the--in the house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My maternal grandfather [Henry Watkins].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory was when I--the one I remember most clearly, my mother took me over to enroll me in kindergarten, and they gave me a test of some sort.  And my mother asked me, "Well what kind of questions did they ask you for this test?"  And I remember having a conversation with her, what animal does beef come from; what animal does pork come from?  I remember this just very clearly talking with her about this.  And you know, telling her that I said, you know, that beef came from a cow, pork came from a pig, that sort of thing.  So we went to Catholic school, and there's a story here, 'cause my parents [Ruby Watkins Harris and Robert Lee Harris, Sr.], they actually sacrificed for us to go to Catholic school, (unclear) had to pay tuition, you know.  But they did not feel that we would get a good education in the public schools in Chicago [Chicago Public Schools].  And there's a story here.  My wife's family knew my family.  The great aunt that I mentioned to you, my grandfather's sister who carried me as a baby to Hattiesburg [Mississippi], she and my wife's grandmother were good friends.  My wife's grandmother was a seamstress, my great aunt was a seamstress.  In fact, my great aunt made clothing for the Barrett Sisters, gospel sing- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The sing- yeah, the Barrett Sisters, right--
Speaker 2: --Barrett's, she made their clothing.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) albums and--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she made their clothing, my--my great aunt did.  So anyway, it was my wife's grandmother who said, "You should send the children to Catholic schools."  My wife [Anita Harris] was in Catholic school, what have you.  So that's how we ended up in Catholic school.  But I--that memory and I'm going a little bit ahead, when my wife and I started dating, we did not know that our families knew each other.  In fact, my youngest sister, Sandra [Sandra Harris Carter], used to come and spend the night over at my wife's house.  She was a good friend of my wife's youngest sister.  And they say that I used to come there to pick up my youngest sister.  I don't fully remember this.  But my wife and I--I took her to this play, I never will forget.  A play by Genet called 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show'].  I thought it was something to do with black people, but it's not (laughter).  Anyway, I took her to this play and in the play there's this elderly woman, and my wife says, "That woman--," Jean Genet, the playwright--she said, "that woman reminds me of Ms. Pearl."  I said, "Ms. Pearl Who?"  She said, "Ms. Pearl Mayweather [ph.]."  I said, "That's my aunt."  She said, "That's your aunt?  That's my grandmother's best friend."  So here we are in college, and we find out that her grandmother and my great aunt were the best of friends.
Speaker 1: So did you and your wife meet in college (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, we met at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 1: Isn't that something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well it's right there in Chicago [Illinois], but still, you know, it's still--
Speaker 2: It's quite a coincidence, isn't it?  And then that our families, you know.  When I met my wife's mother she said, "Oh, yes, I remember you, you used to come by, pick up Sandra," (gestures) you know.
Story_ID: 650327
Speaker 1: Now you were raised on the West Side--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was a different, it was a different West Side then than it is today?
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --when we moved in it was undergoing the transition.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I mean something that I--I--I share with my students, when we moved in, even though my father was a veteran of World War II [WWII], he was not able to take advantage of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  He was not able to get a mortgage on the home that he purchased on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] 'cause it was redlined, okay.  Even though he should've been able to qualify for a mortgage under the G.I. Bill, but he wasn't.  They had to buy their home on what was called land contract--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --which means they were--they had no equity in the house; they had to keep paying for the house until it was paid off.  Now, this is a situation that creates the wealth disparity between African Americans and whites.  When I went to teach at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], my first full time teaching position in 1972, I wondered how was it that my young--my colleagues were buying homes?  We were both assistant professors, we were making maybe a variable of a hundred dollar difference.  I was ma- because there, there was this most popular book in the library at the University of Illinois, this blue book, it was the state budget.  Everyone's salary was listed in this book, and so I knew how much they were making.  I may have been making a hundred dollars more than some of them, they may have been making a hundred dollars--I mean there wasn't that much of a difference.  So how do these guys buy homes?  And so I'm one of these individuals--and again, now I used to tell my students, you got to see--you got to do some espionage work.  You got to understand how the game is played, okay?  So I asked one of my colleagues, "How did--how did you buy your home?"  I mean I'm not afraid to ask, you know, so I can learn.  "How'd you buy your home?"  He said, "Oh my parents took out a home mortgage loan, and they loaned us the money to buy the home.  When we sell it back, we'll give them their money back."  Oh that's how it's done.  My parents [Ruby Watkins Harris and Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] had no equity in their house to get a home mortgage loan, so they couldn't loan us the money.  My wife's parents lived on East 36th Place off of State Street, they had very little equity in their home; and if you know that area, and--and--and my wife's family, they--her great-grandmother bought that house--great-grandparents I should say, bought that house in the 1890s, so they were old settlers in Chicago.  But they stayed in that house when people were moving out to what, Avalon section [Avalon Park] of Chicago, and what have you.  But they stayed in that house.  They, there were five generations that grew up in my wife's parent's home.  But we couldn't get any--borrow any money from them.  So look at the start that my colleagues were able to get in owning property that we were not able to get.
Story_ID: 650328
Speaker 1: What you're mentioning is, this is a historic swindle of black homeowners on the West Side that goes way back.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  So that also looking at the wealth gap, this is what basically influenced that wealth gap that we have today.  Because and I never will forget, the roof leaked on our house.  Well we had a two-story house.  We lived on the first level, my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] rented out the second level.  And the roof leaked.  So how do you get the roof repaired?  He can't go take out a home mortgage loan, right?
Speaker 1: 'Cause he doesn't have any equity.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So he knows someone who has a cousin who knows someone who knows supposedly how to repair a roof.  So he gets this guy.  He comes, repairs the roof.  Six months later, the roof is leaking again.  Now what does he do?  He's got to go to, and I don't know if you remember these--household finance corporation, where you basically pay mafia interest rates.  This is where he's got to go to get the money to re- I mean he's got good credit, he owns his own business [Heeled Bar (ph.), Chicago, Illinois], right.  But given where we start out, and the house on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] because other people are facing similar circumstances, the value of the house does not really appreciate as it might have.  The neighborhood is running down, right.  And so the circumstance that I come out of is one where again, I've had to work twice as hard to get half as far.  But I've learned; and so for our daughters when they bought their homes, two of them own homes, we took out loans because we got equity, had equity in our property, so that they would have a sufficient enough down payment, they wouldn't have to pay the personal mortgage insurance [sic. private mortgage insurance], PMI, which you don't pay off your mortgage that fast.  Now you see, I mean, if you've got a situation where you have--and I mean, you know, we have African Americans today who make as much as white Americans salary wise, college graduates, usually both husband and wife are working, but they have household income that's comparable to white household income, right.  But, what do they have to fall back on?  The wealth, the average white family has about $150 thousand in wealth.  The average--not counting their house, their cars, what have you.  The average black family has about ten thousand dollars in wealth.  My mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] had a small pension from her job.  She later worked for a printing company.  It's interesting as my [maternal] grandfather [Henry Watkins] once cleaned up a printing company.  But she had a small pension and she had social security.  Now, she didn't have that much social security.  My father basically had social security.  He maybe could have taken out some type of retirement, you know, package, but those things really weren't thought about that much.  So what I--the point I'm trying to make is individuals who like--with my children [Lisa Harris Robinson, Leslie Harris Anderson and Lauren Harris], I've got--and my wife [Anita Harris], we've got TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund], we've got Fidelity [Fidelity Investments].  If anything were to happen to us, our children would have an inheritance.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a different game today.
Story_ID: 650329
Speaker 1: We didn't have that.
Speaker 2: Right, when you were in probably--when you were at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], something was formed on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] called the Contract Buyers League.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: It was an organizing effort to get the banks to cease contract buying.  That's how it (unclear) (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 2: --the Contract Buyers League, it was a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it was a door knocking campaign.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Homeowners were, black homeowners were organized--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and they defeated the banks on the contract buying issue.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And it's in our archives, we interviewed some (unclear)--
Speaker 1: But I wanna make a point about this, this wealth gap.  Because this is something when you look at and many people are looking at the educational achievement gap today and trying to understand it; the gap in college gradua- college attendance, college graduation rates, this is where we can trace this back to that situation with the wealth gap.  Now fortunately, given that my wife [Anita Harris] and I are both college graduates, I have Ph.D. degree [from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]; and also my wife and I, I think we're fairly frugal.  I used to tell my students that I drove the same car for fifteen years while our kids were in college.  We were able to invest in our kids' education.  And so that helps to level the field for us, but if you don't have the money to invest in your children's education, if you don't have the money to keep your children in enrichment programs--our youngest daughter who is now, and I hope I'm not going too far ahead of the story here for you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You're going pretty far, but it's all right.
Speaker 1: Our youngest daughter [Lauren Harris] who's now a corporate attorney in Luxembourg, works for a major international law firm.  She's fluent in French, she's fluent in Portuguese.  She's study law for a year at the Sorbonne [University of Paris, Paris, France].  But she could--she was fluent in French by the time she graduated from high school.  Because I saw the applications of students applying to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], I served on the admissions committee.  I saw what was going on.  How these kids came in, and many of them did not have to take a language.  Now if you come in and you don't have to take a foreign language, then you can devote more attention to some of your other classes.  But if you come in, you gotta take a language, you've gotta take your--your science, your math, what have you, it makes it difficult for you.  Our middle daughter [Leslie Harris Alexander] who graduated in civil and environmental engineering, who also got a master's degree in civil and environmental engineering, I saw what was going on in the high schools in--in Ithaca [New York].  As you move up in the math courses, there are fewer and fewer girls in those math classes.  So we were able to send her to Mount Holyoke College [South Hadley, Massachusetts] for the summer, for the women in math program [Association for Women in Mathematics]--that helped to bolster her confidence in studying.  I say all of this to say, that if you don't have the resources for this kind of enrichment, you know, you don't catch up.
Story_ID: 650330
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I asked a question off camera, but I was asking about your neighborhood on the West Side.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the--now this had previously been a Jewish neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and as it became worn out, the residents went to Skokie [Illinois] you're telling me--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --basically and the African Americans moved in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And if from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong here, that most of the residents on--I mean the West Side is populated by the more recent arrivals in Chicago [Illinois] than the later--I mean the earlier ones settled on the South Side first--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then I think the latter wave, you know, moved right to the West Side.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, moved to the Near West Side and then to the Far West Side as housing was opening up on the far--and, and basically Lawndale area's [North Lawndale] sort of Far West Side of Chicago. ` So you lived at Avers [Avenue] and--
Speaker 1: Avers, 13th [Street], right--
Speaker 2: --and 13th.  Describe the house you lived in and the neighborhood; and what was it like culturally and so forth?
Speaker 1: Well, when we moved in there it was a very nice area.  One of the things we say, we knew the neighborhood had run down when the squirrels disappeared, but there were squirrels around.  It was clean, wasn't overcrowded as it later became, as some of the apartments were cut up and more people moved in.
Speaker 2: So what kind of house did you--I mean home did you live in?
Speaker 1: It was a two story building, and there were like three bedrooms on the first floor and then we also had a basement.  And there were three bedrooms on the second floor, and my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] rented out the second floor.  It was one of the ways of helping to pay, you know, for the--the property.  (Laughter) Also--
Speaker 2: Was it brick or?
Speaker 1: It was brick.  It had a coal burning furnace initially; and part of my job was to clean out the embers from the coal burning furnace.  And when we got an oil--oil burning furnace that was a great day 'cause I no longer--'cause we just had the coal delivered.  I mean I didn't do this earlier, but as I got older when I was in maybe sixth or seventh grade I had to tend the furnace.  But when we got an oil burning furnace, no longer had to get that coal delivered and take those coals out, and you know, what have you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what was the--so the neighborhood is primarily African American?
Speaker 1: Yes, well it transitioned, became predominantly African American.  Initially, it was a, it was a great area.
Story_ID: 650331
Speaker 1: The people who lived in the house before we purchased it left this buggy, it was like a twin buggy; and I used to go to the A and P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] on Saturday and I would deliver groceries.  And given that I had this twin buggy, I had this big--I mean most guys had the Red Flyer little wagon, I had this big buggy, put the groceries in, deliver them.
Speaker 2: So grocery delivery was kind of a job that the young boys, I mean boys would do in the neighborhood [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah you pick up a few dollars.  I mean, you know, you get fifty cents, a dollar maybe to go with the woman who had bought her groceries.  I mean these were black and white initially, but the neighborhood was, was pretty safe.  I also had two paper routes.  I--in a way in my family there was this go get them, entrepreneurial spirit.  And so I had two paper routes.  I delivered newspapers and at that time I delivered newspapers, I also picked up the money; you know, people paid each week for their newspaper.  Sometimes you'd get tips.  During the wintertime I would shovel snow, I'd go and I'd ask people, "You need me to shovel your--your sidewalk?"  I, later when I was in about, where was I, I was about seventh grade 'cause I--I started working for my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] in high school [St. Philip Basilica High School, Chicago, Illinois], or maybe eighth grade.  But I worked in this grocery store, I stocked the shelves and what have you in the grocery store.  And this was basically a Jewish neighborhood.  The store owners were Jewish.  There's one day of the year, I can't remember what it is where Jews are not supposed to handle any money.  And so when I first started working at this store, or maybe I told my mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] about this, because he wanted me, that, the guy who owned the grocery store, he wanted me to handle all the money that day.  But my--no, no, this--no, this was some--this was earlier when I first started working at the store, that's right.  When I first started working in the store my mother said to me, 'cause my mother also did what they call day work sometime, housework, cleaned up white folk's homes, which also created problems in her retirement because there was no social security taken out, you know, from her--her pay.  But my mother told me, she said, "Son, when you start working in that store," she said "maybe not the first day, but there's gonna be a day when he's gonna leave some money around you."  She said, "Don't touch it."  I was working for about three days and the guy--they lived in the back of the store.  He said he had to go to the restroom, and so he went to the back of the store to go to the restroom.  And so--let me also say, I should back up just a little bit, 'cause my mother said, "He's gonna leave some money around you, don't--don't touch it."  I said, "Oh, momma, what are you talking about?"  She said, "Boy," now I knew she's serious, she said, "don't touch any money."  So he goes to the washroom.  I look down by the cash register, there's a twenty dollar bill on the floor.  My mother's words are, you know.  I'm like afraid of that twenty dollar bill, I don't want to go near it.  And when he came back, I immediately said, "There's a twenty dollar bill on the floor."  He said, "Oh, it must've fallen from the cash register."  I passed his test.  And as I explain to students, I could've robbed the man blind after that.  See you know, it was Langston Hughes who talked about the ways of white folk ['The Ways of White Folks'].  We knew their ways more so than they knew our ways.  But that was an important lesson that my, my mother taught me.
Story_ID: 650332
Speaker 1: My mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] also was an organizer.  She organized a block club on our block on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois], tried to keep the block clean.  She was very much involved in politics.  She was a poll watcher; and in the basement of our house is where they used to have the precinct, the elections.  And so I became interested in--in politics as well.
Speaker 2: Do you remember who your alderman was in those days or who the?
Speaker 1: Yes, Alderman John Lewis [sic. Benjamin F. Lewis] who was murdered in his office because he was becoming a little too independent for the political machine.
Speaker 2: This was a black alderman?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I explained to students that one year we elected a dead white man to [U.S.] Congress over a very much alive black woman.  In the Democratic primary, you know, whoever wins the Democratic primary is tantamount to the election.  And I can't remember--
Speaker 2: Right 'cause there're no Republicans on the city council [Chicago City Council] at all?
Speaker 1: Well there were some.
Speaker 2: Very few.
Speaker 1: But very few.  And cannot remember her name now.  But she was running for Congress.  And I mean the machine, the Daley machine.  This was Richard J. Daley, the father, not Richard M. Daley, the more recent Daley mayor.  They--they ran.  And also I mean during election time on the West Side of Chicago, all of a sudden the garbage was picked up the week before the election, the streets were clean; and when you were getting ready to go to the polls, the precinct captain, I mean you know, you couldn't, it was against the law to be right near the poll, but the precinct captain would see you on the way to--to go to the polls and would shake your hand and slip five dollar bill in your palm.  Now you know pull lever A, Democrat.  And you know, was really the, and I'm probably again going ahead of the story here, the assassination of Fred Hampton on the West Side of Chicago (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 650333
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lawndale area [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois], let me just say that, you know, as it began to change over you did begin to get the street gangs.  You got the Vice Lords, the Egyptian Cobras.
Speaker 2: Did they emerge when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  In fact, the--one of the war lords for the Vice Lords lived on our block.  One of the vice presidents of the Egyptian Cobras lived on our block.  I knew them, I grew up with these guys.  And so there was never much pressure on me to join the gang.
Speaker 2: Now did you start off in a Catholic school?
Speaker 1: Yes, and went all the way through.
Speaker 2: All the way through, okay.  So you never went to public schools.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: What were the public schools in your neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Well, I can't remember.  Only thing I remember is Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] because they won the state basketball championship in, what, about '57 [sic. 1958] I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Marshall's a huge high school--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with, I think they have like, what four thousand students, something like that.
Speaker 1: But they had some great basketball players.  And that's one of the things I wanted to do, I wanted to play basketball in the worst way.  But as I explain to students, the more I practiced I got diminishing returns; I was not getting any better.  And so I devoted my attention to my books.  And the guys that I grew up with, as I say, there was never any pressure on me to join the gangs.  In fact, there were some activities I knew that they were involved in, some drug activity.  I mean just like with the basketball players, they--basketball players could not be involved in any of that drug activity.  They knew that I was doing well in school and they, in a way, protected me.  I mean there was no such thing as doing well in school acting white.  I mean I don't know where this--this came from.  In fact the guys on--in my neighborhood they wanted me to do well in school.  They wanted me to go to college.  They wanted me to become a lawyer so I could come back and defend them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So this is--yeah.  So now I was gonna ask you why they deferred you, but you--but they--okay.  Now I--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They respected, they respected me.  In fact, off of the West Side of Chicago [Illinois], one block ahead of me on--we--we were at 13th [Street]--at 12th [Street] and Avers [Avenue] you've interviewed Robert Starks [HistoryMaker Robert T. Starks] who grew up in that neighborhood.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Both of us came out, same neighborhood, went to college, became college professors.
Speaker 2: Now was Better Boys Foundation in operation in those days, or?
Speaker 1: Yes.  We went to the Boys' Brotherhood Republic [Chicago, Illinois], BBR, I think it was called.  There was also the Off the Street Club.  And these were groups for a time.  There was the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] I went to, the Sears YMCA.  'Cause Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] had a large warehouse on the West Side of Chicago before the riots in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  But yeah, there were boys clubs around.  I went to--well to say one of the boys clubs we had, I remember being involved some of the crafts program, also taking up boxing, I mean I wanted to be, you know.  Well, you know, a lot of us wanted to be like Sugar Ray Robinson and Joe Louis was passed at, at this point, but yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So this is--did you ever go to the summer camp, Union League [Union League Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --camp?  Okay.
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 650334
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your school, your Catholic school?
Speaker 2: St. Finbarr grammar school [St. Finbarr School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: St. Finbarr (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) F-I-N-B-A-R-R--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I went to for elementary school.  And it was a small--well that was after we moved over to Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois].  Before that I went to a Catholic school on the Near West Side [Chicago, Illinois], St. Malachy [St. Malachy School] until about third grade.  In fourth grade we moved over to Lawndale, and I went to St. Finbarr.  It was a small--
Speaker 1: I'd heard of St. Malachy, but--
Speaker 2: --yeah, it's on the Near West Side.
Speaker 1: Yeah, St. Finbarr, it's not in existence anymore?
Speaker 2: No, no longer.  It was a small school and they had double classes.  So you would have the fourth, fifth grade together, how did it go, fifth-sixth, yeah, third-fourth; you would have those classes together.  So if you were in the fifth grade you were also listening to the lessons that the kids in sixth grade were getting.  And so my sister, my sister, Sharon [Sharon Harris Reed], she was able to skip a grade because of the--them having these double grade classes.  And I guess I picked up some things, but I was never as serious a student as she was.  She was just a fast learner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you seem to be a very studious person, serious person in a lot of ways, I mean, and, but so--
Speaker 2: Well, we gave the nuns fits.  I mean, you know, there were times when--we just--well some of it was boredom too, you know, in--in--in--in school.  But I did very well in elementary school.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject, was it history?
Speaker 2: History, history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: History.  See I've got this--this--this essay in sixth grade, I wanna be a history teacher.  And my expectation was that I would be basically a high school history teacher.  I mean I didn't think about going beyond, I mean because my parents [Ruby Watkins Harris and Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] did not graduate--I mean my parents did not go to college.  In fact, my parents really did not graduate from high school.  And so in my family to graduate from college, you know, it was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Did you have a good history teacher in grade school?
Speaker 2: Chicago Defender.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The--'Your History' ['Your History: From the Beginning of Time to the Present'] by J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers].
Speaker 2: J.A. Rogers.
Speaker 1: You talked about your [maternal] grandfather [Henry Watkins] bringing--?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, he talked a lot about--I mean because they studied, I mean as I say he only went to about the sixth grade, you know, but they learned black history when he was in school.
Speaker 1: Now was Mr. Hammurabi [Frederic H. Hammurabi Robb], I mean as far--did you encounter him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black cultural historians around the neighborhood or that sort of thing in those days (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, the--well in--in our neighborhood, there was, I can't think of his name now, he did the sculpture piece of Jean Point Baptiste du Sable [sic. Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]--
Speaker 1: Oh you're referring to Marion Perkins, I guess is that it?
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Marion Perkins, the sculptor, or?
Speaker 2: But--yeah he did--he lived and you know, we visited his house, and he talked to us a bit about the African American past.  But I also read books.  The nuns, of course, I mean I was, I think, pretty bright student, and the nuns thought I should become a priest.  So I remember it was probably about fifth grade, the nuns gave me--one of the nuns gave me this biography of--now I'm--Bishop Healy [James Augustine Healy] who was African American, first black bishop, although he was very fair skinned, first black bishop in the United States.  He was a bishop in Maine, I believe.  His brother [Patrick Francis Healy], if I'm getting these names correct, became president of Georgetown University [Washington, D.C.].  They were both priests, and of African ancestry.  I mean, one of them probably passed for white.  But the nuns gave me this biography, that was supposed to inspire me, you know.  I read the biography, and also became a little more curious.  I would go to the library; I'd get out books on Frederick Douglass, for example.  I, I was a pretty avid reader.  And so that, you know, was part of the interest I, I had in history.
Story_ID: 650335
Speaker 1: So in high school, and, and we shot a picture earlier of your declaration to become a historian--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the sixth grade and your beautiful handwriting--
Speaker 2: Oh thank you.
Speaker 1: --where you describe, you know, your aspiration why.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is--so when you went on to high school, now did you go to Catholic high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to St. Philip's High School [St. Philip Basilica High School], which was there on the West Side of, of Chicago [Illinois].  And I never will forget the priest, the pastor, of our church of St. Finbarr [St. Finbarr School, Chicago, Illinois] saying to me, "Now you go and show those white boys what you could do."  And--
Speaker 1: Now this is a white priest?
Speaker 2: White priest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was, you know, we were tested for high school.  And I was placed in--in our high school they went from like 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E I think.  I was placed in 1B; and after the first marking period, I had the highest grade point average in 1B.  And it was interesting I, I, I thought, I had these guys who came up--you know, 'cause they knew who had the highest grade point average in the class.  And they came up to me and they, "How did you do it?"   I mean, I, I really think that the implication was I must've cheated on the test, which I didn't, you know.  I did well on the test.  So they moved me into 1A, the highest class now.  And so the competition is a little greater.  But I still graduated about, there were about thirty of us.  I think I graduated number twelve, you know, when I--when I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any high school teachers that were like, you'd consider like mentors or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I cannot remember his name now.  I--yeah, let me--let me share a little story with you.  You know I wanted to be an athlete to play basketball, I wore glasses, played basketball.  I went out with the football team, I weighed about 130 pounds dripping wet.  This guy who weighed 280 pounds tackled me--I wanted to be a split end, he tackled me, I said unh-uh, football is not for me (laughter).  So I went and I joined the chess club.  I wrote for the school newspaper.  I later became copy editor of the school yearbook.  I was in the glee club.  But I was also on the debating team.  And why can't I think now, because he in many ways en- en- encouraged us.  He was a lay teacher.  He was a lawyer, he was teaching at the high school.  I think he practiced law on the side as well.  But there were--I mean there weren't that many black students in the high school.  I was the only black student when--there were two of us in 1B, when I went to 1A, I was the only black student in 1A.  But there were three of us on this high school debate team--three African American students.  That's what I say, he kind of encouraged us.  And you know, I, I got my varsity letters in debate.  I don't know why, I should remember his name, and I don't.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the topics you debated that you?
Speaker 2: Oh I, I don't remember now.  Because I, you know, you had the affirmative, you had the negative.  And I usually debated the, the negative.  The other team would debate the proposition: we should--A, B, C.  And then my team would come along and we would say why we should not do A, B, C.  They were usually very well prepared.  We had to think more on our feet when we were taking the opposing side.
Story_ID: 650336
Speaker 1: Now this is a time when you're in school, I think you were ten in the fifth grade in '54 [1954] when the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision, Brown versus the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka] was passed.  Did your--I know your mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] was active in the block club and that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] was down in the LaSalle Street area with a lot of information flowing back and forth--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your [maternal] grandfather [Henry Watkins] reading the paper.  Did your family discuss the civil rights issues of the day, and?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean, the only thing I remember, and of course this would've been 1955, and everybody in Chicago [Illinois]: Emmett Till.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: In fact, we used to, as many African American families would do during the summer, we would go south.  And--
Speaker 1: So did you go to Mississippi during the (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah during the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you, now this is--this has come up in the discussion of Emmett Till.  What instruction would you get about behavior in Mississippi before you went down south?
Speaker 2: I really didn't get any.  And there was an incident where my paternal grandmother [Primrose Harris] sent my cousin and I to the store, I was a year older than my cousin.  Now at this time I would've been about eleven I think.  Because Emmett Till was fourteen when he was murdered, and I was twelve; so I would've been eleven.  And this is the summer before Emmett Till's lynching.  But my grandmother sent us to the grocery store, and she gave me the money because I was old- a year older than my, my cousin, and she wanted us to buy a pound of bologna.  And so went into the store, white man behind the counter and he said, "What you want, boy?"  I said, "A pound of bologna."  He looked at me, he said, "What you say, boy?"  I thought the man didn't hear that well.  I said--I shouted it, "A pound of bologna."  He said, "Boy, you must not be from these parts, if you don't say, 'Sir,' you're not gonna get anything, and you'll be glad to get out of here alive."  That was--because normally when we went to the South everything was self contained.  There was a movie theater in the little town that my parents grew up in [Hattiesburg, Mississippi].  We didn't really--I, I had an uncle who drove a taxi cab so we didn't have to take public transportation.  We did go sometimes downtown to the five and ten store, some--but I mean, my aunt--great aunt [Pearl Mayweather (ph.)] who raised my mother was an excellent cook, we didn't think about buying anything to eat while we were--you know.  So I didn't really encounter segregation, but now after Emmett Till's assassination when I became twelve, and I never really thought about it that much.  But my sisters [Sharon Harris Reed and Sandra Harris Carter] could go south; I couldn't.
Story_ID: 650337
Speaker 1: We were talking about Emmett Till and I was gonna ask you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --wha- do you remember what you were doing when you first heard about that, or how you found out?
Speaker 2: I--I--I--the only recollection I really have is the cover of the Jet magazine.  And of course there were a lot of people in Chicago [Illinois], given that Emmett Till is from Chicago, who were talking about, you know, this horrible, horrible lynching; and people who wanted to visit the coffin of Emmett Till. But--
Speaker 1: 'Cause the funeral was held in Chicago, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And open casket?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: It was held at--do you remember?
Speaker 2: It may have been at Rayner's [A.A. Rayner and Sons Funeral Home, Chicago, Illinois], I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Sammy Rayner's [A.A. "Sammy" Rayner, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: On 71st [Street] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Calumet [Avenue], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you go to?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But you said that your parents [Ruby Watkins Harris and Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, you know, I heard people talking about it, but after that--and there wasn't really much discussion about my not going south, but my sisters [Sharon Harris Reed and Sandra Harris Carter] continued to go south for the summer and I didn't.
Story_ID: 650338
Speaker 1: As you're in, you're in high school [St. Philip Basilica High School, Chicago, Illinois] and you were describing all your activities in high school with the paper and doing things, so you still, you still were convinced you were gonna be a historian in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  That was my, my favorite subject.  I always did well and I did well in United States history, in European history.  I--I--I think I know why, it was Emmett Till's assassination, but also about that time I was probably beginning to work in my father's [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] shoe repair shop [Heeled Bar (ph.), Chicago, Illinois] and so didn't go south for the--for the summer, so my sisters [Sharon Harris Reed and Sandra Harris Carter] did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  There's--let's see--so did you get a chance to write any or do any kind of historical research while in high school?
Speaker 2: No.  I had a regular column that I was--I be- in fact, I was looking back 'cause I've deposited my papers at Cornell University archives [Ithaca, New York], and I have back copies of the high school papers, all the issues that I wrote in, as well as high school yearbooks which I've put in the--with my papers.  But I started as a reporter; and then I became a feature writer.  And as a feature writer, I basically wrote about activities that individuals were involved in, in the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Were they--or I'm gonna ask you this question, I'll ask it about every profession pretty much, but did you know any, other than Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers], did you know of any other black historians?
Speaker 2: No, I, I really didn't.  I wanted to be a history teacher.  I wasn't thinking so much about being a, a historian.  I wasn't thinking about writing history myself at this time.
Story_ID: 650339
Speaker 1: Now I didn't ask you this, but was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, well I mean I had to go to Mass every Sunday.  When I visited my [maternal] great-grandmother [Dorcia Davis] on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], and the church is still there, now on King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], Morning Star Baptist Church [Morning Star Baptist Church of Chicago], I had to go there as well.  I had to go to two services: Catholic church and to the Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it didn't have any kind of--I mean, what effect did going to church to have on you?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that a sense of, of morality was something, I mean especially within the Catholic church, you know.  That was probably the major issue.
Speaker 1: Were there any, I know in some cities, I know in my hometown there's an organization of black Catholics that had identified certain black saints in the Catholic church and that sort of thing, did you, were you exposed to any of that?
Speaker 2: No, I--I knew about the--well he was called at that time Blessed Martin de Porres, who's, later became St. Martin de Porres.  I knew about him, but that was--and the Healy brothers [James Augustine Healy and Patrick Francis Healy] as I mentioned; but that was about it.
Story_ID: 650340
Speaker 1: In terms of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History [Association for the Study of Negro Life and History; Association for the Study of African American Life and History], you know, Carter G. Woodson, you know, founded Negro History Week [Black History Month] there in Chicago [Illinois].  Did you know any--about any of the members of the association, or about the association when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Not while I was in high school, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So when you're thinking about going to college, this, you graduate from high school in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were you thinking about in terms of college?  Did you think that you would go to a black college [HBCU], or?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't really know that much about college.  I did have this cousin who was at Clark College [Clark Atlanta University] in Atlanta University--I mean Atlanta, Georgia.  And all I knew was that I wanted to go to college; and a friend of mine and I, we decided we're gonna go and enroll at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have any counseling in high school about college?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  And this is a sore point between me and my wife [Anita Harris] 'cause she said, "You were smart enough, you should've been able, you know, to find out about college you--yourself."  My wife is--is very bright, she did very well on the SAT exam.  She was offered a scholarship to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], now this is back in 1960 when--I mean this is before they were recruiting African American students, but her parents couldn't afford to send her to Northwestern, so she went to Roosevelt.  And even though, I mean, my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.], you know, owned his own business, shoe repair shop [Heeled Bar (ph.), Chicago, Illinois], he did well, but I mean there was no thought of my going away; and the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] at that time was not really recruiting African American students.  Most of the kids in my high school, that's the other thing I guess, maybe I resisted this a little bit, they were going to either Loyola University in Chicago [Loyola University Chicago], or DePaul University [Chicago, Illinois], and I decided by the time I finished high school I had enough Catholic education--that was it for me.  And so that's why I looked at, at Roosevelt University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know any of the students there already?
Speaker 2: At Roosevelt?  No.  There was this friend of mine, we both graduated from St. Philip's High School [St. Philip Basilica High School, Chicago, Illinois]; he and I went at the same time and signed up to go to Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650341
Speaker 1: Well, what was it like?  Now this is in the fall immediately after high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  This is the fall of '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: So you're a freshman--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  And now Roosevelt's the school that Harold Washington graduated from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Gus Savage, a generation ahead of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was it like when you get there, and?
Speaker 2: Well, as I look back on it, at the time I didn't give that much thought to it.  But we had wonderful teachers.  I had my introduction to political science from Charles Hamilton [Charles V. Hamilton] at Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: Now he--well tell us, he's the author of--?
Speaker 2: 'Black Power' ['Black Power: The Politics of Liberation'], he was writing that book (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the time when I was a--probably when I was a senior.  No, no, no, he was writing that book when I was a master's degree student at Roosevelt.  But it was Charles Hamilton, there was [HistoryMaker] Hollis Lynch from whom I took an African American history course.
Speaker 1: He wrote the biography of Edward Wilmot Blyden ['Edward Wilmot Blyden: Pan-Negro Patriot, 1832-1912,' Hollis R. Lynch].
Speaker 2: Edward Wilmot Blyden, right, yeah, Hollis Lynch.  There was Lorenzo D. Turner, 'Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect.'  There was--and come on, why am I dropping the name right now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lorenzo Dow Turner.
Speaker 2: Who did the book on--St. Clair Drake was there at Roosevelt.  I mean you had these wonderful teaching--teachers there and a wonderful student body.  I mean, John Bracey [John H. Bracey, Jr.] was there; Darlene Clark Hine was there; Lamont Yeakey who teaches now out at Cal State L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] was there.  Juliet E.K. Walker who teaches at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] was at Roosevelt.  It's a very vibrant intellectual community there at Roosevelt.  And again as I talk to students, I learned as much outside of the class as I did in--in class.  In the cafeteria, someone would be--we would be talking, someone would say, "Well did you read--read 'Wretched of the Earth' ['The Wretched of the Earth,' Franz Fanon]?"  "No, I haven't read 'Wretched of the Earth.'"  So I got to go out and buy 'Wretched of the Earth' so I can read it and be in the conversation the next day, you know.  So, you have these kinds of discussion- I mean just--just--just alive intellectually.  And now there is one person who I remember very clearly, I mentioned a number of African American faculty who were there, but there was a white historian, taught U.S. history named Paul Johnson who--I was just fascinated by him.  The first day of class he had a writing pad, you know, a legal pad, there are about forty of us in the class and we're seating--sitting in rows about eight to a row, five rows, okay.  He takes this pad, he said, "Now I want you each to sign your name, you know, by the rows--do that."  So we signed our names.  He took the pad, he looked at it and he said, "Uh-huh, uh-huh," he put the pad on the side, he said, "And your name is So and So, your name is So--," he had memorized--he had a photographic memory.  He remembered everybody.  You know, I thought maybe there was a secret to this, and that the more history I studied the more I might be able to do something like that, no, something I joke with my students about.  But anyway, I was just fascinated by his command of the field; and as I say, he had like a photographic memory, his memory, and so.
Story_ID: 650342
Speaker 1: Did he teach U.S. history in a conventional manner, I mean in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--it was lecture.  I mean at that time basically in the early '60s [1960s] it was just--I mean [HistoryMaker] Hollis Lynch basically lectured, you know.  What's his--well St. Clair Drake, although we used to watch St. Clair Drake--'cause he was a chain smoker.  And he would take a cigarette and--and he would get down and he would light another cigarette.  And we were always looking because we're wondering is he gonna burn his fingers with that cigarette.  But it would get there and I guess he felt it, then he'd pull out another cigarette and light it and keep smoking, you know, like a train (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He never stopped smoking, huh, just?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: He never stopped smoking?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, he just--throughout his lecture.  Now I don't know, maybe it was a nervous habit, although he did cause a fire once in his office at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], you know.
Speaker 1: That's amazing, I mean to think now on those days when professors actually smoked in the classroom.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But Roosevelt had these outstanding African American faculty before St. Clair Drake was stolen off by Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]; Hollis Lynch by Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]; I just called his name--
Speaker 1: Hamilton?
Speaker 2: Charles Hamilton [Charles V. Hamilton] by Columbia, you know, fascinating, fascinating.  We got a wonderful education there.  And, and we had people who were there because they wanted to teach too.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And there was no, I mean University of Illinois, as I say, you know, Champaign [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], it was a while before they began to recruit black students.  You could go to what was called Navy Pier for two years.
Speaker 1: That's where the Circle campus [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago] was?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where it got started.
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: You go there for two years.  But that was--that was it.  I mean other than going to Loyola [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] or DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois], I mean Roosevelt--.  And Roosevelt is just a wonderful opportunity, wonderful.  I mean, you know, Roosevelt got started because of a quota against the number of black students they would admit, the number of Jewish students they would admit to the Central YMCA College [Chicago, Illinois].  And so you had these faculty who left Central YMCA College and started Roosevelt University.  So it was a very progressive school; and we all got along with each other, I mean, you know.  The student interaction--white students, black students, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So did you have a favorite instructor of these?
Speaker 2: Well, Paul Johnson.
Speaker 1: Paul Johnson was.
Speaker 2: I mean of all of them.  I loved Charles Hamilton because I was very much interested in politics, but Paul Johnson taught history, U.S. history.  And--and that was my--my--my first love.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any exposure to African history at this point?
Speaker 2: No, I heard--I mean, through St. Clair Drake a little bit about African anthropology; but no, I didn't have that much exposure to African history.
Story_ID: 650343
Speaker 1: So you were working in your father's [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] shop [Heeled Bar (ph.), Chicago, Illinois] and going to school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and basically was that your experience for the first four years, just?
Speaker 2: Working and--and yeah, going to school.  And then also I pledged fraternity while I was an undergraduate at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  I pledged Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Now this is significant because you've become the historian of A Phi A?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now the historian in those days was--
Speaker 2: Charles H. Wesley, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's right, the colleague of Carter G. Woodson.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you ever meet Dr. Wesley?
Speaker 2: Oh yes indeed, yes indeed.  In fact, I spoke at a memorial service for Dr. Wesley, yeah.
Speaker 1: So in those days though did you come across him any?
Speaker 2: When I was--no.  I--while I was an undergraduate I came across [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin.  John Hope Franklin was teaching at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]; and he came to the Alpha house in Chicago [Illinois] and gave a talk for Founders' Day.  And you know, you begin thinking.  When I started college, I wanted to be a high school history teacher.  And here's this distinguished historian, Dr. John Hope Franklin, so I began to get a few inklings, you know, maybe I might wanna think about being a college or university teacher, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these doors are opening slowly, and you're getting a peak--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of what's--what the possibilities are?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what was--now 'From Slavery to Freedom' ['From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African Americans,' John Hope Franklin] had been published by this time--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and what--was it used in Roosevelt at all in the classroom?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to recall.  Yes, I--I--yeah, because I read it in college as an undergraduate.  I mean that was the Bible, so to speak, I mean it was the major source for African American history.  Although I must say, at this time I had an interest in African American history, I also had the interest in U.S. history.  And of course, you know, preparing to be a high school history teacher I was going to teach U.S. history.  And so my focus, even though I took some courses on African American history, my focus was on U.S. history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is--I believe in '61 [1961]--now did you have a black bookstore that you attended in Chicago?  I mean or that you knew about it in those days in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: I know at one time Hammurabi [Frederic H. Hammurabi Robb] had one, but I don't know if you?
Speaker 2: --yeah.  No, no.  I'm trying to recall, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you went to the bookstore, say if you went to get 'Wretched of the Earth' ['The Wretched of the Earth,' Franz Fanon], where would you go?
Speaker 2: Well, I went the Roosevelt University bookstore, or I'm trying to think where else would I--would I--that was basically it.  I mean there were a number of book shops, you know, downtown Chicago.  But I didn't go to one of the black bookstores at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now I know [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett was--no he hadn't put out, no that hadn't come out yet, that's right.  From--'Before the Mayflower' ['Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America'] hadn't been released yet.
Speaker 2: Well, of course I read those installments in Ebony magazine, and then basically those installments were there before 'Before the Mayflower' was published.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you know about--through Roosevelt did you find out about any of the black history organizations, or--in Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, I really, I really didn't know about those organizations at that time.  I did later learn about, but I think that was maybe when I was--was I an undergraduate or a master's degree student?  I learned about The Amistad Society and attended a couple of their meetings.
Story_ID: 650344
Speaker 1: You're in undergrad school from '61 [1961] to '65 [1965], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, slight detour (laughter).  In '64 [1964] I got married, and so that delayed me a year.  So I get my--I got my bachelor's degree in 1966, should've gotten it in '65 [1965].  But there was something that happened, I just wanna share this with you too.  While I was at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], there was a Woolworth's department store [F.W. Woolworth Company] downtown on State Street in Chicago [Illinois].  And this would've been in 1960, right, yeah, 1960.  Wow, I must've been in high school [St. Philip Basilica High School, Chicago, Illinois] then.  Because I'm trying to think, it was when the sit in movement took place.  This was in 1960 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh well, yeah, the sit in movement started in--I mean the college sit in movement started in 1960, yeah in Carolina, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This--this--this would've been, so I would've been in high school at this point.  And I remember going, and I wanted to buy something at the Woolworths store.  And they were picketing in front and I didn't know what was going on, you know.  Don't shop at Woolworths, support the sit in.  It's like, and I'm thinking why they picketing Woolworths here in Chicago.  I can go in there, I can sit at the lunch counter, I can buy whatever I want to, to buy, you know.  And, but something said to me, don't cross that picket line, and so I didn't.  And then I started becoming, wondering why are they picketing Woolworths in Chicago?  And I began to read more about the sit ins, and learn, really I began to learn more about what was taking place in the South with the Civil Rights Movement at that point.  But it was something, I mentioned to students because that picket raised my consciousness.  Had they not been picketing, you know, would I have encountered the Civil Rights Movement in the--in the same way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, of course they were picketing because Woolworths is a national chain--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --and they allowed segregation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, but I'm saying why are they picketing here, we can go into Woolworth's, we can sit at the lunch counter; you know, I had to get an understanding of the whole notion of solidarity and support.
Speaker 1: Now did you attend the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  I had just been initiated into the fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]--well, several months before the March on Washington.  There were a number of individuals in the chapter [Theta Chapter] who were going to the March on Washington.  There was a lot of conversation, discussion about that.  I was sort of recovering from my initiation, I was working, I should say on looking at, at my grades.  I was dating my wife [Anita Harris] at that time, '63 [1963], yeah, we got married in '64 [1964].  I, quite frankly, had reservations about the March on Washington.  What is this going to do, you know.  People gathering in Washington, D.C.--I wasn't too sure about that.  Now I did belong to CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] while I was in--in college.  And was involved in some of the demonstrations, o- well this was before Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], the open housing demonstrations.  But some of the demonstration against slum landlords and things of that sort, I was involved in with CORE.
Speaker 1: Did you know James Cage, of Chicago?  Who was--
Speaker 2: No I didn't.
Speaker 1: --I know he was supposed to be in CORE, but I wasn't around when he was.
Speaker 2: I wish I had--had a chance to meet [HistoryMaker] James Forman, you know, who went to Roosevelt and who dropped out of Roosevelt and went south for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC].  And ironically, James Forman later worked on a master's degree at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York]; and I chaired his master's thesis committee.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I met him at The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He actually helped with mailings at The HistoryMakers, I don't understand why, but he was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --very interesting man.
Speaker 2: Yes indeed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes indeed.  He had a rough patch, but I think we kind of helped him as he worked on this master's degree at Cornell, get himself back on his feet.
Story_ID: 650345
Speaker 1: Well you met, you did tell us how you met your wife [Anita Harris], before you, you met her at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I met her at Roosevelt.  I was, at this point, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, she was pledging Delta Sigma Theta Sorority; and we met at a party that--in fact she was pledging, the Deltas giving this party and I met her at that party.  And I was attracted to her and asked her for her phone number and she didn't want to give it to me (laughter).  And I kind of persisted.  Because of the a- my wife's two years older than I am.  My mother [Ruby Watkins Harris] was a year older than my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.].  My wife's two years older than I am.  She has a sister, we're the same age.  She tried to interest me and I wasn't interested in her sister, I was interested in her.  Then so, as we start talking to each other and dating; and my mother said she knew something was going on because--my wife and I, we opened a joint savings account 'cause we were thinking, you know, at some point we might get married.
Speaker 1: So you did this before you got married?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we opened a joint savings account while we're at Roosevelt.  And we would make lunch for each other.  I mean one day I would make lunch for the two of us, another day she'd make--my mother said something's going on.  And you have to know how--my mother, you know, being from the older generation, said, "He's making lunch for that girl, something's going on," you know.
Speaker 1: I think I would think something's going on.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And so we would go out in front of Roosevelt, Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois], sit, have lunch together, talk.  I mean we--we could talk for hours almost, you know.  And that was the other thing, my mother said, "He's on the phone all the time with that girl," you know, she called her that girl.  So, yeah, we--
Speaker 1: One of the things about Roosevelt we haven't mentioned is the setting of Roosevelt.  People would--
Speaker 2: Oh, beautiful.
Speaker 1: --you've got Grant Park; you've got the lake [Lake Michigan] beyond--
Speaker 2: Yeah, beautiful.  I mean, the facility, the physical plant wasn't that great.  The classrooms weren't that great, the library wasn't that great.  But the intellectual activity that was taking place there was great.  And as you say, you've got Buckingham Fountain there, you've got Grant Park, the lake; yeah, wonderful place.
Story_ID: 650346
Speaker 1: So anyway, you're in this beautiful setting and you get married [to Anita Harris].  And so, now I take it your grades are good at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, they got better after I got married, let me say that.  And after I got married--well, I'd been very active in Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.  In 1964, I was president of the undergraduate chapter in Chicago [Illinois], Theta Chapter.  Also in 1965, before I got married, I was elected to a national office as mis- midwestern assistant vice president.  So I was very active with the--the fraternity.  And after I got married, I continued to work on my bachelor's degree, as I say my grades improved, maybe a little more stability to my life.  And later in 1965, we had--see I got married in '64 [1964]; in '65 [1965] we had our first child [Lisa Harris Robinson] and now I gotta think about, you know, not thinking that much about the future beforehand, but now I've gotta think more about the future.  And when we got married in '64 [1964], my mother in law told me about the Catholic church, Catholic schools, you didn't have to have a bachelor's degree to teach in the Catholic schools.  So I was able to teach, I'd finished three years of college by that time.  I was able to teach in the Catholic schools while continuing into my senior--my last year of college.  So I--I began teaching in '65 [1965] and finished in--in '66 [1966], right.  So I taught at St. Rita elementary school [St. Rita School] on the Southwest Side of Chicago.  So I taught there for a year, got my bachelor's degree, and given that I had started teaching there, I decided I was gonna go on for a master's degree.  Because on a high school or on a teacher's salary at that point I figured I'm not gonna be able to really support my family as I would like to.  And plus I--this fascination with history, I wanted to continue to study.  So I stayed at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois]; and Roosevelt was, you know, you, you could study full time at Roosevelt, going--taking classes in the evening.  So I taught sixth grade during the day, took classes in the evening.  Over a two year period from '66 [1966] to '68 [1968], I was able to finish my master's degree at Roosevelt.  Also at Roosevelt, there was a, a faculty member, her name was Elizabeth Balenoff [ph.] who--actually she studied with [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]; and she asked me, you know, "Have you considered going--," 'cause I hadn't thought about going on for a Ph.D. degree.
Story_ID: 650347
Speaker 1: One step at a time: bachelor's degree, master's degree, "Have you thought about Ph.D. degree?"  I gave it some, some thought, but also in 1968 when I was finishing my master's degree [at Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], of course April 4th, 1968, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Now that raised another--I don't mean to cut you--but we were talking earlier about Dr. King living in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and he was very close to your family, right?
Speaker 1: He lived nearby.
Speaker 2: --66th [Street]--nearby.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were about three blocks from where he lived when he came to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Did you get a chance to hear him speak when he was?
Speaker 1: I heard him speak, but this was when my wife [Anita Harris] and I went to Soldier Field [Chicago, Illinois]; and also I heard him speak at one of the churches, can't remember which church it was at now.  Because my wife and I, we--I mean this was 1966, '67 [1967] when we participated in some of those demonstrations.  I should back up a step.  When I taught at St. Rita elementary school [St. Rita School, Chicago, Illinois] I was the only black person in the school--this was an all-white school in Gage Park [Chicago, Illinois], okay.  When Dr. King marched, held the demonstrations in Chicago, there was a march through Gage Park, and my wife and I participated in that demonstration.  And I got along very well in the elementary school, the Catholic school, St. Rita that I taught in.  The kids supposedly loved me.  The parents supposedly loved me.  But when we marched through Gage Park, some of the parents of the very kids that I taught were shouting racial epithets.  They hadn't singled me out specifically, but they were shouting these racial epithets, they were throwing things at us.  And when I went back to school there in the fall of 1967, I did have some parents who say--and I don't know if they really held this against me, but they say, "I saw you in the--in the march, you know."  I said yes, okay.  But after Dr. King's assassination, I saw this ad in the newspaper, the student newspaper of Roosevelt [The Torch] said, "Come teach a brother."  And I mean, they've killed--you know, this had a traumatic effect on a number--.  They killed Dr. King.  I'm teaching in this white school.  I'm gonna go south and teach in a historically black college [HBCU].  And so that's when I went to Miles College in Birmingham, Alabama [Fairfield, Alabama] to teach there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now did you have your master's at that point?
Speaker 1: I was getting, I was finishing up my master's degree.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But just before we--
Speaker 1: And so by--by the time I get--got to Miles I had the master's degree.
Story_ID: 650348
Speaker 1: Before we get you to Miles [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama], what was your thesis about; and, and who was your advisor?
Speaker 2: A person by the name of Donald Bluestone [Donald M. Bluestone] who was also very inspiring as a faculty member there at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  And I wrote my master's thesis on land for the freedmen during Reconstruction.  As I began to study history--as I began to study African American history in particular, as we're at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, I know that there was a Civil Rights Act in 1875 [Civil Rights Act of 1875].  Why are we talking about another Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964]?  Why are we going through--I'm--it's a question in my mind.  Why are we going through this all over again?  Maybe if African Americans had acquired land during the Reconstruction period, the whole forty acres and a mule which some see as a myth, but really wasn't a myth, there was some substance to that.
Speaker 1: But did anyone ever get it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  In fact, there was what's called General Sherman's [William Tecumseh Sherman] field order no. 15 [Special Field Order No. 15], which set aside on the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, plots of land of forty acres each.  We got in a number of places forty acres, we never got the mule, but we got the forty acres.  And then, it spread among African Americans in the South that they were going to get forty a- they believed they were gonna get forty acres and a mu- after all, they had worked all of these years, their unrequited toil, you know.  They thought they were gonna get something.  They were gonna be compensated for those years of enslavement.  And there was also the--there was a land grant act that was passed in 1866 [Southern Homestead Act of 1866] that set aside parcels of land.  They were able to get some land from that land grant act.  So African Americans were able to secure some land in the South during the Reconstruction period, but then they lost it.  And so I was looking to see if--and, and, and I was being influenced by [President] Thomas Jefferson's idea of the yeoman landowner [yeoman farmer] as being the foundation of American democracy.  And so I thought if African Americans had been able to acquire land that they then would've been able to hold on to their rights as citizens of the United States--the right to vote, to hold office, that these things would not have been taken away from them as they were during the late 19th, early 20th century.  I even thought maybe if African Americans had become landowners, the whole thing of segregation in the South may not have taken place.  So I was trying to look at the possibilities of them acquiring land during the Reconstruction period.
Story_ID: 650349
Speaker 1: Now this was a time in the country where there was a lot of reflection on the hundred years preceding where the Civil War and Reconstruction era took place, and it was the Civil War centennial, right?  So was that a big topic of discussion at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] when you were there reflecting on it?
Speaker 2: Well the big thing was, and you mentioned the March on Washington, I mean 1963 was the hundredth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.  And so a lot of people were looking at, you know, free by '63 [1963]--that we now should have our rights as citizens of the United States.  As I mentioned, this did not resonate with us as much in the North as it did in the South.  I mean, Malcolm X was a major voice for many of us in the North.  Why do we have to sit in; why do we have to demonstrate for our, our rights?  Why--why don't we have our rights?  Why don't we have our human rights?  If we had our human rights, we would automatically, as Malcolm X saw it, somewhat automatically we would have our civil rights.  But they don't even recognize our human rights.
Speaker 1: Now was Malcolm influential in your thinking in these--in those, in these days?
Speaker 2: Yes, very, very much so.  I mean, I--yeah.  I mean I--I--I read Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal] and I--I never visited a--a mosque.  I was more left leaning let's say then I would've been, although I thought that many of the things that Malcolm X talked about were things that we should be aware of, the whole Elijah Muhammad's 'Eat to Live' ['How to Eat to Live'], people beginning to put aside the pork and that sort of thing.  And of course, Malc- 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley]; you know, major influence I mean on--how this man could basically make himself so--yes, Malcolm X, his speeches that he gave while I was an undergraduate, everybody was talking about Malcolm X more so in some ways than Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  But we also felt that we owed it to, you know, Dr. King to be supportive of him and the Civil Rights Movement.  As I say when he came to Chicago [Illinois] to participate in those open housing marches.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think it was about--did you ever have a chance to meet Malcolm X in person and hear him speak?
Speaker 2: No, no I never heard him speak in person, I heard Dr. King speak in person.  And it was very interesting.  We talked earlier about James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel].  I talked to students, how I went to this one church, my wife [Anita Harris] and I, on the South Side of Chicago and James Bevel opened up the, the program.  And he got all of the young people, you know, really enthusiastic, then came Ralph Abernathy and he got all of the church people into--.  By the time Dr. King arrived at the podium, at the pulpit; people were ready, they were all riled up, all he had to do was open his mouth and people were just falling out, you know.
Story_ID: 650350
Speaker 1: Oh, I was gonna ask you about the, in '68 [1968], I mean, did your neigh- was your neighborhood destroyed, basically; or the businesses in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh very much, very much so, very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The riots were concentrated on West Side of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.  Well, this may be somewhat controversial, but I mentioned to you earlier that we made it possible for Skokie [Illinois] to be developed as a suburb.  Some people might question this, but people who lived on the West Side of Chicago, mainly a Jewish population was able to sell the homes that we bought; and to move to Skokie.  I have a theory, not really proven, so this is just a theory on my part, that those businesses on the West Side of Chicago were deliberately burned down so that those individuals could get the insurance and now resettle their businesses in Skokie, or the, the north suburbs of Chicago.  Why would people who were living on top of those stores burn out their friends?  I really believe that--now once it took off, you know, it, it was something that was hard to stop.  But along Madison Avenue [sic. Madison Street], along Roosevelt Road, those businesses that were burned out--the people couldn't sell them, who was gonna buy the businesses.  So they got the fire insurance.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting theory.  Yeah, 'cause I've often (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's theory.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've often wondered why people would do that too, you know.  There's a--so, yeah it is, it's interesting.
Speaker 2: And then you know, once people get involved in the heat of this, you know.  But why is it also South Side of Chicago.  I mean there were some parts that burned, but why was it that the South Side of Chicago did not suffer the same kind of damage that the West Side of Chicago did?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) ownership is actually in the hands of the black people on the South Side?
Speaker 2: More so than on the West Side.
Speaker 1: That, yeah, that is something to think about.
Speaker 2: Now some people say well it was get whitey--that's why the, you know--.  But I--I really, I'm not that much of a conspiracy theorist, but I think there was a conspiracy, just like those houses we bought on contract.
Speaker 1: Now the upshot of what you're saying is true, is that the insurance money was used to transport people away--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --ownership to another location (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the West Side is still--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --parts are still wiped clean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --mainly because of the riots.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: One of the messages that you hear is that you need to teach black students in six- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Ri- oh, clearly.
Speaker 1: So you go to Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Clearly.
Speaker 1: Now Miles College is in?
Speaker 2: Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Historically black college [HBCU].  And Miles has a history to it too.  Now, in 19--I'm trying to remember what year it was, maybe it was about '63 [1963], John Monro [John U. Monro], who was dean of the college at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] went to Miles College and devoted himself to education for black students.  Miles is basically an open enrollment school.  A warm body showed up, you could get in.  And so he started this freshman social science program.  And through this program, students who did not have great high school educations were going to be made basically college ready; and would be able to then move through, graduate from Miles College.  And so I worked in this freshman social science program.  But, I mean Miles, small, poor school, didn't pay that much, we weren't worried, I mean because my wife [Anita Harris] and I were basically beatniks or hippies at--at the time.  We didn't require much money.  But, I was teaching five courses a semester.  I just could get up in the morning, eat breakfast, go prepare my lessons for the day, teach, come home, have dinner, I'm teaching about 125 students, go back after dinner, grade those papers and whatnot.  'Cause we were working very intensively with the students on their reading, their writing, with their analytical skills.  I say I can't do this for the rest of my life.  I've--as I'd often thought, you know okay, I'll teach in community college and I looked at Miles as being like, you know, maybe teaching community--now I gotta go back for a Ph.D. degree.  Plus also being there at Miles with a master's degree I'm an instructor, I'm a low man on the totem pole.  I gotta go get a Ph.D. degree.  And John Monro, as I say he was dean of Harvard College, 'cause I was thinking about the school I was most attracted to was Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], and I was attracted to Boston University because that's where Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got his Ph.D. degree.  And they had the Martin Luther King, Jr. graduate fellowships [Martin Luther King, Jr. Fellowship] at Boston University.  So I applied to Boston.  John Monro suggested I should apply to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] as well.  So I applied to Boston, Northwestern, Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] where now [HistoryMaker] Hollis Lynch was teaching at Columbia.  I applied to University of California, Davis [Davis, California].  I think I only got into Northwestern, Davis and Boston.  Columbia, I didn't get in there.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Northwestern became the place.
Story_ID: 650352
Speaker 1: Okay.  Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], now this is--I think we were talking earlier about the seat of the first African studies department in a major U.S. university, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And founded by Melville Herskovits [Melville J. Herskovits]?
Speaker 2: Herskovits.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well there's some question whether it's Northwestern or Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And I think Howard really claims being the first African studies program.  But Northwestern, Melville Herskovits developed very strong; and in fact, he was able to get a lot of the foundation money that Howard was not able to get in establishing the program at Northwestern.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right.  So you were in the history department, Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And who was the chair of the department then and what were they--I mean, who was there when you were?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was there, George Fredrickson [George M. Fredrickson] who was an up and coming historian; Sterling Stuckey was finishing his Ph.D. degree when I was there at Northwestern.  The year before I arrived, the students had taken over the--one of the administration buildings, the bursar's office there at Northwestern.
Speaker 1: This is because of Vietnam [Vietnam War] protest, or?
Speaker 2: No, this was the start of black studies program at Northwestern.  And James Turner, who later founded the Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], it's interesting, where I then ended up later, led that student sit in at Northwestern in 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Sterling Stuckey was getting his Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: James Turner was a student leader--
Speaker 2: Right, he was working on his Ph.D. at North--.  Now we did not overlap.  Sterling Stuckey and I did, but James Turner and I did not overlap at Northwestern.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is the place where there's some--also was [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson there at the time?
Speaker 2: Jeff Donaldson, right, was at Northwestern at the time.  I didn't know him there at Northwestern.  But there were a number of individuals who went on into, you know--James Pitts [James P. Pitts] who was in sociology and became president of university.  Alvin Schexnider [Alvin J. Schexnider] who became president of Norfolk State [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] I believe for a while.  There was just a number of individuals who were there at Northwestern.  It was very, very vibrant, I mean, it was almost like being at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], very vibrant intellectual atmosphere at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so--
Speaker 2: And then, I mean this is a time when they brought [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett to Northwestern, they brought--for the black studies program.  They brought [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett, the great journalist to Northwestern; and Vernon Jarrett taught courses on W.E.B. Du Bois.  I didn't take courses with him, but I remember having a number of conversations.  C.L.R. James taught for a while at--well one semester he taught at, at Northwestern.  Dennis Brutus who was from South Africa, in fact I learned a lot about the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa from Dennis Brutus, as he taught at Northwestern.
Speaker 1: It is quite a collection of people?
Speaker 2: Oh yes indeed, yes indeed.
Speaker 1: So was there a collegial atmosphere amongst the black folks that were there?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh very much so.  In fact, we started a black graduate student organization because many of us felt that the students in 1968 had opened up opportunities for us.  And so we now felt some responsibility to open up opportunities for other students, especially for graduate students.  And so we pressed Northwestern--you know, I look back on this and we--we really believed this I think at the time: we believed that the undergraduate student body at Northwestern should reflect the black population in the country.  And that Northwestern should reach that percentage of the black population, it should by--15 percent of the graduate students at Northwestern should be African American.  And we pressed them on it.  We did get them to hire a recruiter to bring in more black graduate students at Northwestern.  So we had an active group of graduate students there.
Speaker 1: So I mean what percentage were you in, you know, those days of the population?
Speaker 2: About 3 to 4 percent.
Speaker 1: That--that high, really?  I'm--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was about 3 or 4 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  That's higher than a lot of places.  I've heard like one half of 1 percent.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think we were about 3, 4; I think we were--I--I might be a little, I think we were about that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650353
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation topic?
Speaker 2: I--well, let me mention that George Fredrickson [George M. Fredrickson] had written this book called 'The Black Image in the White Mind.'  He was looking at white racial attitudes during the period from roughly 1830 to 1860.  And at this ti- well, no, maybe 1830 to 1870.  At this time you had these theories about black people being racially inferior.  You had the polygenesis thesis--that black people were created separate and unequal.  You had this notion of the great chain of being that there were whites at the tops, Asians, Indians, Africans.  You had people who believed that while blacks and whites were all created by the same creator, you had this idea of social Darwinism that basically African Americans or Africans were in a stage of arrested development--that they had only developed so far.  So all of these theories of racial inferiority he examined, he looked at, this idea of the black image in the white mind.  And so I was fascinated by this; and I was--wondered what did black people think about this.  So my dissertation was the black response to American racism, 1790 to 1863 ['The Free Black Response to American Racism, 1790-1863,' Robert Lee Harris, Jr.].

Speaker 2: My current title is professor of African American history, American studies and public affairs emeritus, as well as vice provost for diversity and faculty development emeritus, Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 1: All right and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is October the 24th, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Washington, D.C. at Skadden and Arps is it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Skadden Arps [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP].
Speaker 2: Skadden and Arps--Skadden Arps, okay.
Speaker 1: All right, and now we are completing an interview that we began on Monday the 20th of October 2013 [sic. October 22, 2013], correct?  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 650355
Speaker 1: We left off with you finishing up your Ph.D. dissertation at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], right?  And is--and we were talking about the title of your dissertation and your advisor, Benjamin Lewis, right?
Speaker 2: No, George Fredrickson [George M. Fredrickson].
Speaker 1: George Fredrickson, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: George Fredrickson, okay.  And now how--did you have any difficulty obtaining your Ph.D. there?
Speaker 2: No, I came into Northwestern with the master's degree from Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  So that put me in a position to move through the program fairly rapidly.  In fact, I completed all of my requirements within three years, except for the dissertation--I'd written half of the dissertation.  But also I went into the Ph.D. degree program with the idea of completing the program as soon as I could.  My wife [Anita Harris] told me--I was married at that time, my wife told me I wasn't gonna be a professional graduate student.  And so I had an incentive to complete the Ph.D. program.  And also, I was a little older than my graduate cohort, given that I did have the master's degree.  I taught for a year at Miles College in Birmingham [Fairfield, Alabama].  And so I had some sense of what I wanted to do; and I began doing little pieces of my larger research project in the seminars that I took.  Now, there is--you said did I have any difficulty, it wasn't really a problem, but my advisor, George Fredrickson, was from what I called the Germanic school: he liked long involved sentences, long paragraphs, very analytical.  My--one of my committee members whom I worked with very closely was Sterling Stuckey.  And Sterling believed that you should have a paragraph break on every page.  He took a more literary sort of approach to writing--short, crisp sentence, make your point.  So when I handed in a draft of the first chapter of the dissertation, I was caught between these two; and so I--I knew Sterling Stuckey fairly well and I went and I--I spoke--'cause he was still a graduate student himself finishing up his dissertation.  I went and I talked to him.  He said, "Look, you have to follow the advice of--of your advisor."  'Cause I'm caught, long paragraph, short, what--what am I gonna do, you know.  But it worked out fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650356
Speaker 1: Title of your dissertation [at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] was the black response to American racism, 1790 to 1863 ['The Free Black Response to American Racism, 1790-1863,' Robert Lee Harris, Jr.]?"
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what--did you discover something that, profound that you had, you didn't know before?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure how profound it was, but we are supposed to make an original contribution to scholarship in the dissertation.  And I think one of my contributions was that African Americans saw themselves as a people that they looked to develop ownership of the movement for freedom and equality; that they did not accept this idea that Africans were destined to be hewers of wood and drawers of water.  That despite all of the efforts to put them in and to keep them in an inferior position, they resisted that.  They developed a consciousness, if you will, of their own.  And they recognized that they were indeed children of God.  And despite all of the propaganda that was being waged against them, they saw themselves as being equal to their oppressors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you raised a point I think that's been, though a simple point, it's something that black people are still struggling with, and that's the recognition of ourselves as a people.  You know, how--what does that mean and I think that's still something that we're struggling with.  How did people in that period--I mean, others saw us as a people in a negative sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how do we define ourselves as a people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, African Americans saw themselves as having a certain integrity as a people.  Frederick Douglass talked about a nation within a nation.  Martin Delany, I'm dropping a name here, ear- other early writers saw African Americans as a people.  So there was, I mean, there was this discussion that was taking place at the time--among those African Americans who were free, as well as among those who were enslaved there was this conversation that was taking place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole idea of a black nationality had, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was really being discussed (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Martin Delany, yeah.
Speaker 1: And historians in the 1970s, you know, had deep discussions about what it meant--what did a black nationality mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and one of the things that I think I looked at is that, you know, we in a sense, and I'm saying we, my generation, coming of age during the late 1960s--many of us saw ourselves as looking at these things anew, as if they had not been discussed before.  And you know, as you go back you look in the past, there were people talking, not in the same manner, because each generation does approach history from the vantage of its generation.  But these were not new issues.
Story_ID: 650357
Speaker 1: On completion of your dissertation [at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], what did you--did you have a position identified?
Speaker 2: Well, I did get a--an offer to teach at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign [Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  I did have my first interview at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] and I should tell you a little bit about that, because the chairman of the history department, Merrill Peterson [Merrill D. Peterson], who's a Jefferson scholar, met me at the airport and as I explained to some of the my graduate students, my interview was over on the way from the airport to the campus.  Because I pressed him on this issue--there was a book that was recently published by Fawn Brodie [Fawn M. Brodie] on [President] Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings ['Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History'], and I asked him about it.  And he told me it was all rubbish--that Jefferson couldn't have had children by Sally Hemings.  And so as I say, that interview was pretty much over.  Although, when I got to the campus and I was giving my seminar, in walked this guy in full Confederate regalia.  Took a seat out in the audience and I said uh oh what's going on here.  And then I looked around, I'll tell you I was really a little bit concerned.  I said now if anybody comes here in a Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] outfit, I'm out the door, that's--that's gonna be it.  I did not get an offer from University of Virginia.  But I did get an offer from University of California, San Diego [San Diego, California], and an offer from University of Illinois.  Of course being that we, you know, both my wife [Anita Harris] and I were born and grew up in Chicago [Illinois], being in Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] would put me close to Evanston [Illinois].  I had half of the dissertation completed when I went to the University of Illinois.  And I was appointed as an instructor, and they said as soon as I finished the dissertation, had everything in place for the degree, I would become an assistant professor.  Well, that's not what really sort of influenced me as much as the fact that they told me that once--I started out making $11,500 a year.  They told me once I completed all the degree requirements, I'd get a five hundred dollar raise.  Well there we were, I'm married, I've got a four year old daughter [Lisa Harris Robinson]--five hundred dollars looked like a lot of money to me at that point.  And so I worked, I really worked, as I try to explain to my graduate students, I developed tunnel vision.  I would go to the library, I'd work until it was lights out, until I finished writing that dissertation.
Speaker 1: Now that was--that pay for 19--for that stage of the '70s [1970s], that wasn't a huge salary or anything, no?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But was that about the average for a beginning professor?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, 12,000, 12,500, beginning professors, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I mean we were able to live on it, it wasn't a problem for us.
Speaker 1: So you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't require a whole lot of money.
Story_ID: 650358
Speaker 1: Now this is in Champaign, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Champaign, Illinois [Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]?  And so what was your experience there at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]; were there other black faculty staff there, or?
Speaker 2: Well, there was one other black faculty member who taught European history.  It's my understanding that he had been in seminary and this is where he developed, I guess, the interest in European history.  But I was the first black faculty member to teach United States history and African American history in the history department at the University of Illinois.  And I had a fairly good teaching experience.  My disappointment was that, like and I--I just shouldn't just single out the University of Illinois for this, but like many institutions, I felt that the University of Illinois was giving lip service to the idea of black studies.  They had an African American studies program on paper, but that was basically it.  They were not really giving much, much support to it.
Speaker 1: So was there actual department or--?
Speaker 2: Program.
Speaker 1: A program.
Speaker 2: Right, not a department.
Speaker 1: Program meaning that it--that members from various departments--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like me, I was in the history department.  They would draw upon faculty in other departments too.  And then they would, you know, cross list the courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah did the--was the black faculty staff organized in any way?
Speaker 2: We had sort of an informal organization.  There were a few black faculty around in the school of education.  There was James Anderson [James D. Anderson] who wrote this very important book on black education in the South ['The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935'].  There was Amassa Fauntleroy who also happened to be a Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] Ph.D. who was in the mathematics department at the time.  And there were a few other black faculty sprinkled, you know, across the campus.  We interacted with each other, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And so what kind of students did you have, were they excited about?
Speaker 2: Well, I--I have to be frank with you, the white students were more excited about the courses I taught than the black students were.  Now I ha- I shouldn't over generalize about this, but one thing that just sticks in my memory is I had this one young black man from Chicago [Illinois] who told me he couldn't get as excited about what I was teaching as the white students, because after all he had lived the black experience.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I had to sit him down and have a long chat with him about what he knew about the black experience.  And of course, it was about, inch deep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was often said in those days, "I'm already black so why do I need black studies," right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, be it history, sociology, whatever.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and of course for many of the white students this was their first encounter.  They hadn't--in fact some of them were really kind of upset that they were learning things that they felt they should've learning in high school.  But these were things that were not taught to them in high school.
Speaker 1: Do you think a lot of African American students kind of took it for granted that, and they heard some of the names, but didn't know--I mean did they?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that we've come to over the last decade or so is looking at what we consider to be the multidimensionality of the black population.  So we can't talk about a black student.  I mean these students were coming from varied backgrounds.  Some of them had some acquaintance, some familiarity from home.  Some came with no knowledge whatsoever.  And you know, we had a group of students who believed that they needed to know more about themselves, that the campus needed to know more about black people.  So there were--there were different groups on the campus.
Speaker 1: So would the--did the program--participate, participation in the program, could it get you like minor in, in African American studies?
Speaker 2: At that time, you could get a minor, but you couldn't major.
Story_ID: 650359
Speaker 1: Any rate, so you were there from '72 [1972] to '75 [1975]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was there a highlight of your stay there?
Speaker 2: The only highlight I would say now--I taught some graduate students, the current chair of the history department at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Edna Medford [Edna Greene Medford] took her first graduate seminar from me.  And she said, in fact she spoke at the Association for the Study of African American Life and History meeting this past September, October in Jacksonville, Florida, and she acknowledged three major influences on her career.  I didn't realize I'd had this influence, but she said her first encounter with African American history was taking my seminar.  And then she also mentioned Ira Berlin at University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] with whom she studied and received her Ph.D. degree from University of Maryland.  And then Vernon Burton who taught also at University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  She said the three of us had major influence on her career.  It's great to hear that, you know.  I wasn't aware at the time that I was having so--as I look back, I mean I didn't realize it at the time, but as I look back on it I see that as a--a high point for me.  But also, in my second year at the University of Illinois I applied for a National Endowment for the Humanities postdoctoral fellowship; and I knew there was a person on the faculty in the history department who had done some work for the National Endowment for the Humanities.  And I'm not a shy individual, I believe that you have to do what is to your benefit.  I developed this proposal and I asked him, a lot of people didn't get along with him, but I said well let me ask him and see if he will read my proposal.  He read my proposal and I remember him telling me, he said, "You made a good case on this study as something that needs to be done, but you have not shown that you're the only person to do it."  I thought you don't toot your horn like that.  But he said, "You've got to demonstrate to them not only does this need to be done, but you're the person with the best qualifications to do it."  I revised the proposal and I got the fellowship.  So that was really a high point for me.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what was it that you were uniquely qualified to do?
Speaker 2: Well, what I was looking at, at the time, I was you know, looking to deepen my study and my dissertation in looking at the free black response to American racism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See no one had really done that and so I'm showing that it was something that needed to be done; and then with the work I had done already and some further work that I was the person uniquely qualified to do it.
Story_ID: 650360
Speaker 1: Tell us like what, what was the situation of the free--so-called free black person, or free person of color back during, you know, antebellum years?
Speaker 2: Okay, well depends of por- course upon where one is located--if you're located in the North, if you're located in the upper South, if you're located in the--the--the lower South or the Deep South.  In the North, those African Americans were free and some people will refer to them in the South as being quasi-free, because there were still restrictions on them.  But in the North, they were able to from their own organizations, their own churches, the African Methodist Episcopal church [A.M.E.], the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church, the Friendly African Union Society [sic. Free African Union Society].  They, they formed these mutual aid societies to help each other in times of sickness, for death benefits, also in some areas they developed their own graveyards because they could not--even in the North, they couldn't be buried in the white cemeteries, so they developed their own cemeteries.  They did similar things in the South, but there were more restrictions.  Now again, it depends upon where you're located in the South.  If you're in New Orleans [Louisiana], if you're in Mobile, Alabama, if you're in Charleston, South Carolina you have a few more privileges than if you're in Mississippi, if you're in Tennessee, if you're in Alabama, let's say--well except for Mobile, Alabama.  But the United States basically had what we called a two tiered system of race relations: whites at the top, blacks at the bottom.  But in a place like New Orleans, which was very much influenced by immigrants from Haiti after the Haitian revolution, you had more of a three tiered system.  So you had whites at the top, mulattos in the middle, blacks at the bottom.  Now, again, this was somewhat fluid, so that just like in Brazil, I mean to this day still, money lightens in Brazil; if you're someone who has a profession, if you have some financial resources, I mean Pele, who was the great soccer player in Brazil, who by standards in the United States would be considered phenotypically black, in Brazil he was considered phenotypically white, even though he is dark skinned because he's famous, he's got money.  So in South Carolina, by and large in Charleston, you have individuals who are professionals, who are tailors, who are carpenters, who are barbers, and who occupy sort of a middle position.  The same thing in New Orleans where you have individuals who are butchers, even some gunsmith--black men who are gunsmiths in New Orleans.  And so it depends upon where you are throughout the country.  But by and large, given that--I mean, at the time of the outbreak of the Civil War there are only 250 thousand African Americans in the South who are somewhat free.  I say somewhat free, in fact many people refer--refer to them as quasi-free, because even in South Carolina there're restrictions after the 1830s that are tightened on those freed blacks, especially after you have someone like Denmark Vesey and his planned rebellion in South Carolina.  But there're 250 thousand black men and women, children who are free, quasi-free in the South, 250 thousand in the North; and then four million who were enslaved in the South.
Story_ID: 650361
Speaker 1: Well was the, the locale of the free person of color, did it make a difference in terms of his response to racism in the country?
Speaker 2: I think so because those individuals who had a few more privileges did not look at the situation the same way as those who had no privileges.  So and, and, and, and this then followed after the Civil War so that after the Civil War those individuals who were enslaved wanted education, wanted land, wanted to participate in politics.  Those who were free before the Civil War, after the Civil War wanted to participate in--well they wanted education, the both agreed on that.  Wanted education, wanted to participate in politics, wanted land.  So you know, the order of interest was, was different depending upon the circumstances before the Civil War and then after the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So now this period of time is--there'd been I guess since the '60s [1960s] a changing guard I guess in terms of the way historians were looking at this period of time in 19th century leading up to the Civil War.  There had been, was that the Dunning School of history back at the turn of the century (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that flipped the Civil War and had, you know, the sympathetic articles about the South--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they shall rise again and all that sort of thing, you know (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, some people refer to it.  In fact, there's this book called 'The Tragic Era' ['The Tragic Era: The Revolution after Lincoln,' Claude G. Bowers] in looking at the Civil War, Reconstruction that--and then of course you have the movie which cinematographically I understand is supposed to be, and I guess it is a, a great movie.  But you know, 'Birth of a Nation' ['The Birth of a Nation'], and in that movie the use of the wide--it was the first time, you know, you have some of these techniques, D.W. Griffith, 'Birth of a Nation.'  But 'Birth of a Nation' gave the impression that a corrupt, inept government was being imposed on the South; and this is where the Dunning School of Reconstruction history comes into play.
Story_ID: 650362
Speaker 1: Now the response to the Dunning School starts to gain more popularity, I mean you've got, you have historians writing about Reconstruction and discovering things that you were telling me off camera Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] had already done back in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah well, in 1938 [sic. 1935], 'Black Reconstruction' ['Black Reconstruction in America']; and Du Bois has a wonderful chapter in there called "The Propaganda of History" in which he shows how these individuals misinterpreted, deliberately misinterpreted the past.  But yes, it's in the 1960s as more individuals come into the profession.  I mean, [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin had, had written about the--some of these things.  [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, 'Black Power U.S.A' ['Black Power U.S.A: The Human Side of Reconstruction, 1867-1877'] had written about it.  But it begins to be more widely accepted during the 1970s; and so then you have white historians who began--and Eric Foner, for example, acknowledges Du Bois' influence on his writing as he goes back and looks at the record.  So that now the Dunning School has pretty much been discredited.
Story_ID: 650363
Speaker 1: But then during the '70s [1970s]--now you started attending the Association for the Study of African American Life and History in nine- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: --seventy-two [1972].  That was the year the name was changed.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is the conference in Cincinnati [Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cincinnati.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They changed the name of the organization to African American--
Speaker 2: From Negro [Association for the Study of Negro Life and History] to African American--Afro-American [Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History]; now it's African American, yes.
Speaker 1: And they made Negro History Week after American--Black History Month.
Speaker 2: Well that--black history--black, well, they had Black History Week, it's 1976 that, and this is the bicentennial of the United States that it becomes Black History Month.  They expanded from a week to a month.
Speaker 1: So those changes take place in the association--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and so--
Speaker 2: And 1976 was also the fiftieth anniversary of Negro History Week, which was started in 1926.  So on the fiftieth anniversary they changed it to Black History Month.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650364
Speaker 1: Oh, I was gonna ask you about 'Time on the Cross' ['Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery'] we talked about it before the interview, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but that was--it got a lot of attention in 1973 [sic. 1974], I believe, when it came out, it was a book by Fogel and Engerman--Stanley Fogel and Robert Engerman.
Speaker 2: Robert Fogel, Stanley Engerman.
Speaker 1: Robert--okay, just the opposite.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.
Speaker 2: Well you know, as a historian I always have to provide some context, okay, for us to understand these things.  And there was a book by Stanley Elkins [Stanley M. Elkins], 1959, called 'Slavery' ['Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'].  And Stanley Elkins believed that Africans had basically been traumatized by the Middle Passage and enslavement in the United States--that they became Sambo-like figures because of this very traumatic experience.  They became dependent on the slave master.  They became--the slave master became like a father figure.  They became childlike.  Now, Elkins thought he was doing us a favor.  In fact what he did, he used the concentration camp analogy, where many individuals in the concentration camps during World War II [WWII] basically identified with the prison guards as father figures.  Many grown men became childlike, they wet the bed in those concentration camps.  And so Elkins was saying that African Americans were not inherently inferior, which was the argument before the 1960s let's say, but that African Americans were sort of made inferior through this process of capture, passage across the Atlantic Ocean, enslavement in the South.  And then this--some people explained the disadvantaged position of African Americans in American society as being because African Americans were inherently inferior.  Elkins was saying no; they were made inferior.  So, I mean, if you're inherently inferior there's low possibility of change, right?  If you are made inferior, just like you could be unmade, you follow me.  So Elkins, I think, thought he was doing us a favor.  But in many ways he was just perpetuating that old stereotype; and so people began to look at enslavement.
Story_ID: 650365
Speaker 1: You mentioned John Blassingame [John W. Blassingame], his book 'The Slave Community' ['The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South'].  Actually John Blassingame was seeking to answer Stanley Elkins [Stanley M. Elkins] because Blassingame said there were three personality types: that there was indeed Sambo who was the person who saw himself as being sort of inferior; there was Nat who was the rebellious individual who was always running away; there was Jack who was sort of in the middle, you know, he went along with the plantation routine, but if he felt like things--he was being done wrong, I mean he was being done wrong, being enslaved, but I mean even within the institution of slavery, he would strike back.  Sambo was an individual and I mean, I've come to acknowledge--there was a time when I just totally rejected the idea of black self hatred.  Sambo was someone who really basically hated himself.  And we do have to acknowledge, and I--I acknowledge today, there are some black people who have self hatred.  I don't think we can characterize the majority of the black population, I don't think we can even characterize a sizeable portion as being self hating.  Because I think there're ways that we can explain the whole notion of a culture of poverty, the same--that we, we can explain the gap, whether it's the achievement gap in education, wealth gap, what have you.  We can explain those by material circumstances more so then by internal behavioral circumstance.  But Fogel [Robert Fogel] and Engerman [Stanley Engerman]--getting back to 'Time on the Cross' ['Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Slavery'], and I was trying to give some context.  They saw the slaves as basically being rational individuals who were operating within a capitalistic economy and who saw--sought to maximize their position.  Also, they saw the slaveholders as being rational individuals, and who did--and, and they had ways that they measured the amount of food that was available and, and the clothing and that sort of thing.  And they saw the plantation as being almost like a factory.  And that there were some benefits, some privileges that came to the slaves.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the association [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] meeting where they--that was discussed as being heralded as the first computational approach to history where they use--actually used computers to crunch data--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to look at the time period--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and they came to the conclusion that slaves were fed fairly well--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) they you know, they were given adequate clothing--and one is left to speculate it wasn't that bad, you know, as a result of it?
Speaker 1: That was not nece- again, I don't think that was necessarily their intent, but the way the book was written it was almost like, what you complaining about?  You know, you benefited from this.  And I mean, there was a dialectic, there was a give and take during the period of enslavement.  But I think that if you put the proposition as happened during the Civil War to the average person who was enslaved, and I say it was put to them, not literally but figuratively whether you want to remain enslaved or you want your freedom, there were individuals who took their freedom.  In fact, we talk about self, which gets us into another area, the whole idea of the Emancipation Proclamation, the slaves freed themselves; [President] Abraham Lincoln didn't really free them.  I mean he said again, sort of the context for them to free themselves, but they went to those Union lines, they took their freedom; when they heard about the Civil War and then when they heard about the Emancipation Proclamation, yes, they took their freedom.
Story_ID: 650366
Speaker 1: I know this is a big discussion, Eugene Genovese's 'Roll, Jordan, Roll' ['Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made']--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the writings of Leon Litwack and Ira Berlin and others--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --writing about slavery.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I know John Clarke [John Henrik Clarke] said at one of the meetings [of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History] that, you know, Blassingame [John W. Blassingame] had the only book written by an African American about the slave experience at that time.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, this is something that puzzled me as a graduate student and then as a beginning assistant professor.  We wrote more--and I was one who fell into this category as well, we wrote more about those African Americans who were free than we did about those who were enslaved.  In part, that was to justify racial equality in a way; to show that we did have individuals of merit, of achievement, okay.  We had very few novels about the period of, of slavery.  It's only more recently like with Toni Morrison's 'Beloved,' and a, a number of other novels that have come out that have addressed, have dealt with--.  It--it's, it's one of the things if you look at the Jewish American population, there's more work that has come out on the Holocaust I would say in the last twenty, thirty years then had been published before.  It was something that, in a way, I--well, I'm just gonna be--speak for African American--I think we were shamed of enslavement.  And we had to reach a point, the Civil Rights Movement freed us in a number of ways and one of the ways, with the Civil Rights Movement, with the notion that we had achieved, and I don't want to say that we had achieved racial equality, but we achieved some semblance of racial equality, that freed us up in many ways to look at our past, to look at the tragedies as well as the triumphs.  Before the late 1960s, we wanted to look more at the triumphs.  In fact, people talk about Carter G. Woodson basically writing contributionist history--showing the contribution that African Americans made to development of American society and again, justifying, saying that we deserve rights as citizens of the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're right.  The name 'The Negro in Our History' [Carter G. Woodson] for instance?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So this was something that, I think, the Civil Rights Movement, the 1964--well, let's say '63 [1963], '64 [1964], '65 [1965] freed us up to really encounter our past in ways that we had not encountered our past before.
Story_ID: 650367
Speaker 1: I mean there'd been some--I don't mean to say we didn't do it at all, but now we were willing to look at it; and then of course in 1976 with 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family'], Alex Haley, we're now really willing more so than before to come to grips with that past of enslavement.
Speaker 2: Now I remember that 'Roots' was the topic I think of the keynote address at the 1973 AHSA conference [African Heritage Studies Association] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I believe, either that--okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: He--Alex Haley was there and he delivered an address to the assembled.  And so what did you think at the time, did you think of--I mean as a historian, what did you think of the history that he was, you know, that was informing his novel, did you think he really had something; and what have you thought about it subsequently?
Speaker 1: Oh I think all of us were very excited about the work that Alex Haley was doing and about the story he was telling.  Now I can't--I'll just speak for myself, I didn't take it literally, I took it more figuratively.  I believed that he opened up some questions that we could now go back and address.  I think he made the story more vivid than the historian did so that individuals could go back and read a John Blassingame [John W. Blassingame], could read other work that was coming out about enslavement.  You know, I wrote study guides for the television dramatization of, of 'Roots'.  And this was something that, you know, in fact we watched 'Roots' as a family at home and we had conversations around the dinner table and my oldest daughter [Lisa Harris Robinson], as she was watching 'Roots' she said, "Oh that's what you were talking about."  It hadn't sunk in, you know, even though we'd discussed this, we'd talked about it.  But when she saw it, and of course, her generation and current generation are very visual.  And so as you talk about these things, you know, they have to see it in many ways.
Speaker 2: Now this is the first visual representation of the drama--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --of the Middle Passage--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I mean of the capture--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of African culture even--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in a positive light--
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, right, right, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and the capture of an African enslaved brought as a middle passage, the seasoning process, enslavement, the punishments for running away, you know, slave family life--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --what happens when your children are sold, all those things?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then the great thing that I liked about--I mean there're a number of things about it, but the--the great thing that I liked about it was--oh why am I dropping his name now, who--was he the fiddler--
Speaker 2: Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] was the fiddler.
Speaker 1: Lou Gossett, Lou Gossett.  But there's this scene in 'Roots' where Lou Gossett walks up to the planters door, and he walks erect, he knocks on the door; and then he bends down.  He gets into the role.  But you know, I was able to use that as a moment to say look, he did not always act in a subservient manner.  You take those individuals who were enslaved, they didn't--and I--I thought that they captured this beautifully in 'Roots.'  They did not always act--Paul Laurence Dunbar poem 'We Wear the Mask.'  And you know, it--it--it--it really displays that poem how African Americans had to act during the period of enslavement, and some extent during the period of segregation.
Story_ID: 650368
Speaker 1: So, the study guide that you wrote, was it used across the nation in terms of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, throughout, throughout the country.  It went--I think it was ABC that did the show 'Roots' and so I did two study guides for 'Roots.'  There was 'Roots' and then there was 'Roots: The Next Generation' [sic. 'Roots: The Next Generations'], the sequel.  And I did a study guide for both of them.
Speaker 1: So how were you chosen as the person to do that, I mean?
Speaker 2: I think I was recommended by Sterling Stuckey to do that.  Sterling has served as a mentor; and he had done quite a bit of writing.  He wrote for the Encyclopedia Britannica on African American history; and I don't know if he didn't have time or if he figured that he needed to help a young brother out (laughter) in his career.  But I think Sterling recommended me to--to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so it was the production company, it was ABC that--
Speaker 2: Yes, asked me.
Speaker 1: --that provided the funds for--
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry.  There was a group called Prime Time School Television.  In fact, they were located in Chicago [Illinois], and I think it was through their contact with Sterling Stuckey that he recommended, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that I do this.
Story_ID: 650369
Speaker 1: Now in the vein--in regards to those contributions to encyclopedias and such, you've contributed a number of biographies--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to encyclopedias--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and different--well biographical entries about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black historical personnel.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know one was H. Ford Douglas and that you wrote about--and there were several others, do you wanna talk about some of those?
Speaker 2: Well, I think H. Ford Douglas is a fascinating individual because he became a captain during the Civil War and there were very few black men who were officers during the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Now what--if I get this--if I'm correct, I think I remember what you said earlier when we started the interview, you said you had an uncle that actually served in a white unit during the war?
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [Henry Watkins].
Speaker 1: Your grandfather?
Speaker 2: During World War I [WWI].
Speaker 1: World War I, right.  Now this is unusual because the [U.S.] Army was segregated.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Was there a confusion about what his race was?
Speaker 2: Yes there was.
Speaker 1: Okay, now H. Ford Douglas did something similar in the Civil War--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the beginning anyway--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --'cause he was already in Illinois, an Illinois unit--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) from what I understand before he became the captain of the light artillery?
Speaker 2: Right, he became art- an artillery unit, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: At Fort Leavenworth [Kansas] I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well you know, we were able to move in and out in ways that people don't fully understand.
Speaker 1: Did you--I mean was there a relationship between your grandfather--and is that why that story kind of interested you or?
Speaker 2: You know, subconsciously it may have, but no, it wasn't, no.  This was someone about whom not much had been written, and that's why I wanted to follow the story of H. Ford Douglas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What stands out about him, 'cause he's someone that I find fascinating that I (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well see, I called H. Ford Douglas a anti-slavery immigrationist, because for a while Douglas favored immigration to Africa, but some people wanted to immigrate to Africa as a means of going back home.  H. Ford Douglas wanted to immigrate to Africa as a way of weakening the institution of slavery in the United States.  So that's why I call him an anti-slavery immigrationist.  Not everyone has accepted my analysis; but I think, well I--I try to make a strong an argument as I can.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Now he died mysteriously at Fort Leavenworth after a series of letters back and forth between him and the commander and the--
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  He contracted influenza or something like that during the Civil War.  You know, he died relatively young.  In a way that was a blessing for me because it ended the story, (laughter) but it was also a curse because I wish, you know, could've continued on with the story.
Story_ID: 650370
Speaker 1: Tell us how you--your--about your transition to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] from University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.  Well, I mentioned to you that I was a bit disappointed at the University of Illinois.  Not with, you know, my appointment in the Department of History.  I think I got along very well with my colleagues there, but I felt that the institution at the university was basically giving lip service to black studies.  Now, most black studies programs came into existence in about 1969, after the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And many people did not believe that black studies was going to last.  They talked about these courses as being rap sessions--that they didn't have any intellectual substance to it.  They saw it as a fad that, you know, something that the students clamored for at the time, but that it would soon die out.  And so in 1975, when I had an opportunity to go to Cornell, I'd been at, at Illinois for three years.  Cornell, the Africana Studies and Research Center was a department.  It was a center, it was almost like a college.  It reported directly to the provost; it did not report through the dean of a college as many programs did.  And most of black studies, if you will at--and that was basically called black studies or Afro American studies at the time--the units were programs.  They were not able to hire and to appoint their own faculty.  The Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell could hire, I mean with the approval of the provost, but could hire, could appoint its own faculty, could recommend its own faculty for tenure promotion, which was very different from these programs where they were dependent on traditional (background noise)--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: --where they were dependent on traditional departments for their faculty.  Like I'm at University of Illinois, the Afro American studies program at the University of Illinois is dependent upon traditional departments for its faculty.  The Africana Studies and Research Center could recruit its own faculty.  Moreover, the Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell combined African studies, African American, and Caribbean studies; and it was a model.  The Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell in 1972 developed the first master's degree program in Africana studies in the country.  And so these were all things that were attractive.  And I also wanted to demonstrate, I wanted to prove these critics wrong.  That there was intellectual substance to Africana studies.  That we had a body of scholarship to draw upon.  I mean we needed, yes, to deepen the archives.  And during the late 1960s, early 1970s, there were many historical organizations, there were many research centers that began to collect material to document the story, but I knew that that was there.  I mean to me, it was saying somehow or another, our story was not legitimate.  And I knew it was.  And I knew that those sources were out there.  We had to search for some of them, but during the late 1960s, early 1970s, we began to create the scholarship, we began to develop the resources; and I think we were able to prove those individuals wrong who said there was no int- I mean, people said there was no intellectual substance--that the courses were just rap sessions, you know.  That is wasn't--it was a fad, it wasn't going to last very long.  And of course, here we are some forty or more years later, right, forty-four years later, still around.
Story_ID: 650371
Speaker 1: Who was at Cor- Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] in Africana studies when you got there?
Speaker 2: Well, when I went there, there was of course James Turner who was the founder of the Africana Center [Africana Studies and Research Center].  There was also J. Congress Mbata from South Africa, and he had been involved with the African National Congress.  There was Tendai Mutunhu from Zimbabwe.  There was also Cheston Everett who was--who is the brother of [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga--as you know Karenga's name is Ron Everett [Ronald Everett].  Cheston Everett is his, his brother.  There was William Cross [William E. Cross, Jr.] who taught psychology and who published this very important essay called 'The Negro-to-Black Conversion Experience' model that appeared in, I think it was Negro Digest then when it was published, yeah.  So it was a dynamic group.  And--
Speaker 1: So it's interesting you mentioned that, because Negro Digest converts to Black World after that article came out (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, after that article, yes.  So, it was a dynamic group and of course there were some, some great students who were there at Cornell as undergraduates; and also as, as graduate students because of our having the first master's degree program in Africana studies.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who were some of your students or what do they do, did they go on to?
Speaker 2: Most of the students that I work with went on to get Ph.D. degrees.  And several of them went to--well, one went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], one went to University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], one went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and many of them are now teaching; they're on faculty colleges and universities around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, what courses did you teach at, in Africana studies?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah I, I taught of course the survey of African American history.  I also taught a course that John Henrik Clarke had developed, because he helped to develop the curriculum at the Africana Center.  And he had this course called Men and Movements in the Black Urban Ghetto.  And I used the structure, but I renamed it Black Leaders and Movements in African American History because, you know, the whole women's consciousness movement called it Men and Movements--was not--I mean I tried to expand it, expand it out.  I also taught a course on African American historiography, looking at the writing and the interpretation of African American history.  I taught a course on the, what I call the socioeconomic history of black America.
Story_ID: 650372
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about John Henrik Clarke.  Now he's, he's a figure of those days in historical circles that had no historical academic credentials in the sense, in that sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he was what Earl Thorpe [Earl E. Thorpe], who wrote this book on black historians ['Black Historians: A Critique'], was called historian without portfolio.  And of course, I mean there's a tradition of individuals who studied African American history and John Henrik Clarke was, was one of those individuals.  Of course, John Henrik Clarke was basically self taught, but he knew as much or more than individuals who had gone through the academy.  I mean when I came through the academy, there was no major in African American history for example.  We had to--I--I had to take my comprehensive exams in United States history.  And so there was some focus on African American history, but I had to really have a mastery of United States history, from the colonial era to the present.  And so, John Henrik Clarke, of course is someone who is--who is well read, who has a fantastic memory; and I used to love talking with him in the hallways at, at conferences, or sit down with him at lunch and, and talk with him about, especially many of the individuals that he had encountered in the old Harlem History Club.  You know, John Henrik Clarke developed the curriculum for the HARYOU-ACT program [Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited - Associated Community Teams] that Kenneth Clark had started in New York City [New York, New York].  And he, as I mentioned, developed--helped to develop the curriculum of the Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  So here was someone who was legendary, if you will; someone who had a sense of our past and who studied it you know assiduously.
Story_ID: 650373
Speaker 1: In terms of African American historiography, you mentioned Earl Thorpe's [Earl E. Thorpe] book ['Black Historians: A Critique']--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I know that's the first volume I'd ever read--attempt to do an African American historiography as such.  What was your kind of contribution to that effort?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote a article which I understand is getting some play these days.  I have graduate students that I encounter or recent Ph.D.'s that I encounter at the association [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] and they say, "Oh you wrote that article 'Coming of Age'--the development of African American history."  Well, at the time, I was trying to show how African American history during the late 1960s, early 1970s had matured--that African American history had become a subject in its own right and not an appendage to United States history.  Now you can't understand United States history without understanding our African American history; and likewise to understand African American history, you have to have some background in United States history.  But African American history is not the stepchild, if you will of United States history.  It's something that's able to stand on its own, especially given the fact that African Americans developed a distinctive African American culture.  We did not become as the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier would suggest, we did not become quintessential Americans.  We helped to shape American culture.  In fact, W.E.B. Du Bois said, "What would America have been without her Negro people?"  And so when you look at issues of language, and you look at issues of music, dance, cuisine; you look at the iron work in Charleston, South Carolina and New Orleans [Louisiana].  You look at the rice plantations in the Sea Isles [Sea Islands] off the coast of South Carolina and, and Georgia.  You look at the area of South Carolina and Georgia along the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean].  Africans basically brought rice cultivation to the American colonies.  And so you've got to look at that in its own right.  You can't start with a frame of United States history and then subsume African American history under it.  You're not going to get a full understanding, appreciation of African American history and the United States history unless--it depends upon your starting point, you know.  What lens are you going to use in looking at the past.  And if you're gonna understand black people in the United States, you've gotta use a particular lens; you can't use the lens of United States history in order to do that.  So I think my contribution was to suggest that African American history become a subject of its own and also I looked at the interconnection between African American history and African history.  Something we didn't talk about, I did study West African history as a minor field for my Ph.D. degree at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  So I saw that interconnection.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this article was written in 1982, the 'Coming of Age: The Transformation of Afro-American Historiography,' and it appeared in the Journal of Negro History [Journal of African American History].  It's also been reprinted in 'Paradigms in Black Studies,' edited by Abdul Alkalimat; and referred to by people since that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is something that stands--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --stands the test.
Story_ID: 650374
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well there're two things that I--have gotten a lot of play.  That's ['Coming of Age: The Transformation of Afro-American Historiography,' Robert L. Harris, Jr.] gotten quite a bit of play; and then the article that I wrote--.  I was involved in a, a study with Darlene Clark Hine and Nellie McKay for the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] looking at black studies programs.  I call it the institutional and intellectual development of Africana studies in the United States ['The Intellectual and Institutional Development of Africana Studies,' Robert L. Harris, Jr.], and that seems to have gotten a lot of play as well.
Speaker 2: Now when was that published then?
Speaker 1: Oh that's in the, the--nine- it's been reprinted in a number of places, that's in the '90s [1990s] I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So now in '84 [1984], you wrote an article, you know, I'm skipping over, there's a whole--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --there are, I don't know I guess a hundred or more articles here.  But this one from 1984 is called 'The Afro-American Classics: The Essential Library' [sic. 'The Afro-American Classics: An Essential Library,' Robert Lee Harris, Jr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that appeared in Black Enterprise magazine.  And I was just curious as to what books would you consider to be the Afro American classics?
Speaker 1: Well, let me again, this notion of context.  I was trying to see if I could basically identify a group of essential readings that everyone who wanted to be acquainted with, have some understanding of the African American experience should be familiar with.  And so I wrote to a number of people to see, what would they consider to be sort of essential reading?  And so we have things like 'Up from Slavery' by Booker T. Washington.  The narrative of Frederick Douglass ['The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,' Frederick Douglass].  Richard Wright's 'Native Son.'  We have Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man'; we have Margaret Walker Alexander's 'Jubilee.'  You know, these are books for which if I say to you, "You're acting like Bigger Thomas," you should have some understanding.  Now unfortunately today, many young people, if you say you're acting like Bigger Thomas, they have very little idea; or if you say that, "Black women are like the mules of the world," going back to Zora Neale Hurston's work ['Their Eyes Were Watching God'], many young people have very little idea of what you--you're talking about.  So, I was looking at, and a lot of people were talking about a canon--what's the canon of black life and history so to speak.  And so I--I was trying to identify roughly twelve books that everyone who wanted to be conversant on black life should be familiar with.
Speaker 2: So do you think--
Speaker 1: 'Souls of Black Folk' ['The Souls of Black Folk,' W.E.B. Du Bois].  You know, I mean in fact, as I explain to students, my--you know I--I--I think has to be required reading for everybody in high school.  You shouldn't be able to get a high school degree if you haven't read 'Souls of Black Folk.'
Speaker 2: Okay.  And why is that piece so important?
Speaker 1: Well, W.E.B. Du Bois tells us the importance, the significance of African American history, of African American life.  The idea of dual consciousness.  The idea of being both a Negro and an American, you know.  He said that he would not bleach his African soul to become an American.  He would not give up--you know, can a person be both.  And this is something we struggle with over the past five hundred years if you will, it's something we're still struggling with today.  Do we have to give up our heritage in order to be United States citizens?  And so Du Bois in 'Souls of Black Folk' lays this bare, also in looking at what it means to be a black person in the United States.  He, more than anyone before him, or I would say since his time, has really looked at that, that particular issue.
Story_ID: 650375
Speaker 1: In '87 [1987], you wrote an article called 'The Flowering of Afro-American History' [Robert L. Harris, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Okay, so I've got 'Coming of Age' ['Coming of Age: The Transformation of Afro-American Historiography,' Robert L. Harris, Jr.] (laughter); and then I was asked basically to do a review essay for the American Historical Review, and the American Historical Review is the major historical journal in the United States.  So, I felt honored, you know, to be published in the American Historical Review.  And I was asked to look at three books.  I was asked to look at this book by August Meier and Elliott Rudwick ['Black History and the Historical Profession: 1915-1980'] when they looked at African American--development of African American history.  They looked at--I also included [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's biography of George Washington Williams ['George Washington Williams: A Biography'] as a part of that review essay.  And so okay, we've got 'Coming of Age,' it's there; we've got 'Flowering,' it's now blossomed, blooming, African American history and you know, John Hope Franklin in looking at George Washington Williams, who was one of the first--well we looked at Carter G. Woodson as being the father of African American history, but George Washington Williams wrote what we might consider to be the first scientific study of African American history.  And his book ['The History of the Negro Race in American: 1619-1880'], of course, was a product of--George Washington Williams book was a product of its time, because he was looking at what he considered to be, and many historians of that day were looking at what they called the hidden hand of history.  The providential movement, if you will, of history.  And so, it's, it's a good book for its time.  Something we should be familiar with.
Speaker 1: As a historian, you mentioned George Washington Williams' book, it's often said it's the first scientific black--I mean, treatment of our history.  Of course John Hope Franklin wrote a biography of George Washington Williams.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But what separates George Washington Williams say from William C. Nell [William Cooper Nell] or William Wells Brown, and others who attempted to write history, you know, before him?
Speaker 2: Well, George Washington Williams called upon a variety of sources.  William C. Nell, 'Colored Patriots of the American Revolution' ['The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution,' Harriet Beecher Stowe and William Cooper Nell], and a couple of other publications, they drew upon newspapers basically that they had available to them.  Also, many of these early writers, like Robert Benjamin Lewis in 'Light and Truth,' drew upon the Bible as a source.  And so George Washington Williams was able to use more official documents, records--more the type of thing, type of source that historians would draw upon.  And so, that's why he's seen as, you know, doing one the first scientific histories.
Story_ID: 650376
Speaker 1: You wrote quite a few chapters for anthology histories and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have favorite chapters of these, I mean, or--they range from "Changing Contours of African American History During the Twentieth Century" ["The Changing Contours of African American History during the Twentieth Century"] for 'A Century of American Histori- of American Historiography' ['A Century of American Historiography,' edited by James M. Banner, Jr.] to "A Brief History of Black America" ['Historic Landmarks of Black America'] for Gale Research [Gale Research, Inc.; Gale] in Detroit [Michigan].  An article about Ralph Bunche ['Ralph Bunche and Afro-American Participation in Decolonization,' Robert L. Harris, Jr.], you know, so?
Speaker 2: Well those biographical portraits, if you will, I enjoy doing, especially in trying to gain some better understanding of Ralph Bunche, of W.E.B. Du Bois, I did.  But the one which is one of the more recent essays that I wrote on the changing contours of Afro American history, I mean that was in a book that looked at the interpretation of U.S. history over the 20th century.  And so I was asked to write an essay on African American history.  And in that essay, again going black--(laughter) back to Du Bois, 'The Souls of Black Folk,' I indicate that--I think we pretty much told the story.  Of course, it's going to be retold and as we get more resources it will be better told then it has been.  But I think we've shown the contribution that African Americans have made to the development of the United States.  I mean there are two things that Du Bois points out in 'Souls of Black Folk.'  One is the contribution that we've made to the development of the United States.  The other is the issue of African American identity: who are we?  Are we Negro, are we American?  We're still trying to come to grips with that.  We've not ans- I mean I don't think, I mean we've, you know, approached it, we've taken stabs at it, but we're still working it out.  I mean after all, we've gone from being Africans to colored people to colored Americans, to Afro Americans to Afrique Americans to Negros to blacks to African American.  We haven't fully worked out our identity in the United States; and that's something that I think we're still working on, we're still looking to write about.
Story_ID: 650377
Speaker 1: Now you--you're also responsible for a couple of books, the 'Columbia Guide to African American History Since 1939'--
Speaker 2: Thirty-nine [1939], um-hm.
Speaker 1: --co-edited with [HistoryMaker] Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, right?
Speaker 2: Whom you've interviewed.
Speaker 1: And that was published in 2006?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And another one is 'Teaching African American History' [Robert L. Harris, Jr.] in its third edition published by the American Historical Association in 2001.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are these primary academic books are used in (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the book 'Teaching African American History' is more pamphlet form.  The American Historical Association has this teaching series and so I was asked to do this work on 'Teaching African American History,' which also grows out of a big conference that Darlene Clark Hine organized at Purdue University [Lafayette, Indiana]; and there were people who gave papers.  There was a book that she edited that had essays by individuals like [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin, like oh I'm dropping his name, who is it?  Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts]--it will maybe come to me.  And--Thomas Holt [HistoryMaker Thomas C. Holt] who was at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  A number of individuals wrote essays for that book.  And then I was asked to write this work on 'Teaching African American History.'  And what I tried to do was to show that we--well again, in line with my thinking that while African American history took place within the United States, it still should not be sort of captive to United States history.  So that one of the things historians look at is chronology.  And so I try to suggest a chronology for looking at African American history.  So, we have what I call the transition from Africa to America.  We reach a watershed; and then we have a transformation whereby Africans become African Americans.  And again, there are people who don't fully agree with this, but I say by the 1830s that Africans had become African Americans.  Because when you look at those Africans who were brought to the North American colonies, actually they did not really see themselves as being Africans, they saw themselves as being Igbo or Yoruba--different national groups in Africa.  They melded as a people in the United States and became African Americans.  I suggest that happened by the 1830s, because by the 1830s, you had a--a group that had matured that--there was not the same direct memory of Africa as there had been before.  So I have this transition from Africa to America; transformation, African Americans.
Speaker 1: Was that transformation set in motion too by the cessation of the African slave trade, I mean the actual--I know it didn't cease all together--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) just because of law, but they actually passed laws to keep, you know, stop the African slave trade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but in part, the black population in this country had sort of stabilized.  Because there had been sort of disruptions.  You had a group that was here, then another wave was sort of brought in; but after 1808, you--you have very few waves being brought in.  And so then you have the transition from slavery to freedom.  And the transformation, you know, from being enslaved to becoming free men and women.  And this is something that I suggest did not happen in 1863 or in 1865--it's something that continues on into the 1870s, the 1880s.  And you begin again--maybe this is part of my generational view of things--but by the 1880s, you have the first generation that matures that had not been enslaved.  And so I say that, you know, freedom in that sense by the 1880s.
Story_ID: 650378
Speaker 1: Well, let me just follow through, especially on the teaching of Afro American history ['Teaching African American History,' Robert L. Harris], I see sort of four major periods: the, from Africa to America; from slavery to freedom--and as I say, historians look at periodization and I'm trying to suggest a periodization for African American history.  It doesn't really coincide with the traditional periodization of the United States history, okay.  So then, we have from slavery to freedom; and then we have from countryside to city, the migration.  The migration doesn't start around time of World War I [WWI], I mean there're African Americans who are beginning to leave the South for cities in the sou- urban areas in the South, urban areas in the North.  That movement actually really starts during the 1890s when you have the boll weevil infestation coming through the black belt region of the South.  This was basically the cotton growing region of the South.  So in the 1890s, you begin to have this movement of African Americans from the South to urban areas of the South and to urban areas of the North.  Now, I--I--I tried to disabuse students of the notion that somehow or another, African Americans moved from field to factory--that was the title of a exhibit [Field to Factory: Afro-American Migration, 1915-1940] at the Smithsonian Institution [Washington, D.C.] many years ago.  I mean it's not like they moved from the field to the factory.  They moved from rural areas of the South, urban areas of the South.  Urban areas of the South, urban areas of the North, and then it's during World War II [WWII] they moved to urban areas of the West.  So we have this transition from the, the South to the North.  We have this transformation where African Americans were primarily agricultural workers until really World War II when they became more urban workers, okay.  And then we have the transition from segregation to civil rights.  Going from basically Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896 to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965.  And at this point, African Americans basically become first class citizens of the United States.  Now, I did not flesh out, because when this was published--but we need to look at a period, and I've been toying around with some ideas from civil rights to--to--and again, I'm trying to work out some ideas to--parity maybe.  I mean what is the next transition, transformation.  We go from being first class citizens to being equal--to having parity in American society.  I mean it's something that's--I'm still trying to work through.
Story_ID: 650379
Speaker 1: This is a good time for my colleague's question.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And that is, like as a African American historian, how do you view, I guess in light of these periods, the election of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]?  Now I know you mentioned downstairs when we were eating earlier that you didn't foresee this happening in your lifetime.
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no.  I mean, I was one of those individuals who, when Barack Obama announced that he was going to run for president of the United States, I didn't think he would--he would make it.  I didn't become a believer until after the Iowa caucuses.  Iowa, an overwhelmingly white state, Barack Obama wins the votes there, you know, the delegates in Iowa.  And it was at that point, that I became a believer; I thought, well maybe he's got a chance.  Still wasn't quite sure.  Wasn't necessarily a commentary on Barack Obama, it was a commentary on the country.  I didn't think the country was ready to elect a black man as president of the United States.  And this might take us a little bit far afield, but Barack Obama has got good juju.  Barack Obama has been lucky.  Barack Obama became senator from the State of Illinois because the guy he was running against [Jack Ryan] was so corrupt, the Republican had to drop out of the race and they had to bring in Alan Keyes to run against him.  He gets elected to the United States Senate.  Barack Obama oppose the war in Iraq.  He comes up against Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] who supported the war in Iraq.  Young people, as I say Barack Obama--I just as I lecture in class I say, you know, he's just got some good magic that's been in his favor, because it's the young people who get behind Barack Obama because he had opposed the war in Iraq and Hillary Clinton had supported it.  And then they help to move him across the finish line.  Then he comes up against John McCain.  The economy tanks.  I mean this guy, I mean just like people talking about the whole thing of the chemical weapons in Syria.  And I mean this could have really created a problem for Barack Obama; and they get an agreement with the Soviet Union [sic. Russia] to destroy the chemical weapons in Syria.  The man comes out smelling like a rose when this could've been a real international issue for him.  So there's a saying in French, and I hope I'm not butchering it, but, (speaking French) "Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose"; the more things change, the more they remain the same.
Story_ID: 650380
Speaker 1: Now in that regard, there's an ongoing critique of the Obama administration in the black community--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and in the liberal white community too, but in the black community it's fairly--pretty much led by Cornel West and [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley--they're the leading spokespeople, the leading critics of the Obama administration.  What do you think about their criticism (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there--there's also a lyric that talks about the changing same: so the more things change more they remain the same, the changing same.  How much have things really changed, I mean for the average African American?  This might be the first generation of African Americans whose children will not do better than their parents, because of the widening wealth gap in this country.  We have an intractable, almost portion of African Americans who are impoverished in this country.  So, Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has given African Americans a good sense of feeling good, having a black man in the White House, having a black family in the White House.  But, and this is just my speculation here, in some respects, Barack Obama's election as president of the United States is somewhat similar to Carl Stokes' election as mayor of Cleveland [Ohio]; of--our election as mayor of these major cities that were bankrupt when we became mayors of those cities.  And so African Americans, yes, were able to get these leadership positions; but what did they get and what did Barack Obama get as president of the United States?  It's not his fault, it's the way the country is moving.  It's part of the--I mean United States has basically become deindustrialized.  And so whereas my parents' [Ruby Watkins Harris and Robert Lee Harris, Sr.] generation were able to get good working class jobs working in the steel mills, working in the auto industry, working in the meat packing industry, especially in Chicago [Illinois].  Those jobs are--are--are not there.  I mean, this is a postindustrial society.  And African Americans have not been able to maintain an economic state position in the country.  And it's not just African Americans.  After all, we're the canary in the--in the mine, you know.  And there's the expression that when the country catches a cold, we get the flu; and so we can see that.  I mean, we suffered initially first in the Great Depression; talk about the economic downturn in 2008 we were already beginning to suffer.  You talk about the comeback, we have not comeback.  Unemployment within African American communities in some areas is almost at depression levels.  And so it's almost like a cruel hoax: we've got a black man in the White House, but yet the economic situation for African Americans is worsening.
Story_ID: 650381
Speaker 1: So he's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] there, but we're in a state where we have less, there's less presidential power to be wel- welded--wielded, I guess in the?
Speaker 2: Well it's because of I mean--you know as I mentioned, we're in a postindustrial economy.  We are now in advanced technological society.  And there're fewer opportunities available in this advanced technological society.  An individual with a strong back could become a member of the middle class in this country prior to the late 1960s.  After the late 1960s, it's no longer a matter of being able to get a job, to make a living with your hands.  It's now you've got to have that--that brain power.  And unfortunately, even with the brain power, the opportunities are beginning to narrow.  There's a great deal of emphasis on what they call STEM: science technology, engineering, mathematics.  And while I think we're always going to need historians, we need someone to examine the past, to look at where we've been to help us to determine where we're going to go.  We need individuals in the humanities, we need individuals in the arts; but where are the resources being placed these days in this country.  They're basically being placed in the STEM disciplines: science, technology, engineering, mathematics.  And you know, unless you're in that arena, you know, what are your life chances, what are your opportunities going forward?  It's one of the reasons why, I'm trying to do it subtly, I am really trying to engage to prepare my grandson to be proficient in mathematics, to me that's the future.  What did they say in the movie, I'm trying to remember now--"Plastics."  What was that--that--that movie?
Speaker 1: 'The Graduate' (laughter)?
Speaker 2: 'The Graduate': "Plastics."   Mathematics (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Right.  That's the answer to his career.
Speaker 2: --mathematics.
Speaker 1: "One word--plastics," right.
Speaker 2: Right.  One word: mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650382
Speaker 1: Now you had other duties at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as well as teaching.  What were some of those duties, and?
Speaker 2: Well, I served as special assistant to the provost.  I--I was sort of one foot in administration, one foot in the classroom.  I also served as director of the Africana Studies and Research Center for five years at Cornell.  And we talked about, you know, one of the--some of things that I'd look upon that I really like.  When I was director of the Africana Center, we were able to secure Title VI status in African studies.  We were the only black studies--and there hasn't been one since, black studies department in the country that had Title VI status in African studies--
Speaker 1: Okay, now what's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which was support from the U.S. Department of Education.  It's under the National Defense and Education Act [National Defense Education Act of 1958].  And so we had support for courses in African studies and African language instruction.  And so that was something when I was director of the Africana Center; then I later became special assistant to the provost for six years; and then vice provost for eight years.  And I was vice provost for diversity and faculty development.  I was the chief affirmative action officer for Cornell--looked at issues of recruitment, retention of students, recruitment, retention of--of faculty, both--well students, basically students of color, faculty both male and female faculty.
Story_ID: 650383
Speaker 1: You retired in 2013, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When--I know many people that when they get caught up in the academic life, even though they're writing and as you were doing other duties, have a project that they long to finish that they would like to f- a dream project to finish, and when they retire they have an opportunity to do it.  [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin is one example when he wrote the biography of George Washington Williams ['George Washington Williams: A Biography'].  Now do you have a project, or projects like that?
Speaker 2: Several, several projects.  Number one, I am the national historian for Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.].  Charles H. Wesley who wrote the history of Alpha Phi Alpha from its founding in 1906 to 1976 ['The History of Alpha Phi Alpha: A Development in College Life'], I have now written volume two of the history of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity from 1976 to our hundredth anniversary in 2006 ['The History of Alpha Phi Alpha: A Tradition of Leadership and Service,' Robert L. Harris, Jr.].  And so I'm finishing up that.  That project is basically in place.  There's some final work that needs to be done on it.  But that's one project.  The other project that I'm working on is looking at Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in history and memory.  One of the things that historians look at are myths about the past, and there're these myths that are growing up around Martin Luther King, Jr.  Granted, Martin Luther King, Jr. was a great figure.  Martin Luther King, Jr. helped to usher in the second American revolution--to help the United States to live up to its principles of freedom, justice and equality.  But, many individuals looking at Martin Luther King, Jr. as being the Civil Rights Movement, as if there was no [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, as if there was no James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], as if there was no Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker]; I mean you name the individuals around who supported Martin--as if there was no A. Philip Randolph or Bayard Rustin, as if there was no Ella Baker.  You know, individuals around Martin Luther King.  So, this current generation needs to understand how we have-- and this has been a conscious decision: how we've decided to remember Martin Luther King.  And I've done this in class, I say we're gonna do word association.  I'm going to say something, I want you to say the first thing that comes to your mind.  I say, "Martin Luther King, Jr., what's the first thing that come to your--?"  "I Have a Dream."  Well, we need to understand that speech.  First of all it wasn't called I Have a Dream, it was called Normalcy, Never Again.  We need to read and understand the first part of the speech about the promissory note.  We need to understand Martin Luther King, Jr.'s major speech against the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War] a year before his assassination in 1967 at Riverside Church in New York City [New York, New York] where he said, "They're turning my dream into a nightmare [sic.]."  But we don't hear that.  I mean, it's almost like selective--and I understand why the country would prefer to associate Martin Luther King, Jr. with the dream more so than with the struggle for civil, for human rights, for economic equality in this country.  He was assassinated while he--before he--well, he was assassinated helping sanitation men, garbage workers [in Memphis, Tennessee], right?  He was planning a Poor People's Campaign to bring together poor white people, poor black people.  We don't realize, I mean we see Asian Americans as being somewhat prosperous, but if you go to the Chinatowns of this country, there's poverty.  If you go to Appalachia, there're white people who are poor.  You go on many Native American reservations, there's poverty there.  Martin Luther King was trying to bring these individuals together.  He was trying to make this country realize its promise--indeed, live up to its dream.  And unfortunately, we're moving away from that, but still there're people who would prefer to look things in the abstract, the dream, rather than to look at things in reality.
Story_ID: 650384
Speaker 1: How far along are you with this project on Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got most--most of the research done.  And then I've also started research on a biography of Jerome Holland [Jerome H. Holland] who was All-American football player at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  He was one of about four or five black students on campus during the time that he was there.
Speaker 1: Is that Brud Holland they called him?
Speaker 2: Jerome "Brud" Holland, right.  And he wanted to go into business.  He graduated with honors from Cornell, but he was not able to get an interview with a major corporation when he--his classmates were getting interviews, but he wasn't.  He later worked for this company, and it's not c- the name's not coming to me right now.  In fact, they became supporters of--of him during World War II [WWII].  He helped to be sort of personnel manager for the black dock workers in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He later got a Ph.D. degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He became president of Delaware State.  He worked for the Pugh family, Pugh Company [N.W. Pugh Company, Roanoke, Virginia], and they became financial supporters of him later.  Because he became president of Delaware State College [Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] at a time when it was unaccredited.  He helped to get the accreditation, develop some endowment.  He later became president of Hampton University [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  He became U.S. ambassador to Sweden--Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] appointed him U.S. ambassador to Sweden.  Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] later appointed him as president of the American Red Cross.  He served on more corporate boards during the late 1970s of any African American.  He had a place on the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York].  So here was a man of fantastic accomplishment, fantastic achievement, but who had some questions about black power.  He--and I'm fascinated by him, because he's someone who prepared himself, the doors were closed for him, but once the doors, as he saw it, became open for African Americans in general, he thought that African Americans should take advantage of those opportunities, and should not be involved in things like black power.  So I'm fascinated by him.  And usually when you take on a subject like this, you know, you've got questions.  I mean, how did this individual who was very independent, when he became an All-American at Cornell, they wanted now to give him room and board.  He, he was paying his own way.  He basically continued to pay his own way as an undergraduate.  And so that's another project I'm working on.

Speaker 1: So do you see yourself running out of projects at some point?
Speaker 2: Oh no, because at some point either--I, I hoped that one of my graduate students would do something on the black barber in America.  If I have enough time left, I'd like to do a history of the black barber in the United States.  Because at one time, we dominated barbering in this country; what happened?  If we had been able to devel- well I know in part what happened, segregation.  But if we had--if we had developed that niche, you know.  Most of the caterers in this country at one time were African American.  What if we developed that as a niche, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think the ice cream industry was--we had a hold on that at one time.
Speaker 2: We'd be in a totally different position today.  Totally different.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only pla- the residual of that, correct me if I'm wrong, is the capitol where the barbers are still black and in the White House [Washington, D.C.], I think, right?  For years, they've still been black people doing that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not--I'm not sure.  And there were some people who got a start through barbering and then went on to establish--Alonzo Herndon in Atlanta, Georgia basically was able to develop capital of--
Speaker 1: Of the Herndon insurance agency?
Speaker 2: Right, through barbering.
Speaker 1: Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Insurance Company; Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia] I think it is, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there again, what happened?  When Prudential [Prudential Life Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.] and MetLife [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; MetLife, Inc.] came calling, we couldn't compete.  I mean it's just like the cosmetics industry.  When they began to recognize there was a market out there, you know, the co- Johnson beauty products [Johnson Products Company], so forth.  Today, I think there are only about ten major black insurance companies.  There are only a handful of black cosmetics companies left.  I believe, you heard it here, but the mor- mortuary science, we had a monopoly there.  And over time, people are gonna--and they're already seeing it as a market.
Story_ID: 650386
Speaker 1: Even the shoe repair, we're no longer really in, in shoe repair.  There were large numbers of African Americans, downtown Chicago [Illinois], I mean my father [Robert Lee Harris, Sr.], you know, was fortunate to have his own shoe repair shop [Heeled Bar (ph.), Chicago, Illinois], but there were a number of Af- most of the shoe repair shops were owned by Italian Americans, but they had African Americans also working for them.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You got speed, Larry [Larry Crowe].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, yeah.  We--I thought we were already rolling?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We are.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.  Yeah, so, so these, we're losing ground in occupations that we have traditionally, you know, been on top of or been the dominant force in; and this has been going on for a long, long time.  Well, so do you--as a historian looking along the line, or looking down the pike as they used to say back in the St. Louis World's Fair days [Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missouri], what does--what do you see for us?
Speaker 2: Well, we have our work cut out.  In--especially working with the younger generation.  We've got to really look to mentor in ways, I think--I mean all of us were mentored, all of us stand on the shoulders of other individuals.  But given the nature of things today, we've got to really intensify that effort of mentorship.  We've got to look to inspire the young people.  I mean, education is something that we've got to focus on.  I mean, we've always focused on education, but we've got to focus on it more intensively now.  We've got to give our young people the tools to make it in this advanced technological society.  And many of them, I mean they can work with these computers and what have you, work on the Internet.  I mean, there's still that creativity that's out there.  We do now have, and hopefully some of the younger people will follow these individuals who are taking African American culture, who are really bringing it to the wider world, who are able to advance economically--I'm thinking about the young Jay Zs and even 50 Cents.  I mean, these young men, we--we looked at them, and I must say that I looked at many of them and sort of dismissed them as thugs with--especially some of this gangster rap that they were involved in.  But these young men are creative geniuses; and some of them have applied this to other areas.  We now have some individuals who are showing the way, like a Magic Johnson, in business, economic development.  When you look at the number of basketball players, football players, I mean 60 percent of them go bankrupt after their careers end.  But now there are some role models, hopefully, for them.  I mean, there've always been the role models out there for them, but I think they're taking more of an interest now.  And then we need individuals, sports attorneys.  We need tax accountants, you know, to work with these.  If young people can see these outlets that might be available for them, I think that that's important.  But that's why--you asked me earlier, what's one of my favorite expressions, and it's from the song 'I Believe I Can Fly': "If I can see it, I can be it."  And I think we've got to let our young people see it.  I mean, many of them don't know about the number of black men and women who today are airline pilots; you know, they don't see that as necessarily something that's for them that they can do.  And we've got to bring that to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you've, and you lecture on these topics?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 650387
Speaker 1: There's something going on, I--a couple years ago a friend of mine sent me an email, alarming email about the changes in the administrative policies at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], vis a vis the Africana studies department (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: How you report is different.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of things are becoming different, and it's not to the satisfaction of the old stalwarts of the department.
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: So, how do you feel?
Speaker 2: --wasn't to my satisfaction.  In fact, I had been asked to serve as director of the Africana Center after I left the position as vice provost.  I served in that position for eight years; and I was planning to go back to the faculty and serve out, you know, my years on the faculty and retire, but my colleagues asked me to return as director.  I mean, I'd been back for about a year, they asked me to become director of the Africana Center, and so I agreed to do it.  But then the provost [W. Kent Fuchs] decided that he wanted the Africana Center to report to the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, as opposed to reporting directly to the provost.  Now, again there's a context here.  I opposed it, in fact I resigned as director of the Africana Center because of it.  I understand what was going on in the university, after all I served as vice provost, I was in the meetings of the provost.  For a while I served as part of the president's cabinet at Cornell.  I knew that there was streamlining taking place within the university.  And at most universities, the president is involved more in fundraising than the president used to be.  The provost is becoming more of the chief academic officer of the university as opposed to the--the president.  And so the provost was looking at ways that he could free up his time in order to take on greater responsibilities.  And so, there were three units: there was the institute for public policy [Cornell Institute for Public Affairs]; there was the real estate institute [Center for Real Estate and Finance]; there was the Africana Studies and Research Center reporting directly to the provost.  The provost shed the real estate institute; he shed the public affairs institute; and then he went to shed the Africana Center.  Now, being in administration I understood that.  I did not understand the way that he went about it.  In fact, I asked him, "Can we transition this over a period of time?"  This was an abrupt change for some forty-odd years, forty years we were reporting directly to the provost, and now he's saying we want you to report to the College of Arts and Sciences.  And so I said, "Is there a way that we can have an affiliation with the College of Arts and Sciences initially and then transition into the College of Arts and--?"  No; he wouldn't go for that.  There's this--lots of things that go on in administration.  I mean, every school now has to have a strategic plan.  But there's also this notion of strategic decisiveness: when you make a decision you have to implement it.  And within colle- within academia, things have not moved like that.  I mean, this is one of the reasons why the board of trustees got rid of the president of the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] 'cause they said she [Teresa A. Sullivan] didn't practice strategic decisiveness.  It backfired on them and she's now back as president of the University of Virginia.  But, he made this decision and he was hell bent on implementing it.
Story_ID: 650388
Speaker 1: And so as I say, I resigned as, as director of the Africana Center.  Now I did come back and serve out the spring semester because my colleagues said, "Well, you know, if we don't have someone who's serving as director what--what are we gonna do?"  So I did that for that semester, but that--that was it.  And then, let me complete the story in a way, because we have lots of--I mean we resisted it as much as we could, and we had lots of colleagues around the country who asked us how did this thing turn out?  We are now in the College of Arts and Sciences, and it hasn't been that bad for us right now.  Because College of Arts and Sciences has approved our searching for five new faculty members; and they've helped up in developing a Ph.D. degree program for Africana studies at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  Those five faculty members are all tenured; they can be full professors, they can be associate professors--that's to give stability to the Africana Center.  So I tried to explain this that we lost the war, but we won several battles along the way.  The provost [W. Kent Fuchs] said that he was going to provide more resources for the Africana Center as it was placed in the College of Arts and Sciences, but he never gave us a figure of what those resources would be, okay.  There was the issue of--and by saying he was going to provide more resources for the Africana Center, there were students who said, "Why are you opposing this, why not go into the College of Arts and Sciences?" There were alumni who were saying, "Why are you opposing this? You're gonna get more resources."  For many of us, it was more a matter of principle, you know, and again the way it was done.  By fiat, more so then by--as I say, I talked with him about this and I said, "Let's transition."  So he did come out with a figure, three and a half million dollars for the Africana Center.  Boy when he said that, our support among students was gone, our support basically among alumni was gone.  The president said the Africana Studies and Research Center would maintain its current location--that the College of Arts and Sciences would not be able to interfere with the budget of--now he said for five years--with the budget.  'Cause we were afraid that the budget was gonna be collapsed into the College of Arts and Sciences; and you know, you have demands coming from various departments.  And one of the reasons why the provost did not want to announce that figure is because he had cut the budget of the theater, film and dance department by a million dollars.  So how does he go about cutting them a million, then announcing he's gonna give three and a half million to the Africana Studies and Research Center?  I mean, that did create some resentment on campus against us.  But that was a battle we won.  So our location, maintaining our name, the Africana Studies and Research Center, maintaining our location, getting that funding--those are battles we won along the way.  We lost the war, we're in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So do you see that the--well I guess it's hard to foresee over the five year plan, but do you think the--there's enough support on the part of alumni and students to keep the department?
Speaker 1: Oh I think the department will be there.  What kind of support it gets, and that's where we've got to really work on developing that alumni support, getting alumni to really support the Africana Center financially.  Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] has been very astute at--at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He's developed over a $40 million endowment for the African American studies department, it's now African and African American studies department [Department of African and African American Studies]; and to the Du Bois Institute at Harvard [W.E.B. Du Bois Research Institute].  And he just got a $15 million gift and they've renamed the department--I can't remember the name of the person who gave him, gave them $15 million.
Story_ID: 650389
Speaker 1: Do you see, as a historian looking at our community, residual effects or rippling effect of Africana studies--intense study, you know, rippling out into the community?  In, for community institutions, churches, schools and other institutions?
Speaker 2: I think it's there in the scholarship that's being produced.  How widespread, I'm not sure.  I served on the--I was co-chair of the history, social studies committee for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.  This is looking at professional certification for secondary school teachers--actually it was for middle school and secondary school teachers.  And so, you know, I'm able to influence--was able to influence what teachers should know and be able to do, and to insert African American history into that.  So that's having that kind of effect.  There are school districts I think that are beginning--Philadelphia school system [School District of Philadelphia] for example adopted Darlene Clark Hine's textbook.  So all students in Philadelphia have to study African American history.  If that's a model that might be replicated in other major cities, that would show that influence going out.  And I would hope that there would be more school districts, more schools--I mean, there, there was a time, especially during Negro History Week, Black History Month when the churches all had programs.  I don't think we have as many of those today.  So we've, we've, we've got work to do.
Story_ID: 650390
Speaker 1: As we sit here today, Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] has a series, 'Africans in America' [sic.]--
Speaker 2: 'Many Rivers to Cross' ['The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'].
Speaker 1: --'Many'--yeah, 'Many Rivers to Cross,' and you saw the first episode.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you think, is he on the right track?
Speaker 2: Oh I think he's clearly on the right track, and that he has said himself, it's been, what forty years almost since Bill Cosby had the program on--'Black History: Lost, Stolen or Strayed.'  And so it's time.  I mean we have to do this each generation, we can't think that we've done this and it's finished.  We can't look at--we've given the United States an inoculation of African American history, and now the country is set, you know, like a flu shot or something.  And even with a flu shot, you have to get it each year.  So, we've got to look at ways in which we can tell this story--and of course now with television, with the Internet, there're ways that this can be spread out; with YouTube, there're ways that it can be spread out.  And so what he has said is that he wants to see this series used in schools around the country.  In fact, he said, you know, every time we have a major incident--the murder of Trayvon Martin, people say we need to have a conversation on race in this country.  We talk about it for two weeks and that's it.  He thinks we need to talk about this year round, and that this series will hopefully spark a conversation.  In fact, he said that, you know, we need to study black history not just during Black History Month, but year round.  And this is what Carter G. Woodson wanted us to do.  He wanted to raise a theme each year during Negro History Week, later when we expanded to Black History Month, we want to raise a theme during Black History Month that would be discussed then throughout the remainder of the year.  But you need to have something to set the idea in motion, to get people to thinking about the Emancipation Proclamation, 150th anniversary; to think about the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington.  And then, that's something now people talk about.  And so Skip Gates believes that we should have this conversation on race.  We should look at the trials, the tribulations, the travail, the triumph of African Americans in this country.  And all school children should come to grips with this.  So there's the series, there's also the book that goes along with it ['The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross,' Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Donald Yacovone], and many lessons can come out of that.  Hopefully, teachers, students will look at some of those issues that are being addressed and then we'll study them in--in a bit more depth, more detail; we'll look at the way in which the Harlem Renaissance, the New Negro movement if you will, helped to revitalize this country after World War I [WWI] when many people in this country were looking at what they considered to be man's inhumanity to man.  They were helped to come to grips with their humanity after World War I through the Harlem Renaissance.
Story_ID: 650391
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at your career at all the things you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: You know, I saw that somewhere and I was thinking about it, and it's something I've not given that much thought to.  Because I think if you think about what's going to be your legacy, you don't have time to do the work to take the risk that you need to take.  History will--will have to judge that.  My greatest legacy as I see it is that we have a fine family; three daughters [Lisa Harris Robinson, Leslie Harris Alexander and Lauren Harris]--two lawyers, one civil and environmental engineer; and a grandson, who I hope will become very proficient in mathematics.
Story_ID: 650392
Speaker 1: Now likewise, if you look back at everything you've done to this point again, what--is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Oh, as I--and I--every opportunity I get, I try to talk to young people.  I try to talk to the young historians who are coming along.  And I suggest to them that you should not be reluctant to talk to those individuals who have gone through what you're going through now.  The whole issue, especially for younger historians of looking at tenure, looking at promotion, looking at publishing their work.  I try to give them the benefit of my experience.  And also to recognize that the times are not the same today as they were when I came along.  They're being expected, in many respects, to do more than when I came along.  So, you have to look at your scholarship, for example.  It's all right to be active, to be an activist scholar, but unless you get tenure, you're not gonna be able to keep up that activism within a university setting, and I would say outside.  I mean, [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin because he was anchored in the academy could work with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on the Brown versus Board of Education case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  He could write a brief for that case, okay.  But he was anchored in the academy and I try to get younger historians, especially to realize you need to be anchored.  I also get them to realize that it's your scholarship because the more highly you're valued outside of the institution--I was talking to a young man recently.  We made an offer to him to come to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], young historian.  When he went back to his home institution he said, "I've got an offer from Cornell."  He said we did him the biggest favor in his career to date, 'cause when his institution heard that Cornell was courting him, had made him an offer, he was able in fact take that offer to them.  He said his position at his institution has become so much better for him, that the people there seem to appreciate him so much more; they gave him a raise, reduced teaching load, what have you.  Young scholars, in particular, need to talk with the older scholars.  I tell them that they really have to carve out time to do their work, you know.  That you can't just sort of stretch yourself too thin, that there are ti- when John Hope Franklin worked on the biography of George Washington Williams ['George Washington Williams: A Biography'], and I just use him as an example.  When he worked on his autobiography, 'Mirror to America' ['Mirror to America: The Autobiography of John Hope Franklin'], he pulled away from these other things.  He did not accept, I'm not saying he turned down every speaking engagement, but he did not accept many speaking engagements, because there was that work he wanted to do, he wanted to complete.  And so, you know, the younger scholars, especially coming along, they look at the work that these others have done, but in many ways they don't realize, they don't understand the time they put in; they don't understand how there're points in which you have to develop, as I refer to it, you have to develop a tunnel vision, bore in, get that work done; then the other stuff will come.
Story_ID: 650393
Speaker 1: What's the most valuable quality an African American historian has to have in order to make a major contribution to the community?
Speaker 2: Well of course there--there has to be a commitment, and you know, even though I just talked about having tunnel vision, doing your--your--your work, you have to be willing to share that work; and so there're times when I have to pull away, there's work to be done.  Then once that work is finished, I can go out, I can share that--that--that work with others.  I think you have to have a sense of passion and you have to do the work in a way that's going to interest others.  We can't become too narrowly focused.  I mean, one of the things that I resisted, although given the nature of things, the amount of scholarship that's out there that you try to keep up with.  Within the historical profession, there're many individuals who are specialist in the Antebellum period, that's it, that's all they work in, that's all they work on, you know; and there are only about ten other people who read their work (laughter).  We--we--we--we--we've got to--we've got to be willing to make contributions where we're able to make them, to help improve things.  And in this essay that I--I wrote that has been reprinted, on the institutional and intellectual development of Africana studies ['The Intellectual and Institutional Development of Africana Studies,' Robert L. Harris, Jr.], I end that essay by saying Africana studies for what?  And that's a question I want, you know, my colleagues to ponder, that I want young scholars coming along to ponder.  So, for example, I've tried to write in and to work in a number of different media.  I've written for popular journals, magazines, newspapers.  I've also written for the academic journals.  I've worked in the mainstream historical organizations.  I was program committee chair in 1995 for the American Historical Association.  I've also worked in the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.  I serve as president of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.  I attend meetings of the National Council for Black Studies.  After talking with you and meeting some of my other colleagues at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I'm curious about ASCAC [Association of the Study of Classical African Civilizations]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and will attend one of those meetings.  We need to be seen at these, these, these meetings, you know.  We can't cloister ourselves in the ivory tower and leave it at that.
Story_ID: 650394
Speaker 1: I have one last question--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but is there anything we haven't discussed so far, I know you've--I'm glad you got in some of your other activities with boards and presidency of ASALH [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] and other things; but is there anything we haven't talked enough about or haven't mentioned before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay, well the one thing I would like to mention is that I had an opportunity, and unfortunately the year is escaping me, of attending the first international conference on reparations [Pan-African Conference on Reparations] in Abuja, Nigeria.  And I was at that meeting with Ron Walters [HistoryMaker Ronald Walters] who is a part of our, our delegation, as well as Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] was in the delegation and I met, you know, a number of individuals across the African continent.  I was very pleased to be asked to give the Martin Luther King, Jr. Lecture [ph.] in 2005 I think it was, during the fiftieth anniversary of Ghanaian independence in Accra, Ghana.  So, I've had a bit of an international dimension to my career.  If you look at my CV [curriculum vitae], I've got a couple of articles that have been published in Italian from a conference that I attended in Turin--Torino, Italy.
Speaker 1: There was one--in that regard, there was one in Sardinia [Italy] back in I think two thou- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was in Turin, Italy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, you're talking about one in Turin, but there's one in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, not in Sardinia.
Speaker 1: No, there was one in Sardinia that I saw the--I saw the conference program for, a conference that lasted for a solid week--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) where scholars from Europe, Asia, and the United States participated in a study of African Americans.
Speaker 2: Oh no, I wasn't at that one.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I'm just raising that because, I mean I think sometimes we take our own story (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh we've got to look--we've got to look internationally.
Speaker 1: This is something that Buzz Palmer [HistoryMaker Edward "Buzz" Palmer] showed me, and it was Maria Diedrich, the woman who wrote--
Speaker 2: Okay from Germany, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, she was the conference chair at this conference.  They come from all over.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This--this--this, I mean it's international interest in the African American experience.  And I mean after all when you look at the African American experience, you look at the independence movements in Africa, many of those independence leaders studied in the United States.  When you look at movements in Europe, in Asia, I mean in--in Europe solidarity, they were singing 'We Shall Overcome' in--in Poland.  So yeah, there're many places that look--.  And today, in Japan in particular, the young people there look at the hip hop movement in the United States.  So we have this international influence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I just wanted--I just wanted--so your conference in Turin, was that a similar kind of experience where people from all over were?
Speaker 2: Yes, but we were discussing a number of international issues.  I was looking in particular at the whole issue of human rights and the United Nations--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in my presentations there.
Story_ID: 650395
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be re- you know, that--that--that--that really is a--is a tough question.  I just--and I don't know who this expression comes from, but, you know, I--I try to do the best I could with what I had for my time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, very good and very interesting.  I mean you know, some of these things you haven't thought about.
