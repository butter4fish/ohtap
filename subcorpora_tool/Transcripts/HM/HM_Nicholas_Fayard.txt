Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fayard Antonio Nicholas, that's me.
Speaker 1: All right.  And there's a story about your first name, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  When I was born my mother [Viola Harden Nicholas] wanted to name me something besides Tom, Dick or Harry.  And she had a French friend who was there, and the French friend said, "Name him Fayard."  And my mother, "Oh, that's odd and it's, it's original.  Well, all right, he's Fayard."  And so it's the last name of the French.  And I use it as the first name.

I remember I was walking down the street--this is when we, we were in the, the Broadway show 'Babes in Arms'; and walked down the street, and there was a broker who sold tickets for all the Broadway shows.  And he'd come up to us when he'd see us walking, and he says, "Hello, Moe, what do you know"?  And we'd say, "We just got back from Vaudeville show".  He'd say, "Can you dance?"  We'd say, "We'll take a chance, well, skeet, scat, skeet to scat".  And that's how we became Big Moe and Little Moe (laughter).

Speaker 2: Oh, 1892?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, and my father's name was Ulysses, Ulysses D. Nicholas.
Speaker 1: Do you know what the "D" stood for?
Speaker 2: I think it was Dominic.  I don't know how to spell it (laughter).

Speaker 2: He was born in Mobile, Alabama too.
Speaker 1: Okay, I did read that there was a year for him as--?

Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Do you remember?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.  It's spelled, his name is U-L-Y-S-S-E-S, Ulysses.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, let me ask you about your mother's side of the family first and then your father's side too.  But you were telling us that your mother grew up in Mobile, and she was, she played the piano.
Speaker 1: She played piano, yes.  That's what she majored in, in college, yes.  And my father played drums.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, where did your mother go to school?
Speaker 1: When?
Speaker 2: No, where did she go to college, do you know?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Was it in Mobile?

Speaker 2: Okay, now, do you know much about your--did you ever meet your grandparents on either side or know anything about the history of the family?
Speaker 1: No, I don't, no, I'm sorry.  That was something I never knew about.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you never knew your grandparents?
Speaker 1: No, never did know or met them.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Now, shortly after you were born, the family moved from Mobile?
Speaker 1: Yeah, moved from Mobile, yes, and did a lot of traveling.
Speaker 2: Was it in pursuit of show business?
Speaker 1: In show business, yes, 'cause mother played piano, father played drums.  And they had an orchestra that they traveled with.  And they, they--I remember they traveled here in Chicago [Illinois], Chicago, where my sister [Dorothy Nicholas Morrow] was born and Winston-Salem [North Carolina] where my brother [Harold Nicholas] was born.  And then, then after that we went to Baltimore, Maryland, and the last place was Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], was the last place.  And we traveled right along with them.
Story_ID: 11371
Speaker 1: Let me backtrack a little bit and just ask you the names of your, of your siblings, your sister was born first, right, after you, right?
Speaker 2: My sister was born after, after me, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were born in 1914, your sister was born in 1920?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: What's her name and--?
Speaker 2: Dorothy, Dorothy Nicholas [Morrow].
Speaker 1: And your brother was born in '21 [1921], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1921, March 17.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: Harold Nicholas.  I, I named him when, when he was born.  I was so--I loved Harold Lloyd from the movies, the silent movies.  And when my mother [Viola Harden Nicholas] didn't know what to name him, I said, "Ma, name him Harold Lloyd."  So he became Harold Lloyd Nicholas.
Story_ID: 11372
Speaker 1: Now, did you go to the movies a lot when you were young?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved the movies, all the silent movies.  I loved seeing Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin, Rudolph Valentino, Lillian Gish, Claude Ball (ph.), all these silent movie, movie stars.  And, well, because I would go to the theater every day where my parents were.  They, they played music for the silent movies.  And so, so I would go there every day, and that's how I became to like movies.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Harold Lloyd was one of your favorites in the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Harold Lloyd, yes.
Speaker 1: I think that people watching this, this interview maybe in the future may not know who Harold Lloyd was, and but he was somewhat of an acrobat, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, he, yes, he was.  And he would always wear glasses.  But the, they, there was no glass there (laughter).  It was a big--it was a hole in both sides of, of his glasses, and when he took--he looked better with the glasses on (laughter).  And he, he was my favorite.  Did you ever see the movie when he was hanging from this clock on a building?  Oh, he was fantastic, and I, I was crazy about him.
Speaker 1: Were you inspired to try some of the stunts that you saw him--?
Speaker 2: Oh, not, not like that, not hanging from--(laughter).  But I, I did gymnastics in school, and so I just put it together with my tap dancing, and I taught my brother [Harold Nicholas].
Story_ID: 11373
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, I mean what were some of the--can you tell us what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, when you want to smell something, I'd like roses (laughter).  That's good to smell.  And I like going sightseeing.  It's when I'd see all these tall buildings in New York, Manhattan, those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what else did you ask me?
Speaker 1: No, and so what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  I mean what was your neighborhood like or neighborhoods and what was it like to travel so much as a young kid?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved traveling.  Before we did a lot of traveling by car and by trains, and so, so it--I was so young then.  And I would like to see all the different sights when I'm, when I'm on a plane, I'd look out the window, and there I'd see horses and cows (laughter), and see the green grass and the trees and all those things, very exciting when I was younger.
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of a little boy were you when you were growing up?  How would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd describe myself as a little boy who liked everybody.  I always wanted to be friends with everybody.  I didn't like to have enemies.  And I wasn't prejudiced.  I mean we, well, I'd see, I'd play with kids of all races, and, and I could see that we're different colors, but it didn't matter because I wanted to be friends with everybody.  I've always been that way, always been that way that, that I, I loved people, and I want them to, to like me.  And I would have no prejudice at all, cause everybody is the same to me.  So that's the way I grew up.  And my parents were wonderful parents cause they taught us right from wrong.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about your parents that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can say they were wonderful parents, and they really looked out for my brother, my sister and me.  And we loved them so much because they took good care of us, the greatest parents in the world.  And I would say that I loved them so, so much.
Story_ID: 11374
Speaker 1: Did you have a tough time trying to keep up with schoolwork when you were on the road so much?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, 'cause I would be changing schools as I was going.  But it worked out well, well, wherever I'd go 'cause I'd start where I left off.  And, but when my brother [Harold Nicholas] and I started to do our thing in show business, we, we had a tutor to travel with us, a private teacher.  And that, that, that helped us with our education.  So, so--because that, that's what the law is.  You must have your education even though you're working on the stage or whatever you're doing.  And it, it worked out well.
Story_ID: 11375
Speaker 1: Now from what I've read, you taught yourself--.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: --to dance.  And, but did you have--who were you inspired by?  Did you--because you saw a lot of the vaudeville--.
Speaker 2: I saw a lot, lot of the vaudeville entertainers.  Yes, I saw--at the Standard Theatre in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I saw Buck and Bubbles, and John Bubbles was a great, great rhythm tap dancer.  I saw Willie Bryant and Leonard Reed there.  I saw Peaches and Duke.  And I, I liked what I saw on that stage cause I was there to hear my parents play for them, and then watched everybody on stage.  And I liked what I saw, and I said, they're having fun up there.  I'd like to be doing something like that.  So just by watching, I taught myself how to perform.  And I'd go to our apartment and start trying to do the things that I saw.  Now, one evening at our apartment, I was rehearsing, and my father [Ulysses Nicholas] saw me.  And he said, "Son, what you do is great," but he said, "Don't do what the other people do.  Do your own thing."  I said, "Okay, Dad."  And he said, "There's another thing, when you're performing, don't look at your feet.  Look at the audience because you're entertaining them, not yourself."  And then he said, "There's something else you do, son, that I like very much."  I said, "What is that, Dad?"  He said, "I like the way you use your hands."  He said, "Do more of that."  And so I said, "Okay, Dad."  And so, one day I went to this, one of these rehearsal calls.  And I had my little record player with me.  And they had mirrors on the wall.  So I'm looking at myself in these mirrors and performing, and then I said, that's what my father was talking about.  And so I got together with myself, and creating the Nicholas Brothers' style.  And I taught my brother [Harold Nicholas] this, and that's how we became the Nicholas Brothers.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a seven year gap between you and your brother, right, in terms of age?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum, in terms of age.
Speaker 1: And in the beginning, now, was your brother interested in dancing before you started--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, because I started dancing before I taught him.  I used to do some, plays in schools, and so he, he would see me.  And he said, "I want to learn that."  And I said, "Okay."  So I started teaching him to do these different steps that I created.  And I remember one evening I was teaching a certain step.  And he was having trouble.  And I said, "You're having trouble now, so we'll do it tomorrow."  He said, "No, I want to learn it now."  I said, "No, no, no, let's do it tomorrow--right now." I said, "Okay."  So after about an hour, I taught this step, and he, and he got it.  And when he got that step, he never lost it (laughter), yes, he was, he was great.  My brother was something.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had a natural talent for dance too.?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, he, yes.  He, he could do everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you taught your sister [Dorothy Nicholas Morrow] how to dance too, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I taught her too.  And we got a little, got, act together with her, with the three of us, and we called ourselves the Nicholas Kids.  But she, she didn't last long with us because at nine o'clock, she'd had it.  She's got to go to bed (laughter).  So we told her, look, go on to school, and get your education, and we're gonna do the working.  And we'll put you through school.  And that's when we became the Nicholas Brothers, but people still called us Nicholas Kids.
Story_ID: 11376
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Ulysses Nicholas and Viola Harden Nicholas]--did they push you sort of into being performers, 'cause a lot of, you know, you hear a lot of stories about children of performers, their parents are grooming them all the time and pushing them out there, and all this kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, I know what you mean, yeah.  I remember one evening my brother [Harold Nicholas] and I we were rehearsing.  And the parents were coming from the theater, and it was, it was late.  And they came into the living room, and they saw all the lights were on.  She said, well, "What are you doing up?  You've got all the lights on here and what's happening?"  And we said, "Sit down, we want to show you something."  So they sat down.  And we started singing a song, and going through all these routines, and my mother and father looked at each other and said, hey, we got something here.  So they gave up their orchestra to manage us.  And then, that's--I remember at the theater where they, they had their orchestra and played there, my parents took us to this theater, called the Standard Theatre [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and the manager of the theater's name was J. T. Gibson.  And they, my father said to, to the manager of the theater, "I think my, my sons have a little talent.  I'd like for them to work here."  So go up and get up on stage.  So we got up on stage.  We started to singing a song and didn't do any dance, and, and the manager said, "That's it.  You don't have to do any more.  You're booked here next week" (laughter).  And so that's how we started.  And so my parents became our manager.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you basically had that fire to perform, you know, on your own initially.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, we wanted to, to be in show business, and when my parents found out we had this challenge--this talent, they said, fine, fine.  They didn't push us into it cause we wanted to do it, wanted to do it.  And so they encourage us to do, to do what we wanted to do and rehearse and become good entertainers.
Story_ID: 11377
Speaker 1: Now, can you remember the first time that you all performed on stage together as the Nicholas Kids?
Speaker 2: Yes, and let me see.  I think it was one time we performed in a burlesque theater (laughter) in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (laughter).  And that's where they had all the girls doing the striptease and everything.  It was, it was really something because when we got on that stage, the audience forgot about the ladies stripping.  They liked theses little guys, the Nicholas Kids, and we stopped the show every, every day we stopped the show.  And that was our first one in, I think it was in 1929 we did our first performance in a burlesque theater.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know any of the other, any of the children that were performing in those days.  I know Sammy Davis, Jr. started young.  I don't know if you ever ran across him when he was still young--?
Speaker 2: When he was still, no, no.  No, we didn't run across him at that time.
Speaker 1: Or the Step Brothers or?
Speaker 2: No, I--we, we did most of our things in Philadelphia because most of the entertainers were in New York, and so we did most of our vaudeville shows in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, okay, now, you all, you say you were show stoppers.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's what they called us, the show stoppers.
Speaker 1: What I read is that people didn't follow you all.
Speaker 2: That's it, yeah (laughter), they didn't want to follow us (laughter).
Story_ID: 11378
Speaker 1: When we opened up at, at the Cotton Club  [Harlem, New York] in 1932 with Cab Calloway and his orchestra, they said, here are the Nicholas Brothers, they're gonna close the show 'cause I'm sure nobody will, will want to follow them.  And so that's what happened.  So we, we closed the show.  And the audience would want more, more and more.  And so Cab Calloway would call us out and said, "Aren't these boys wonderful?"  And the audience said, "Yes".  And then Cab would look at my brother [Harold Nicholas] and say, "I understand, Harold, that you do an impression of me."  My brother would say, "Oh, yes, I can."  He said, "All right, let's see."  Now, at the Cotton Club, there was a microphone that came from the ceiling.  But my brother couldn't reach it.  So Cab Calloway told--called the waiters and said, "Break out a table."  So he picked my brother up and put him up on the table so he could reach the microphone, and that's when he started to singing "hi de hi de hi", 'Minnie, the Moocher', and, and Cab was beaming.  And as, as my brother would say, "hi de hi de hi" and we'd say, "hi de hi de hi", and stop the show again.
Speaker 2: From what I understand too, from what I understand, from what I read that Cab Calloway and your brother would have a dueling kind of scat going on.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Scat--Cab would scat and your brother would scat.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, they had that thing like that, and see who's gonna be the winner.  But in, it wound up as a tie (laughter) 'cause my brother always, he, he learned to scat just like Cab could.
Speaker 2: Oh, just back to the beginning of the Cotton Club, do you remember how you all got booked at the Cotton Club or how you got, you know?
Speaker 1: Oh, we, we were working at a theater called the Lafayette Theater in Harlem, New York.  And the, the manager of the Cotton Club saw us at the Cotton--'cause he'd heard so much about these Nicholas Brothers.  People were talking about us all, everywhere, in New Jersey, in Chicago [Illinois], in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and other cities.  And so he, he wanted to go see who were these Nicholas Brothers.  And his name was Herman Starks (ph.), the manager of the Cotton Club.  And he saw us there, and he talked 'em--our parents [Ulysses Nicholas and Viola Harden Nicholas], and he said, "I'd like for you to bring your boys to, to the Cotton Club.  We're starting a new show there with Cab Calloway.  And maybe they can be in the show."  And so we arrived at the Cotton Club and Bill ['Bojangles'] Robinson was there, Ethel Waters was there, Cab Calloway was there, Duke Ellington was there, Lena Horne was there.  They were all there for this rehearsal of this new show at the Cotton Club.  And so the manager of the Cotton Club said to us, he said, "Fellows, get up on stage and do something for everybody."  We said, "Okay."  We got up there, and we sang a song and did a little dance, and after we finished, Cab Calloway--no, no, it wasn't Cab Calloway.  It was Duke Ellington.  Duke Ellington said, "These boys are original."  I said, "Thank you, Mr. Ellington."  I said, "You are original too" (laughter), and everybody laughed.  So we opened up in the, the new show at the Cotton Club in 1932.  And we stayed there two years before going any other place.
Story_ID: 11379
Speaker 1: Sir, could you tell us, what did your act [with The Nicholas Brothers] consist of?  How would you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, when we first started out, I--we start off with a little soft shoe dance.  And after that we do a rhythm tap dance.  And for the finale, we do--it's a song called 'The Bugle Call Rag', and that's when we would do these splits and, and acrobatic tumbles and all of that and always stopped the show.  People wouldn't get--couldn't get enough of us.
Speaker 1: Now, you're famous for one of the most famous moves that you perfected, and, and you did this and taught it to your brother [Harold Nicholas], I guess, was the jumping split, where you jump out and actually go into a split.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you learn that and who inspired you to do that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember, oh, it was a long time ago.  It was in Baltimore, Maryland at a theater where my parents [Ulysses Nicholas and Viola Harden Nicholas] were, were playing.  And I saw it--a guy came out on stage and his name was Jack Wiggins.  And I saw him go down into a split and come up.  I said, "Oh, that's neat.  I'd like to do that."  And so I went down to do it, but I, I did it in a way that I would jump and go down and do the split.  But he just went down like this and came up.  And I would go, walking down the street, and I'd jump over a hydrant and jump over the bushes into a split, and did it very carefully.  I didn't hurt myself (laughter).  And then I taught my brother.  And we got our act together.  So we incorporated the acrobatic with the splits, with the tapping.  And that's, that's how we became the Nicholas Brothers with our style.  And we used the whole body and, you see, the, the feet would--was great down there, but we used the whole body and our hands, put it all together, and that's how we, we created our style of the Nicholas Brothers.  And a lot of people tried to imitate us, but they couldn't get the hands like the Nicholas Brothers (laughter).  The, the feet were going all right, but, but we had this style with class and personality.
Speaker 1: Well, the acrobatics too seemed to--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --probably were a challenge for people, I guess, too, cause I don't, I don't think I've ever seen anybody else try it, that kind of--a jumping split.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it was something that we created.  And there were--several tried, but they wasn't successful.  They tried, but, but it wasn't--they would do certain things, but they didn't have the class.  When we did it, see, some would just go wham, and, and (laughter) wouldn't come up with any class.  And, but we did it, ah, and bring it up, boy (laughter).
Speaker 1: So y'all were cool--.
Speaker 2: We were real cool (laughter).
Story_ID: 11380
Speaker 1: So you were at the Cotton Club [Harlem, New York] and you all performed--did you perform exclusively with Cab Calloway?
Speaker 2: Well, we performed there with Cab Calloway and then Duke Ellington would come in, see.  Cab Calloway would be there about six months.  And then they'd start a new show, and they'd bring Duke Ellington in.  And Duke Ellington would do his thing.  And so they would--every six months they would change the shows.  And I remember one time we worked there with Jimmie Lunceford.  He was there, and we worked with him.  And so it was always a big band there.  And we were doing our thing with all of them, and it worked well.  And we always (laughter) stopped the show, were the last ones on, closed the show.  And, and that was when we became Nicholas Brothers, the Show Stoppers.
Story_ID: 11381
Speaker 1: Now, you were at a lecture last night where you indicated that the Cotton Club [Harlem, New York] was a--at the Cotton Club was the first time you really experienced racism where you could really understand it.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And there were a lot of things going, and there're also some good things too, but could you explain the racism part.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Well, here was the Cotton Club in Harlem, where black people lived, but they couldn't go to the Cotton Club.  And I didn't like that at all.  I, I, not at all.  I, I couldn't understand it.  And that's when I faced, found out about this segregation because like I said before I always went to integrated schools and there was nothing going on wrong about the, the races in, in the schools.  And I couldn't understand why they couldn't go to the Cotton Club, and they lived in that area of Harlem.  But I, I guess we were lucky.  We [The Nicholas Brothers] were lucky because even though we--we were just, we were just little kids.  We could go through the front door of the Cotton Club.  And, and then go right back to, to our dressing room.  Now, the, the rest of the class--the cast of the show, they couldn't do that.  They couldn't do it.  And so I just said it's because we were so young, but I'm glad we did this 'cause I think we started something.  We started integration when we were there.  See, when the Cotton Club opened at 48th Street and Broadway, downtown, in New York City, everybody could go there.  And, and so I, I said, maybe it's because of my brother [Harold Nicholas] and because we were gentlemen, and we, we were like the pioneers.  We helped where people could go, all races could go to the Cotton Club downtown, Broadway.  And, yeah, because I remember we were at the Cotton Club, and I saw all these different stars sitting out there in the audience.  And I wanted to meet them because I'd seen them in movies, on the stage, and I wanted to get--so I said to the manager of the Cotton Club, who, who was our manager at the time, I said, "I'd like to go out and meet these wonderful stars."  He said, "Go on out there."  I said, "Okay."  So I, I said, when I found out later that we could go there, and the rest of, of the performers couldn't go.  So I said maybe it's because we were just little boys, but we were gentlemen because we went to a table and Tallulah Bankhead was there.  And we said hello.  And she said, "Hello, I just saw you; you boys were wonderful," said, "Sit down.  What will you have?"  And we'd say, "We'd like some orange juice, please".  So we started talking to Tallulah Bankhead.  And all the other entertainers who were there, like Eleanor Powell was there and Jimmy Durante, George Raft, the Marx Brothers, and many, many other celebrities were there.  So they wanted to talk to us too.  But we was talking to Tallulah Bankhead.  And so Tallulah Bankhead said to my brother, said, "When is your birthday?"  And my brother said, "It's this month, March 17."  And she said, "Oh, would you like to have a big picture of me for your birthday?"  He said, "Yes, I'd like to have that picture."  She said, "Well, would you like to have a bicycle?"  Oh, said, "Yes, I'd like to have a bicycle too."  She said, "Well, which would you prefer, the picture or the bicycle?"  He said, "I'd like both of them if I can get them (laughter)."  She says, "Okay, you will get both of them."  And the next day the postman brought this picture and this bicycle for my brother.  And my brother rode that bicycle all over (laughter), all over New York.  And, and that was a first meeting with Tallulah Bankhead.  And, and because we were there and we were little boys and we were gentlemen, and everybody saw we, they--everybody liked us.  And I think we, we created this thing of integration for, for all races to go to the Cotton Club.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't, I hadn't realized that the Cotton Club moved from Harlem to downtown.
Speaker 2: Oh, you didn't know that?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, they did.  They moved downtown at 48th Street and Broadway.  And everybody could go there.
Speaker 1: Okay, when did it move?  Do you remember the year?
Speaker 2: I think the year was--let me think.  It was 1937, I think, I think that was the year because when we first went to the Cotton Club uptown, it was in 1932 and stayed there two years before going any other place.
Story_ID: 11382
Speaker 1: During the same period of time [1930s] you all were involved in movies.  I think a first--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --the first movie, when was the first movie?
Speaker 2: First movie that we made was called 'Pie, Pie Blackbird' where, for Eubie Blake and his orchestra and Nina Mae McKinney.  And that, that was the first one.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: It was, it was 1932.  And it was a short for Warner Brothers that we made in New York.  We made three films with them.  The next one we made with them was the all-colored, colored, yeah, all colored vaudeville show, with Adelaide Hall.  Then the next one we made was the 'Black Network', where we, my brother and I, and we sang and, and danced this song called 'Lucky Numbers'.  And those were the three films we made for Warner Brothers in New York.  And you can get them in video shops now, yes (laughter), our first films.
Speaker 1: Okay, so those were actually shot in New York City, huh?
Speaker 2: All of 'em were shot in New York.
Speaker 1: And there was another movie you made called 'Kid Millions'.
Speaker 2: "Kid Millions" with--.
Speaker 1: It was nineteen--.
Speaker 2: In nineteen--.
Speaker 1: 1934, I think.
Speaker 2: 1934, yeah, with Eddie Cantor.  And that was the first one, movie we made when--in Los Angeles [California], Hollywood, we made, made this film.
Story_ID: 11383
Speaker 1: How was that experience--going out to Hollywood?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that was, that was something (laughter).  Samuel Goldwyn, the producer of, of Eddie Cantor's films, saw us [The Nicholas Brothers] at the Cotton Club [New York, New York], and he said, "I'm doing a film."  We went to his table, and he said, we're--"I'm doing a film out there in Los Angeles called 'Kid Millions' with Eddie Cantor.  And I'd like for you guys to be in that film."  I said, "Fine."  I said, "We'll get together with our parents and see what can be done."  So we did.  And we signed the contract, and when we got, got to Los Angeles [California] to do this film, right away, we got together with Eddie Cantor.  And he said, "Oh, I'm so happy to meet you boys.  I, I've seen you at the Cotton Club and other places."  And he said, "This is gonna be a great film.  Oh, you're gonna love it."  I said, "Yes, I think so with all the pretty Goldwyn girls, it's gonna be really nice."  Now, Ethel Merman was in that film, Ann Sothern was in it, [Jesse] Block and [Eve] Sully, a comedy team were in it.  Yeah, Ed--Eddie, no not Eddie--George Murphy--Ann Sothern, Ethel Merman and Block and Sully were, were in this film.  And we, we had a number right--that we did with, with Eddie Cantor.  And was, it was called 'Mandy'.  He would sing the song with Ethel Merman and it was a, it was a thing where we were in the back of Eddie Cantor, and my brother would go to one side of him--when you see it on the screen, you don't see us in the beginning, then you see us, and we do a little time step with him, oh, boy.  And then we--I said--so my brother [Harold Nicholas] would, would do a step, and then after he would finish, then I would do a step.  And now, Eddie Cantor, he would try to do a step right then, and my brother would grab him and say, "Don't, not yet, wait till get his in".  So I did it (laughter) too, do a step, and Eddie Cantor would start to do something after me, and I'd stop him.  I'd say, "Let him do it" (laughter).  And then we'd do like that, and the last thing is, Eddie Cantor started and my brother grabbed him by, by his legs like this, said, "Wait a minute, no, don't you do it; my brother's gonna do it now".  And then after I finished, then the two of us would say, "Now, take it (laughter)."  And he, he dances off the stage and leaves us there, and we finish the dance.  That's the way we did it with Eddie Cantor (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that was your first Hollywood film?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the first one, um-hum.
Speaker 1: 'Kid Millions'.
Speaker 2: 'Kid Millions', yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Kid Millions' 1934.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Eddie Cantor was a big star then.
Speaker 2: He was a big star then.  Oh, yes, big star.
Story_ID: 11384
Speaker 1: After we [The Nicholas Brothers] finished the film, and we'd go on a tour of California to different cities like San Francisco and Oakland and do vaudeville.  And after we finished that we--oh, yes, and we also did the Coconut Grove, when the Coconut Grove bill was in, in Los Angeles in 1934.  Then we'd go back to the Cotton Club [New York, New York].  We could come back to the Cotton Club in New York any time we want, even if the show had started without us.  The manager would be, held--we'd have a spot in the show, yeah.  And then we'd, we'd be at the Cotton Club for a while.  Then we'd come back to Los Angeles, Hollywood, to another film called 'The Big Broadcast of 1936'.  We did that.  And, and that had many, many celebrities like Bing Crosby was in it and Ethel Merman and Kate Smith, Jack Oakie, George Burns and Gracie Allen were all in this film.  And we were in this film in a radio station.  And Jack Oakie was, was the star of this radio show where--and we were like part of the entertainment in it.  I would, I would be on drums and, and my brother would be dancing, tap dancing over the radio (laughter).  And then later on, well, we'd sing, sing a song.  And so that was the second film in Los Angeles, Hollywood.
Speaker 2: Now, was Jack Benny was in 'The Big Broadcast of 1936' too?
Speaker 1: Not the one, not 1936, no.  He was another one.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And Bob Hope was also in 'The Big Broadcast', but this one was before that.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, when--now 'The Big Broadcast' from what I've heard you were very satisfied with your performance in that movie because it was--you all had speaking roles--.
Speaker 1: Had speak--yes.  That's right.  We had speaking roles in there, and we were a part of the script.  And--.
Speaker 2: And that was special right, because that's not usually the case, right, because in many films that you all were in, you all just had different--had numbers--?
Speaker 1: We just had, sing--we'd sing and we danced, and that was it, yeah.  But those, those five minutes that we appeared on that screen made us famous all over the world.  Some people would go to see the film just to see the Nicholas Brothers (laughter).  And so, so we--like I, I wasn't too bitter about not having a, being a part of the script because just those five minutes or more, all over the world, people loved the Nicholas Brothers.  And they'd welcome us whenever we'd go to different countries like France or England or Sweden, they were there waiting, waiting for the Nicholas Brothers at the airport to see them, to greet them.  And so even though we didn't have lines in the films, we were very famous for those five minutes.
Story_ID: 11385
Speaker 1: I was thinking when you mentioned, when we were talking about Eddie Cantor, Eddie Cantor was an actor, like a lot of the vaudevillians that performed often in blackface.
Speaker 2: That's true, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did the old minstrel type stuff.  In those days, there was sort of a--when you all were coming along, there was sort of a transition out of that, wasn't it?  It was starting to move away from the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the blackface, anyway, even if the same songs were being song, you know, into something new.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--.
Speaker 1: Did you all see that?  Did you kind of see that transition take place when you were kids?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Eddie Cantor, yes.  This, this number that he did with us, he had on the blackface 'cause it, it was a minstrel show that, that was performed on a ship that, that where--that we were performing.  And so they put the, the show on.  Like George Murphy was the interlocutor who would introduce Eddie Cantor and, and Ethel Merman, they would be on the--you've seen those minstrel shows, haven't you?
Speaker 1: Well, to tell the truth, no.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And a lot of people today have never seen one.  Actually, they--you've seen, you see excerpts of what it's supposed to be like, but you've never really--I've never really seen an actual minstrel show from start to finish.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about what it's, what it's actually--?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there--it would be the different comedians.  One would sit on one side of the stage and the other, other one on the other side.  And they would tell jokes.  And the interlocutor would, would say something to them, different jokes.  Let me see, how, how--what were some of 'em.  If I can remember it, Eddie Murphy [sic, George Murphy] would say to Eddie Cantor, or Eddie, or Eddie Cantor would say--Eddie Cantor would say to the interlocutor, "Do you know the difference between a girl and a horse?"  And (laughter), and he'd say, "Well, I don't know.  What is the difference between"--he'd say, "You don't know the difference between," he'd say, "Well, you must have some funny dates" (laughter).  Yes, it was something, something like that, that they did in, in the minstrel shows.
Speaker 1: So that was a style of show that had come all the way down from the nineteenth century basically, I guess and --.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and it hadn't changed sort of, you know, all the way up to the '40s [1940s].  And things--did, were you all ever asked to perform in blackface?
Speaker 2: No, never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never, no, we never were.  I don't think I wanted to do it anyway.  There were a lot of comedians who did blackface, like Dusty Fletcher, Tim Moore--.
Speaker 1: He was--.
Speaker 2: He was in--.
Speaker 1: --he was famous for Kingfish on--.
Speaker 2: Kingfish in 'Amos and Andy', yeah, right.  He, he would do blackface.  And, but we never did.  We never did, and, and--'cause we always wanted to have this class.  We'd dance in our tuxedoes and tails.  And then that's, that's what we did all the time.
Story_ID: 11386
Speaker 1: That raises another point too, and the popular dress of the late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s], I mean the zoot suit was becoming very popular--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Cab Calloway was one of the people that popularized the Zoot suit look--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --but you never wore those suits--?
Speaker 2: I never did that.  No, we didn't, never did do that, no.  We stayed in the tails and the tuxedoes and did our class act (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, where did you get this idea that you were gonna be a classy or, or--I mean where did that come from?
Speaker 2: I guess from our parents [Ulysses Nicholas and Viola Harden Nicholas] because they always wanted us to dress neat, on stage and off stage.  And so, that's how it came because, because of them because they too, dressed with style, my mother and my father.  So they had their two sons to do the same.  And that's how--it stuck with us, yeah.
Story_ID: 11387
Speaker 1: Somewhere along the way, I've heard that met--that you all met George Balanchine, the--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --choreographer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We, we were working at, at the Cotton Club [New York, New York], downtown, this is 1937.  And they were doing this new show called 'Babes in Arms' at the Shubert Theater, starring Missy Green.  And they found out that we were at the Cotton Club.  So they asked us to come there and, and meet George Balanchine.  Then we, we met the composers of, of the show 'Babes in Arms', Richard Rodgers and Larry Hart, who wrote a wonderful score for this, for this show, like 'Willow Wind', 'The Lady is a Tramp', 'Johnny One Note' and, oh, it was a beautiful score.  And 'Willow Wind', all, all these wonderful songs in 'Babes in Arms'.  So we went to the theater, and we met Richard Rogers, Larry Hart and George Balanchine.  And Mr. Balanchine said, "I'm happy to meet you, you guys.  Hey, you're gonna be terrific in this show, I know; say, get up on stage and do a little something for me."  So we got up on stage, and we sang a song and started to doing different things like, my brother [Harold Nicholas] would slide through my legs, and I would jump over his head and do a split.  And he, George Balanchine said, "Hey, wait a minute, stop it (laughter), I got an idea."  I said, "What is that?"  He said, "This is the idea I have for this production number called 'Po' Johnny One Note'".  He said, "Well, I'm gonna have two girls come down front and bend over," and said, "Harold, you do a cartwheel over the girls," and said, "Fayard, you do a split over the girls."  And this kept building and building until it was eight girls.  And so he found out, where we--eight girls would stand back-to-back and spread their legs, and my brother would do a split through the eight girls on the other side.  And then after that, the girls would bend down and I would jump into a split over the eight girls.  And we finished the number (laughter).  And so that's what George did.  He didn't show us anything.  He just told us what he, what he thought we should do (laughter).  And so we, we did it.  And it--we'd go back into the audience with him, and he said, "Fellows?"  And we said, "Yes."  He said, "Did you ever take up ballet?"  And we said, "No, we never did."  And he said, "Well, you--looks like it.  When you're on that stage, you look like you had some ballet training."  And we said, "Well, we just dance the way we feel, and if it comes out that way, so much the better." (laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: Isn't that something? (laughter).
Story_ID: 11388
Speaker 1: As we go towards the late '30s [1930s] or the mid '30s, late '30s, you all make more movies, and now in '36 [1936], 'The Big Broadcast' and then in '38 [1938] you were in a movie, I think with or you're in a show with the Dandridge sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, we, we were in the Cotton Club [New York, New York] with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Cotton Club downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were at rehearsal, and we were in the show costarring with Cab Calloway.  And we were there at rehearsal, and we saw these three girls sitting across the way at the Cotton Club.  And I said, "Hey, hey," to my brother [Harold Nicholas], "Hey, look at those girls over there."  And my brother said, "I, I noticed them right away" (laughter).  I said, now, I had my eyes on Dorothy Dandridge, and so we went over to meet them and said, "Hello, I'm Fayard Nicholas and this is my brother, Harold Nicholas.  And we are the Nicholas"--they said, "We know who you are" (laughter).  And so then they introduced themselves, Dorothy, Vivian and Etta, the three Dandridge sisters.  And so like I said, I had my eyes on Dorothy Dandridge.  But I sound--found out that she was paying more attention to my brother than me.  So I, I backed out 'cause my brother and I, we never fight over women (laughter).
Story_ID: 11389
Speaker 1: All right, sir, now, we were talking about 'Sun Valley Serenade'.
Speaker 2: 'Sun Valley Serenade' where, where we [The Nicholas Brothers] introduced the song 'Chattanooga Choo Choo' with Glenn Miller and his Orchestra.  Oh, yes, I, I can remember the first that the president of Twentieth Century Fox, Darryl F. Zanuck called everybody and asked us to come to the rehearsal hall to hear this new song that Harry Warren and Mack Gordon wrote.  And Glenn Miller and his Orchestra was there, and, and Dorothy Dandridge was there.  And naturally, my brother [Harold Nicholas] and I were there and John Payne, Milton Berle were all there to hear this new song.  So Harry Warren got on the piano playing this song, and, and Mack Gordon was singing the song "Pardon me, boy, is that the Chattanooga choo choo".  And I'm listening to this song, and I said, what is that? (laughter)  What, yeah.  And Glenn Miller was sitting right beside me, and I said, "Glenn, what, Glenn, what do you think of this song?"  He said, "It stinks" (laughter).  He didn't like it, and I didn't like it.  But that goes to show you, you don't what's gonna be a hit or a miss.  Now, Glenn Miller when he made his record, it was selling.  It was--his first gold record, was 'Chattanooga Choo-Choo' oh, for Glenn Miller and his Orchestra.  And my brother and I, when we travel all over the world, we can't get off the stage until we sing 'Chattanooga Choo-Choo' and dance 'Chattanooga Choo-Choo', all over--can't get off the stage until we sing and dance 'Chattanooga Choo-Choo'.  So it was good for Glenn Miller, and it was good for us, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was like, like--it was his theme song, and it became our theme song, 'Chattanooga Choo-Choo'.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I didn't like it at first (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that number is really fantastic in that movie, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 1: And they show it a lot on television.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 11390
Speaker 1: There was a movie before that, though, 'Down Argentine Way' too with Don Ameche--.
Speaker 2: Oh, down, 'Down Argentine Way'? Yeah, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: With Don Ameche and Betty Grable.
Speaker 2: Don Ameche and Betty Grable, yes, that we [The Nicholas Brothers] made with them.  And it was supposed to be in, in Argentina.  And, and the, the song that we did was called 'Argentina'.  And I remember when we got there on the set, Irving Cummings was the, the director.  Now, first we met Nick Castle.  We were in our dressing room at Twentieth Century Fox, and there was a knock on the door.  And I opened the door, and that was Nick Castle.  And Nick Castle said, "Oh, I'm so happy to meet you guys."  He says, "I know that you can do my ideas."  And he said, "I'm just here with the little starlets doing a one and a two and a three."  He said, "I got so much in me.  I want it to come out, and I know you can do my ideas."  I said, "Okay, Nick, let's get together."  So we got together with Nick, and making up this routine for the new number 'Down Argentine Way', and we got there, and Irving Cummings, the director of the film said, "Let me see what you're gonna do."  So, all right, we went through the whole number without stopping, and he called--he said, "Nick, come here."  He said, "This number is too long."  And Nick said, "If you cut it, you'll ruin the number."  He said, "Oh, that's all right.  I can cut"--he said, "No, don't cut it, don't do (laughter), don't do that."  He said, "Just let it be just like it is."  He said, "All right, I can pan over to"--he said, "No, don't pan over to Betty Grable.  Keep the camera on them and let them finish the number."  And so he said, "Oh."  And Nick said, "I'll make a deal with you.  Let the number be exactly like it is.  When we go to a sneak preview, we'll see what will happen."  So Irving Cummings said, "That's all right, I can still cut" (laughter).  And so we, we went through the number and everything, and we were--after we finished it, and then we went to our apartment.  And it was two weeks later, and Nick Castle called me on the telephone.  And he said, "Fellows, we just saw the premiere of 'Down Argentine Way'," and he said, "When you and your brother came on that, that screen and did your number, that the, the audience started clapping, stomping their feet and whistling, and they did that so much that the operator in the projection room had to rewind the film and show your part over again (laughter)."  He, he said, "They will not pan over to Betty Grable, and they will not cut (laughter)."  He said, the, "The number will be intact."  And that's what happened.  Every place that that film played--and we came on there, they had to stop the film, rewind it and show us over again.  And because of that, we got a five-year contract with Twentieth Century Fox.  Yeah, 'Down Argentine Way' was really something (laughter).
Story_ID: 11391
Speaker 1: Now, I've read--now, tell me if this is true 'cause you don't know what, what you've read is true or not some times.
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: I've heard that you all were the first to incorporate samba music into an act in the United States, Brazilian music or samba music.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, 'cause we went to Rio de Janeiro [Brazil] in nineteen--1939 with the Casino de Urca in Rio de Janeiro.  And we were hearing all these different Brazilian songs.  And so we liked the one that's called 'Brazil'.  And, and also another called 'Mama Yo Quiero'.  (Singing) Mama Yo Quiero, Mama Yo Quiero, Mama Yo Quiero, mama.  And so we put that into the act.  And it was a big success, and, and sang it in its language, Portuguese (laughter).  And so it became a big hit for us.  And everywhere we would do it, everyone would love it, even though they didn't understand it, but they liked the rhythm of it (sings a rhythm) yeah.  It was great.  It was great.
Story_ID: 11392
Speaker 1: I know your brother, Harold [Nicholas], met Dorothy Dandridge around the same time as you met--you met your first wife around the same time--?
Speaker 2: My first, yeah--.
Speaker 1: --in '38 [1938], I guess, 1938.
Speaker 2: Her name was Geraldine Pate.  I met her here in Chicago [Illinois].  And I remember we were playing at, a theater here in Chicago on the South Side.
Speaker 1: The Regal?
Speaker 2: Regal, Regal Theatre, that's right, the Regal Theatre.  And there was a friend who came backstage to see me, and he said, "Fellows, I want you to meet some nice girls."  I said, "Oh, yes, that'll be fine."  So he took us over to the house of these three lovely girls, Geraldine, Rose and Eloise.  And right away, Geraldine came, came to the door and, and let us in.  And she said, welcome, welcome, and, and there we met her.  And Geraldine, right away she looked around and she, she said, "I know you're the fast one" (laughter) to my brother.  He said, "What did I say?"  (Laughter) And so we went to the house, and we talked and we had, had our drinks like Coca-Cola or something like that.  And then after we said to, to the, the three girls, and we went back to the theater, and I said to all the guys, I said, "I like that girl.  I'm gonna marry her."  That's what I, just thinking right, right then, I was going to marry her.  And--because I had this thing that I just wanted to be a bachelor, not get married, but I wanted to marry her.  And I kept in contact with her.  And we were coming back to, to Los Angeles [California] to do another film, and I kept in touch, touch with her, and I sent for her to come, come to Los Angeles and be with me and we get married.  And we did (laughter).  We did.  We got married in nineteen--yeah, in 1942, 'cause I met her in 1941, the time when we got into the war [World War II].  And I met her at the train station, and, and we--I said, "Let's, let's do it now.  Let's get"--and so we went to one of those courthouses and got the license and things, and we got married.  And we were married for--let me see, I think twelve years, and we had two sons, Tony [Antonio Nicholas] and Paul [Nicholas].  And it was a nice marriage, as long as it lasted (laughter).
Story_ID: 11393
Speaker 1: When World War II broke out, I mean--you were drafted when, in '42 [1942] or '43 [1943], when you served--?
Speaker 2: In '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: '43.
Speaker 2: Right, right after we made this film 'Stormy Weather'.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, maybe we should talk about 'Stormy Weather' first and then we'll talk about the war.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: But the war is going on, but, but 'Stormy Weather' is sort of a landmark film for black film, you know, everyone talks about 'Stormy Weather'--.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: --with all the huge cast of stars.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, a lot of 'em, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and so many people.  You got Fats Waller and Lena Horne.
Speaker 2: You got Fats Waller and Katherine Dunham, Lena Horne and Bill ['Bojangles'] Robinson, Cab Calloway, and, let me see, Miller and Lee, yeah, it was, it was a lot--also, Ada Brown, I think was in it, yeah.  And so, it was an all-star cast in 'Stormy Weather', yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance--I'm sorry, did you get a chance to meet or interact with some of those people?
Speaker 2: Well, well, I--when we were on the set together, 'cause a lot of times we'd be doing, doing our thing, and they wouldn't be around because they were concentrating on, on my brother [Harold Nicholas] and me.  But we, we saw all of them, Bill Robinson and, and Cab Calloway naturally.  The number we did was called 'Jump and Jive' where Cab Calloway would start singing.  And he comes over to--and we're sitting at a table there in, in this, this night club.  And he goes over to us and say, (scatting).  And we go back to him (scatting) (laughter).  And we jump from the table down to the stage.  And Cab would hold his hands out, and we'd hit his hands like that, and then we'd go into the number called 'Jump and Jive' (imitating the tune).  And we did this thing.  And everybody liked that, that number in 'Stormy Weather'.  Every dancer loved it.  I mean you name them, Bill Robinson loved it, and Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Eleanor Powell, and I could just go on and on.  They all loved that, that number.  And it, it was good for us.  That, that was the, the last film we made at Twentieth Century Fox and it seems it was the best to everybody else, this one.  And I remember one part of the film where we come, supposed to come down these stairs jumping over each other's heads into splits, from one stair to the other.  And we had, and we never rehearsed it.  And when it came time to do it, Nick Castle, who was our dance director said, "Don't rehearse it, just do it."  Said, okay.  So we got up to, up there at the platform and just started jumping over each other's head, one right after the other, jump over my brother's head, brother would jump over my head un-until we reached the stage, and they said, "Cut; said, that's it fellows.  You cannot get it any better."  So we did that in one take.  And I said, "Oh, happy day" (laughter).  I didn't feel like going back up those steps (laughter).  So it worked out well.

Speaker 1: This style of dance, it just raises another question here that I think that people would probably want to know about.
Speaker 2: Want to know.  What's that?
Speaker 1: Your style, you talked about the style of dancing and the acrobatics and use of the hands, the drama and the elegance of it--.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --but some of it, it just appears when you watch it could be dangerous.  I mean it--.
Speaker 2: Well, we did it--.
Speaker 1: Were you ever hurt?
Speaker 2: We did it very carefully so we couldn't hurt ourselves, yeah, because I think it--I mean a lot of people wouldn't, when I make that first jump, they say, ooh (laughter).  But we, we did it so we wouldn't hurt ourselves,  And so we, and we practiced that way to do it, and it came out beautifully.
Story_ID: 11395
Speaker 1: Did you ever have an occasion where you were injured, you know?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.  I remember one time we were at, at the Roxy Theater in New York City.  And the, the manager of the theater got this idea--he wanted to create something like what we did in 'Stormy Weather' with, with the steps.  And so he, he had the orchestra on stage with us and had these stairs on each side of the orchestra where we could dance up the stairs, brother [Harold Nicholas] on one side and on, on the other, and then we would meet at the center of the platform upstairs.  And then when we got up there, he said to us, "Now, fellows, I want you to do a split over the orchestra onto the stage."  I said, "Wait a minute" (laughter).  I said, "Wait a minute."  So we--I said to my brother, "What do you think?"  He says, "Well, we'll try it."  I--'cause see, when we jump over, over the orchestra, see, if, if the orchestra was, was, wasn't on stage, the, then we'd, we would go--just go down to, to the stage.  But we--now, we got to over the orchestra to the stage, see.  If they weren't there, we'd just go down then.  So now, we got to fly (laughter).  And so I say, "Okay, on the count of three, we'll do it."  And I say, "Okay, one, two"--he said, my brother said, "Wait a minute (laughter), wait a minute, let me think."  I said, "Okay."  So (laughter), okay, on the count of three, one, two, three.  And we jumped, and we sailed, wow, perfect, straight, we get up and we dance off the stage, and then we go to our dressing room.  So I said to my brother, "I don't want to do that anymore."  I said, "I hurt my heel."  So my brother said, "That's all right.  I'll do it by myself."  He said, "When we get up there, and we, we dance up the stairs, say, you, you cross me, and you go back down the stairs, and then you just wait for me with your hands up to me like this, and I'll go down.  And then when I come up, you bring me up."  I said, "Okay, that's fine."  So we get up there to do--now, he says, I said, "Come on, brother; come on."  So he comes, so he's there, and he goes down, over the orchestra, and go wham, and then I go down with him, and then I bring him up (laughter), and we dance off the stage.  And we go to the, to the dressing room.  And so when we get there, my brother said, "You were right.  I don't want to be doing that anymore either" (laughter).  He hurt his heel (laughter), 'cause it was so high.  It had to go to--that's why.  And we figured out a way that we, we didn't have to--wouldn't have to jump over the orchestra, just dance all around them.  So that's, that was one time, but it wasn't serious 'cause we, we went on in to do the next show.  And at the Roxy Theater there was 6,000 people who, who saw us at each show.  And whoever was there for the first show saw that (laughter), and, and so we, we, we cut it out, but, and, but the, the act went over just as good because we added something that was spectacular as, as that.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the only time.
Story_ID: 11396
Speaker 1: Now, in 1942, your brother, Harold [Nicholas], married Dorothy Dandridge, I think--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, right.
Speaker 1: --which it's always written about so I'd better ask you about it.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, in 1932, they, they got married.
Speaker 1: In '42 [1942].
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: In '42 [1942] I think.
Speaker 2: Yes, '42, 1942, they got married at my mother's [Viola Harden Nicholas] house at that time.  And it was a beautiful wedding there, yeah.  And we, we were dressed nice and all, nice tuxedoes.  She had a beautiful evening gown.  And my, my wife, Geraldine [Pate], was there and many, many people.  Nick Castle was there, and Hattie McDaniel, she was there and, let's see who else was there?  Oh, it was so many wonderful people who was there to, to see this wedding with my brother and, and Dorothy Dandridge.  So we wished them well, and just had a wonderful time and had the reception where great food and--my mother was a great cook.  Oh, she had, she had some food that she'd cook, it was so wonderful.  And everything went well with, with them.  And they, they had a, a nice wedding.  They--let me see.  I think they were only married for about seven years.  I don't, I don't know what went wrong 'cause I thought they were the perfect couple.  But during those seven years, everything was fine.
Speaker 1: Well, why did you think they were the perfect couple?
Speaker 2: Because they looked so good (laughter), and everybody liked them when, when they'd see them together.  And everything was going fine for those first few years.  Um-hum, yes.  But then something happened.  I don't, I don't know what.
Story_ID: 11397
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 1943, you were drafted, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was drafted into the Army.  And I--my brother [Harold Nicholas] and I said, "Look, I know you don't want to go to this Army, and I know I don't want to go to this Army."  He said, "Let's go and try to lose some weight" (laughter).  So we go to the steam house and sit in the--in there it's hot, and, and trying to lose weight.  And so I went to the induction center, and they examined me and everything.  And you go to this officer where he stamps you 4F or A1.  And then they booked me into the Army (laughter).  But it's a funny thing.  When my brother went down to the induction center, he, he said, "Listen, I'm gay (laughter).  I have flat feet, and I smoke marijuana" (laughter).  He was telling them everything was wrong.  So they examined him, and then when he went to this officer who would say he was 1A or 4F, and he looked, he looked at my brother, and my brother then he, he had these wide shoulders on, on his, his suit.  It made him look larger than he was.  And the officer looked at his papers and says, "It says here that you weigh 100 pounds."  He said, "But I don't believe it.  Go back and get examined again" (laughter).  So he, he went back, and they went through the same things with him, and then my brother was saying, 'h, no, oh, boy.  And he was perspiring and everything.  And so after he had got examined and went back to this officer, and he looked at his papers, the man--the officer looked at the papers and said, "Ninety-five pounds"?  My brother worried himself so, so much he lost five pounds.  He said, "4F, get out of here" (laughter).  So he was never in the Army.  But I weighed just enough to put me in.  I weighed 115 pounds.  That's, that's small, but it was enough to put me in.  Boy, that was a one hap--unhappy day of my life.
Speaker 1: Well, where did they assign you?
Speaker 2: Signed me up to a, a laundry company in Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi, oh, man, there to wash clothes for the soldiers who were crawling on their stomachs that day, and, and that's, that's what I wind up in.  But, but they found out that I could entertain.  And so, so I became (laughter) the entertainer there, and direct the shows and everything.  And--.
Speaker 1: Now, they didn't know in the beginning that you were Fayard Nicholas?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they knew, but they didn't care at the time.  But when I started telling them what I could do, then they said, okay, let's do it.
Speaker 1: You were eventually transferred to Arizona, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  I, I went there, yeah.  And that--in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, I was entertaining the soldiers who were going overseas, and that's all I was doing with the other entertainers who were there.  And that's all we were doing.  We were just doing that.  We didn't have to make bed check.  We didn't have to make 'Reveille', just go to the office of the, of the--the officer in, in charge of, of special service that we talked about what kind of show we were gonna do for the soldiers.  And that's what we'd do.  We didn't have to make any bed check and, and get up when we wanted.  That was fine.  That was fine, until there was an order that came from Washington, D.C. that every man was a soldier (laughter).  There I was with this heavy pack and the rifle going hut two, three, four, marching.  I said, oh, no, what are we--what are they doing to us?  And I didn't like it at all.  I says, gee, jeepers.  So I, I got sick (laughter).  I got sick in, in the barracks where we were.  And I, I wouldn't eat.  And I would tell the fellows, will you go out and get me some oranges and some lemons.  So I'd take--I'd say, bring me some jelly jars and wash 'em out so I can put this lemon juice in this, the bottle and the orange juice in the other one.  So I was drinking the orange and--yeah, orange in, in the morning and lemon juice at night.  And I got so thin, ooh, and then the--there was a, the priest who came by to see me, and said, "What's, what's the matter, Nicholas?"  I said, "I'm sorry, I can't stand this army. It's not good for me.  I, I don't think, things are going right" (laughter).  And so they took me to the hospital.  And I was there, and they started feeding me this good food.  And I, I started gaining weight (laughter), so they sent me back to my barracks.  And then I went back on the orange juice and the lemon juice.  And I got thin again (laughter).  And so I went back, and they took me back to the hospital, and I was there, and then just plain sick.  And my wife at that time, Geraldine [Pate], came there and, and said to me, "Everything is gonna be all right.  You, you, you're gonna be all right."  I said, "Okay."  And so they, there was, one of the officers there was very friendly with another girl called Alice Keyes (ph.).  And he, he talked to her and said, "Fayard's gonna be fine.  He's gonna be fine."  So they, they examined me again, and all of a sudden I got discharged.  And I went home and my wife said, "I told you everything was gonna be all right, yeah."  And so, then I went home and I was so happy when I got out of that army, oh, the things that I went through.  But it was all right when I was just, just entertaining, but when they had me soldiering, I'll tell you what really had me to think of this.  They had a thing where you crawl on your stomach, and, and they would shoot bullets over your head.  And they'd say, "You stay down, don't get up because you may get shot and killed."  When I found out we was supposed to do that, that's when I got sick (laughter).  I'm not going through that (laughter), yes.
Story_ID: 11398
Speaker 1: Now, you were discharged [from the U.S. Army] in 1944, right--?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --from the service, and now, what did you do?  Did you get right back into show business?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother [Harold Nicholas] and I, we got back together.
Speaker 1: And what had your brother been doing while you were--.
Speaker 2: Well, he was doing a single then.  And he made, made a couple of movies, my brother, Harold Nicholas.  And he made two films, one called 'Reckless Age' and 'Carolina Blues'.  And in 'Carolina Blues', I remember I, I was on a furlough, and I, I visit--visited the studio where he was shooting this film called 'Carolina Blues' starring Ann Miller and Kay Kyser.  And he had a special number that he did in the film called 'Mr. Beebe'.  He was Mr. Beebe  And he sang this song, 'Mr. Beebe', and then he would dance.  And he, he danced with, with everybody in the film, Marie Bryant and (unclear) and the four--the [Four] Step Brothers were also in that film.  So he, he danced with them.  They would follow him 'cause he was the leader, Mr. Beebe.  And there was June Richmond, who sang the song too in, in the film.  And so he did this big production number, and I was there watching him as he was doing it.  And he was good in it.  I don't, I don't know if you saw it.  It was called 'Carolina Blues'.  He, he--oh, he was terrific.  Those are, those things that he was doing when I was in the Army.  And he, he did another film, 'Reckless Age' with Gloria Jean that he did. And he was, he was in this department store where he, he put on a record, and, and he started to sing "Mama yo quero, Mama yo quero", and then he went into this dance that, what he, what he was doing.  And then he walked up this ladder and did a back flip on, on stage and finished the number.  Oh, he was--and then he told me, he says, "I wish you were here with me."  He say, "They working the devil out of me" (laughter).  So those are the things that he, that he was doing when I was in the Army.
Story_ID: 11399
Speaker 1: You and your brother [Harold Nicholas] had a--seemed to have a wonderful working relationship, I mean--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, we, we--.
Speaker 1: Not all siblings can get along.
Speaker 2: Well, we got along.  We, we liked each other, and we, we wasn't jealous of each other, like if we're on the, on stage, and we're doing a challenge dance.  And maybe he'd get a bigger hand than I'd get when he's doing his challenge.  And I'd say that's fine.  That's part of the act, part of the Nicholas Brothers.  So we, we never get jealous.  And then I'd do my thing, and so it was always a team, a team with, with friendship and everything.  And 'cause, some acts, brother acts, they hate each other (laughter).  They, they get there, they go on stage and, and do their act, and then when they finish, they separate, even stay in different hotels.  But my brother and I, we, we really liked each other.
Story_ID: 11400
Speaker 1: Now, your upbringing had something to do with that--.
Speaker 2: Oh, the parents, our parents, yeah.  They were wonderful parents and, yeah, and they taught us right from wrong, and they dressed us neat and just did all the wonderful things for us.  And, oh, we were lucky.  We were lucky to have such wonderful parents, 'cause they were--.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me--I know your father [Ulysses Nicholas] died in 1935?
Speaker 2: Five [1935], right, right.
Speaker 1: Right, and you were about twenty--you were just about twenty-one, I guess, twenty-two--.
Speaker 2: Something like that, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --then what happened?  Did he get sick or what happened?
Speaker 2: He had a heart attack.  You see, we were going out to California to do this film, 'The Big Broadcast of 1936'.  And my dad was driving in this limousine car with us, with a chauffeur and he had a heart attack while he was, they were driving.  And we found out about this 'cause, 'cause the, the--our chauffeur called us and told us what had happened.  And so--he made all the arrangements how to get him to California.  And then we had, had this funeral and everything, and that, that was so upsetting then because he, he played a big part of the Nicholas Brothers in show business.  And so we was so sad to, to hear that he'd passed away 'cause he, he was really something.  He was one of the best drummers in the world, you know.  He, he could do, do all these wonderful things.  And so that was one of our setbacks at that time.  But we, we went on and we made the film, and they gave us time to go to the funeral and everything.  So, oh, boy, he was, he was a wonderful dad, really.  Both of my parents were wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your mother [Viola Harden Nicholas] lived until 1971, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: Your mother lived until '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Oh, nineteen--yeah, that's right, yes.  Yes, we bought her a home out there in California, and I'd go there every week to see her and just have a wonderful time with her.
Story_ID: 11401
Speaker 1: Now, did you--when did you relocate permanently to California?
Speaker 2: Oh, in 1940.  That's when, when we decided to move there from New York, when we made the film 'Down Argentine Way', and it was such a big success, and they gave us a five-year contract that we said, let's move everything out here in Los Angeles and, and settle here cause when I, when I first went to, to Los Angeles, to make this film 'Kid Millions' with Eddie Cantor, I looked all around and said, hey, this is it cause I got tired of those winters and those summers in New York 'cause the climate is so wonderful in, in California.  And I love it because it can be, say like 120 in the shade, but at night, it would cool off (laughter).  But like in New York, if it's 120 in the daytime, it's 120 in the nighttime (laughter).  So I was, I was so happy to, to get to, to California and, and move there.
Story_ID: 11402
Speaker 1: So when you come back after the war [World War II], you and your brother [Fayard Nicholas] get back together and start and resume your act.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And your fame is spreading sort of world wide here.  People know about you everywhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people, every--all over the world, they knew about, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I guess it, the culmination--well, not the culmination, but one of the big incidents was the command performance before the King [of England] and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, the King [George VI] and Queen [Elizabeth], yes, that was in, in 1948, in London at the London Palladium.  And they were--it was so wonderful because we could see the royal family up in the royal box.  And they, they told us that, that when we, we would do our thing, is that, after we'd finished, we bowed to the King and Queen up there in the royal box.  And then bow to the audience, and after that, we bowed to the King and Queen again, and then we'd get off the stage.  We said, that's fine.  So I remember I was backstage, and I was looking at the King and Queen up into, up there in the royal box, and, and Princess Margaret was up there with them.  And I saw someone come to them and all of a sudden they were talking to this person, and then they got up and they left.  And I thought--because they would always come backstage to greet the entertainers.  And I'd do my courtesy, like that, and we were waiting for that, and said, "Well, what happened?"  And we found out later that they went to, to Buckingham Palace to be with their daughter, Elizabeth, because she was giving birth to her first child, Prince Charles, who may be King one day.  And that's, that's, that's why we didn't get a chance to meet them because they wanted to be there with her.  And that's the--when, when the King passed away, then his daughter, Elizabeth, became the Queen, Queen Elizabeth [II].  And that, that was one of the great moments in our life, for a royal command performance for the King and Queen of England.
Story_ID: 11403
Speaker 1: Now, what were things like in the '50s [1950s], as we go into the '50s?  Did, I mean, did things pick up or did you travel more or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we traveled more.  We'd do nightclubs and theater.  We'd work in, like in Boston [Massachusetts] at the [B. F.] Keith Theater, and I remember we did one show at the Keith Theater in Boston with Count Basie and Billy Eck--no, not Billy Eckstine, it was Billie Holiday.  Yeah, we, we did a, did some shows with them and it was like, maybe, five shows a day or something like that.  And it was great.  We became very friendly with, with Count Basie and, and Billie Holiday.
Speaker 1: What was she--what were they like, you know--?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, they, they were fine.  And--.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about either one of them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we used to play cards with--in between the shows with, with Billie Holiday and like a little blackjack or something, something like that or whist or bridge or something.  And she was so wonderful because I've always heard about her on drugs.  But she didn't use any of that around us.  She was a wonderful lady, and we had so much fun.  And see, see, I found out we could have fun without drugs.  And she was a great lady, and I loved the, the way she sang.  And, and that band was something, Count Basie.  And they, they really played for us, great music for us.  And they'd always close the show with the Nicholas Brothers (laughter).  Nobody wanted to follow (laughter).  Yes.
Story_ID: 11404
Speaker 1: Now, I think I skipped over--.
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: --a night, a tour that you, I read that you went on tour with Dizzy Gillespie in '48 [1948] and you all went through the South.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Oh, this was--I remember when our agent, William Morris Agency, called us to the office and said, "Fellows, I got a good deal for you."  I said, "What is that?"  He said, "They want you to go to the South on some one nighters."  I said, "I don't want to go down there."  I said, "You know, know what's happening down there."  He said, "Wait a minute.  Count Basie is going down there, and there's a lot of money.  Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, all went down there doing these one nighters."  I said, "Yeah, I don't want to"--and then when he started telling me how much money I'm gonna make, and I saw these dollars before my eyes, I, I started to changing my mind (laughter).  And he said, "Now, when you go down there," he said, "You will have a road manager who will travel with you on a special bus with everybody."  And he said, "You will have Dizzy Gillespie who's just started his big band.  You'll have Libby Lane, the exotic dancer, June Eckstine, who was the wife of Billy Eckstine at the time, and you'll have Patterson and (unclear), comedy team, comedy dance team."  And he said, so when he, when I saw all this money I was gonna make, then I, I changed my mind and said, so it was the Nicholas Brothers show, starring the Nicholas Brothers, and we were the master of ceremonies and introduced everybody.  And then after they did their thing, we would come on and do our thing.  Now, now, it was so funny 'cause Dizzy Gillespie was playing dance music for everybody.  And he was playing bebop.  And he would--one, one day they came out on stage, the whole band with Dizzy, and the audience would run up to the stage and, and lean on the stage, and they listened to this music.  And they listened, and they said, wait a minute--they didn't understand bebop music (laughter).  And they said, oh, no (laughter).  But they, they, they all liked the show, liked the show.  And, oh, we, we did very well down there, going to these different cities in the South, Atlanta, Georgia and, and Texas, and (unclear).  And because of our road manager, who would make sure we'd, we'd be at our hotel there, and we have our own bus, that there was no trouble, no trouble for us in the South.  And it was a funny thing, after the show, white people would come back to see us, and also the black people.  More white people came back to see us than the black people.  And that was this pretty little blue-eyed, blonde girl and said, "Oh, Mr. Nicholas"--grabbed me and hugged me and kissed me, and I said, wait a minute--to myself (laughter).  Here we are in the South.  And, and she said, "I've seen all your movies".  I said, "You've seen all of my movies here in, in the South?"  Said, "Yes."  I said, "They didn't cut us out?"  Said, "No."  I said, "Wait a minute.  I always thought they cut us the film when they would play here."  She said, "No, they didn't do it 'cause they--how could they, 'cause you on that screen all by yourself.  Why should they cut you off?"  And that's when I found out they didn't cut us out, 'cause, 'cause she named all the movies that played down there, that we were in, 'Down Argentine Way' and 'Sun Valley Serenade', all of them.  And I said, "Well, I'll be darned."  But I was still cool (laughter).  Yes.  So those were the things that happened in the South.  So we, we got along beautifully.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so you had played before black audiences or--well, black and white audiences, but they were separate?
Speaker 2: Separate, yes.  It was like, one night we'd play for the black audience downstairs, and the white people would be upstairs looking down, wishing they were down there dancing.  And the next night, the white would be downstairs, and the black people would be upstairs.
Speaker 1: It's the same theater, but they would just split the audience?
Speaker 2: But the same--but, but they separated them downstairs and upstairs.  And so it worked out fine.  There was no trouble at all, no.
Story_ID: 11405
Speaker 1: Now, you were, you were on another--you were involved in a Broadway show too with Josephine Baker--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about her now.  She--.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, she was a wonderful lady.  Oh, so crazy about her.  We did a number with her called 'Maharajah' where she was in beautiful gown, and she had the long fur piece.  And we were like little page boys, I mean we'd run in behind her, to make sure this, this fur wouldn't get caught in, into anything.  And she was there with these handsome guys in tails and high hat, and she was singing, and they were close to her, but they didn't touch her.  See, in France, the guys would touch her and dance with her.  But they were there, like that.  So they wanted to create something, something like, like she did in France.  But they didn't have her to touch anybody (laughter).  And so there we were.  Now, she would be singing the song in French, and then she would go offstage with, with the guys and leave us.  And my brother [Harold Nicholas] would be there, and he started imitating her doing, doing the (scatting) oui, (scatting) merci (laughter) and just putting a little French in with this scatting.  And I'd say, "Yes, man" (laughter).  And so we did that together.  And we'd stop that show every night (laughter).  They couldn't get enough of us.  I remember when we were, we were in Boston [Massachusetts] doing the show, and we were on stage.  And we--the people wanted more and more of the Nicholas Brothers.  Now, that was a, a skitch--a sketch where that Fannie Brice, Eve Arden and Judy Canova were doing, sort of a, like a, a radio sketch.  And the, the, the manager, the stage manager got an idea that to keep these people from applauding for the Nicholas Brothers and they going back and do another number, is to have the, the curtain go up.  And so they would see Fannie Brice.  Well, they didn't care (laughter).  They kept on applauding, even though Fannie Brice was there (laughter).  And so we went out and did our thing about six times (laughter) before they let us go.  And it was so funny because after we left, and Fannie Brice, she looked at the audience, she looked at Eve Arden, she looked at Judy Canova, then she looked at the audience again, and said, "well, I guess we can speak now" (laughter).  And it's good she said that because that sketch would have went down the drain (laughter).  And they were trying to find out where can we put these Nicholas Brothers, where they don't stop the show like they do; didn't, didn't care where they put us, we'd stop the show (laughter).

Speaker 1: Now, in the '50s [1950s], now, you were, you said you did a lot of traveling in the '50s [1950s], and I know you made some movies in Europe in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we did.  We did make some--.
Speaker 1: And a couple of them, one in France, one in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we made one in France, and we made in Italy and Germany.  And we did some things in Mexico too.  I can't think of the name of 'em 'cause (laughter), but we, we did these different, different films.
Speaker 1: Well, I see--it's one--I have the name of some of 'em here.  Well, one in France was 'Bonjour Kathrin' in 1956 and then there's a German movie called 'Musik im Blut'--.
Speaker 2: Yes, is that what it was?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, in '55 [1955].  You all are international stars now.  You're really--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, those, those movies made us international too.  See, they--because they discovered us before we arrived there because they saw the movies of the Nicholas Brothers.  And then when, when we arrived there, they were open arms for us.  And we, we headlined everywhere, everywhere.  And the, the place was packed ev-every night wherever we'd go, every city in Paris [France], London [England], Stockholm [Sweden], Denmark or whatever country we'd go to, it was always standing room only.  So those movies made us real popular there, and, and then when we got there, it made us more popular cause they saw us in person.
Speaker 1: Now, in those days, were you performing more overseas than you were in the United States, you think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.  I remember we went to our office there in New York at the William Morris Agency, and he says, "Fellows, things are a little slow here now.  Why don't you go to Europe?"  And so we said, "Oh, yeah, why not?"  And so we would go to, we'd go to Europe.  And sometimes we'd stay there four years before we'd come back to, to America.  And they, they just loved us over there.  And we would go to different things like, like each year we would go to the same places.  Maybe if we'd go to Spain and Italy and those and--we, we--every year we'd make that same tour and go back fresh because we, when we'd go, we'd change our act.  We'd do something different for them.  And that's why they liked us over there cause we changed so much.
Story_ID: 11407
Speaker 1: Now, there seemed to have been--as the man at William Morris Agency was saying, I guess, it seemed to be some of a--things were a little slow over here for--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the movies especially.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, yes.  It was a little slow at that time, at that time.
Speaker 1: --for roles, they were, you could almost count the--'Carmen Jones' was a big, you know, black movie in the '50s [1950s], but it's hard to think of another one, really, in the '50s,a big black, I mean a movie with a black cast--.
Speaker 2: With the black cast, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or even a movie that had a substantial role for black people, you know, in the '50s.  Do you have any thoughts about that or why it was like that?
Speaker 2: I can't--I, I don't know exactly why it was like that because I, I thought 'Carmen Jones' was a big success and that maybe they would be making more movies like that.  But those producers, when, when they, they get mind set to something, well, that, that would be it.  I think Dorothy Dandridge made another film right after that with, also with Harry Belafonte and Joan Fontaine, some about island.
Speaker 1: 'Island in the Sun'.
Speaker 2: 'Island in the Sun', yeah, and she, she was in love, in love with--Dorothy Dandridge was in love with this guy from, from England, I think, but they, they didn't do no heavy romancing in it.  I think they would dance a little bit or something like that and hug each other, but no kissing.  And Harry Belafonte was--was involved with Joan Fontaine.  But they didn't do any heavy romancing either.
Speaker 1: All they could do is look at each other.
Speaker 2: They lead you there--but--and just say they like each other (laughter), yes.  Those, those were the films in those days, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the '50s [1950s], it was a real conservative time, I guess, for that--for--?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 11408
Speaker 1: Now, you did some television in the '50s [1950s], I guess, right, over here, some, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did Ed Sullivan ['The Ed Sullivan Show'].  We did with Frank Sinatra and Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra.  We, we did some, some television.  And, and after that we, we went back to Europe.  But before that we were in the, at the inauguration of President [Dwight] Eisenhower.  And we did, did a show for him with many celebrities.  And I think right after that, we went back to Europe and stayed another four years.  So, so, that's the thing about Europe, you can stay away from Europe for years, five or ten years and you go back, and they still remember you.  If you stay away from that, from the U.S.A. for two years, they'll forget you if you're not around (laughter).  And you, you--and so you have to build it up again.  Yeah, so that's the wonderful thing about Europe.  They, they, they never forget you.
Story_ID: 11409
Speaker 1: Now, were you in Europe when the Civil Rights Movement jumped off here for the most part?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--yeah we were.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) In fact, yeah, I guess you were 'cause you made a movie in '55 [1955] and '56 [1956] when 'Brown v. Board [of Education'] was going on, and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the Montgomery [Alabama] bus boycott and all that.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: What were some of your thought about the Movement?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I remember--let me see, I was here, I think when the--in 1954, I believe I, we were here.  And that's when they were having the, the black children go to the white schools.  And naturally, the southerners, they didn't like that at all.  I was watching on TV, and there was a lady who was walking around with her Bible and saying, "There's nothing in this book about integration" (laughter).  I said, "What is she talking about" (laughter).  And things were going, I said, what's the matter with these little innocent kids, you don't want them to go to school, you know, at, at a white school, just because of the color of their skin.  But everything worked out.  They did go to the schools.  And I said, "Oh, happy day" (laughter).  I noticed a lot of those things.
Story_ID: 11410
Speaker 1: Now, in the '60's [1960s] when you, when you came--what are your reflections about the '60's [1960s]?  What were you all doing in the 1960s?
Speaker 2: Oh, in, in the 1960s?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I left my brother [Harold Nicholas] in Europe, I--to come back here.  I, I was wanted, I was homesick.  I wanted to come back.  And I think I came back in 1958, I think that's when I came back to this country and left him over there.  And he, he stayed there.  And he was doing his single act.  And so I was trying to do a single act here with, with all the different television shows and everything.  And I was in the drugstore, it was on Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax [Los Angeles, California].  And I was looking at some postcards.  And a fellow came over to me, says, "Aren't you one of the Nicholas Brothers?" I said, "Yes, I am."  He says, "Well, where's your brother?"  I said, "My brother's still in Europe."  He said, "Well, I want to take you to a television studio what's called 'Hollywood Palace'.  I want to introduce you to all of the producers.  And we're gonna see if we can get your brother back" (laughter).  And so I went there, and I met the producer, and somebody say, "Hello, there Nicholas, hey you look great."  I said, "Well, how--what other way should I look?" (laughter)  He said, "I thought see an old man here strolling along with a cane." And I said, "No, no."  I said, "I'd like to be on your show, 'The Hollywood Palace'."  He said, he said, "Well, get up on stage and do something for me."  So I got up on stage, and I sang a song and did a little dance, and they said, "Oh, that was great.  We liked it so much."  And they said, "It'd be much better if your brother was here with you."  I say, well, I said, "Well, well, we're gonna try and see if we can get my brother.  I'll give my brother a call, and he's in France, see if we can get him to come back."  I said, "But wait, if you can't get him back, you'll still have me on the show?"  Oh, he said, "Yes, yes, we will" (laughter).  And so we got together, we, we called my brother and told him.  He said, "Will you--we're doing this 'Hollywood Palace' show, and we'd like for you to come back."  And he said we'll give you a first-class ticket on the airlines.  You will have a first-class room to stay at a hotel.  You don't have to pay any money--.
Story_ID: 11411
Speaker 1: You were discussing the producers of 'The Hollywood Palace' bringing your brother [Harold Nicholas] over--.
Speaker 2: Yes, are we on?
Speaker 1: Yes, we're on.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: They, you were saying that the producers of 'The Hollywood Palace' paid to bring your brother back from Europe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, wanted to bring him back, yes.
Speaker 1: And this is in 1964?
Speaker 2: 1964, they, they wanted my brother to come back and join me.  And so we called him and, and said to him, "Do you want to come back to America?"  He says, "Well, what's happening?"  They said, "Well, we got a good deal for you.  You will, you will be on 'The Hollywood Palace' TV show with me, and you will have a first-class ticket to come.  You'll stay in a first-class hotel, and you won't have to spend any money at all.  And you'll get a great salary."  And he said, then he said to, to his wife, he said, "Honey, we--you want to go to America?"  And she said, "Well, not right now, but I, I can meet you later if you got a good deal, yeah."  And so we sent for him, and we--he got here, and we, we did this first 'Hollywood Palace' TV show with Ed Wynn, Ed Wynn and there was Eydie Gormé.  She was also on the show.  And so we, we did the first one, and then my brother, he, he--it felt good to him.  So he decided that he wanted to, to stay and do some other things because he, he heard about things were doing better in Las Vegas [Nevada].  You could stay in any hotel you wanted to stay in, and, and be happy.  And so, after we did that first show, then he sent for his wife and his son.  And we did the second TV show with, let me see, who was he, Edgar Gaball (ph.), did, with him.  And that was, that was a good one too 'cause we, we had a chance to do 'My Kind of Town' that we, we did a special routine where we sang this song (singing) "My, my kind of town".  We said, Manhattan is, but it's really Chicago is (laughter).  So we changed the, the lyrics.  And we did that one, and we did another one with, let me see, who was that last one with?  Oh, oh, it was, it was, I think it was Phil Harris, Phil Harris.  You remember Phil Harris?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: He was married to Alice Faye.  And we did those three.  Now, it was, it was time for, for us to go to Las Vegas.  So, so we, we went to Las Vegas at the Desert Inn and did a show there with, with Pearl Bailey, and the Nicholas Brothers are back together and it was a big success in, in Las Vegas.  And we stayed there, and then went right from that, that hotel to another hotel called The Thunderbird, where we did a show called the "Ziegfield Follies of 1965'.  And we were the stars of that show.  And those are the things that we were doing when he came back with me, the TV shows and, and Las Vegas.
Story_ID: 11412
Speaker 1: Now, that was an era that, I guess, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Frank Sinatra were doing those big Las Vegas [Nevada] shows, and--.
Speaker 2: Yes, they were..
Speaker 1: --and Las Vegas was like in a sort of a golden age or something then, I guess.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: With--.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes.  Oh, it was.  I mean we did a show with, with, with Frank Sinatra there at the Sands Hotel.  And it was a big success, big success, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was he like and what--did you, I guess you probably knew the other members of the so-called Rat Pack, you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, we knew all of 'em (laughter).  Yeah, but we knew Sammy and, and Frank better, better than the others.  But we would always go to see them at the Sands Hotel and go backstage and see them and, and just have a nice chat.  And those were the golden years, you might say.  And we, later on, we did a tour with, with Sammy Davis, Jr. at a theater in the round.  And we also went to Europe with him.  And it was a big success with, with Sammy.  Sammy always liked, liked the Nicholas Brothers (laughter).  He--I remember we were headlining at the Chicago Theatre in Chicago [Illinois], and Sammy came back when he was with his father [Sammy Davis, Sr.] and his uncle [Will Mastin], when it was the Will Mastin Trio.  And this is what Sammy said, said to his father--they came backstage to our dressing room, and he said, he said, "Dad, I want to be like the Nicholas Brothers."  And I said, "Wait a minute, Sammy, what do you mean you want to be like the Nicholas Brothers?  You--all that talent, you do your own thing."  And he said, "I mean I want to have the class of the Nicholas Brothers."  I said, "Oh, oh, I understand what you mean now," 'cause, 'cause he did have a lot of talent.  And he, but when, wherever the Nicholas Brothers would be, he would go there to--this is before he, he went on his own as Sammy Davis, Jr.
Speaker 1: I remember, yeah, he did perform with his uncle and his father?
Speaker 2: Uncle and, and his father, and it was called the Will Mastin Trio featuring Sammy Davis, Jr.
Story_ID: 11413
Speaker 1: Now, did you have--is there any particular--I guess I have to ask this cause I--a few years ago, there was a movie called 'Tap'.
Speaker 2: Oh, my brother [Harold Nicholas] was in that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you, did you know that? (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, [Charles] 'Honi' Coles was in it and--.
Speaker 2: No, Honi Coles wasn't in it.
Speaker 1: He wasn't in that one?
Speaker 2: No, that was, that was 'The Cotton Club' that Honi Coles was in.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but 'Tap' was, was with Gregory Hines--
Speaker 1: Gregory Hines.
Speaker 2: --Sammy Davis, Jr. and my brother, Harold and it was Jimmy Slyde and Steve Condos and, let me see, [Howard] 'Sandman' Sims was in it--.
Speaker 1: Henry LeTang.
Speaker 2: Henry LeTang, yeah, yeah.  Oh, everybody was in it.  But I was supposed to be in that film too.  But, but when, when they called me to be in that film, I had made a promise to kids in, in one of, one of the schools that I would come and talk to them and maybe perform for them.  And I didn't want to disappoint them.  And so they didn't call me back.  But, but I thought I made the best choice to, to, to make these kids happy.  But I'm happy that my brother was in it, and he did, he did a great job.
Speaker 1: Now, was there--just the movie kind of raises a questions--.
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: --that, is there like a special bond between the black tap dancers, you know, cause it seemed to be--in the movies it seemed to show that all the black tap dancers knew each other, and they, everybody, and, you know, they had like a special kind of bond between themselves.  Is that really true?
Speaker 2: Where, in the movie?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the movie, but is it really true in real life?  I mean do the other people doing tap, I mean do you know all of them or do they all have a--?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we--I know 'em all well, get together, the black and the whites, yeah.  And we will praise each other of different things, and that's the thing about show business.  There, there may be some jealousy in it, but, but I've never found it because we all like each other, and we're not jealous of each other.  And we found out that all the dancers did their own style, and that's what I, I learned about them.  And I would never compare them.  They're, they're--see, when I was watching Bill ['Bojangles'] Robinson, he's doing his style.  And I wouldn't think of any other dancer, I'm just thinking of Bill Robinson.  And, naturally, of course, see, Fred Astaire, and I just think of him, don't think about any other dancer, and--because all of 'em had their own style, you know, like Bill Robinson, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Ethel [Waters], Eleanor Powell, Ann Miller, you name them.  They all had their own styles.  And so when I see them, I just think about them doing their thing and don't think about anybody else because if I did, it would ruin the performance of them if I'm thinking about somebody else.  So I just think about them, and you see a wonderful performance.
Story_ID: 11414
Speaker 1: Now, do you--I have to ask this question, do you have a favorite tap dancer or dancer, period?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, to tell you the truth, I like them all, but I lean a bit towards Eleanor Powell.  Eleanor Powell, she did everything.  She tap danced.  She did ballet; she did acrobats, she did, she did it all.  And she was a great, great performer, and I, I loved her.  Did you see her in the film the big--'The Broadway Melody of 1940' with Fred Astaire?  Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell, gee, I've never seen him work so hard in all my life (laughter) because of her, 'cause when Fred Astaire is performing, the lady he's performing with, she's following him.  But he didn't have to follow Eleanor Powell, be more like she's following--he's following her (laughter).  And so I remember one time--oh, yeah, I was at a birthday party that one of Eleanor Powell's protégés gave her, big birthday party, they had all the dancers there.  And I was sitting there beside Eleanor Powell, and I said, Eleanor, tell me about this film that you made with Fred Astaire called 'Broadway Melody of 1940'.  Oh, she said, "Fayard, I had a wonderful time.  We had such a great time, and, and we had a lot of challenge that would go on between the takes of the film."  And she said, "While I was sitting in my chair, taking off my tap shoes, and we were going our separate ways", she said, I saw Fred Astaire way over in the corner with his arms folded like this, just looking at me.  And I looked at him and said, "Wait a minute," she said, "Come over here, come over here."  And then said, and she said, "Fred, didn't we have a wonderful time?"  Fred said, "Yes, yes, Eleanor, we did have a wonderful time making this film."  But he said, "Eleanor, I don't want to work with you anymore."  She said, "What do you mean you don't want to work with me?  Well, we had a great time." " Yeah, we had a great time," he said, "But Eleanor, I don't want to work with you any more because you work me too hard" (laughter).  And she did.  Yeah, because I tell--I guess he had in his mind, I'm not gonna let this woman outdance me.  So, and those, like I said, I'd never seen him work that hard before, but it, it turned out great.  There was--all the numbers they did together were outstanding, yes.
Story_ID: 11415
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in the '70s [1970s], you did your first dramatic role, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, in 1970, yeah.  It was called 'The Liberation of L.B. Jones'.  I had my, my dramatic part that I did, when--and with Lola Falana and Roscoe Lee Browne and let's see who else?  Lee J. Cobb and, let's who else was in that film, oh, many, many, many stars.
Speaker 1: Anthony Zerbe.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Anthony Zerbe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Anthony Zerbe, yeah, Anthony Zerbe--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Anthony Zerbe.
Speaker 2: --he was in it too, yeah.  And so I had this part where I was assistant to Roscoe Lee Browne who had a place where he was, where you get coffins to bury--.
Speaker 1: He was a undertaker.
Speaker 2: Undertaker, yeah, that's it (laughter).  He was an undertaker, yeah, and so I was his assistant there.  And Ros--my name was Benny in that, in that, and I had this dramatic role.  And I, I was--I remember I was in, in a prison and they, they accused me of something that I didn't do.  This was supposed to be in the South where--and, they had Lola Falana, she, she was also in prison too.  And she was the cause of, of my, my friend, Roscoe Lee Brown, being killed.  They killed him, and they accused me of doing it, but I didn't do it.  It was these, these officers who, who staged this.  So I was in, in prison and Lee J. Cobb came there to make sure, to let me out cause he knew I didn't do this.  And as, as I was leaving and they were letting Lola Falana out, and I knew what, what happened with her cause she was making it with one of the officers (laughter).  So I turned around, and I slapped her, wham (laughter).  And, and the audience just applauded when I did that (laughter), cause she was a bad girl in that (laughter).  That was some of what I did in there.
Speaker 1: Well, she was a great dancer too, really in the--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, she, she, she was, yeah.  She could really shake her hips (laughter), Lola Falana.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your brother [Harold Nicholas] was in--.
Speaker 2: 'Uptown Saturday Night'.  'Uptown Saturday Night', right.  He played Little--.
Speaker 1: He played Little Seymour.
Speaker 2: Little Seymour, that's right.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and he beat up Bill Cosby (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's a wonderful scene.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, wasn't that a scene.  This little guy, doing this karate (laughter), yes.
Story_ID: 11416
Speaker 1: In 1981, you and your brother were honored by the Academy, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, the, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, yeah.  That's right in 1981, and that was the time that Ronald Reagan was president.  And, and I remember we, we were there at the theater to rehearse what we're going to do on the show, and we heard that someone tried to shoot Ronald Reagan.  And, but paying respects to him, we, we cancelled the show one day.  And then the next day, we did the show.  And did you see it?
Speaker 1: I believe so, yeah.
Speaker 2: You did see it, yeah.  And remember they were showing, I, let me see, I think Johnny Carson was the master of ceremonies.  And he would say, he was talking about dance.  And he said, "This is dance in the movies."  And he said, "Watch your screens."  So they showed a lot of dancers, Gene Kelly and Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, and Buddy, Buddy Ebsen, and many, many, many others.  And after they showed those, then they showed, started showing the Nicholas Brothers films, yes.  They showed those films, and they closed with the last one 'Stormy Weather', where we're coming down those stairs, coming down the stairs.  And when we make the slide down, the sliding and bow thing, right, and when we come up and do our arms like this, we finish the number, the screen goes up and there we are behind that screen in that same pose.  And the, and the audience went wild when they saw us.  Here we are in person.  And so we come down, and we started doing a little dance together.  And then I started to walk away, and my brother said, "Wait a minute, we haven't finished yet" (laughter).  And so he, he does a little tap dance by himself without music.  Yeah, and he turns and he does a flip and he comes up.  And then we go over, over to, to say who's gonna win the next award.  And it was, it was to be the best score in a movie of, of a movie score.  And 'Fame' won that time, the movie 'Fame'.  So we say, 'Fame', and then the, the one who, who, who wrote the music for it came out, and we presented him with his Oscar for having the best musical score, you know.  And that's what we did on the, the film for the Academy Awards for the Oscars, that's, that's what we did in 1981.
Story_ID: 11417
Speaker 1: Now, sir, your performances are often greeted with the kind of excitement is usually now reserved for athletes, you know--.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and when Michael Jordan dunks a basketball or you see somebody do something like, you know, fly through the air on a football field sometimes, and people go ooh and ahh.  Yeah, they would ooh and ahh'ed your performance--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, 'cause, and we did it with music.  There was a beat (laughter).  That, that's it, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And the same as you referred before that they had to rewind the actual footage and show it again in the theater--.
Speaker 2: Rewind the film and show it over again, but they, they would go wild in the theaters.  Yes, because we were really entertaining them, even though we wasn't really there.  It was our figure out there on stage, and they'd just go wild, and they'd want to see it over again.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the nature of your dancing is so physical, I mean did it come--do you remember thinking about slowing down, you know, I mean--when did you first--I know you at some point said, well, I can't keep dancing like this.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I had to start--to stop in, really stop in 1975 because I had arthritis.  And I remember I was on stage with my brother [Harold Nicholas], and I was still trying to do those splits.  And brother said, "Don't you do them, just let me do them," because he saw I was having trouble.  He says, "When, when I go down in the split, you go down with me and then bring me up with your hands."  I said, "Okay, that's fine."  And the act went over just as good without me doing those because I was, I was there with my brother, and, and feeding him with, with my hands and, and just doing the things I would do without the splits.  And it went over good.  It went over real good.  But I, I had to stop it because of the, this arthritis that I was having.  And I found out it was in my hips, that went down into my legs.  See, 'cause I thought it was just in my legs.  But I had a x-ray, and they found out it was in my hips.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I, later on I had the operation for both hips.

Speaker 1: If there's anything big that I'm forgetting, let me know cause I don't want to--.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a star on Hollywood Boulevard [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Hollywood Boulevard.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a [John F.] Kennedy Center [for the Performing Arts] Honors.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, well, let's talk--.
Speaker 1: Remember that?
Speaker 2: --let's about those.  Now, you received quite a few honors in your lifetime.  What do you think the biggest one was?
Speaker 1: Well, I think the Kennedy Center Honors.  That, that was really thrilling.  It was in 1991 when we received this award. And that was when President [George H. W.] Bush, the father, President Bush was in office then.  And I can remember they were showing the, the film clips of the Nicholas Brothers.  And this was the--when Gregory Hines was there.  And he, he talked about us.  And there were many dancers there, Savion Glover who danced with the Nicholas Brothers.  This, I loved this Kennedy Center Honors 'cause we didn't have to do anything, didn't--they just sent the award and just get a lot of praise (laughter).  So, so I'm up in the, that box there with the President and, and the First Lady, Barbara Bush, and after the films finished, I turned to, to hug my brother [Harold Nicholas], and then I went over to shake the hands of Mrs. Bush 'cause she was sitting right there next, next to me.  And she kissed me (makes kissing noise).  I don't know if you saw that or not (laughter).  And then I shook hands with the president.  And so that was, was a great thrill that night.  Oh, boy.
Speaker 2: And it was in the '90's [1990s] when you finally got a, your--a star on the Walk of Fame, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in 1994.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that wasn't that long ago.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't--that wasn't too long ago.
Speaker 2: Ten years ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so all of these things came in the, in the '90s [1990s], which we should have received earlier.
Story_ID: 11419
Speaker 1: Something practical that you did in the '90s [1990s] that I've read about, and tell me once again, if this is true or not, but you assisted Janet Jackson with the 'Rhythm Nation [1814]' album, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we did, we did a video with her in, let's see, what year was that?
Speaker 1: I think it was'90 [1990], I think.
Speaker 2: '90-something.  Yes, and it was, it, it was good to--and she always wanted to do something with us.  And it was on the Universal [Studios] lot that we did this thing with, with her.  And it was only a few minutes that we did it, and she was just there looking at us as we were doing it.  And, and it turned out good.  I don't know if you saw it or not, but--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--it's a video, yeah, on the video.
Speaker 2: On the video, yeah.  It was nice--it was neat.
Speaker 1: And you, now, you have some kind of relationship with Michael Jackson too, right--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we, we--.
Speaker 1: --who is also known as a great dancer.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes.  And he has all our films.  (Laughter) I think he's been studying them.  And we, we did a show with, with him, when he was with his brother, when the, The Jackson 5, we did, did a TV show with them.  But I never saw the show.  I don't know what happened.  And they always promised me that they were gonna make me a copy of it, but I haven't received it yet.  I guess I have to keep bugging him till he does send it.  But we had fun because the--we taught them a routine of ours, the, the five of 'em, to, to do with us.  And, and it turned out good, yes, had a lot of fun doing that.  And so, cause Michael, he, he's crazy about the Nicholas Brothers.  As I said, he had all our films, and so maybe he was, he was doing a little something like we do.

Speaker 1: What do you think about some of the popular dancers, like, well, you have Michael Jackson, James Brown was--I'm sure he didn't do your style of dancing, but he, he was an exciting dancer to watch when he was popular, you know, well, he still is.
Speaker 2: And he's still popular.
Speaker 1: But he can't like he used to, but he's--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, nobody does (laughter).  Yes, I--.
Speaker 1: MC Hammer, even was a--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, they, they're doing their thing, yes.  And what's the other guy's name, Prince, Prince, uh-uh, they're doing it.  And they're entertainers.  That's, that's it.  When you entertain, that's, that's the way to go.
Speaker 1: Now, were the Temptations influenced by some of your style?
Speaker 2: Well, some of them, yeah.  You, you see some of these singers who put a little dance into, to their act and do a little Nicholas Brothers, try to do.  And, and I like them, I like them, yeah, yes.

Speaker 1: Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, I, I hope that they will, as far as show business is concerned, is to keep on reaching their goal.  And there may be hard times where there'll be some ups, where there'll be some ups and downs, but don't let that discourage you.  If you want to reach this goal, go for it because that's what you want to do.  And, because my brother [Harold Nicholas] and I, we reached that goal, and we--and so want everybody.  It, it doesn't have to--necessarily have to be show business.  It can be any other business, to get that goal that you want to do.  And don't be discouraged, and I think you will be happy.
Story_ID: 11422
Speaker 1: What would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, well, I think all the things that we, we [the Nicholas Brothers] have done in show business, we have, we have it with class, style, personality, and this is what I want people to remember us by because we, we did things to, to be remembered this way, and we, we never did do drugs or anything like that.  We want to be remembered that we respected ourselves and respected everybody.  And we want you to remember that, okay.

Speaker 1: How do you manage to stay so young?  You're eighty-nine years old now.  You'll be ninety soon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll be ninety in October, October the 20th.  I think it's because I think young.  And I have a young wife, who keeps me young (laughter).  Her name is Katherine [Hopkins Nicholas].  And we, we both love each other.  And I think that's what, what it is that's keeping me young now because, because she's so dear to me, and I, I love her.  And I want everybody to know, know that.  And we both think young.
Speaker 1: How did you meet, maybe I should ask you that?
Speaker 2: Oh, we, it--we met in 1973, yeah, we met in '73 [1973].  We were doing some shows together, and she--at that time she was, was with a team called the Wheel Brothers (ph.), three, three guys who played violins and they did comedy, and they would sing and dance.  So she became a part of, of that act.  And so I would do some shows with them.  And so we, we always stayed in touch with each other and never dreamed that we were gonna get married.  And, but at the time we were married to different people.  She had--she was married to a fellow who was, and who was a dancer, and I was married to a young lady.  Her name was Barbara [January].  And we just kept in touch with each other.  And my, my wife, Barbara, she passed away [in 1998].  And I had a stroke, and she, Katherine, saw the trouble I was having.  And so she would stay with me and would come with me and cheer me up and everything.  And we never thought that we would fall in love and get married, but who knows what's gonna happen, and it did (laughter).  And, and I'm so happy because, 'cause we have something in common, and, and it's beautiful.
